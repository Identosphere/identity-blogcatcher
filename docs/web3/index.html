<p>If you are acquainted with the everyday actuality of the crypto space, you surely have heard of staking. You likely also hold some staking misconceptions that need to change ASAP.<br></p><p>Besides being one out of several ways to earn passive income in crypto, staking is a vital piece of the blockchain puzzle. It keeps blockchain networks secure, allows the average user to participate in governing crypto ecosystems, and (as we’ll see below) much more.</p> What is staking in crypto? <p>The average observer who comes across the term 'staking' may assume it is a concept related to gambling. Indeed, the word 'stake' is used in betting circles to describe monies or properties placed on a bet. When you stake a certain amount on an outcome, you stand to earn rewards in multiples of the amount staked if your bet wins. If you remove the stake, on the other hand, the bet is canceled, and you will not earn any returns even if the bet wins.<br></p><p>Staking is a tad different in the crypto space. The term staking first emerged from the concept of the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">proof-of-stake</a> consensus mechanism. However, it is worth noting that the term staking is increasingly used in a flexible, somewhat confusing way. This article will focus on clearing out staking misconceptions, confusion, and different meanings associated with the term staking.<br></p><p>Let's start with understanding the concept of proof-of-stake, where it all originated.<br></p> The origins –staking in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks<br> <p>Proof-of-stake is one out of several consensus mechanisms through which the participants of a distributed ledger can achieve the consensus needed to secure a common state of the network. A proof-of-stake blockchain network has several kinds of participants, such as users, delegators, validators, developers, etc. Staking involves validators and delegators.<br></p><p>To become <a href="https://phemex.com/academy/blockchain-validator-process'">validators</a> (and receive rewards for it) in a proof-of-stake network, users are required to lock up the network’s native asset in a smart contract. This process is called staking. Besides locking up their assets, validators are also required to store a copy of the network’s ledger and keep it updated as per network rules. <br></p><p>Additionally, there are often a number of assets required to be locked to participate as a staker. For example, in the upcoming Ethereum proof-of-stake network Beacon chain, users are required to lock at least 32 ETH to become validators.<br></p>Diagram showcasing the rewards associated with the staking process (<a href="https://cryptolad.co/how-to-stake-crypto/">Source</a>).<p>Validators are rewarded with tokens issued by the protocol’s inflationary mechanism. Similarly, validators can be penalized for not following the rules of the network. Thus, the process of staking incentivizes the validators to act honestly and follow the network’s protocols.<br></p><p>To directly participate in staking, a user needs to hold coins in a <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/custodial-non-custodial-bitcoin-wallets/">non-custodial wallet</a> and enter them into the staking contract, sometimes for a fixed period. <br></p><p>Users can also participate in staking indirectly through centralized exchanges (we’ll dive into this in a bit), which pool together funds from different users. It’s worth noting here that staking on centralized exchanges is done in a custodial manner. This means that the centralized exchanges act as a third-party responsible for the safety of tokens. Centralized staking can be both convenient (since it reduces the minimum entry level for users) and inconvenient (since users need to pay a commission and transfer ownership of their tokens), depending on each person’s preferences.<br></p><p>However, even in PoS staking, there’s a common misconception that all networks follow the same structure.<br></p> Staking misconception #1: not all PoS staking is equal<br> <p>So far, we’ve covered PoS staking focusing on Ethereum as an example. However, this is far from being the only model.<br></p><p>Some protocols also offer soft staking, where users do not need to lock their coins to earn rewards (e.g., <a href="https://www.algorand.com/">Algorand</a>). The protocol distributes rewards to active stakers according to an estimated annual percentage yield/rate. Algorand users are paid staking rewards for each new block by simply holding ALGO tokens in their wallets.<br></p><p>Some blockchain networks that use a PoS consensus mechanism also allow validators to participate in governance decisions that drive progress in the ecosystem. Crypto staking has evolved from a method of securely recording transactions to also facilitating governance and other features.<br></p><p>We should also note that to participate in staking to secure a network, users don’t necessarily need to actively participate in block validation. They in turn delegate their stake to validators in a non-custodial manner to earn staking rewards without active participation. This is called delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS).<br></p> Governance staking<br> <p>Governance staking requires users to “invest” in a protocol –a blockchain network, a DeFi protocol, etc– by means of purchasing its governance token. Users can then earn rewards for staking their coins, which also entitles them to governance votes, often directly proportional to the number of tokens staked. <br></p>Diagram showing blockchain governance process (<a href="https://www.mphasis.com/home/thought-leadership/blog/crypto-governance-adopting-a-decentralized-approach-to-governance.html">Source</a>).<p>Governance staking offers users a chance to participate in the governing of the projects they believe in, taking an active role in decision-making. By participating in governance, average users can shape the future of their favorite <a href="http://pantherprotocol.io">crypto projects</a> and still earn rewards for staking. Governance staking can happen in PoS and dPoS networks, protocols hosted on top of them, and even in centralized protocols. As you’ll see, this is key to understanding the many shapes the word “staking” can take.<br></p> Other common staking misconceptions <p>One of the main misconceptions of staking is, as we’ve mentioned, thinking that all staking is exactly the same. <br></p><p>You may have encountered mechanisms inspired by proof-of-stake staking in <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">DeFi protocols</a>. Concepts like liquidity staking (staking to earn rewards for providing liquidity) and yield farming (staking one asset, sometimes interest-bearing assets, to earn rewards in another) draw inspiration from PoS staking and have become mainstream in the crypto space, with <a href="https://defillama.com/">billions of dollars</a> committed to protocols globally. <br></p><p>Although many might know exactly what each protocol refers to when mentioning staking, there are still a few misconceptions about the concept and what it entails.<br></p> Staking misconception #2: same name, different uses<br> <p>As we saw above, even in PoS chains, not all staking opportunities are created equally.<br></p><p>Even though the term staking originated from the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the term staking has various meanings nowadays. For example, you could stake MATIC to earn rewards on Binance (a centralized exchange), stake ETH to become a validator on the Ethereum network, or even stake Curve tokens to participate in their protocol’s governance. Therefore, it’s important to clear up what each of these different projects actually mean.<br></p><p>On a broader level, the main difference between the many types of staking lies in the nature of each protocol. Blockchain networks incentivize users to stake to secure the network and validate transactions, issuing rewards to those helping validate news blocks. On the other hand, DeFi protocols do not need to validate blocks but strive for liquidity and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl">total-value-locked</a> (TVL), so they encourage and incentivize liquidity staking. Centralized exchanges care about making a profit, and they can do so through fees, commissions, or finding creative ways to leverage the assets you deposit in them. <br></p>Risks of liquidity and lending staking vs. protocol staking. (<a href="https://www.figment.io/resources/misconceptions-about-staking-protocol-staking-vs-liquidity-lending">Source</a>)<p>All of the different mechanisms above utilize the same name and issue rewards, but they have different structures and ultimate goals. Therefore, you can define staking as a system in which a protocol issue rewards to users in exchange for them putting their holdings of selected tokens in stake. As we have mentioned this could be for any of the different purposes each protocol may have.</p> Staking misconception #3: losing and making money<br> <p>Another common misconception is that you can’t lose money through staking. Users tend to equate a staking program with the idea that, even if their assets depreciate, staking rewards will ultimately cover any reduction in the initial value of the coins staked. Not only is this belief misleading, but it is also financially irresponsible. You can earn valuable passive income, but also lose money in crypto staking.<br></p><p>This is true even when it comes to dPoS or PoS staking. If a validator fails to maintain network security or behaves dishonestly, they may lose a percentage of their stake through slashing. Also, crypto prices experience high volatility, and most proof-of-stake protocols do not allow immediate unstaking. To name a famous example, users who staked <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-valuable-lessons-from-terras-collapse-opinion/">LUNA</a> before the coin's price fell dramatically lost billions of dollars and could not unstake in time to not sell at a loss.<br></p> Is staking crypto safe? Benefits and risks <p>Just like all endeavors in the crypto space, staking has its upsides and potential downsides. Some of them are: <br></p> Benefits of staking   Governance: From voting on Treasury distributions to new hires, token holders can have a say in determining the project's direction and help shape its future. This, in theory, should inform protocols to make better product decisions and serve its community better over the long term.<br>  Rewards: Users can earn rewards proportional to the value of the staked coins. Projects incentivize staking as if to say 'thank you for continuing to be a part of this project and believing in us.' Some staking programs also give users access to tokens they can then use to unlock their staked principal or even deploy to the DeFi ecosystem.   Staking risks   Crypto prices are highly volatile. Therefore, in staking, users need to worry about potential downward price swings that may result in significant losses, outweighing any earned rewards.<br>  Staking and unstaking periods, which can cause liquidity problems for some users.<br>  In the case of centralized staking, not holding control over one’s coins.<br>  In the case of delegated proof-of-stake systems, users risk losing their tokens to slashing if their designated validator misbehaves.<br>  Just like in every crypto project, users run a risk of their designated project (centralized or decentralized) being hacked, exploited, or disappearing. <br>   Is staking crypto taxable? Let’s look at the precedents <p>Crypto staking generates passive income for users. Yet, the authorities have not finished deciding on whether staking rewards are taxable or how they should be taxed. Firstly, regulations differ from country to country. In the United States, the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/25/why-we-still-need-guidance-on-staking-rewards-taxation/">Internal Revenue Service</a> does not have a definite position on the tax regulations specific to staking rewards. However, the regulator has a clear stance on earnings that should be classified under an individual's gross income.<br></p><p>According to the Internal Revenue Code, paying for services and interests is part of an individual's gross income. Now, the IRS views staking rewards as compensation for validating a network or interests received for participation. Either way, staking rewards are classified as gross income and are therefore, taxable. <br></p><p>In the famous <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2022/03/07/crypto-couples-victory-against-the-irs-comes-at-the-cost-of-regulatory-clarity/?sh=2fcb7ac748f9">Jarretts case</a>, the IRS refunded taxes collected from Tezos staking rewards. The Jarretts' lawyers argued that staking rewards were neither compensation for validating networks nor interests earned. Instead, they claimed that staking rewards were newly created assets. This, they argued, made the tokens alike an artist's painting, which is also taxable when sold, not upon receipt.<br></p><p>However, while several crypto accounts on social media used the Jarretts' case as a reference to prove that staking rewards should not be taxed, certain factors may render the judgment meaningless in the long run. <br></p><p>Firstly, a District Court heard the case, not a Tax Court. Also, since the Jarretts did not accept the refund, the case will go on trial in 2023. The IRS will push for clearer legislation, which may set a federal precedent that could render the Jarretts' argument null and void.<br></p><p>The discussion around tax laws on staking rewards will continue. The IRS, on one side, believes that staking rewards count as gross income upon creation. Crypto stakeholders (conveniently) argue that these new <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-bull-case-for-zkp-from-token-agnostic-privacy-to-full-user-empowerment-in-web-3-2af9c6b0010b/">tokens</a> are created, not earned as interest or compensation, which makes them only taxable when sold.</p> What else is staking good for? <p>As we described throughout the article, there are many other things that can be done by staking. Since staking is basically locking up your tokens in exchange for rewards (whether they come in the form of tokens, governance participation, or something else) this showcases your commitment and investment in a project.<br></p><p>The novelty of staking as a concept and of the crypto ecosystem as a whole makes it likely that we will continue to discover new functionalities of staking. The possibilities are, in a sense, infinite. For example, Panther aims to release a staking system through which users can mint private versions of their assets in MASPs (Multi-Asset Shielded Pools), allowing users to break the on-chain link and transact privately. &nbsp;If you’d like to learn more about this system and participate in Wave 3 of Incentivized Advanced Staking, you can do so by reading this <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">blog post</a>.</p> In summary: staking misconceptions won’t go away, but now you know better. <p>As networks like Ethereum transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, it’s unlikely that staking will ever go away. Staking in crypto has its fair share of benefits and risks, yet, it is a reliable passive income generator for users with long-term goals and helps drive active participation in the crypto space. It also helps projects incentivize users to hold on to their tokens as opposed to selling them, which in turn encourages healthier market dynamics.<br></p><p>When it comes to staking misconceptions, it is unlikely that they will fully go away –after all, the diversity of staking solutions will likely continue to increase. However, we hope this article served its purpose: informing you of a powerful general-purpose tool, its background, and how to interact and benefit from it.<br></p><p>If you’re interested in more articles like this, please sign up to receive the Panther newsletter!

         The Listeners                <p>ByLacy Warner</p><p>Photography:MARK DAVIS</p><p>PublishedJuly 14, 2022</p>            <p>For Deepika Bodapati and Tanay Tandon of Athelas, paying attention is a superpower.</p>       



 
 
   
<p>Four years ago, Deepika Bodapati was up late, staring at her computer and doing something rather unusual for a founder of a startup soon to achieve unicorn status: she was reading all the support tickets that came through her company, Athelas’, website. “Once in a while, we’ll have our employees’ parents write in,” Bodapati says with a laugh. “But I read every single thing because I just thought it was super interesting.” As Bodapati waded through the queries and suggestions, studying how her sales team handled issues, she noticed one woman, Dr. Deanna Kelley, writing in again and again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She was very persistent,” Bodapati recalls. Dr. Kelley, Chief and Director of the Treatment Research Program at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, was asking to study the Athelas One device, claiming she could help Bodapati further develop and test the machine. Bodapati knew that she and her co-founder, Tanay Tandon, were looking at an arduous application process for their second FDA clearance and would need all the support they could get. So Bodapati did what she was best at: she picked up the phone and listened to what Dr. Kelly had to say. This approach has come to define her ability to build both a better product and a better business.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Listening has always been central to Bodapati’s creative process. Listening closely to both the data and her intuition led to the Athelas One, which is the only FDA-approved, internet-connected finger-prick device that tests white blood cell and neutrophil counts at home and then shares that information directly with healthcare providers. The Athelas One is a small black cylinder, similar in appearance to an Alexa device. In a traditional lab, pathologists take a drop of blood, put it on a slide, smear and stain it and place it under a microscope to determine cell counts. Athelas One uses computer vision and machine learning to automate the process, and then sends the information to a healthcare team. Athelas is a leader in producing portable devices for remote patient monitoring (RPM), a growing sector of the global healthcare market that may be worth more than $175.2 billion by 2027. The need for such an industry was revealed during the pandemic, but RPM can benefit anyone from patients with chronic diseases who need to consistently track their medical data, to elderly or disabled individuals for whom a trip to the doctor’s office can be cumbersome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As lifelong scientists, the founders knew Athelas One needed data proving, beyond doubt, that it worked consistently and accurately; as entrepreneurs, they knew a trial, as soon as possible, would be essential for the company’s development. When the duo participated in Y Combinator, they found themselves among a handful of potential competitors—but none of them had run a clinical trial yet. Bodapati and Tandon knew this could make them stand out to potential customers, partners and collaborators. “There was no option,” Bodapati says. “There would be no company if there was no trial.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Setting up a clinical trial is complicated, and, through an acquaintance, Bodapati had a lead on a hospital in Juarez, Mexico, a city of 1.5 million across the border from El Paso, Texas. In 2016, Bodapati and Tandon conducted their first clinical trial for Athelas One.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati says that the hospital instantly saw the value in the Athelas One device for their patients. “We were able to set up a table, where, on one side we had our device, and on the other side was the nurse who was drawing blood to compare with the Athelas One samples (to make sure they were accurate). And then we told them, ‘Free blood testing for anyone for the next three days.’” Bodapati sat at a table in the hallway with the Athelas One and its finger-pricking lancets and glass test strips, and Tandon sat in another room reviewing the results on a computer monitor. The response was overwhelming. Patients came from all over, alone at first, and then the next day with their families. One patient, at the hospital for a routine appointment with their doctor, had blood drawn at the Athelas table on a whim—a whim that would be life altering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Tandon saw this patient’s blood cell images on his laptop, he knew instantly that something was wrong. Over several days, he’d been reviewing hundreds of blood test results, all displaying the normal range of white blood cells, between 6,000 and 8,000, but this patient had a count of well over 40,000. Tandon immediately got up to show Bodapati the results. The two also saw that the cells were immature, which indicated mass proliferation of leukocytes, a type of white blood cell. Tandon and Bodapati knew what this meant: the patient had leukemia. But because Athelas One had yet to receive FDA approval as a diagnostic tool, they couldn’t speak directly to the patient. They were, however, able to alert the hospital staff that the patient needed to be tested for cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati remembers flying back to California days later and sitting quietly next to Tandon, both of them struck by the force of what had happened. She felt the weight of the results, presented in such a personal way to someone they’d seen face-to-face. Though the two were mainly silent on the flight, Bodapati was listening to something—an inner voice describing not only the future of her company, but possibilities for the good she could do, the change she could drive in the healthcare industry more broadly. “Imagine if you could do that all the time with really cheap tools?” Bodapati asks. “You go in, you sign your name, you prick your finger. You get told right there. You don’t have to go to your appointment, then go to a different place and get your lab drawn.” It took another three weeks for the hospital to confirm the patient’s leukemia diagnosis that Bodapati and Tandon saw in minutes. Tandon was haunted by the fact that the patient had come in for a regular doctor’s appointment, “But because healthcare today is not quantitative, it’s traditional, you come in, you get some symptomatic analysis and they’ll tell you to go home and rest.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s when it clicked,” Bodapati recalls, referencing that solemn flight. “It’s this concept of making tools so cheap, so usable, that people can do it all the time. Only then can you actually get preventive care.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia Capital who collaborates closely with Athelas, happened to already be questioning the landscape of available medical testing technology when he met the co-founders while they were participating in the Y Combinator startup accelerator. Lin’s father was undergoing chemotherapy, and Lin was frustrated that the most reliable method of testing whether his father had an infection was to take his temperature. If a chemotherapy patient has a fever that spikes above 101.3, they’re told to go to the emergency room. But to Lin, the thermometer felt like an inadequate diagnostic tool, based on what always happened next. “I just found that so silly. What if it’s 101.2 and it’s not .3?” Lin asks. “The first thing that happened every time I took my father to the emergency room was they take his temperature, his blood pressure and look at his vitals. And then the next immediate thing they did was to take a full blood count.” Lin, like Bodapati and Tandon, felt there had to be a faster, more accurate way of putting the needs of the patient first: “Tanay and Deepika were on a mission to figure out a more comprehensive test than a thermometer,” Lin says</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Sometimes the signals Bodapati is listening for come from places like support tickets; other times they’re literally knocking on the door. The company wouldn’t be where it is today had Bodapati and Tandon not been pursued by their first test user, a Stanford University student and basketball player named Michael Morris. “Michael was an inventor at heart,” Tandon tells me, “A lot of the ideas around how we could make the device user-friendly came from him.” Morris was also a cancer patient who needed constant monitoring of his white blood cell count. When he heard about how two of his college classmates were experimenting with a machine that might help him, he showed up at their office in Mountain View—a barely refurbished liquor store—ready to be their guinea pig. Tanay and Bodapati had been building since their high school science fair days, and—with Tanay’s background in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and Bodapati’s time spent internering at her uncle Dr. Sanjiv Gambhir’s molecular imaging research lab at Stanford—the two friends were able to make a prototype for an in-home blood testing kit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[Morris] brought this energy with him that would just take over the office,” Tandon says. “And it was so helpful for the early team of 4 or 5 people to see an actual patient talk about how important this was, and how much you wanted to track these critical metrics.” Using Athelas One consistently over the next couple of months, Morris noticed a disturbing trend in his cell count. His cancer therapy wasn’t working anymore. “He asked us to go to a doctor’s appointment with him,” Bodapati reveals. “It felt so personal because he was showing the doctor his results, and telling him that the cancer was back.” In that office, supporting her friend—a sick man holding tightly to his wife’s hand—Bodapati saw again how valuable Athelas could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after this moment, the FDA sent Bodapati and Tandon an additional information request for Athelas One, a kind of auditing the agency does to further analyze efficacy. The Jaurez trial proved to Bodapati and Tandon that Athelas One worked, and that they were right to believe in their new business. But the FDA wanted more, including other trials. Though it’s fairly standard to receive such a request, the 40-plus line questionnaire was daunting, demanding another 8 months of data collection and an additional trial, which still wouldn’t guarantee FDA approval. Yet Bodapati says Morris’ belief in the device kept them going, with the paperwork and the eventual second trial that led to their FDA approval. His constant presence energized the staff, and his input on how to better Athelas One for its users was crucial, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, Michael Morris passed away. “Michael really believed in it,” Bodapati says, naming him as one of their first true advocates; a guiding light urging them forward. “He told us, ‘It’s too late for me, but make sure you bring it to other people.’”</p>



<p>Bodapati has been hearing those words ever since.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flights have been their own recurring theme during Bodapati and Tandon’s long friendship. They first bonded on a flight as teenagers when competing on the elite science fair circuit, an extracurricular they participated in with such intensity that they joke about it being a competitive sport. (As a preteen Bodapati even invented a test strip that could detect whether vegetables were contaminated with salmonella and E. coli. It was her first foray into microfluidics, working with and studying how fluids move in miniature devices and the spaces within them, which later came to play a large part in the development of Athelas One.) The experience of going from competitors to friends and collaborators eventually brought Bodapati and Tandon together as co-founders. “I know his strengths. He knows my strengths. We knew one another when we were competing, so it was the rawest form of each other,” Bodapati says. Lin even recalls the two of them finishing each other’s sentences, describing Tandon as verbose while Bodapati is a grounding presence. If Bodapati is the listener, then Tandon is the talker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati has been honing her listening skills since childhood—both in her family home and in her uncle’s Stanford research lab. Her parents were small tech business owners with companies in the United States and India, and because of the time difference, they were often on the phone with their teams abroad while dropping Bodapati off at school. Sitting in the backseat, Bodapati could hear the chatter of business deals considered, strategies debated, negotiations made. Bodapati’s brother, Sunil, also remembers, “After dinner, we would hear them get on the phone to kick off early meetings with the India team, and we were able to listen to how they approached deals, how they structured them. We were there when deals went through, there when deals fell through, there when employees quit. So we got to see what it was like to go through the highs of the lows [of running a business] in a very visceral way.”</p>



<p>Bodapati tells me that sometimes the training was more explicit, though; her father would encourage the family to have what he called “pitch night,” teaching the kids how to really sell their latest science experiment. “My dad would always tell us, ‘You can’t just explain the science; convey it in a way that is compelling—what’s the practical implication of the project?’” Sunil, who is the CEO of his own healthcare startup, Enable Medicine, says that while he and his sister learned business from their parents, it was their beloved uncle, Dr. Gambhir, who instilled in them a love of science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Gambhir, chair of radiology at Stanford and a pioneer in advancing techniques for molecular imaging and early detection of cancer, died of cancer in 2020 at 57. Bodapati tells me that she believes if her uncle were still alive he would be awarded for his work with a Nobel Prize. He wanted not just to innovate, she says, but also to truly improve the lives of those affected by cancer. Bodapati’s years spent working in her uncle’s lab and listening to his stories and advice, led her to want to revolutionize preventive care, to improve people’s lives holistically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, Dr. Gambhir’s work and research became deeply personal: his teenage son, Milan, was diagnosed with the aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme—the exact tumor type Dr. Gambhir had been studying. Tragically, Milan died two years later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati shares the story his uncle told the lab the first time he returned after Milan’s death and how she internalized it, becoming ever more motivated to create positive change, even from terrible loss. Dr. Gambhir gathered his staff at the office and told them a fable credited to several Native American tribes: a grandfather is teaching his grandson about life and reveals that every person has two warring wolves within them. One wolf represents resentment, petty jealousy and sorrow, while the other is hope, compassion and faith. The grandson asks his grandfather which wolf wins in the end; the grandfather responds, “Whichever one we feed.” With that, Dr. Gambhir turned to his colleagues, bowed his head and said, “Let’s remember that’s what we’re doing here.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Dr. Gambhir continued to research early cancer detection, he became a leader in developing tools that could passively monitor patient health by collecting data in minimally intrusive ways, like a smart toilet that tests stool and urine for early signs of disease. Gambhir dreamed of a proactive healthcare system, one preventive and holistic, rather than focused on fixing problems individually as they arise. Today, Bodapati is working to make this a reality. “Part of who I am now is because of the work that I did with him and his lab,” Bodapati says. Sunil underscores his sister’s feelings: “You know that if you can move the needle in a significant way for human progress, then you kind of have an obligation to do that.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>On the opposite side of the country, in the suburbs of Baltimore, Dr. Deanna Kelly, Director and Chief of the Treatment Research Program at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, was trying to develop or find a point-of-care device that would help her treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients gain access to the antipsychotic drug clozapine. One of clozapine’s side effects is neutropenia—too few white blood cells to fight off infection—and tracking a patient’s white blood cell count requires regular testing. When the FDA cleared clozapine for use, it did so with the mandate that patients get labs drawn every week for the first 6 months, then every two weeks for the next 6 months, then once a month for their course of treatment, which, for most patients, is a lifetime. This would be a difficult task for anyone, let alone someone suffering from paranoia and delusion.</p>



<p>For the last 20 years Dr. Kelly had been working with clozapine, and believed it would be life-changing for many people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. She believed that the drug could be the difference between a patient living in a closed facility or leading an independent life with a steady job and stable relationships. “Often doctors believe that though this drug would be life changing for their patient, it’s just too much of a liability to have them on it’” Bodapati says. “Or patients feel that even though they know the drug is good for them, they simply can’t manage all these steps.’”</p>



<p>Dr. Kelly says up to 30 percent, or more, of people diagnosed with schizophrenia are labeled “treatment resistant,” and it doesn’t take much for a patient to receive such a designation. “The guidelines tell us that [after] two failed trials of antipsychotics, someone should be considered treatment resistant,” Dr. Kelly says.</p>



<p>Dr. Kelly and her colleagues at University of Maryland College Park were experimenting with electrochemical detection for monitoring blood levels and neutrophil counts, but they weren’t getting far. “Once I heard about Athelas, I was like, I don’t know if this is too good to be true,” Dr. Kelly recalls. “Then I kept reaching out and kept thinking this is going to be a major advantage and a major breakthrough to revolutionize our care.” Fortunately for her, Bodapati listened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Kelley was thrilled when Athelas One received its second FDA clearance for at-home use. This allows the results to be instantaneously sent to a doctor and a pharmacist, who then ships the medication directly to the patient—meaning the patient has to do little more than prick their finger in the privacy of their own bedroom. Dr. Kelly says some of her patients are poor, lack transportation, or have cognitive impairments, things that make participating in a traditional healthcare system nearly impossible. “The way Athelas did it was clever: merging these results that you get back to the [risk evaluation management] system, coupled with the ability to order in a pharmacy. That’s a game changer.”</p>



<p>Bodapati and her team worked to get Athelas One in California state hospitals, specifically in forensic facilities and county medical facilities that treat a significant number of homeless patients with drug-resistant schizophrenia. By this time, HLS Therapeutics, one of the makers of clozapine, heard about Bodapati and Tandon’s work and offered the duo a rare opportunity to partner, broadening their reach into mental healthcare and beyond oncology in ways they never expected.</p>



<p>Cliff Weitzman is CEO of the text-to-speech audio reader Speechify, and has been part of a support network for a man he’s known since childhood who has struggled with mental health issues and hasn’t responded to most antipsychotics. Weitzman describes this experience as hopeless.“The first thing to know is that when this happens, this person that you’ve known all your life stops acting normal,” he says. “They might shout at you, scream at you, stop eating, stop drinking, stop being able to function. You lose all control, and that’s very scary. And there’s nothing you can do. And then you go to doctors, and there’s nothing that doctors can do either. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wietzman took time off work and flew all over America to speak with top psychiatrists. After that year, he discovered the potential of clozapine in a Facebook group. “The first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth doctor you talked to does not bring up clozapine,” Weitzman says. “We went on Facebook groups of patients who have similar problems, and the only success stories we heard often were from patients who use clozapine. And we’re like, well, what is clozapine?” Weitzman believes that clozapine wasn’t even considered by the patient’s medical team because it’s not only difficult for the user, but it’s also a burden for the doctor prescribing it. “It’s a lot of work because the doctor every week has to go to the portal, click the button, make sure that the regulation is there. Doctors don’t want to do that. That’s not why they went to medical school.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Athelas One had broken down the primary barrier to doctors prescribing clozapine. “Now it’s a realistic thing that we can use,” says Weitzman. He believes the company has the ability not only to help millions of people with previously untreatable diagnoses, but also to offer relief to their families and support networks, helping them to reconnect with their loved ones. “You’ve gone from a state of scary, helpless, hopeless, to empowered, assisted, supported, hopeful. So it gives hope. That’s a very special thing that very few companies can say they succeed in doing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>When the pandemic hit, Bodapati found herself listening again, this time for insight on how Athelas could transition from diagnostic to preventive care. “We realized we had an opportunity where the world is on pause, and we’ve collected all of these interesting lessons from getting this FDA clearance and then launching in some of these incredible health systems and clinics,” says Tandon. “We can continue to operate as a traditional biotech or we can synthesize this knowledge and turn it into something a lot bigger that can really serve the population that we touch and help them work through COVID, but also create this transition to preventive health.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati spotted an opportunity when she was on a sales call with a psychiatrist named Dr. Gustavo Alva from southern California. Bodapati asked him to tell her about his other patients, those who weren’t on clozapine—what were their needs? Dr. Alva said he had thousands of patients, a large percentage of whom were on medications with side effects like weight gain, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. When Bodapati asked how he was monitoring his patients’ long-term health, he replied that it was often left up to the primary care doctor. Bodapati didn’t hesitate. She asked Dr. Alva to connect her to some of his patients who would be open to chatting so she could discern if Athelas could help. On the calls, she heard that they often didn’t see a GP, just their specialist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on these calls, Bodapati and Tandon started building a suite of predictive, internet-connected tools that worked together to monitor a patient’s health. Shortly, she went back to Dr. Alva and asked him how valuable it would be if she could give specific patients glucometers, weight scales and blood pressure cuffs that all recorded the patient’s results at home and sent the results to a healthcare team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the call ended, the two had roughed out a path toward a collaboration that led to an order for more than 800 patients. The Athelas team got to work, reaching out to potential patients, getting them the devices and onboarding them. Then the Athelas team set the patients up with a nursing team. “Once we got them on the program and they were continuously testing, [Dr. Alva]&nbsp; told us how powerful it was to engage these chronically ill patients from their homes. It was something he had been attempting for decades,” Bodapati says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati and Tandon then developed an app that allows the patients to record their information and schedule appointments. “That’s how our product grew,” says Bodapati. “And overnight, our average deal size went from 10 patients to 600.” The co-founders have also created a pill tracker that works in tandem with the Athelas One for any patient for whom tracking their medication is a burden—a device that can help the provider as well as the patient to determine whether the medication is working or if it’s not being taken correctly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As soon as Bodapati attempted to bill for the remote patient monitoring Athelas was now offering, she started to wade through the insurance coding maze and realized how opaque the current medical billing system really is: “As a business, you need to know how much money you’re making, and as the CEO of the business, you need to have that information within 30 seconds. It was very clear that the doctors had no idea,” says Bodapati “You don’t really know where your money is coming from, how it’s segmented. It’s a black box.” Again, Bodapati saw a need and developed a solution; Athelas is now an innovator in remote patient monitoring and in revenue cycle management (RCM), helping private practices and provider groups bill appropriately and consistently. Now Bodapati says that RCM has become a core part of Athelas’ future, joining a $126.1 billion industry.</p>



<p>Lin sees a future of Athelas that goes beyond monitoring the sick to one connecting all people with preventive care. Now Bodapati is scaling up teams and connecting with as many hospital systems and provider groups as she can, having already partnered with Palomar Health System and Horizon Family Medical, which, she says, together represent approximately 100,000 patients. “What’s been most rewarding working with Deepika and Tanay, when they get close to their vision, they’re always very, very good at expanding it,” Lin says.&nbsp;Bodapati believes that improving the healthcare industry and making it more accessible is simply a matter of finding the people who need help and listening to them. What she doesn’t mention is the hard work, the designing, fabricating and testing that the listening leads to. This work has shepherded Athelas to become, in Bodapati’s words, the sensor and software infrastructure for running a modern healthcare business, with a unique value proposition of identifying “hard to discern” commonalities between stakeholders. Her insights are the key to this success. “We found that people are so much more willing to innovate, systems are willing to innovate, insurance companies are willing to innovate. Patients are willing to try new technologies,” Bodapati says. “We would talk to patients, asking them, ‘What can we do to make this the easiest possible experience for you?’ And they’ll tell you exactly what they need and what they want. Once you unlock that, it becomes really powerful. Because then you just keep building and building and building.”</p>

<p>TL;DR: Perpetuals futures are financial instruments that have become increasingly popular in the crypto space. Coinbase demonstrates a hypothetical simple delta neutral strategy which takes advantage of positively skewed funding rates in the perpetual futures market to achieve a high return on investment.</p><p>By The Coinbase Data Science Quantitative Research&nbsp;Team</p> Systematic Trading&nbsp;Strategy <p>A systematic trading strategy is a mechanical way of trading that is aimed at exploiting certain aspects of market inefficiencies to achieve investment goals. These strategies employ disciplined, rule-based trading that can be easily backtested with historical market data. Rule-based trading follows strict, predefined trading methodologies that are not impacted by market conditions.</p><p>Systematic trading is a fully grown area of investing that spans a wide range of strategies and asset classes. With the ever-growing crypto market, in which thousands of tokens are being traded and derivatives offerings are being expanded, systematic trading will play an important role in goal-based investing with efficient capital allocation and rigorous risk management. In this piece, we explore a delta neutral strategy to demonstrate the basic building blocks of systematic trading.</p> Spot market and derivative market&nbsp;terms: <p>Spot Trading: Buying or selling assets that results in its immediate transfer of ownership. For crypto spot trading, one can directly buy or sell crypto assets via centralized exchange, retail broker, or decentralized exchanges. (For example: <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/prime">Coinbase Prime,</a> Coinbase Exchange)</p><p>Derivatives Trading: Derivatives are financial contracts whose values are dependent on underlying assets. These contracts are set between two parties and can trade over a centralized/decentralized exchange or over-the-counter (OTC). A futures contract, one of the most popular derivatives, obligates parties to transact an underlying asset at a future date at a predetermined price. Derivatives, such as futures, are highly regulated financial instruments. For example in the United States, the CFTC regulated the derivatives market including commodity futures, options and swaps market as well as over-the-counter markets.</p><p>Delta and Delta Neutral: The delta measures the rate of change of the derivative contract’s price with respect to changes in the underlying asset’s price. For the underlying asset itself S, it is called delta one because the rate of change of S relative to itself is 1. Futures contracts that track closely the underlying asset, are approximately delta one. To achieve a delta neutral portfolio, one can take offsetting positions in spot and derivatives markets to construct a portfolio with an overall delta equal to zero. The zero/neutral delta portfolio is not subject to underlying price movements.</p> Perpetual futures <p>Perpetual futures have become a popular way to trade crypto assets. Unlike traditional futures that have expirations and associated delivery or settlement dates, perpetual futures don’t expire. These instruments are periodically cash settled with funding rate payment and there is no actual delivery of the underlying assets. Perpetual futures have to be either closed out to exit or held indefinitely.</p><p>Perpetual futures have their value closely pegged to the underlying assets they track with a funding payment mechanism built into the contract. It allows investors to easily take directional positions without worrying about physical delivery of the underlying assets. Perpetual futures have several advantages: it’s easy to take long or short positions, contracts can have high leverage, and there is no expiration to the contract — eliminating the need to roll&nbsp;futures.</p><p>We will use two scenarios to illustrate how the funding payment mechanism works:</p>  When perpetual futures are traded at a premium to spot prices, the funding rate is positive. Long futures traders will pay the short counterparty a funding amount proportional to the funding rate determined by the exchange.  When perpetual futures are traded at a discount to spot prices, the funding rate is negative. Short futures traders will pay the long counterparty.  <p>For illustrative purposes&nbsp;only.</p><p>As illustrated above, the larger the futures price diverges from the spot price, the bigger funding payment will be exchanged under a clamp threshold from exchanges. It’s an effective way to balance the supply and demand in the futures market and hence keep futures tightly anchored to underlying assets.</p> Systematic trading strategy with perpetual futures <p>Based on the above discussions, we explore a systematic delta neutral trading strategy that monetizes the rich funding rate in the perpetual futures market. A one-step setup of initial positions is required and no further rebalance is needed. We first take a long position on the underlying asset, at the same time take a short position on the perpetual future with the same notional. Given that the price of a perpetual future closely follows its underlying asset, the net position is delta neutral and has little exposure to the price movement of underlying assets. The strategy draws its performance from the funding rate payments since it is on the short side of the perpetual market.</p><p>Below is how it can be set up with BTC and BTC-PERP on 2x leverage:</p>  Deposit USD Y amount as collateral  Long BTC with notional&nbsp;2xY  Short BTC-PERP with notional&nbsp;2xY  Every 1 hour, the position either collects or pays the funding on 2xY BTC-PERP position.  <p>Here’s an example of a one period performance:</p><p>A trader opens a long position on Bitcoin. The open price was $9,910 USD and position size was 2 BTC. The trader at the same time opens a short position on BTC-PERP at $10,000 and with position size 2*9,910/10,000 =&nbsp;1.982.</p><p>If the price of Bitcoin then increases to 12,500 USD and BTC-PERP increases to 12,613, the unrealized profit from BTC position is 2*(12,500–9,910) = 5,180, and unrealized loss from BTC-PERP position is -1.982*(12,613–10,000) = -5,180. The profit and loss offset each other nicely. During the same period, if we assume a funding rate of 0.3%, we will collect a payment of 10,000 * 1.982 * 0.3% = 59.5. With periodic funding payments, the strategy accrues over&nbsp;time.</p><p>In our backtest, we deposit USD $1MM as our collateral and then enter into BTC long positions and BTC-PERP short positions with the same amount of notional. Given the strategy has minimum risk to the underlying price fluctuation, we can leverage up our positions by 10x and the leverage ratio stays stable through the period with negligible auto-deleverage/liquidation risk. With a holding period of approximately 1Y, the strategy performed with a return of&nbsp;~40%.</p><p>Data source: Coinbase and&nbsp;FTX</p><p>In order to confirm the achieved performance, backtests with different holding periods and different entry/exit dates were performed: 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. The table below shows median metrics related to these backtests:</p><p>Data source: Coinbase and&nbsp;FTX</p><p>From the simulations above, the longer the holding period, the higher the annualized return.</p><p>We just demonstrated a systematic trading strategy with spot BTC and perpetual futures. It is a basic strategy that only requires the initial setup of spot and derivative positions; no further active position management is needed before closing out. To make the strategy more robust, one can devise additional trading rules for risk management under market stress scenarios. It will also be interesting to explore ideas on running more dynamic trading rules that adjust leverage ratio to enhance&nbsp;return.</p> Funding rate <p>The core of the strategy is funding arbitrage between the perpetual futures market and fiat currency borrowing. Below we take a closer look at the funding rate distributions in the futures market. The rate is concentrated in the bucket around 2%, which can be thought of as a breakeven rate. But there is a long positive skewed tail which contributes to our strategy’s performance.</p><p>Data source:&nbsp;FTX</p><p>Below we also look at the autocorrelation function (ACF) of funding rate to understand how past observations are correlated to future occurrences. It is clear from the autocorrelogram below that the funding rate itself exhibits serial correlation up to about 20&nbsp;days.</p><p>Data source:&nbsp;FTX</p><p>It is also interesting to see how funding rate and spot prices are related. It is evident from the below chart that when spot prices quickly move up, so is the funding rate. And the reverse applies as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Data source: Coinbase and&nbsp;FTX</p><p>When spots are quickly ramping up, trend followers are chasing the market, possibly with leveraged positions in the futures market. The demand for funding in the futures market pushes up funding costs. When the market takes a downturn, there is less appetite for funding, so funding costs decrease and can even go negative.</p> Risk analysis <p>Execution risk for delta PnL offsetting. We demonstrated a delta neutral strategy for which PnL from spot leg and perpetual futures leg offset from each other is expected. Oftentimes, prices between spot and futures could diverge and cause non-trivial delta PnL. This can be mitigated by entering into/existing from the positions gradually in relatively small&nbsp;sizes.</p><p>Slippage cost, the effective price paid/received when Coinbase executes orders against an exchange or DEX. When the order size is big compared to order book depth, advanced trading algorithms are necessary to mitigate slippage&nbsp;cost.</p><p>Funding rate risk, funding rate is stochastic. It can fluctuate above/below zero. When the rate drifts below zero, the strategy underperforms. Historical markets showed a positively skewed funding rate distribution. However, there is no guarantee of its path in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Leverage risk, auto-deleveraging/liquidation. In order to have a sizable return, the strategy has to be levered up. Given the strategy is delta neutral, it’s safe to run 10x leverage under normal market conditions. However, in a stressed market when spot price and perpetual futures price diverge for a prolonged period of time, the strategy bears risk of auto-delverage or even liquidation, which could result in significant capital&nbsp;losses.</p> Future directions <p>We have demonstrated how to run a systematic trading strategy in the crypto market with a basic one-step setup. Systematic trading in crypto is an uncharted territory in which many of the existing strategies in traditional financial markets could be equally applicable. However, with innovations coming from different angles (e.g, decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, DeFi lending/borrowing) many new opportunities and possibilities arise as a result. We, as part of the Data Science Quantitative Research team, aim to develop and research in this space from a quantitative perspective that can be used to drive new Coinbase products.</p><p>You can track crypto spot and derivatives markets with <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/prime">Coinbase Prime</a> analytics, a set of institution-focused market data features that provide real-time and historical analytics for cryptocurrency spot and derivatives markets.

 <a href="https://tokenmint.global">TokenMint</a> is an easy-to-use platform for anyone to launch a token using custom tokenomics without having to know a single line of code. It streamlines and simplifies the tokenization process, making creating a fungible token easy and quick.&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that TokenMint is now live on mainnet!&nbsp; The Alpha version of the TokenMint platform offers the basics for creating a fungible token.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 About the TokenMint Platform 
<p>The TokenMint platform, comprising four key components, is designed to provide a seamless, simple, and intuitive user experience:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – a sidechain built on the Horizen network 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global">Token Generator</a> – a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics. 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt Wallet</a> – a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global">TokenMint Block explorer</a> – a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">TokenMint Testnet</a> remains active for anybody that wants to test and try out the platform. Over 550 tokens were created by users on the testnet, and the user feedback we received helped us improve the platform for the mainnet launch. These improvements include UX/UI features, bug fixes, and additional security measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tokenization will serve as one of the main driving forces behind the wave of innovation in blockchain and growth in the adoption of decentralized applications in coming years. A platform like TokenMint can play an important role in making tokenization accessible to mainstream users. </p>
<p>Notably, no programming knowledge is required for creating a token using TokenMint so users can get started right away. Our long-term goal for the platform is to achieve provable tokenomics while enhancing user privacy, a move that will further break down the barriers between tokenization and the masses.”</p>
<p>– Rob Viglione, co-founder of Horizen and Horizen Labs.&nbsp;<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We leverage agile methodologies to bring immediate value to our community through early and continuous delivery of our software. The TokenMint alpha release is just the beginning, as our product and engineering teams will continue to rapidly iterate on it with shorter delivery cycles that immediately address the evolving needs of Web3 and the crypto movement.&nbsp; We look forward to having TokenMint drive forth additional mainstream adoption.”</p>
<p>– Zain Cheng, VP of Engineering, Horizen Labs.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
 Token Creation Fees 
<p>Currently, it costs 10 ZEN to register a new fungible token on TokenMint and 1 ZEN to mint. We are running <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/HDE-Proposals/issues/67">a limited number of community tasks</a> on HDE that offer reimbursement on the token creation fees along with a small reward.&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/HDE-Proposals/issues/67">Create a token on TokenMint mainnet for free now.</a></p>
<p>Future versions of TokenMint will integrate a wider range of features like NFT support and marketplace, interoperability with our EVM sidechain, and zk-SNARKs, a privacy technology that will enable provable tokenomics and preserve user privacy.</p>

 Apply for grants to run the first Nym Privacy-Enhanced Apps! <p><a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/">Welcome to Shipyard</a>, the new Beta space for Nym! Shipyard is a place to build and stress-test Privacy Enhanced Applications (PEApps), which are service providers that use the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-simple-introduction-to-mixnets-6783a103d20e">Nym mixnet </a>to provide anonymity for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>In order to parameterize the Nym mixnet to offer strong anonymity, we need to get some apps running via the mixnet. Many existing apps like Telegram can be privacy-enhanced, a ‘PEApp’ — but we need to run two components called gateways and network requesters to make your regular apps work with Nym. <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">Gateways</a> are the first hop into the mixnet, and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">Network Requesters</a> are the hop out that takes the user to an app. Scroll down to learn about grants to set these&nbsp;up.</p> Nym Shipyard is&nbsp;for… <p>INFRASTRUCTURE WIZARDS who want to run gateways and network requesters to make the mixnet accessible for a broad set of existing applications and users. These are needed to make the mixnet broadly usable and Shipyard is giving Service Grants to set these up - <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/service-grants">Apply&nbsp;Now!</a></p><p>DEVELOPERS who want to build new PEApps in the Nym privacy stack and contribute to building out a vast ecosystem of usable tools where privacy is the default.

To learn about and try new releases <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/b49txYh9">Join Discord</a> #product-and-peapps</p> Grants for running the first gateways to&nbsp;privacy… <p>The first tranche of Shipyard grants is for gateways and network requesters — which combined allow wallets, apps and chats like Telegram to run on the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Together, gateways and network requesters provide the bridge into the mixnet and enable ordinary users to begin using the Nym mixnet. In order to slowly onboard users, Shipyard will be granting people running gateways and network requesters for apps and wallets that already work with Nym, like the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Nym wallet</a>, <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum wallet</a>, <a href="https://keybase.io/download">Keybase</a> and <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>.</p><p>To qualify for a grant you must commit to setting up a gateway and a network requester that whitelists these initial applications, configure your gateway to gather minimum stats and maintain it for a minimum of 6 months. Instructions will be provided of course! (<a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up here</a>). In the meantime, get familiar with <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">Nym docs</a>, <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways/">gateways</a> and <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester/">network requesters</a>.</p><p>The use of these applications via the Nym mixnet will be experimental at first and will gather stats on usage and traffic patterns directed towards a particular application so we can parametrize the mixnet to provide strong anonymity. (There is no other data gathered — this is a privacy system so we simply don’t have&nbsp;it!)</p><p>These first grants are essential for Nym to start being usable to a broader set of people, and for the Nym core team to stress test and optimise the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>NOTE in order to get payment you need to get the code up and running for your app of choice by the 1st of August payment deadline! To get full monthly payment per month you need to have 100% uptime and decent performance.</p><p>The Nym network has reserved a limited budget for apps, so funding will come to whoever sets up apps first if there is an overload of applications — so apply early and get that code&nbsp;running!</p>  <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/service-grants">Apply now!</a>  <p>…and be among the first to provide mass access to network level&nbsp;privacy.</p> For Developers — Upcoming Build&nbsp;Grants <p>Shipyard also invites more ambitious service provider grant applications for integrations with a broader set of wallets and applications. These could just be apps that already have SOCKS5 support. Apps that require re-compiling and coding can of course apply for more! For the highly skilled and ambitious among you, a fork of a popular app like Signal that runs on Nym could go way above&nbsp;$3000.</p><p>Service grants are just the beginning and part of a much larger grants program that will roll out over the next quarter. Stay tuned for announcements, including large grants aimed at research and larger projects that are looking for funding on top of Nym from the Nym Innovation Fund.</p> Relevant links:   <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net">Shipyard</a>  <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/service-grants">Service grants</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">What is a gateway?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways">Docs</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">What is a network requester?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester">Docs</a>  <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up</a> to the Shipyard grants email&nbsp;list  <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym Whitepaper</a>   Socials:   <a href="http://@nymproject">Twitter</a>  <a href="https://discord.gg/K2CQMAjX">Discord</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">Announcing Nym Shipyard</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>WabiSabi is a novel communication protocol for creating bitcoin coinjoin transactions with arbitrary amounts. It is a concept with roots going back to the early days of bitcoin, even the earliest beginnings of digital payments. Over the last two years, we have researched, designed and implemented this protocol. Now that we have finally released Wasabi Wallet 2.0, here is the history of this monumental advancement in bitcoin privacy.</p><p>Wasabi Wallet 1.0 solved a lot of difficult problems out of the box. Tor was natively integrated, protecting user IP addresses. Block filters were used to synchronize wallets without anyone else learning about the transaction history. The best available zerolink coinjoin protocol with Chaumian blind signatures provided privacy on the blockchain.</p><p>However, the Chaumian blind signature protocol had limitations that lead to a bad user experience and excessive blockspace usage. The minimum denomination was too large for many users, denying them access to the service. But for others it was too small, resulting in many coins in the wallet, which is expensive. If a user wanted to consolidate many inputs in the same coinjoin transaction, he had to tell the coordinator which belonged together. Even though the coordinator could not link the inputs of one user to the equal amount output he received, it was public knowledge which non-equal change output the user received.</p><p>Some of these concerns were improved with marginal upgrades to the protocol during the Wasabi 1.0 life cycle. However, in order to truly solve these issues, a fundamental solution was required. But at this point, we did not know what technology existed that could be applied at scale.</p><p>A group of developers, cryptographers and enthusiasts got together in the Wasabi Research Club, a weekly meeting to define, discuss and solve this complex problem. Initially, a different academic paper was chosen as the topic for each week. We invited the authors of each paper to join us, and many did, giving ample opportunity to ask questions. One of the researchers, usually Aviv Milner, started the call with a short presentation to introduce and summarize the paper. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPwc75tPMdsgTYlu9dJZlosCm0s7WmIpF">recordings</a> of these calls are available on the Wasabi Wallet YouTube channel.</p><p>A breakthrough moment was when Jonas Nick suggested that keyed verified anonymous credentials might be a great fit for our specific use case. There are numerous different cryptographic schemes in this category, like Brands’ credentials, Mercurial signatures, anonymous credentials light and keyed verified anonymous credentials. The specific paper Jonas brought to our attention was <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1416">The Signal Private Group System and Anonymous Credentials Supporting Efficient Verifiable Encryption, written by Melissa Chase, Trevor Perrin and Greg Zaverucha</a>.</p><p>This cryptography allows a central server to issue tokens which can have many attributes. Each of these attributes can be blindly committed to, then selectively revealed at a later point. These tokens can be transferred anonymously. The trick we use in WabiSabi specifically, is that one attribute of these credentials is a blinded value of sats. Pedersen commitments are used so that the coordinator never learns how many sats one token has attributed, but he can still ensure that nobody is creating more money than he spent.</p><p>These anonymous digital bearer certificates are the access rights to the new bitcoin transaction that is being built. The coordinator issues tokens and gives it to anyone who provides an input. And later, any anonymous user who provides such a token, can write an output address and amount to the transaction. These tokens ensure nobody is writing more outputs than inputs, without the users having to sacrifice their privacy to the central server.</p><p>At this point, we had a pretty solid idea of the problem and how flexible anonymous eCash tokens can be used to solve it. This was a sufficient advancement to document in a new paper, <a href="https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/releases/latest/download/WabiSabi.pdf">WabiSabi: Centrally Coordinated CoinJoins with Variable Amounts</a>, which was peer reviewed and published. This paper was finalized mainly by Adam Ficsor, Yuval Kogman, Lucas Ontivero and István András Seres.</p><p>A crucial next step was to implement the cryptography that makes the system possible. Lucas Ontivero, Yuval Kogman and David Molnar dedicated months to building, testing and reviewing this critical part of the codebase. An independent security firm was hired to audit the code base and several outside contributors have reviewed it as well. In the following months, Wasabi’s client and server code were upgraded and sometimes entirely rewritten to support this new protocol.</p><p>With the protocol designed, the cryptography implemented and the client and server code well on its way, we realized that some of the most difficult questions are still unanswered. Now that the coordinator no longer dictates the minimum value of inputs and what output values to register, what exactly should the client do now? With great power, comes great responsibility. For the first time in the history of bitcoin coinjoin, the client can basically do whatever it wants. This turned out to be rather uncharted territory, with conflicting ideas of how to approach the subject.</p><p>Anonymity likes company meaning that it’s a good idea to hide in a crowd. So a coinjoin transaction should have many coins with the exact same amount of sats. However, every transaction should have many different equal amounts. One of Yuval’s many insights was to use low Hamming weight standard denominations. Only a few of these amounts are required to sum up to any arbitrary value. Specifically, these standard denominations are powers of two, powers of three, and 1, 2, and 5 times the powers of ten. Between 5000 sats and 1 bitcoin, there are 41 of these standard denominations. If all clients prefer to create outputs in only those standard denominations, then there are going to be a higher number of equal amount inputs and outputs.</p><p>These developments are why Wabisabi has improved upon the original Zerolink protocol of Wasabi 1.0 and how Wasabi 2.0, powered by Wabisabi are breaking records everyday for facilitating some of the largest coinjoins ever while provided even the newest Bitcoin user access to the highest level of privacy.</p>

<p>Introducing the first Nym Service&nbsp;Provider</p><p>Nym is an open, decentralised privacy infrastructure. The infrastructure is run by people all over the world and is composed of different node types that each perform slightly different roles. In short, when using the infrastructure for privacy, your communications traffic would first be encrypted by a Nym client on your device and then sent on&nbsp;to:</p><blockquote><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">Gateway nodes</a> which are the first hop into the&nbsp;mixnet;</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/choose-your-character-an-overview-of-nym-network-actors-19e6a9808540">Mix nodes</a> that mix people’s traffic through three sets of nodes, making it untraceable;</blockquote><blockquote>And finally, Network Requesters are the hop out that takes the user from the exit gateway to an app — which they are now using in a privacy-enhanced mode!</blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/choose-your-character-an-overview-of-nym-network-actors-19e6a9808540">Previous blog posts</a> have covered Gateways, Mix nodes and Validators. This post is a deep dive into <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester">Network Requesters</a>, which is the first type of Nym Service Provider, connecting the core privacy infrastructure to user-facing applications.</p><p>Before delving into Network Requesters, let’s have a broader look at the role of Service Providers in general — of which Network Requesters are just one&nbsp;type…</p><p>NOTE: Nym will very shortly be issuing grants for starting up and running Network Requesters. If you want to be among the first to provide mass access to network level privacy, sign up <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">here</a> and stay&nbsp;tuned…</p> Service Providers <p>The design space for Service Providers (SPs) is very open: some will allow access to external services on the internet, shielding the user from the prying eyes of data scraping and machine-learning-enabled observers; other SPs will allow access to shielded services that can only be accessed via the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Developing SPs doesn’t involve rethinking how you design your app from the ground up (in terms of code anyway)! You can think of SPs just as ‘applications that can communicate with a local Nym client’. This means that you can spend more time exploring the growing ‘private-by-design’ application design space, and less about integration!</p><p>It’s likely that people running SPs will also run their own gateway for their app, to ensure reliability and uptime. That said, a small SP could easily rely on the public gateways available to them if they wanted&nbsp;to!</p> On the internet no-one needs to know you’re using the&nbsp;mixnet… <p>Now you might be wondering how SPs might protect people’s privacy! SPs enable people to use even not-so-private applications in a privacy-preserving way. They may facilitate anonymised requests to public web services outside of Nym network to applications such as Keybase or Telegram, Mail servers, or even blockchains.</p><p>SPs do this in the same way as a standard proxy service: it takes your message request from the mixnet, and passes it to the specific endpoint elsewhere. The clearnet recipient — such as a web server — doesn’t (and shouldn’t) even need to have any awareness of Nym! To them the SP is just another application sending them a web request. The metadata exposed by the request will only be that of the SP. As a result, the origin of the request — the Nym user — will be protected, and any observer monitoring the clearnet traffic will be none the wiser than if they were interacting with the server from their metadata.</p><p>SPs that do not communicate outside of the Nym network can offer similar services to the standard range of application or server solutions available on the internet, but privacy-enhanced, and existing solely within the Nym network. Something like secure untraceable data backups are an immediate example: think anonymous Dropbox or file hosting services.</p> Introducing the Nym Network Requester <p>We already have one SP in our <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/service-providers/network-requester">github repository</a> and the <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester/">docs for you to try running it</a>: the Network Requester (NR). The NR is a binary that can be run alongside a Nym client on a VPS, which allows for private network requests to be made outside the mixnet from your local Nym&nbsp;client.</p><p>Why would you be using this? When you are using your desktop app, it communicates to the application backend servers, or makes outbound web requests. The Network Requester sits on ‘other side’ of the mixnet making these requests for you thereby hiding your metadata!</p><p>For example: you can use the Nym SOCKS5 client to connect your local Telegram desktop app to the Telegram servers to collect and send messages. This means that the Telegram servers see a request from the Network Requester instead of your local computer. The Network Requester acts in a similar way to a proxy, routing requests for you and passing back the responses it gets from Telegram’s message&nbsp;servers.</p><p>How does it work? It’s a piece of code which checks an inbound request from its Nym client, checks the domain that is being requested and whether this domain is on a whitelist, and if so, forwards the request and then passes the response back to the requesting client (i.e.&nbsp;you).</p><p>From the user’s perspective, this all happens under the hood. All you have to do is point your local SOCKS5 client to a NR that supports the domain you wish to access, and then point your local app into the SOCKS5&nbsp;client!</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester">Explore how to run a Network Requester</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">Explore the Nym privacy&nbsp;platform</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/VmVaqPHA">Join Nym Discord</a> (Network Requester channel)</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">Tech deepdive: Network Requesters</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>On June 17, 6pm UTC, shielded transactions submitted to the Zcash network increased dramatically. As a result, third party wallets have experienced lower performance. The network remained, and still remains, stable and operational, and transactions are being processed normally.<br><br>The ECC core team worked over the Fourth of July holiday to implement a new batch validation algorithm to further reduce verification time by another 80%. Their efforts saw release <code>zcashd</code> 5.1.0 go live.</p>



 Summary 



<p>This release is primarily targeted at improving the validation performance of Sapling and Orchard transactions as well as an incremental improvement to the scan performance of post-NU5 blocks. The release also made improvements to <code>getblocktemplate</code> performance and added Orchard information to <code>getrawtransaction</code> and <code>decoderawtransaction</code>. We will continue to address remaining scan performance issues in subsequent releases.</p>



 Notable changes 



 Faster block validation for Sapling and Orchard transactions 



<p>Block validation in <code>zcashd</code> is a mostly single-threaded process, due to how the chain update logic inherited from Bitcoin Core is written. However, certain more computationally intensive checks are performed more efficiently than checking everything individually:</p>



  ECDSA signatures on transparent inputs are checked via multithreading.  RedPallas signatures on Orchard actions are checked via batch validation.  



<p>As of this release, <code>zcashd</code> applies these techniques to more Sapling and Orchard components:</p>



  RedJubjub signatures on Sapling Spends are checked via batch validation.  Groth16 proofs for Sapling Spends and Outputs are checked via batch validation and multithreading.  Halo 2 proofs for Orchard Actions are checked via batch validation and multithreading.  



<p>This reduces worst-case block validation times for observed historic blocks by around 80% on a Ryzen 9 5950X CPU.</p>



<p>The number of threads used for checking Groth16 and Halo 2 proofs (as well as for creating them when spending funds) can be set via the <code>RAYON_NUM_THREADS</code> environment variable.</p>



 Option handling 



  A new <code>-preferredtxversion</code> argument allows the node to preferentially create transactions of a specified version, if a transaction does not contain components that necessitate creation with a specific version. For example, setting <code>-preferredtxversion=4</code> will cause the node to create V4 transactions whenever the transaction does not contain Orchard components. This can be helpful if recipients of transactions are likely to be using legacy wallets that have not yet been upgraded to support parsing V5 transactions.  



 RPC interface 



  The <code>getblocktemplate</code> RPC method now skips proof and signature checks on templates it creates, as these templates only include transactions that have previously been checked when being added to the mempool.  The <code>getrawtransaction</code> and <code>decoderawtransaction</code> RPC methods now include details about Orchard actions within transactions.  



 Wallet 



  Rescan performance of post-NU5 blocks has been slightly improved (overall rescan time for a single-account wallet decreases by around 6% on a Ryzen 9 5950X). Further improvements will be implemented in future releases to help mitigate the effect of blocks full of shielded outputs.  The <code>CWallet::UpdatedTransaction</code> signal is no longer called while holding the <code>cs_main</code> lock. This fixes an issue where RPCs could block for long periods of time on <code>zcashd</code> nodes with large wallets. Downstream code forks that have reconnected the <code>NotifyTransactionChanged</code> wallet signal should take note of this change, and not rely there on access to globals protected by <code>cs_main</code>.  Some <code>zcashd 5.0.0</code> nodes would shut down some time after start with the error <code>ThreadNotifyWallets: Failed to read block X while notifying wallets of block disconnects. zcashd</code> now attempts to rectify the situation, and otherwise will inform the user before shutting down that a reindex is required.  



 Deprecated 



<p>As of this release, the following previously deprecated features are disabled by default, but may be reenabled using <code>-allowdeprecated=&lt;feature&gt;</code>.</p>



  The <code>dumpwallet</code> RPC method is disabled. It may be reenabled with <code>allowdeprecated=dumpwallet. dumpwallet</code> should not be used; it is unsafe for backup purposes as it does not return any key information for keys used to derive shielded addresses. Use <code>z_exportwallet</code> instead.  



<p>As of this release, the following features are deprecated, but remain available by default. These features may be disabled by setting <code>-allowdeprecated=none</code>. After at least 3 minor-version releases, these features will be disabled by default and the following flags to <code>-allowdeprecated</code> will be required to permit their continued use:</p>



  <code>wallettxvjoinsplit</code> – controls availability of the deprecated <code>vjoinsplit</code> attribute returned by the <code>gettransaction</code> RPC method.  



<p>The <a href="https://z.cash/support/schedule/">Zcash Schedule page</a> has been updated to reflect the 5.1.0 release.</p>

<p>Why you might want to run a Nym&nbsp;gateway</p><p>The Nym mixnet is up and running, the reward system has been launched and now, to facilitate usage of the Nym privacy system, the mixnet needs gateways!</p><p>Gateways are entry points to the Nym mixnet. Without them, the mixnet is simply not accessible. And if there are too few of them, the system becomes vulnerable to DDoS attacks. <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways">Jump straight to the docs to learn how to run&nbsp;one…</a>!</p><p>In this blogpost we will&nbsp;cover:</p>  What gateways do in the overall Nym architecture  How you can get creative when running a gateway and provide additional privacy&nbsp;features  Incentives and grants to spin up your&nbsp;gateway   What do gateways&nbsp;do? <p>Gateways are the interface between users and the mixnet. They check that an application or user has the credentials to use the mixnet; they send traffic through the mixnet; and they receive and store traffic at the other end in case a receiving user is&nbsp;offline.</p><p>Gateways can also offer extra privacy features as a way to attract users! (More on that&nbsp;below…)</p> Checking credentials <p>Gateways are responsible for checking that a user has credentials to use the mixnet. For the next few months, the mixnet will be free to use and integrate as we fine-tune and optimise the network performance. This means gateways will initially not be charging user fees to allow time for integration and optimisation. Meanwhile, gateways will be supported through a Service Grants scheme announced later this week— <a href="https://discord.gg/Vwf8gNue">join our Gateways Discord chan</a> or sign up <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">here</a> to keep up to&nbsp;date!</p><p>Once usage fees are switched on, gateways will begin to receive a part of the fee after checking that the user (or the app they are using) purchased the required bandwidth credentials with their NYM tokens. Bandwidth credentials are a form of anonymous credentials using the decentralised Coconut signature scheme that prove payment of mixnet fees in a private manner. The gateway queries the blockchain to verify that the credentials have not already been ‘spent’ before forwarding traffic through to the&nbsp;mixnet.</p> Sending and receiving messages <p>A user can send messages through the Nym mixnet via the gateway. Currently there is no limit to usage, but once user fees are turned on, users will have purchased a data allowance represented by their bandwidth credential.</p><p>The Nym client on a user’s device encodes data into Sphinx packets with multiple layers of encryption and sends them over a secure channel (end-to-end encrypted) to the gateway that then forwards them on to the mixnet. At the other end, when a gateway receives packets from the mixnet, it removes the last layer of the Sphinx encryption, sending the message to its final destination. (This does not mean the gateway gets to see any plaintext though, as the content is still end-to-end encrypted by the original sender and is only decrypted by the receiving client!)</p><p>If a receiving user is offline when a message arrives, the gateway will store messages for later retrieval. When the user connects, all messages will be delivered. So it’s important that gateways be online consistently and not running on a mobile phone or a&nbsp;laptop.</p><p>The default gateway implementation included in the Nym platform code holds packets for later retrieval. For many applications (such as simple chat or file sharing), this means it is usable out of the box, as it provides a place that potentially offline clients can retrieve packets&nbsp;from.</p><p>In order to register a gateway, you will need to put up a registration deposit (a locked amount of NYM, which will be unlocked when you unregister the gateway) and publish in the blockchain a descriptor with keys and address, to be reachable for users. The registration deposit is required to discourage spurious registrations of gateways and prevent sybil&nbsp;attacks.</p> Running a personal&nbsp;gateway <p>Gateways serve an important function, making the mixnet publicly available, and are listed in the Nym explorer. If you are a more technically savvy user, you might want to run your own personal gateway, rather than relying on someone else’s. Running a personal gateway prevents you from having to trust a third-party gateway.</p><p>The downside, however, is that with just your own traffic flowing through your gateway, you don’t benefit from blending the bulk volume of your traffic with other gateway clients, potentially exposing your overall level of usage and your online/offline periods — anonymity loves company after&nbsp;all!</p><p>Running a gateway for yourself AND for others affords by far the best privacy protection for everyone. Not only will your traffic be aggregated with others, but you will also be able to earn fees from providing this service when usage fees are turned&nbsp;on.</p> Broader use-cases / how you can add&nbsp;features <p>Gateways do not only act as an entry-point to the mixnet. They are also a user-facing service! To attract more users (and thereby more user fees in the future) you might want to offer additional privacy features. These features could include all manner of additional benefit to users, for&nbsp;example:</p><p>Censorship circumvention — Making Nym available to people in parts of the world where Nym might be blocked. Multiple pluggable transport solutions have been proposed in the last years to circumvent censored access to Tor, which can be adapted to Nym. In the Nym infrastructure, gateways are the entities in a position to deploy censorship circumvention solutions and make Nym accessible to users in all regions. Gateways may also run different protocols to connect to the user machine, from Wireguard to various Shadowsocks variants.</p><p>Disguise — Such censorship circumvention could include disguising traffic as a WhatsApp call for&nbsp;example.</p><p>Anonymous mailbox services — gateways can provide email services at an additional cost.</p><p>Nyms — establish a temporary nym with the gateway. The user and the gateway establish a shared secret and a nym (i.e., a temporary pseudonym). The data exchanged between the user and the gateway is encrypted with the shared secret, and the nym is used by the gateway as a temporary mailbox address where it can receive downstream data that is cached by the gateway. The cypherpunks called this a “nym server” in the early days of mixnets and anonymous re-mailers.</p><p>In fact, the more diverse the gateways, the better for everyone! Get creative&nbsp;:)</p> Incentives and grants for&nbsp;gateways <p>The mixnet is currently free to use because over the first many months we will be optimising the system, supporting app integrations and focusing on developer onboarding. This means there will be no user fees as income for gateways for the first&nbsp;months.</p><p>Instead, we are offering Service Grants for people wishing to run gateways along with service providers. These grants are specifically aimed at gateways and service providers that are needed at this stage of development.</p><p>The details of these grants will be announced later this week. <a href="https://discord.gg/Vwf8gNue">Join</a> the Discord gateway channel or sign up&nbsp;<a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways">Run a Nym&nbsp;gateway</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">Gateways to privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Brian Armstrong, CEO and Co-founder</p><p>As companies scale, they usually slow down and become less efficient. It takes more dollars, more people and more time to get anything done. Coordination headwinds increase, vetocracies emerge, risk tolerance fades, and teams become inwardly focused instead of staying focused on their customers.</p><p>While this trajectory is natural, it is not inevitable. Every great company, from Amazon to Meta to Tesla, found ways to retain their founding energy in conjunction with appropriate controls, even as they scaled to be much larger than Coinbase is today. Great companies maintain their insurgent mindset, for fear of becoming complacent and irrelevant over&nbsp;time.</p><p>That’s why we’re focusing on driving more efficiency at Coinbase. After 18 months of ~200% y/y employee growth, many of our internal tools and organizing principles have started to strain or break. So we’ve been digging in to identify the set of changes we need to make to help us succeed at this new&nbsp;scale.</p><p>The first step was significantly slowing our growth, and making the difficult decision to reduce the size of our current team, which we <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-message-from-coinbase-ceo-and-cofounder-brian-armstrong-578d76eedb12?source=collection_category---4------0-----------------------">announced last month</a>. Moving forward, we’ll keep looking for ways to make Coinbase more efficient, and to get back to the mindset and approach that made us successful. I believe that these steps will carry us&nbsp;forward.</p> Push decision making down to single-threaded DRIs <p>We use DRIs (directly responsible individuals) to help us execute faster. DRIs balance input from the team, and make clear decisions in a timely&nbsp;manner.</p><p>But now that we’re a larger company with many products instead of one, we need to adjust how we make decisions — pushing most decision making down in the org, removing bottlenecks and empowering our product&nbsp;leaders.</p><p>DRIs often have the temptation to push decision making up the chain when they aren’t sure or don’t want to take risks. Sometimes they’re afraid of being fired if the decision doesn’t go well. That’s why, where possible, we are increasingly focused on identifying “single-threaded” DRIs. Single-threaded is tech jargon that simply means solely focused on a single area. The single threaded DRI is the most senior person whose only job is to run a given product or initiative, this will typically be a product management or engineering leader. They can’t be the single-threaded DRI if they are the DRI of multiple&nbsp;areas.</p><p>This may mean that not every decision is perfect. But that’s OK if we can scale our impact and empower subject matter experts who are closer to the products and closer to our customers.</p> Give product leaders visibility into their&nbsp;P&amp;L <p>Each of our products have well funded competitors that are dedicated companies. We believe the right way to compete is to incentivize our product leaders to also run their product more like a standalone company. Companies must achieve profitable growth on some reasonable time horizon. Over time, we’ll be able to give product leaders direct visibility into their P&amp;L, so they can move their product toward positive margins and make better decisions around where to invest, while at the executive level we will continue to look at consolidated performance.</p> Leverage shared services to minimize duplication <p>While product leaders can operate independently, there are often common elements across products. We have shared services around how customers onboard, manage their accounts, store crypto, add payment methods, trade crypto, and more. Done wrong, shared services can slow down and frustrate product teams. But when they work well, they can create amazing synergies between products, and deeper product integration.</p><p>Product teams should not be required to use a half baked shared service. But once a shared service is mature, all products may be required to use it. We’ve found that it often helps to start a shared service with one anchor product in mind. When it becomes clear that we are duplicating effort or creating an inconsistent user experience across our products, services need to graduate into clearly decoupled services that any product can leverage.</p> Organize teams into small&nbsp;pods <p>Small teams are more efficient. That’s why it’s important to set a maximum size on teams, so they don’t grow too large and slow&nbsp;down.</p><p>We’re beginning to deploy a new concept that we call “pods” to create more structure around the appropriate size of a team. Within each product, we will be defining pods of &lt;10 people working on a specific feature or area. If a pod grows to be more than 10 people, it will be time to split it in two and assign each one a more specific goal or focus. Pods also need to have a focus, and a north star metric that ties into the overall company&nbsp;metrics.</p> Ship products not slide&nbsp;decks <p>Inside growing companies, there’s a danger that product and engineering teams start shipping great slides decks instead of great products. It can be tempting to “manage up” and feel like a meeting went great with a beautiful deck shown to superiors. But our customers never see the slide decks we create. They only see the&nbsp;product.</p><p>So we’re experimenting with banning slide decks in product and engineering reviews. Instead of a slide deck, you can&nbsp;show:</p>  A dashboard with your metrics — hopefully your team is looking at this at least weekly&nbsp;anyway  Figma mockups  But most importantly….show the product itself and use it&nbsp;live!  <p>It’s fine to include a one page agenda to capture action items, or to link to any pre-reads like technical design documents. But the best use of time in product and engineering reviews is to share your screen and walk through the actual product on mobile or web. It could be the production version, or a staging version. The important thing is to get hands-on with the product, see what the customer is seeing (or is about to see), and make it&nbsp;better.</p><p>As we do this, we should avoid spending too much time talking about what’s going well in meetings. We can share what’s going well in the pre-read, and take a moment to celebrate it, but the majority of the time in meetings should be focused on what is not going well, so we can improve the&nbsp;product.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate this point. Inside companies, there are plenty of things that feel like work, but ultimately don’t improve the customer experience — from market cycles and negative press, to policy efforts, internal politics/drama, titles, and compensation. We have teams that focus on these areas, so that the vast majority of the company (80%+) can remain focused on talking to customers and building better products.</p> APIs instead of&nbsp;meetings <p>Larger companies also get slowed down by endless meetings around prioritization and feature requests. We need to move to a model where all product and engineering teams (not just shared services) publish APIs so that other teams can benefit from what they’re building without ever needing to schedule a meeting. In other words, they need to productize their services and allow other teams to use them in a self-service way.</p><p>This requires us to adopt an internal API catalog where any engineer at Coinbase can browse to find an appropriate service. Without this, it’s difficult for any engineer to even know if an API exists, leading to duplicate work. All services need to be architected using “paved roads”, meaning consistent libraries and languages for authentication, logging, instrumentation, etc. Many of these APIs will be surfaced in Coinbase Cloud for external customers as well, making them even more&nbsp;robust.</p> Maintain an insurgent mindset <p>Ultimately, a lot of this comes down to retaining the founder mentality inside the company and acting like owners. Most companies start off by being anti-establishment, seeking to right some wrong in the world. But as they grow bigger and more successful, they start to become the new establishment. They get complacent, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTwXS2H_iJo">feeling that they’ve won</a>, and bureaucracy sets&nbsp;in.</p><p>At Coinbase, one of our values is repeatable innovation, meaning we always want to be pushing the frontier. We use a 70/20/10 resource allocation model where we invest 70% of our resources in our core business, and 20% in strategic efforts, we also ensure 10% of our resources are always going toward ambitious new bets. And we always try to make products that are the most trusted and easiest to use, so we can bring a billion people into crypto. This is the best way to accomplish our mission of increasing economic freedom in the&nbsp;world.</p> Conclusion <p>Coinbase’s success has always been rooted in an ability to operate efficiently with a startup mindset. Now, as we adjust to our new scale, we need to get back to the things that made us successful — to drive more efficiency and shake off the complacency that can creep into a bigger company. We need to empower our leaders to make decisions, and our teams to deliver great products to customers. It won’t be easy, and we’ll need to keep adjusting. But we got this far, and I’m confident that if we make smart decisions now, it will only be the beginning.</p> Further reading <p>Companies approach this problem of declining efficiency in different ways, to best fit their situation. We’ve aligned on implementing these changes and tools after doing significant research on how other companies have navigated this. Here are a few great books and resources that helped educate me on this&nbsp;topic:</p>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amp-Unlocking-Hypergrowth-Expectations-Intensity/dp/1119836115">Amp It Up</a>: Frank Slootman has a great <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amp-up-frank-slootman/">blog post</a> on this that turned into a book. The core message is that when someone says I’ll get back to you next week, say how about tomorrow. When someone says it will take six months, ask how we would do it in six weeks or six days if we had&nbsp;to.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404">Turn The Ship Around</a>: The core message of this book is instead of asking your manager what you should do, tell him or her what you intend to do, and they will edit your thinking if needed. You still need to inform, but it’s your responsibility to decide the best&nbsp;path.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Founders-Mentality-Overcome-Predictable-Crises/dp/1633691160">Founders Mentality</a>: The core message is to maintain an insurgent mindset, with a bias for action, bold mission, customer advocacy, and more. Try the <a href="https://media.bain.com/founders-mentality/">quiz</a> for more&nbsp;details.  <a href="https://komoroske.com/slime-mold/">Coordination Headwinds</a>: Scaled organizations need to be loosely coupled and tightly aligned. In other words, align on a high level mission, values, and metrics, then empower leaders to make their own path with more localized decision&nbsp;making.   <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/operating-efficiently-at-scale-e6e2378d3d4">Operating efficiently at scale</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Validator Spotlights showcase the great teams working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain. Here are <a href="https://twitter.com/rockx_official">RockX</a>’s responses to some questions from the Findora community:</p><p>1. Tell us about&nbsp;RockX</p><p><a href="https://www.rockx.com/">RockX</a> is a leader in non-custodial staking for Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, Osmosis, and now Findora ecosystems.It was established in 2019, and so has been in the blockchain industry for 3 years now. We are a Web3 company that acts as a gateway to crypto finances. Through innovative and easy-to-use products, we give individuals and institutions access to blockchain data, crypto yield products, and the best-in-class key management solutions.</p><p>With over $900 million USD worth of tokens staked on our validators, RockX is an innovator in liquid staking, data services, and MPC key management, and we have partnered with firms like Lido, SSV Network, and Amber Group. Aside from running validator nodes, RockX also provides an access node API service. This allows blockchain businesses or developers to access on-chain&nbsp;data.</p><p>RockX will soon provide non-custodial staking for Findora. This means users hold their own keys, allowing them to stake FRA without surrendering ownership of their funds. Their FRA will be stored in their cold&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>2. What should we know about the RockX&nbsp;team?</p><p>Although RockX is based in Singapore, the RockX team is located around the world. This allows us to be responsive to inquiries from our community around the clock. We are committed to putting our community above all else, especially when it comes to things like governance and voting. You may reach us on <a href="https://t.co/GmwzB17Wt2">Discord</a> at any time. Also feel free to tweet at us, email us or drop a message through the chatbot on our&nbsp;site.</p><p>We’re also committed to security. With consistent, regular updates and 24/7 monitoring, our nodes have consistently performed smoothly and remained online at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>3. What makes RockX&nbsp;unique?</p><p>RockX prioritizes transparency and ownership. We strongly believe that everyone should know exactly what they are getting themselves into before staking with us. Thus, we’re extremely clear with how much commission we charge and lock-up periods. This is also why we provide additional resources on our <a href="https://blog.rockx.com/">blog</a> for anyone wanting more information. Whether it’s about staking, crypto in general, or the technology behind it, we publish thrice-weekly to answer common questions and provide regular updates on Web3 happenings.</p><p>We provide non-custodial staking, meaning you get to retain ownership of your coins while you stake. This gives you control over your assets and preserves the decentralized nature of&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>4. Why do you want to validate with&nbsp;Findora?</p><p>Ownership has always been important to RockX, which is why we offer non-custodial staking. We believe that with decentralization comes the right to data ownership, which goes hand-in-hand with&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Rather than exchanging personal data for online services, blockchain technology allows people to take ownership of their personal data. This is what truly sets Web3 apart from Web2. With advances such as zero-knowledge technology, this is becoming more of a reality. Findora’s focus on ZK and privacy aligns perfectly with our vision of what Web3 will look like in the future, and we’re excited to support that in any way that we&nbsp;can.</p><p>5. Where can the Findora Community learn more about&nbsp;RockX?</p><p>Website: <a href="http://www.rockx.com">www.rockx.com</a></p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/rockx_official</p><p>Discord: <a href="https://t.co/GmwzB17Wt2">https://t.co/GmwzB17Wt2</a></p><p>For direct access to our access node portal: access.rockx.com</p><p>For more information on staking or Web3 in general: blog.rockx.com</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-validator-spotlight-rockx-1d0033caadc8">💡Findora Validator Spotlight💡: RockX</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Solana DApp Support for Brave Wallet on Desktop 
<p>Brave is continuing to deepen its integration with Solana, <a>first announced in late 2021</a>. With Brave’s 1.41 release, <a>Brave Wallet</a> desktop users can now connect directly to their favorite Solana-based Web3 DApps. This expands Brave Wallet’s Solana support that already includes the ability to send, receive, store, and purchase tokens.</p>
<p>With Solana’s low fees and fast transaction speeds, users can easily explore the network’s vibrant and growing ecosystem. They can buy NFTs on <a href="https://www.magiceden.io/">Magic Eden</a>, discover music on <a href="https://audius.co/">Audius</a>, earn tokens through exercise with <a href="https://stepn.com/">STEPN</a>, or even collaborate on projects with <a href="https://squads.so/">Squads</a> (just to name a few). Solana also boasts an impressive range of decentralized finance options. Fans of BAT should be on the lookout for a special BAT/Brave-themed NFT collection launching this month on Magic Eden.</p>
<p>“Brave Wallet already makes Web3 easy-to-use with multiple features and partnerships, and today we’re expanding this access via our Solana integration and DApp support for our desktop browsers, with mobile coming soon,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “Brave users already benefit from Solana’s faster transactions and low fees, and can now directly connect with its growing ecosystem of DApps to explore NFTs, music, fitness, and many more options.”</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 Brave Wallet Developer Docs 
<p>We’re also announcing an easy way for developers to build Solana DApps with Brave’s 62 million users in mind. In these documents, you’ll find instructions on setting up your DApps to offer a seamless connection with Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>To get started, developers are encouraged to view the dedicated sections for <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/ethereum">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/solana">Solana</a>, as well as keep an eye out for updates on support for more blockchains on the horizon.</p>
<p>Release 1.41 is another step in the direction of opening up the decentralized Web to more people. We continue to drive forward our vision of a multi-chain Brave Wallet, offering our community more choice and control with security and privacy at its core.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more announcements around Brave Wallet, including more features on all devices. <a>Get started with Brave Wallet today</a>!</p>

<p>A challenge all web3 developers need to address when building applications is where the data is&nbsp;stored.</p><p>Historically, most web3 developers have chosen to use either blockchain storage or <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> and sometimes resort to traditional centralized database (eg MongoDB, Postgres) for some types of data. Verida provides a decentralized replacement for those traditional databases, and a better option for some of the things developers are currently using blockchain storage or IPFS&nbsp;for.</p> Choosing data&nbsp;storage <p>In the flowchart below we show some of the key decisions a developer must make when choosing&nbsp;storage.</p><p>Firstly, look at your data and decide if it is structured or unstructured. Examples of structured data include data that you would keep in a spreadsheet, a JSON or XML file or a Notion database. Unstructured data includes images, movies or other multimedia.</p><p>Secondly, is your data public or private? By public we mean it can be accessed without access control mechanisms. Note that encryption on its own is not an access control mechanism because access cannot be revoked if a key&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>Finally, do you need to update or delete data? Be careful here — some storage systems implement deletion as the removal of a reference to data that is stored elsewhere. In these cases the data is still there and anyone who recorded that reference can easily access it. Both deletion and updates should be implemented in such a way that all copies of the data are irrevocably modified.</p>Data choice flowchart Limitations of Current Web3 Data Storage Solutions <p>Blockchain storage is the first type of storage most web3 developers use. However, it doesn’t take long to realize this is best suited for very specific types of data such as links to external data like NFTs. The nature of a blockchain makes it expensive and inefficient to store more than small amounts of data and the immutable, public nature of the data means it is unsuitable for many applications.</p><p>Many developers discover these limitations and switch to using IPFS. IPFS is a globally accessible content addressable file storage network, where files are referenced by the hash of their content. This makes it very well suited to “flat file” type storage, and it has had great success as storage for NFT images. In broad terms IPFS is used in a similar way to how AWS S3 is used in Web2 development — to make files available to people and applications.</p><p>The next limitation Web3 developers find is around private data and managing access permissions to that data. Users want self-sovereignty over personal data so they can control their own information. How do you store things like a user’s interests or even things like health information in a way that doesn’t make it publicly available to anyone for data mining or identity&nbsp;theft?</p><p>Many developers resort to trying to encrypt data and store it either on-chain or in encrypted files on IPFS. There are a number of serious problems with&nbsp;this:</p>  Most developers are not cryptographers and often make mistakes in how they implement their encryption, putting user data at&nbsp;risk.  Both blockchains and IPFS are immutable storage systems, meaning that any mistake either in implementation or by a user accidently leaking an encryption key means their data is globally public forever with no way to fix&nbsp;it.  The lack of a proper query mechanism leads to badly performing apps. Either applications load large files into memory and developers find data inside them or there are many small files each of which must be requested each time it is&nbsp;needed.  Updates and deletes are implemented by copying all data to a new version of the file and resaving it. This is both expensive and&nbsp;slow.  No control over the physical storage location of data which is often important for legal or policy&nbsp;reasons.  <p>Verida exists to solve these problems. The <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/network/storage-node">Verida DbStore</a> is a decentralized, end-to-end (E2E) encrypted document database.</p><p>Because it is a database, developers get strong query capabilities. Data updates are trivial and fast which means correcting any errors in the data is simple. Databases are both encrypted (so storage node operators can never see the data) and protected by an authentication system (so they are inaccessible to non-authorized users).</p><p>Verida <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/network/storage-node">storage nodes</a> are open source and can be self-hosted. Users can choose what node to store their data on, meaning that the legal and policy issues around data sovereignty are easily addressed. Data can be replicated to multiple non-related nodes for better availability and performance.</p><p>The table below is an easy to use reference to look at when comparing the three&nbsp;methods:</p>Table comparing Web3 storage solutions Conclusion <p>Verida DbStore is a new type of Web3 storage that provides capabilities that are important to many applications. It is fast, resilient and easy to use.

  One of the most pervasive techniques used by browsers &amp; advertisers to get ads in front of receptive eyes, is that of third-party cookies!

<p>Although it is intimately connected to our everyday lives, advertising technology (adtech) goes unnoticed by most of us. </p>

<p>One of the most pervasive techniques used by browsers and advertisers to get relevant ads in front of increasingly receptive eyes is that of the ‘third-party cookie’. </p>

 What is a third-party cookie?  

<p>These are tiny pieces of data that are stored in your browser on behalf of a website whenever you visit. Websites that you visit later can access these cookies and use them to tailor the ads they show or the deals they offer. </p>

<p>An example: suppose that you are planning a trip to Lisbon and doing online research about where to visit and what to eat. Some of these websites leave cookies on your browser that can be witnessed by other websites when you browse to them. The next time you visit Amazon you may find that - miraculously - there is a sale on guide books to Portugal. </p>

<p>As simple and benign as third-party cookies sound, this mechanism is powerful. As internet users, we are spreading information about our browsing history far and wide. While more tailored advertisements is in theory a benefit, the privacy implications are manifest.</p>

 How do we tackle the issues related with adtech? 

<p>An obvious approach to cookies and adtech is to make the trade-offs between privacy and relevance of advertisements clearer. One trivial way to do this is to alert a web user each time they visit a website that uses cookies. Those of us in jurisdictions subject to the GDPR encounter these warnings with aggravating frequency. Inevitably, we click through the warnings with no thought at all, meaning that the well-intentioned notifications are completely meaningless. </p>

<p>This status quo is transparency theatre. Even though these cookie warnings are meant to abide by the GDPR principle of consent, those of us in the majority of users who ignore the warnings do not have the time to give informed consent and we gain little assurance that our data is being used in appropriate ways. Even if GDPR risk is mitigated in a technical sense, practically there is no benefit.</p>

 Adtech needs a major facelift! 

<p>One such direction, until it was killed in January 2022, was Google’s FLoC; the Federated Learning of Cohorts. The idea behind FLoC was to map people into a group of like-minded users called a cohort. A website can then request the cohort identity of a given user to generate targeted ads, without getting more specific or identifying data from the browser. Topics, which is Google’s proposed replacement for FLoC, instead tracks user interests based on browser history and makes these interests available to advertisers in real time. </p>

<p>The Google proposals have received mixed reviews. They may not be as private in practice as suggested. Then again, it might actually be a more pragmatic approach than simply blocking third-party cookies, which at first glance is more privacy-friendly, but has the effect of strongly incentivising much more privacy destructive technologies such as device fingerprinting. </p>

 We see no solution on the table as getting adtech quite right.  

<p>The ingredients that are missing are meaningful transparency and minimality. A key aspect of adtech transparency should be to provide information about when a person’s browsing data is actually used. This avoids some of the problems of the never-ending cookie warnings, but also introduces ‘actionability’. </p>

<p>An example of actionable adtech transparency: you find that a particular company’s website is making heavy and seemingly unjustifiable use of your browser data. You then consider switching to an alternative business to get the same service. </p>

<p>This methodology, in which statistics about your adtech privacy are consumed after-the-fact, and then made actionable, eliminates the need for a constant stream of up-front warnings, without foregoing ultimate transparency or accountability. </p>

<p>As members of the PAD team, we cannot help but notice that this methodology is closely related to the trust-but-verify nature of decryptions under the PAD system. Once a user grants in-principle decryption approval to another party, that party does not need to request permission to decrypt. Instead, that party is subjected to unavoidable transparency about whether and when decryptions were made. </p>

<p>This counter-intuitive property allows many of the PAD use cases to fit together well. In the case of PAD Places, if you are in an emergency and a friend needs to identify your location, requiring that the friend seek permission may be unsuitable if you are unable to grant it.</p>

 Applying PAD-style transparency to adtech.. 

<p>Applying PAD-style transparency to adtech might be a modest part of solving the problems inherent to this domain. Technology that enables the average person to get a sense for which websites apply adtech proportionally - rather than provide a useless stream of blanket warnings - also could be used to empower the individual to be compensated for use of their browser data. Users who are highly motivated by this compensation could even optionally attach additional attributes about their identity or browsing history, and secure this information in encrypted form under PAD. If advertisers wish to use this data, they must transparently decrypt it and subject themselves to a micropayment to the user.</p>

<p>This self-sovereign ownership of browser data may be a moonshot for now, but regardless, the notion of meaningful transparency already incentivises our second goal of minimality. Privacy-centric consumers will track and recommend businesses that make the most out of the least data and provide more relevant ads without making unjustifiable intrusions. Reputation-sensitive companies will respond and learn to live with less. Incentive compatibility is a hallmark of great technology. </p>

<p>We see meaningful transparency and incentivised minimality as the principles currently missing from the adtech debate surrounding third-party cookies and alternative solutions like topics. Any technology that provides individuals with an easily interpretable layer to see how their data is actually used will play an outsize role in the adtech of Web3.0.</p>

 Why release a transparency report? 



<p>Electric Coin Co. (ECC)* is committed to openness and transparency — as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital currency, and in support of our mission to empower people with economic freedom. This transparency report details company income, expenses, and use of funds during Q4 2021.</p>



<p>Key takeaways:</p>



  Bootstrap received coins at a value above the ECC operating-expense level for Q4 2021. During this time, Bootstrap received coins at an average of $1,185,000 a month (at the Q4 average ZEC price for each of the three months’ distribution dates at $154.81), and ECC incurred average monthly expenses of approximately $717,000.  At the end of Q4 2021, Bootstrap and ECC collectively held approximately $6.5M in USD and approximately 85.3K ZEC. As of June 22, 2022, the companies held approximately $4.9M in USD and approximately 113.3K in ZEC.

<p>The Findora Newsletter gives you monthly updates in the push to build privacy infrastructure for Web3. Thanks for subscribing and being part of our community!</p> 🛠 Engineering Updates  🎉Triple Masking to Launch on&nbsp;Testnet <p>We are excited to announce a successful network upgrade to Findora: support for Triple Masking on Forge testnet is live and ready for extensive testing by the community! Triple Masking enables shielded asset creation, issuance, and ultra-fast transfers powered by Turbo-Plonks, <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/modules/UTXO/anonymous/Concepts/">a type of ZK-SNARK</a>.</p><p>With this network upgrade, Findora’s network can support use cases not previously possible including confidential cross-chain transfers, private decentralized lending, private DAO fundraising, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Capitalizing on cryptographic breakthroughs and zero-knowledge proofs, the launch of Triple Masking completes Findora X, a series of integral toolkits including Restful APIs, SDKs, and infrastructure to make Ethereum-based assets and applications fully&nbsp;private.</p> …And A Triple Masking SDK is Soon to&nbsp;Follow <p>The Findora SDK contains a Triple Masking API, which enables developers to have access to the latest Findora privacy features, such as fully secured transfers with full privacy. SDK integration testing was completed locally.</p> Rialto Bridge to Support Fantom, Polygon, and…NFTs! <p>That’s right, according to the developers working on the Rialto Bridge, it is being configured to support NFTs. They will be supported on Findora OG (the UTXO ledger) where they can assume similar privacy properties to those Findora gives to ERC-20 tokens.<a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/developers/evm/Mint%20NFTs/p1_deploy_nft/"> Click here</a> for documentation on deploying NFTs on&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>The Rialto Bridge connects Findora to Ethereum and its satellite ecosystems, and the team has already launched a BNB Chain bridge on mainnet and an Ethereum bridge on testnet. Paths to the Fantom and Polygon are now in the pre-production phase.</p> EIP-1559 Transaction Support <p>As well as preparing the UTXO layer for the ERC-721 tokens, the Findora engineering team is working on supporting EIP-1559 transactions. EIP stands for “Ethereum Improvement Proposal,” and EIP-1559 is a hardfork of the Ethereum chain introduced by Vitalek Buterin to stabilize the volatility of gas&nbsp;fees.</p><p>🧑‍🌾 Ecosystem</p> EthCC Launch Party&nbsp;🥳 <p>We are celebrating the launch of Triple Masking with a launch party at EthCC! We plan to host a huge hackathon taking into account hacker feedback from EthNYC and Consensus in Austin.

<p></p><p>The term MEV stands for Miner Extractable Value, lately referred to as maximum extractable value. It is a measure of the profit a miner (or validator, sequencer, etc.) can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce on a smart-contract enabled blockchain network.</p> What is MEV (Miner Extractable Value)? <p>Simply put, MEV is a dynamic that allows miners to maximize their profit by determining the order of transactions on a blockchain network to their advantage. This includes arbitrarily reordering, including, or excluding transactions within a block at the expense of users.<br></p><p>The term Miner Extractable Value was first coined in 2019 by a team of researchers highlighting the issue by publishing a paper called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf">Flash Boys 2.0</a>. Interestingly, the problem of MEV was first identified even earlier by a Reddit user in 2014 who raised the issue of ‘<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2d84yv/miners_frontrunning/">miner front-running</a>’ given that all transactions are public on the Ethereum network.<br></p><p>Subsequently, the concept of Miner Extractable Value and the problems surrounding it gained notoriety after the research team of a Web3 investment firm, Paradigm, dove into them. Head of Research at Paradigm, Dan Robinson, published the article <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest/">Ethereum is a Dark Forest</a>, in 2020. In it, Robinson states that MEV issues such as front-running bots potentially incentivize miners to reorder and submit transactions in their mempools for their benefit.<br></p>Total MEV on the Ethereum network since 2020. (<a href="https://explore.flashbots.net/">Source</a>)<p>Today, MEV is one of Ethereum’s biggest issues, with more than <a href="https://explore.flashbots.net/">$663 million</a> worth of value extracted from users since 2020. This shows that MEV is not merely a minor issue, but a significant problem occurring at a massive scale and a matter of concern for Ethereum users.<br></p><p>Let’s look at the different types of extractions, examples, and effects of MEV, as well as the measures users can take to mitigate its effects.</p> Types of Miner Extractable Value <p>Today, users suffer the economic effects of MEV in more than one form. Terms like gas golfing and generalized front-runners often occupy crypto headlines. However, before we venture into discussing the various types of MEV, let’s first examine the theory behind MEV and how it impacts miners and validators.<br></p><p>As we have stated, MEV allows miners and validators to profit from re-ordering transactions, as they have access to confirming blocks. Despite this, a good portion of MEV is performed by autonomous network partakers called searchers.<br></p><p>Searchers are users (not necessarily miners) that handle intricate algorithms in the blockchain ecosystem. These algorithms are then used to detect available profitable MEV opportunities. Searchers make use of bots to automate the submission of profitable transactions to the network. Since searchers have a “secure” profit opportunity, they are able to pay high gas fees, incentivizing miners and validators to accept their proposed order of transactions.<br></p><p>Below are the different types of extractions that take place as forms of MEV.</p> Gas golfing <p>Gas golfing is the process of optimizing the existing functionalities of smart contracts in a way that minimizes the amount of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp">gas</a> involved. This involves programming transactions in a way that takes advantage of contracts’ design to use the least possible gas. <br></p><p>Gas golfing gives a competitive advantage to searchers, as it allows them to set higher gas prices while keeping their total gas fees constant (since gas fees = gas price*gas used).<br></p><p>To understand the concept of gas golfing, one must understand the cost of storage in a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralized</a> network. Unlike data centralized in servers, blockchain data is not stored in just one place but on tens of thousands of disks distributed across the globe. Furthermore, data has to be readily available to every node in the network if a future transaction comes along to access or change it. Because of this, the cost of data access is charged by the network in the form of gas fees. <br></p><p>Gas golfers use techniques such as: <br></p>  Saving data space within transaction code whenever they can.  Only storing data when it is really required.  Keeping a check on how many times a function is accessing or changing storage.<br>  <p>Other gas golfing techniques involve using addresses that start with a long string of zeroes, as they take less storage space. Another involves leaving small <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC-20</a> token balances in contracts to re-use them, since it costs more gas to initialize a storage slot than to update one (SSTORE vs SLOAD).<br></p><p>It’s worth noting that SSTORE (to store data in a storage slot) and SLOAD (to load data from the slot into memory) are some of the most expensive opcodes on <a href="https://cypherpunks-core.github.io/ethereumbook/13evm.html">EVM</a> in terms of gas fees.</p> Generalized front-running: What is front-running and why it’s so common <p>Unlike gas golfing, front-running doesn’t deal with optimizing smart contracts to detect profitable MEV opportunities. Instead, it involves keeping an eye on unconfirmed transactions, looking for profitable trades, and then front-running the original transactions by submitting them but with higher gas fees. <br></p><p>By effectively executing a winning trade first, front-runners secure a profit at the expense of the original honest trader. Front-running bots that use specific algorithms and parameters to identify transactions before they happen are called generalized front-runners.<br></p><p>Let’s illustrate this with an example.<br></p><p>Imagine a trader finds an arbitrage opportunity. As it turns out, there’s a price difference for a certain coin between Uniswap and Sushiswap. Let’s say wBTC/USDC is $20,904 in one and $20,916 in the other. To profit from this opportunity, the trader has to initiate a transaction to buy the asset for a lower price on Uniswap and then sell it at a higher price on Sushiswap. Once the trader initiates the transaction, it will have to wait in the mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions) to be picked by a miner and get executed.<br></p><p>However, what our trader doesn’t know is that this opens up a window for a front-runner bot to sweep in. The bot would detect the transaction while it’s waiting to be executed, copy it, add in higher gas fees, and have its transaction executed beforehand. This will effectively rob the trader of her arbitrage opportunity, profiting at her intellectual, monetary, and creative expense.</p> Back-running <p>Similar to front-running, back-running involves the monitoring of a mempool to execute a transaction immediately after a pending target transaction. To achieve this, MEV searchers employ back-running bots eavesdropping on big transactions that often results in an imbalance in an <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm-588954fc5ff7">AMM</a> pool and in heavy price slippage.<br></p><p>The back-running bot then executes an opposite trade on the same pool to maximize its owner’s profit. In other words, back-running works by leveraging the price difference caused by an original transaction.<br></p><p>Back-running bots also monitor mempools for new token pair listings and place transactions to immediately scoop the initial liquidity by buying a large quantity of one token from the pair. This subsequently increases the price of a token, creating FOMO among other traders and pushing the price even higher. The bot then sells the token at a higher price maximizing the searcher’s profit, wrecking small buyers on its way out.</p> Sandwich attack <p>Sandwich attacks deal combine both front-running and back-running strategies. They are particularly useful in decentralized exchanges (such as Uniswap) that utilize an AMM concept. As you saw in the back-running example, the price of an asset can substantially increase or decrease with a single big trade under this model. <br></p>Illustration of a sandwich attack for a given token. (<a href="https://www.publish0x.com/ilvfi/illuvium-silv2-don-t-get-sandwiched-xqmrdwj">Source</a>)<p>MEV extractors leverage AMMs for a profit by monitoring the mempool for large transactions and sandwiching them. To do so, they simultaneously front-run and back-run them.<br></p><p>For example, let’s say a victim wants to swap a large amount of ETH for an obscure altcoin on Uniswap. Once the MEV searcher sees this transaction in mempool, it can front-run the victim’s transaction by executing the same transaction prior to the victim's transaction. <br></p><p>As the searcher’s transaction hits, it will invariably result in price slippage, which will subsequently increase the price of the altcoin within the pool. This, in turn, will make the victim pay substantially more per coin than they originally expected. To complete the job, once the victim’s transaction is executed, the searcher can then swap its altcoins back to ETH at the original trader’s expense, back-running to make a profit.</p> Time bandit attacks <p>Another form of MEV attack is the so-called time bandit attack. As you will see, these are perhaps the most worrying types of attacks, as they could destabilize the consensus and trust in a network.<br></p><p>Time bandit attacks involve the re-mining of blocks in order to maximize profits. An opportunity for a time bandit attack might occur when block rewards are small enough compared to MEV. This incentivizes miners to destabilize the consensus to reap the maximum profits.<br></p><p>For example, let’s say the highest block of a blockchain network is numbered #B10 and its block reward is $100. Incidentally, a miner notices an MEV opportunity worth $1000 on block number #B7. This opportunity might incentivize the said miner to remine the #B7 block and all subsequent blocks to reap the MEV rewards while adhering to the longest-chain rule.<br></p><p>As you can imagine, this is unlikely to happen in big chains without a certain degree of collusion between several miners. However, block re-mining is still a problem in novel chains and could become more prominent as <a href="https://argoblockchain.com/articles/read-more-china-dominates-bitcoin-mining-heres-why-that-needs-to-change">mining power progressively centralizes.</a></p> Uncle attacks <p>Another peculiar kind of attack is uncle attacks. Uncle attacks can bypass and perform MEV even from bundled transactions, a common defense tactic that consists of sending transactions in batches. To understand how <a href="https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1382673587715342339">uncle attacks</a> work, we need to first understand bundled transactions.<br></p><p><a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a> is a research organization that democratizes access to MEV (a controversial take that we’ll address below) by creating an off-chain MEV auction marketplace. This is called front-running as a service (FaaS). Once Flashbots’ auctions conclude, a batch of front-running transactions is bundled together to avoid getting front-run by other searchers (in other words, out-speeding front-runners). Bundled transactions must be included in the order submitted, and either the whole bundle is included, or nothing is. They are also not allowed to split.<br></p><p>However, there are cases in which a bundle of such transactions is mined on an uncle block. In Ethereum, occasionally two blocks can be mined at roughly the same time, with only one of them being allowed into the chain. The block that gets discarded is then called an "uncle" or “orphan”. Transactions that get written into uncle blocks then create a small window of opportunity for an attack.<br></p><p>When bundled transactions are mined into an uncle block, they’re open for everyone to see. In this case, an attacker can select transactions from the bundle to front-run or back-run them. This also shows that attacks extend beyond the mempool and into uncled blocks as well.</p> Effects of Miner Extractable Value – the good, the bad, and the ugly <p>Surprisingly, there are numerous arguments for MEV and its role in the blockchain ecosystem. <br></p><p>Let’s start out with the side that believes MEV is unsolvable and inevitable before we look into the negatives.</p> The good side of MEV <p>This side argues that the crypto community should be building the tools to democratize access to MEV instead of trying to solve it.<br></p><p>The proponents of MEV believe that MEV ensures the usefulness of DeFi projects such as lending protocols, enabling them to speedy and smooth liquidation processes. The proponents argue that MEV extractors are rational actors seeking and fixing economic inefficiencies of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364/">DeFi protocols</a> making them robust.<br></p><p>A group of researchers belonging to the proponents camps have built an organization called Flashbots working on mitigating the negative externalities of current MEV extraction techniques. <a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/#:~:text=Flashbots%20is%20a%20research%20and,state%2Drich%20blockchains%20like%20Ethereum.">Flashbots</a> has built a product called MEV-Geth, which offers front-running as a service with a primary focus on enabling a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction.<br></p><p>The proponents argue that offering <a href="https://medium.com/offchainlabs/front-running-as-a-service-334c929c945a">front-running as a service</a> (FaaS) makes up for the miners’ lost revenue caused by Ethereum’s <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/quorum/what-is-eip-1559-how-will-it-change-ethereum/">EIP-1559</a> fee-burning update. Hence, it indirectly increases Ethereum’s security by incentivizing miners to compete for MEV with higher hash power.</p> The bad <p>On other hand, there are obvious reasons for MEV causing a worse experience for users. Particularly, it causes more expensive transactions and revenue loss.<br></p><p>For example, at the application layer, front-running and sandwich attacks are causing users millions of dollars worth of losses in terms of increased price slippage and lost arbitrage opportunities. In the 30 days before publishing this article, MEV searchers and miners have extracted over $28 million from Ethereum users.<br></p><p>The existence of front-running bots makes arbitrage trading an unwinnable game for amateur traders. This especially hurts the proposed functionality of DeFi protocols that rely on third-party arbitrage to function properly. The presence of MEV bots creates an unfavorable environment for real arbitrageurs to participate in such protocols, which in turn is detrimental to the protocol’s security.<br></p><p>Additionally, at a network level, generalized front-runners compete against each other by increasing gas fees. This often results in network congestion and high transaction fees. Network users (and the network itself, which turns inefficient and costly) suffer as a consequence.</p> The ugly <p>There are also arguments put forth claiming that MEV worsens the network itself at a protocol level. For example, for any given block, if MEV rewards are larger than block rewards, this might incentivize miners to remine blocks and destabilize the network’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245820300668">consensus</a>.<br></p><p>Depending on who you ask, allowing miners to reorganize and reorder the transactions in blocks for profit might be seen as breaking the entire premise of blockchains being a secure, immutable, and permissionless technology. It also makes miners’ take an active role in influencing transactions and balances, as opposed to being neutral parties competing for a different set of benefits. In fact, we encourage you to think about what may happen when miners decide it’s worth their time to utilize their mining privileges to conduct MEV themselves.</p> Mitigating Miner Extractable Value <p>We have looked into the bad and ugly sides of MEV and considered the millions of dollars lost due to MEV extractions. It is now crucial to close this article by discussing how to mitigate or minimize the effects of MEV.<br></p><p>The crypto ecosystem as a whole is actively discussing and working on solutions to mitigate or at least minimize MEV’s effects. Numerous solutions have been proposed from both camps – those who believe MEV is inevitable and access to it should be democratized, and those who are trying to prevent it.<br></p><p>Let’s have a look at the solutions both camps propose.</p> MEV democratization, Flashbots, and more <p>In the “proponent” camp, several organizations such as Flashbots (see above) aim to democratize MEV extraction through a sealed-bid block space auction mechanism. This auction mechanism creates a parallel private relay to reduce mempool bidding wars, failed transactions bloating the blockchain, and overall gas costs for users.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a> has led a movement that proposes <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-auction-auctioning-transaction-ordering-rights-as-a-solution-to-miner-extractable-value/6788">MEV Auction</a> (MEVA) to minimize the effects of MEV on network traffic. With MEVA, an auction is created in which the winner has the right to reorder submitted transactions and insert their own, as long as they do not delay any specific transaction by more than N blocks.</p> Against MEV <p>On the other side, those who believe that MEV is bad and should be minimized have built a couple of solutions as well.<br></p><p><a href="https://bridge.arbitrum.io/">Arbitrum</a>, a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, has openly positioned itself against MEV and FaaS. To mitigate MEV, Arbitrum has proposed a solution to avoid reordering of transactions by having <a href="https://www.mev.wiki/solutions/mev-minimization/arbitrum-offchain-labs">no sequencer</a> on Layer-2 chains. <br></p><p>As per Arbitrum, a chain can be created in which no permissioned entities have sequencing rights. Ordering then is to be determined entirely by inbox contracts. A Layer-2 chain without sequencers might lose the ability to get lower latency than its Layer-1 chain but, without any party involved in the Layer-2 (including Arbitrum validators) having a say in transaction ordering, MEV cannot enter the picture.<br></p><p>Well-known oracle network Chainlink has also built a solution to avoid the reordering of transactions called <a href="https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-fair-sequencing-services-enabling-a-provably-fair-defi-ecosystem/">Fair Sequencing Service.</a> The idea behind FSS is to have an oracle network order the transactions sent to a particular contract, including both user transactions and oracle reports. Through FSS, oracle nodes ingest transactions and then reach consensus on their ordering, rather than allowing a single leader to dictate it.<br></p><p>Another approach is that of <a href="https://github.com/Taichi-Network/docs">Taichi Network</a> (now defunct) or <a href="https://bloxroute.com/">bloXroute</a>, which allows users to send private transactions directly to a mining pool, bypassing the public mempool. This eliminates the attack surface within the mempools (where, as we have established, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">transactions are public</a> and can be monitored by MEV bots).<br><br></p>A diagram showing how Taichi Network enables users to avoid getting front-runned. (<a href="https://www.mev.wiki/solutions/faas-or-meva/private-transactions">Source</a>) Conclusion: Miner Extraction Value is not going away soon. <p>It is a well-established fact that MEV problems, as they stand, are quite serious in nature, and need to be addressed or minimized at least. Even though there are conflicts about the good and bad sides of MEV, both sides are actively working on various solutions.

 Our latest partnership with Unstoppable Domains introduces BlockWallet users to their multi-chain NFT domains for sending and receiving crypto.  Introducing NFT&nbsp;Domains <p>NFT domains are the first step to simplifying the Web3 experience. And thanks to our newfound partners <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/">Unstoppable Domains</a>, here’s what you can&nbsp;expect:</p>  Simplify crypto transactions by replacing all your complicated wallet addresses with your domain name as your username.  Use your domain to receive 275+ coins and tokens across multiple blockchain networks.  Login to apps with your domain name as your universal web3 username.  Unlike traditional domains, fully own and control your domain. You buy it once, you own it for&nbsp;life!  Easily create and host websites, ranging from personal websites to NFT galleries.  <p>So if you haven’t claimed your NFT domain yet, visit <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/">their website</a> to grab yours before it’s gone&nbsp;forever.</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a privacy-first self-custodial browser extension wallet where you can store, send or receive crypto and interact with your favorite blockchain apps privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy often translates to security risks. BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating friction and making privacy accessible for everyone.</p><p>BlockWallet protects you and ensures privacy by default. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain apps, BlockWallet routes all node requests through Privacy Proxies, which mask the IP address and other metadata, that can be used to identify and track you on a blockchain. You can also use the Privacy Pools feature, powered by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zk-snarks">zk-SNARKs</a> technology, to deposit and mix funds in a smart contract. This allows transferring funds without links to your main wallet. BlockWallet offers integrated Flash-Bot Protection, shielding you from sandwich attacks when you trade on DEXes. Meanwhile, the Phishing Protection feature helps you combat phishing scams by generating unique artwork on all sensitive pages.</p><p>BlockWallet is not a compromise. It’s privacy-first, but it still packs all features you would expect from a wallet. With full Web 3.0 support, the wallet allows you to connect to any&nbsp;DApp.</p><p>Become a part of the BlockWallet community today:</p><p><a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Homepage</a> | <a href="https://blockwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetBlockWallet">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/blockwallet">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/69gvNKatdb">Discord</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EKVZ2xWXEH">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://hello@blockwallet.io/">E-mail</a></p>

Each one is master of his work &amp; can do whatever one pleases to do. <a href="https://tornado.cash/">Tornado Cash</a> has never been so much in the hands of its community. We are thrilled to see the outcomes of this&nbsp;release.</p><p>Before leaving you to your keyboards &amp; your creative minds, we would like to thank the Tornado Cash community for their support. Now more than ever, the crypto ecosystem needs to continue working on privacy and decentralization.</p><p>Remember — no one can stop Tornado Cash.

<p>We’re proud to announce that Aztec Connect is live on mainnet, enabling private DeFi on Ethereum for the first time&nbsp;ever.</p><p>By fusing full privacy and L1 DeFi liquidity right on Ethereum mainnet, users no longer need to trade convenience for privacy via alternative privacy chains. With Aztec Connect, Ethereum is now capable of private DeFi all on its&nbsp;own.</p><p>To help reveal the power of Aztec Connect, we’ve completely revamped <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a>, our first-party DeFi aggregator. Users can try the comprehensive update today, which allows anyone to use DeFi apps like Lido, Curve, and Element with complete privacy and up to 100x cost&nbsp;savings.</p><blockquote><a href="http://zk.money">Try zk.money&nbsp;here</a></blockquote><p>Blockchain transactions are fully public. They leak privacy, exposing user behavior and creating security vulnerabilities. At Aztec we solved the challenge of implementing blockchain privacy by inventing <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/09/22/plonk.html">Plonk</a>, the industry-standard zk-SNARK that enables fast privacy for Aztec while securing billions of dollars of on-chain value for the broader zk community.</p><p>Aztec Connect is the next major leap toward our long-term vision: a fast, decentralized zero-knowledge network with native smart contract&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Aztec Connect enables anyone to add privacy to Ethereum applications with two easy-to-use developer tools:</p>  Bridge Contracts: 100–200 line interfaces connecting Ethereum smart contracts to Aztec’s&nbsp;rollup  SDK: a front-end toolkit enabling beautiful, seamless web interfaces to access Aztec Connect integrations  <p>In simples terms, Aztec Connect works like a VPN: by using Aztec’s rollup contract as a proxy, users interact with Ethereum services from within the Aztec&nbsp;network.</p><p>Encrypted instructions are passed to Aztec’s rollup contract on Layer 1, which executes those commands. Aztec batches transactions, reducing user fees and enabling up to 100x cost savings over mainnet Ethereum.</p> A Private zk-Rollup — Today <p>The launch of Aztec Connect represents exciting new paradigms for DeFi and&nbsp;beyond:</p>  Fully confidential Defi actions: staking, vault entry, lending and&nbsp;swaps  Significant cost reduction for&nbsp;users  Private treasury management, on-chain DAO governance, and NFT purchasing and&nbsp;trading  <p>And because Aztec Connect relies on Ethereum as its execution environment, protocols keep liquidity and contracts on mainnet while maintaining Ethereum ecosystem composability.</p><p>That means partners can access the benefits of a private rollup&nbsp;with:</p>  No liquidity fragmentation  No contract redeployment  No re-audits of code and contracts  <p>Scale and privacy without compromise.</p> zk.money <p>We originally built zk.money as a showcase for private payments. Since launch, 75,000 users have entrusted our cryptography with over $100 million in payment&nbsp;volume.</p><p>We’ve now expanded <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> functionality to support beautiful, intuitive access to DeFi interactions that are private by default, starting with acquiring Lido liquid staked Ether (stETH) with Curve and entering fixed rate vaults with Element&nbsp;Finance.</p><p>As of today, users can visit zk.money and interact with our Curve-Lido and Element bridges, enjoying mainnet liquidity, full privacy and up to 100x cost savings over Layer 1 Ethereum, with upcoming support for your favorite DeFi&nbsp;apps.</p><p><a href="http://zk.money">Zk.money</a> demonstrates the simple and elegant user experiences that are possible with the Aztec Connect SDK–a Typescript-based front-end development tool that allows anyone to integrate privacy and cost savings into Ethereum applications.</p><p>We’re just getting started and will be bringing more DeFi integrations to zk.money over the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>We’re supporting developers creating fully private DeFi experiences using these tools, and we want to hear from you! The public repo for Aztec Connect can be found <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges">here</a>, with documentation found&nbsp;<a href="https://transcendent-marshmallow-2f922f.netlify.app/">here</a>.</p> State of Aztec’s Private&nbsp;Rollup <p>In order to achieve seamless privacy, we’ve made significant improvements to Aztec’s rollup in the last&nbsp;year:</p>  Performance: throughput increase of over 11x; rollup gas efficiency improvement of&nbsp;30%+  UX on L2: chained transactions allows for instant settlement on internal transfers  UX on L1: support for multi-asset DeFi deposits and withdrawals  <p>Further releases will include gas cost reduction via off-chain viewing keys, lower latency, improved UX and security via native Ethereum signatures, and multi-signature wallet&nbsp;support.</p> Towards a Community-Driven Rollup <p>This achievement wouldn’t be possible without the Aztec, Ethereum, and zk communities. More than ever, we are committed to supporting a community-first approach to Ethereum&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>That’s what prompted us to launch Aztec Grants, funding the independent development of DeFi protocol integrations with Aztec Connect. We’re excited to be working in collaboration with the grants programs at Aave, Compound, Element, Lido, and more to expand the privacy ecosystem.</p><p>If you’re a developer interested in building privacy-first applications, please <a href="https://airtable.com/shrvglCZ24jaH73oe">apply for a grant&nbsp;here</a>.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges/tree/master/src/bridges">See here for a repository of Aztec Connect integrations.</a></blockquote><p>We also owe a debt of gratitude to the scientists, researchers, and engineers who are building on Plonk and keeping cryptography secure. With their support and collaboration, the dream of blockchain privacy will soon be a&nbsp;reality.</p> About Aztec&nbsp;Network <p>Aztec Network is the first private zk-rollup on Ethereum, enabling decentralized applications to access privacy and scale. Aztec’s rollup is secured by its industry-standard Plonk proving mechanism used by the leading zero-knowledge scaling projects.</p><p>Aztec’s first-party payments and DeFi aggregation product <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> has supported over 75,000 unique users, 250,000 transactions, and $100 million in transaction volume since its launch in&nbsp;2021.</p> Build with Aztec Connect&nbsp;SDK <p>Are you a developer who wants to bring privacy to your favorite DeFi protocol?

<p>Dear community,<br></p><p>We’re happy to announce that our Zafari incentivized Testnet is resuming its activities with the third wave of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------">Advanced Staking testing</a>!<br></p><p>Please read all the details below carefully to learn more about what is being tested and how to participate.</p> How does Wave 3 of testing work?<br> <p>In this testing round, users will stake test $ZKP tokens (i.e., tokens with no value) to earn:</p>  Test $zZKP rewards, which are computed in a Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP).  10,000 test Panther Reward Points (PRPs) per stake, which can be redeemed for test $zZKP once the protocol’s v1 launches.  <p>By holding onto their test $zZKP in the MASP, users can also continue to accrue additional test PRPs.</p><p>This new test environment will feature an Early Redemption functionality which allows users to withdraw their test $zZKP rewards early by forfeiting test PRP rewards. Withdrawing ahead of time means that users give up any possible additional test PRPs accrued through holding test $zZKP in the MASP.</p><p>$zZKP in the MASP will start accruing rewards in PRP as soon as the stake is created. They will continue to do so even in the period before upgrading to v1, which implements full shielded pool functionalities. This wave of testing also features updated contracts and reward management mechanics (implementing smart contracts), as expected.</p><p>Note that PRPs will only be created as the protocol’s v1 launches. Rewards issued to users will be computed taking into consideration their staking date.</p><p>Wave 3 of testing will proceed as follows:</p>  Staking will become available on July 7th, 14:00 UTC.  The staking period will end on July 9th, 14:00 UTC.  Unstaking of test $ZKP principal will become available on July 10th, 14:00 UTC.  test zZKP rewards will also become available for redemption on July 10th, 14:00 UTC.   Reporting a bug <p>Make sure you read the instructions below, as well as our section on Unaccepted submissions before participating.<br></p><p>To report and be eligible for rewards, do the following once you think you’ve stumbled into a bug:</p>  <a href="https://appuals.com/open-browser-console/">Open your browser console</a>.  Ensure that the Console tab is selected.  Type -/zkp-staking/ into the Filter box to filter out all the failed to load source map warnings.Make sure all logging levels are enabled, including Verbose:<br>    Scroll to the bottom to locate the more detailed errors.  Make sure the window is a decent size, so that it captures a good amount of detail from the errors.  Take one or more screenshots of the window to capture any log messages which might be relevant to the problem in question.  Make sure to include this information in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftCbVmbosspDfFDLMwL5qfDyq4O7bRcijicZKPXLBhISUTGA/viewform">bug report form found here.</a><br>   Unaccepted submissions <p>Avoid grouping multiple bugs into a single report. Please generate multiple reports for any number of issues you find.</p><p>Note that the previous rounds of testing have helped identify several unresolved bugs. Submissions reporting them will therefore not be accepted. All submissions also now need to provide proof of the bugs they’re reporting via an image or video.</p><p>These include:</p>  White screen upon opening the zAssets page.  Pending transactions in MetaMask.  Faucet: transaction failed - None 200, status code ‘404’ (mobile version).  Transaction error: code 32603 + code 404.  Transaction error: Cannot find event in receipt. No StakeCreated event found for this transaction.  Available balance incorrect comma in total balance (balance card).  Double tapping Stake/Unstake buttons produces 2 transactions per one stake.  zAssets page not viewable if connected to networks other than the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.  zAsset link not showing on the navigation bar when &nbsp;connected to networks other than the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.  Incorrect rounding of staked amounts.  Footer line showing at incorrect locations.  White screens when using Safari (browser).  MATIC balance not auto-refreshing.  Progress bar on top of staking tab needs real data.  Auto translator enabled.  Unstaking tab and balance card data showing differences in total rewards.   Moving forward<br> <p>From the Panther team, we'd like to thank you again for your enthusiasm in previous testing rounds. Your feedback has been incredibly helpful in building towards v1 of our protocol and the launch of MASPs.<br></p><p>Advanced Staking is a critical intermediate step between Panther's current state and the release of MASPs. Thanks to it, we can test the dynamics behind creating zAssets and computing rewards in a real-world setting.<br></p><p>We're looking forward to receiving your input!<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/CesareFracassi">Cesare Fracassi</a>, Chief Economist, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/institute">Coinbase Institute</a></p><p>TL;DR: How should we evaluate the recent highs and lows of crypto prices? In taking a market efficiency view, crypto prices are a reflection of the market’s assessment of the future prospects of digital assets. This view can help us understand the historical trends in crypto prices and its correlation with the overall financial markets:</p>  Over the last 5 years, crypto markets saw very large returns due in part to adoption by institutional and retail investors, and the laying of the foundations of&nbsp;web3.  Whereas crypto markets were originally uncorrelated to the financial markets, the correlation has risen sharply since 2020. Thus, the market expects crypto assets to become more and more intertwined with the rest of the financial system.  Nowadays, the risk profile of crypto markets is similar to those of oil prices and technology stocks.  The recent decline in crypto markets can be attributed for ⅔ to worsening macro-factors, and for ⅓ to a weakening of the outlook for cryptocurrencies.   Introduction <p>Over the last eight months, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies went from a peak of $2.9T to a current level of less than $1T, a decline of over two thirds. This is not unusual in crypto markets: Since 2010, total crypto market capitalization experienced a quarterly decline of 20% or more (a typical measure of bear market conditions) nine&nbsp;times.</p><p>Each time a sharp decline in crypto prices occurs, media and expert commentaries usually take one of two&nbsp;forms:</p><p>(i) the “Crypto is dead” response, where crypto is painted as a gigantic Ponzi scheme fueled by the desire not to be left out of great returns (Fear of Missing Out, or FOMO in short) followed by anxiety and despair when prices decline (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt, or FUD in short). The price drop is the sign that the bubble bursted, and we should run for the exits before prices go down to&nbsp;zero.</p><p>(ii) the “HODL” response, where crypto is seen as a groundbreaking technology. Crypto winters and summers are a feature, not a bug, of disruptive innovations, like national banks in the early 18th century, railways in the mid 19th century, and the internet and artificial intelligence in the late 20th century. We should hold and ride through the volatility, as crypto prices will resume their rise in the near&nbsp;future.</p><p>However, neither of these explain both the historical trends we have seen in crypto and how we are seeing the correlation with overall stock markets today. But there is a third way to interpret changes in prices, the “market efficiency” response, where prices are a reflection of the market’s assessment of the future prospects of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Market Efficiency</p><p>Examining the crypto markets based on an understanding of market efficiency can help us interpret the data. For&nbsp;example:</p>  From June 2017 to June 2022, crypto market cap rose 860%, indicating that the outlook about cryptocurrencies today is much brighter than it was back then: The adoption by institutional and retail investors, and the laying of the foundations of web3 (i.e., decentralized finance applications, non-fungible tokens, decentralized identity solutions, tokenization of real assets, and decentralized autonomous organizations) were part of the reason for these exceptional returns.  Since 2020, the correlation between the stock and crypto asset prices has risen significantly: while for the first decade of its existence, bitcoin returns were on average uncorrelated with the performance of the stock market, the relationship increased quickly since the COVID pandemic started. This suggests that the market expects crypto assets to become more and more intertwined with the rest of the financial system, and thus to be exposed to the same macro-economic forces that move the world&nbsp;economy.    In particular, crypto assets today share similar risk profiles to oil commodity prices and technology stocks. Beta is a typical measure of systematic risk for financial assets. A beta of zero means that the asset is uncorrelated with the market. A beta of one means that the asset moves together with the market. A beta of two means that when the stock market rises or falls by 1%, the asset increases or decreases by 2%. The animation below shows that the betas of bitcoin and ethereum have jumped from 0 in 2019, to 1 in 2020–2021, and to 2 today — they are now very similar in risk profile to a more traditional asset, technology stocks. (We wrote about this in our <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/gycMMHJJzrlBYI4zuiCXQ/aa25426f47d6574f7ce3474d3b82207b/Coinbase_Institute_Monthly_Report_-_May_2022.pdf">Coinbase Institute May 2022 Newsletter</a>.)    As the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world recently began to increase interest rates, long-term assets like crypto and tech stocks became heavily discounted and their values dropped rapidly. It might be useful to consider how much of the current decline is due to worsening macroeconomic conditions, as opposed to souring outlook specifically for cryptocurrencies, especially considering the crypto market cap declined over 57% year-to-date in 2022. It’s worth noting that during the same time, the S&amp;P 500 declined 19%, and if macroeconomic conditions were the only cause of the decline, we would have expected crypto assets, with a beta of 2, to drop by about 38%. We can thus roughly estimate that two-thirds of the recent decline in crypto prices can be attributed to macro factors, and one-third to a weakening of the outlook solely for cryptocurrencies. This is similar to what happened during the 2000–2001 dot-com recession, where the S&amp;P 500 declined 29%, and the Nasdaq composite index (composed heavily of tech stocks), with a beta of 1.25, declined 70% from peak to&nbsp;trough.   The Future of Crypto&nbsp;Markets <p>There is one topic that the market-efficiency view is mostly silent about: the direction of crypto prices in the future. The most important pillar of the market efficiency hypothesis is that any traded asset, from stocks to bonds, commodities, and even crypto, incorporates into its price the market’s expectation about the future value of the asset. For example, if the market expects Tesla to sell a very large number of cars in the future, the stock price today will be high to reflect that expectation. If Tesla meets that expectation in the future, its stock price will not rise, because it already incorporated that event into its price&nbsp;today.</p><p>Similarly, then, changes in prices occur only when there are changes in the expectation of the future outlook about the assets. Thus, according to the market-efficiency view of crypto markets, only changes in the outlook of the crypto industry relative to what is already expected will bring changes to&nbsp;prices.</p><p>NOTE: The views and opinions expressed herein are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Coinbase or its employees and summarizes information and articles with respect to cryptocurrencies or related topics that the author believes may be of interest.

Check out our <a href="https://github.com/scala-network/MobileMiner">mobile&nbsp;miner</a>!)</p> Shortlink <p>We have implemented a cool feature called “shortlink”, which allows you to define your own personal URL that you can share with your friends, family or users and makes it easy to receive&nbsp;XLA.</p>Shortlink example How much does it&nbsp;cost? <p>It’s totally free! There are no hidden&nbsp;fees.</p><p>You simply send and receive XLA like any other transaction on any other wallet, just like you are used&nbsp;to.</p> Can I make Scallet my main&nbsp;wallet? <p>We don’t recommend it.

  Another month of non-stop work for the Panther team has just gone by. We've successfully finished our first DeFi integration proof-of-concept, moved forward with Advanced Staking testing, and much more.

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>Believe it or not, it’s July already, and we’re more than happy to share that we continue to meet milestones in our development. Our first proof-of-concept for a DeFi integration is complete, we’re moving forward with research that will empower the zero-knowledge community, and partnership opportunities keep arising everywhere.</p><p>Let’s jump right into our monthly update.</p> Tech and Product  Advanced Staking testing <p>We’ve constantly reiterated the importance of Advanced Staking as a predecessor to Panther’s v1. This is because the primitives used in Advanced Staking will be key to designing and building Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pools.</p><p>Zafari, our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b/">incentivized testing program</a>, continues to provide invaluable feedback for our upcoming Advanced Staking program.</p><p>In addition to last month’s findings, testers managed to catch a few urgent and high-priority bugs, as well as other lower-priority items throughout. While feedback has now slowed down as the system has already been thoroughly explored, we haven’t. Our team is hard at work fixing the last batch of bugs, and we will soon be able to swiftly roll out Advanced Staking on Polygon.</p> DeFi integration <p>While Advanced Staking progresses, we have successfully finished the first proof-of-concept of a DeFi integration. Through it, users can utilize Panther to access DeFi privately, interacting with protocols in a way very similar to what they’re used to.</p><p>The importance of a DeFi-compatible privacy solution cannot be overstated! Enabling the Multi-Asset Shielded Pools to augment DeFi as a whole with privacy lays the foundation for bringing trust to DeFi via Panther’s flexible disclosure capabilities.</p><p>More news on this, pronto.</p> Community and business development  Released our one-pager <p>As builders of a pioneering blockchain privacy protocol, we are tasked with introducing people not only to the need for privacy, but to its solution as well. Since this happens almost on a daily basis, we decided to create the most digestible (but still thorough!) explanation of Panther to this day.</p><p>We’ve redesigned the <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.pdf">Panther One-Pager</a>. It contains all the central points to grasp why PriFi is deeply necessary and how Panther is the perfect solution for enabling it, within a single standard sheet of paper!</p> New Panther Blog &amp; Panther Academy <p>The <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/">Panther Blog</a> went through a complete UX redesign. We’ve organized content by categories, removed cluttering elements from its interface, and added a dark mode, in addition to many other noticeable improvements. The Panther Blog is now easier to navigate and friendlier than ever! Our re-vamp also touched on technical aspects that make our blog easier to find through search engines and news feeds. All our precious existing content is still available with the same URLs for you to share.</p><p>Part of the reason to put in the effort and redesign our blog came from our plans to launch a valuable initiative from Panther for the crypto community: The <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/tag/academy/">Panther Academy</a>. Our goal with the Academy is to improve accessibility to high-quality crypto education, even for subjects that could be considered basic by our audience of mainly hardcore privacy enthusiasts. Those interested in diving deeper into crypto, DeFi, and privacy can now come and learn about these subjects from us.</p><p>Our first Panther Academy article is already out and tackles <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">private crypto transactions</a>. Don’t forget to give it a read and share it with your privacy-curious friends!</p> Unofficial local language Twitter accounts <p>Panther Ambassadors have been doing a more than impressive job at spreading the Panther Gospel to non-English-speaking countries. We now have three unofficial Twitter accounts; in <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherES">Español</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherTR">Türkçe</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherFR">Français</a>! </p><p>Here’s to all of our amazing ambassadors.</p> 12k followers in CMC Gravity <p>In order to kickstart our <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/gravity/profile/PantherProtocol">CoinMarketCap Gravity</a> following, we hosted a <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1533888810991370240">giveaway</a> offering a $2500 $ZKP prize pool. Three weeks later, we can say with no doubt that it was a success.</p><p>Panther has attained the number one spot in engagement growth in CoinMarketCap’s blogging platform! That’s a pretty good reason to celebrate, don’t you think?</p><p>Panther’s CMC Gravity account now has over 12,000 followers, growing by almost a thousand daily. If you’re not among them, you know what to do: <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/gravity/profile/PantherProtocol">follow us now</a>!</p> zTalks #2 <p>The second episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mXHeo2FvUQ">Panther zTalks</a> touched on multiple intriguing subjects: </p>  The role of cryptography experts in Panther  Why we <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-joins-zprize-and-industry-leaders-to-further-the-zero-knowledge-industry-391a494a58d6/">foster the zero-knowledge field</a>  How significant is Advanced Staking in Panther’s roadmap  <p>… and so much more.</p><p>Our Senior Architect, Adam Spiers, was a new addition to our team members’ panel for this episode. Show it some love, and remember to subscribe to our Youtube account!</p> Events  Oliver and Mike in Consensus 2022 <p>Our Co-Founder and CEO Oliver Gale and Mike Chan, Head of Marketing, were present at <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022/">Consensus 2022</a>, the largest crypto and blockchain event worldwide. The conference hosting 500+ speakers from within and outside the cryptosphere took place in Austin, Texas, from June 9th to 12th.</p><p>Lots of partnerships talks, great panels about privacy, and walking around in Panther swag ensued.</p>Oliver and Mike in full Panther style. Anish and Saif at NFT NYC <p>On <a href="http://www.nft.nyc/">NFT NYC</a>’s 4th edition, Panther was well-represented by two heavy hitters of our tech team: Anish Mohammed, our Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist, and Saif Akhtar, our Head of Product. The conference featured 1500 speakers and over 14k attendees. </p><p>Why are we attending NFT conferences, you might be asking? Well, because privacy for NFTs is definitely necessary, creating a fertile land for Panther to explore.</p><p>To learn why, check out this great <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginalOlii/status/1540106469013610503">thread</a> by CEO Oliver Gale.</p> Features &amp; Media  Anish AMA with Bittrex &amp; interview on XT Cast <p>Bittrex was one of our first exchange partners to list $ZKP. They invited our CTO Anish for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz2LnHGn3Wk">AMA on Panther</a>, where he elaborated on Panther’s goals, development, and our approach to decentralization, among other very relevant aspects. Make sure to check it out!</p><p>Anish was also invited as a guest in the brand-new <a href="https://youtu.be/onqbP1Dh7EI">XT Cast</a>, specifically tackling how Panther is enabling privacy and trust through $ZKP.</p> Anish’s lecture at Cerberus Capital Management <p>Cerberus Capital Management, a leading global firm in alternative investing with around $60 billion in managed assets, invited our CTO on June 30th for a keystone lecture on “The Future of DeFi – Beyond the Crash”.</p> Oliver on Yahoo! Finance <p>As of late, crypto has become <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-ultimate-irony-thoughts-on-the-state-of-our-markets-1de4a5c8bec3/">increasingly correlated</a> with the stock market’s movements. These, in turn, are undeniably linked to interest rates set by the Federal Reserve. Yahoo! Finance’s article on <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/impact-did-fed-interest-rate-152256883.html">the impact of the interest rate hikes on crypto</a> counted on the expert opinion of none other than Oliver Gale, our Co-Founder and CEO. In his thought-provoking words:</p><blockquote>“Cryptoassets are experiencing the fastest growth of any technology industry in history – almost twice the pace at which the internet was adopted in the 1990s. Despite a bump in the road here, this trend is still intact and will resume in the next year or two. For now, we have to bide our time until inflation is brought down.”</blockquote><p>Worth a read!</p> Hirings <p>This month, we hired new Panthers for the following positions:</p>  Head of Compliance  Content Writer &amp; Social Media Manager  Head of Community  <p>Several roles remain open on our <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol">Angel.co page</a>:</p>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2172598-graphic-designer">Graphic Designer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2204245-applied-mathematician">Applied Mathematician</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2221049-blockchain-architect">Blockchain Architect</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2204246-cryptographic-engineer">Cryptographic Engineer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2142601-cryptography-internship">Cryptography Internship</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2221050-cryptography-researcher-zero-knowledge-proofs">Cryptography Researcher (Zero-Knowledge Proofs)</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227585-full-stack-developer">Full-Stack Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227586-lead-front-end-developer">Lead Front-end Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2109231-machine-learning-internship">Machine Learning Internship</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227587-senior-solidity-developer">Senior Solidity Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2198464-defi-research-analyst">DeFi Research Analyst</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2009427-product-marketing-intern">Product Marketing Intern</a>  <p>If you wish to work with us or know someone who might be a good fit, please apply right away!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

Happy building!</p><p>By JM Cho, software engineer for Coinbase&nbsp;Wallet</p><p>Last year, the NFT market experienced its best year yet — generating over $23 billion in trading volume with a floor market cap of <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/2021-dapp-industry-report">$16.7 billion</a> for the Top 100 NFT collections. With demand growing, NFT minting sites quickly became one of most popular types of dapps built in the crypto space. In comparison to projects launched on marketplaces like OpenSea, custom minting sites offered projects the ability to provide their community with a customized minting experience and retain full control over their distribution timeline and royalties.</p><p>For the teams behind these projects, creating an NFT minting site creates an opportunity to showcase their engineering capabilities, share important details about the project, and more deeply engage their community. However, the resulting demand for web3 developers who can ship end-to-end NFT minting experiences has far outpaced the number of resources that can teach how to build these dapps from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Enter: Coinbase’s NFT Dapp Starter&nbsp;Kit.</p><p>The NFT Dapp Starter Kit reflects Coinbase’s commitment to empowering developers by making it easier and faster to build for web3. This open-source kit embraces the collaborative nature of web3 by enabling developers of any level to easily launch new NFT projects. Compatible with both the Ethereum Mainnet and EVM-compatible chains, this resource will be particularly helpful for those who want to create a full-stack NFT project but lack experience writing Solidity or integrating a smart contract to a front-end.</p><p>Features included in this starter&nbsp;kit:</p>  Frontend web app integrated with a gas-efficient, audited ERC-721 smart&nbsp;contract  Built-in multi-wallet modal to enable users to easily connect to your minting site with Coinbase Wallet or other major self-custody wallets  NFT minting front-end component that allows users to specify mint&nbsp;number  Explorer to view minted collection and tokens owned by connected user  Gas-efficient pre-sale feature using merkle tree allowlists  Token art pre-reveal feature and scripts to make this process&nbsp;seamless  Support for Royalties on NFT transfers (EIP-2981 standard)  Ability to reserve tokens for gifting or&nbsp;airdrops  Art engine to create generative artwork and metadata with built-in&nbsp;examples  Easy-to-run scripts to simplify various NFT contract interactions  Hardhat unit tests to ensure correctness of&nbsp;contract  Clear documentation and walkthrough tutorial of the kit and how to use&nbsp;it  <p>Check out the<a href="https://github.com/Coinbase/nft-dapp-starter-kit"> NFT Dapp Starter Kit</a> on GitHub and watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvkO9iqz1oQ">video tutorial </a>for instructions on how to start building your dapp. As always, we welcome your feedback or ideas in the Github repository for our team’s consideration and look forward to hearing from the community.</p><p>Happy Building!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/introducing-our-nft-dapp-starter-kit-for-developers-fe2fd02990c5">Introducing our NFT Dapp Starter Kit for Developers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: As we continue to grow our presence in the UK and Europe, we have met with policymakers in the UK, established a regional Centre of Excellence in Ireland, strengthened operations in DACH with our first hire in Switzerland, and are expanding our footprint across additional European&nbsp;markets.</p><p>By Nana Murugesan,VP Business Development and International&nbsp;; Tom Duff Gordon, VP International Policy</p><p>At Coinbase, our mission is to promote economic freedom, and we believe the best way to do that is by increasing crypto adoption in the world. That is why international expansion is fundamentally mission-aligned and continues to be a company priority.</p><p>As part of our recently announced <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/lighting-up-the-map-how-coinbase-plans-to-scale-globally-7bdc2783ff63">two-pronged growth strategy</a>, we are driving a concerted effort to strengthen our presence in Europe. This week, Coinbase CEO and Co-Founder, Brian Armstrong, was on the ground with other members of our executive team in London and Dublin and to meet with policymakers, partners, and key journalists. Brian also hosted our first-ever “Live from London” companywide global all&nbsp;hands.</p><p>It is great to hear about the UK’s ambitions to become a leading global hub for crypto assets, and we are encouraged by the thoughtful conversations with policymakers on how to turn that aspiration into a reality. The UK is currently the largest international market for Coinbase and we are excited by the momentum there as we look to grow our business.</p><p>Yesterday, the EU reached a landmark agreement on the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation, “MiCA”, delivering the most comprehensive regulatory framework in the world and a single rule-book across 27 countries. This will provide important legal and regulatory certainty to the market, and raise standards across the industry. This is exciting — a harmonized single set of rules for the entire EU will enable us to invest, accelerate, and scale our growth efforts across the entire&nbsp;bloc.</p><p>Furthermore, the EU took a major step forward by reaching a sensible deal for implementation of the Travel Rule to tackle financial crimes and the transfer of illicit funds. The agreement takes a risk-based approach to verification requirements for crypto asset transfers to and from Self Hosted Wallets (SHWs). This is crucial for the protection of privacy and the development of Web3, for which SHWs are the&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>The EU is setting measured regulatory standards for crypto assets, which should provide renewed impetus for other jurisdictions to reflect on their own approaches to regulation and Travel Rule implementation.</p><p>During market downturns, the temptation can be to shy away from international expansion. We first entered the UK and EU during the bear market in 2015, a move that paid off significantly during the bull run a few years from then. We’ll keep building around the world, and doing everything we can to grow the cryptoeconomy.</p><p>We’re already on the ground in the UK, Ireland, and Germany. Additionally, we are in the process of expanding in France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. In all of these markets, our goal is to launch the Coinbase suite of retail, institutional, and developer products.</p><p>In Switzerland, we are delighted that Peter Hofmann is going to establish our in-market presence, within the Central European build-out that we recently embarked on, spearheaded by DACH Regional Director Sascha Rangoonwala, based in our Germany&nbsp;office.</p><p>In Ireland, we established a regional Centre of Excellence (CoE) to drive business outcomes by working closely with regulators and internal teams including PED, Compliance, Legal and Policy. This new team will be led by Lory Kehoe, Head of EMEA, Market Operations.</p><p>We are also investing in the development of the crypto ecosystem. Coinbase Ventures, one of the most active corporate VCs by deal count, has invested in close to a dozen companies just in the UK including Euler, a lending protocol, and Qredo, a cross-chain protocol for asset managers and traders active in the digital asset markets. Coinbase Ventures is consistently evaluating investments to add to their portfolio, as well as potential acquisitions.</p><p>While markets will always be volatile, we believe the future is bright — and we’re excited to keep building that future with our customers and partners across the&nbsp;region.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Nana &amp;&nbsp;Tom</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/building-across-europe-c4ef51f62509">Building Across Europe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Findora made a <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/navigating-nft-nyc-with-findora-727a1c06cbc3">good showing</a> at NFT NYC and ETHNewYork this year. We had the privilege to talk to many exciting and innovative projects, and we’re looking forward to partnering with them going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>The City That Never Sleeps always leaves you with a lot to look back on, but here are our main takeaways:</p> Forecast Calls for&nbsp;SBTs <p><a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html">Soulbound tokens</a>, or non-transferrable NFTs, look like they will be a big part of the NFT space going forward. They were certainly a hot topic among attendees at NFT&nbsp;NYC.</p><p>SBTs have many use cases because there are many financial applications in TradFi that aren’t transferable e.g. credit card numbers and bank accounts. SBTs mimick that&nbsp;utility.</p><p>SBTs may also play a huge role in identity verification. However, to safely do so, users will need to be able to selectively disclose only some information while keeping other data shielded. Users won’t want to reveal everything about themselves every time the token is used. Currently, there are no privacy solutions for SBTs, but the kind of selective disclosure they require is exactly what Findora can&nbsp;provide.</p> NFTs are Finding Their&nbsp;Utility <p>Apes, Lions, and Goblins are great…but we’re getting hyped&nbsp;out.</p><p>There were a lot of projects focusing on the less sexy applications of NFT technology like licensing. Other examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Ticket verification  Wallet verification  Linking real assets to NFTs e.g. real estate, supercars, trading cards,&nbsp;etc.  <p><a href="https://tokenproof.xyz/">Tokenproof</a>, <a href="https://0xmoon.io/">0xmoon.io</a>, and <a href="https://www.chainpass.xyz/">Chainpass</a> are good examples of projects working hard to make NFTs useful as passes at&nbsp;events.</p><p>There is a lot of creativity and imagination in the space as projects race to be the first to implement a new NFT use&nbsp;case.</p><p>NFTs are evolving from shiny collections to real-world applications; it’s a sign of the space maturing. We’re excited to see how NFTs will evolve and how they can change the day-to-day lives of people around the&nbsp;world.</p> ZK Privacy Is Getting More&nbsp;Popular <p>There were other zero-knowledge projects present, and while they may not be as far along as Findora is, their presence signals a general interest in ZK technology and privacy for NFTs. It’s increasingly recognized that privacy is a necessary feature of any financial or blockchain system, and there was a lot of interest in Findora&nbsp;events.</p><p>Despite short notice, our ZK-Bistro event was a huge success. We were able to meet many exciting teams looking to integrate ZK technology into their projects and who were interested in the Findora Foundation <a href="https://www.findora.foundation/">grant program</a>. We’re excited for the partnerships that will come out of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Warren Paul Anderson, CEO of Discreet Labs, gave a talk on the importance of privacy noting that privacy doesn’t not equal secrecy. Secrecy means never revealing information. Privacy implies you want to reveal information — but only to those who need to&nbsp;know.</p><p>He observed that major brands like Apple are launching campaigns to promote privacy and that Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever or whatever he is, most likely wanted bitcoin to be private but didn’t have the technological ability to accomplish it.</p><p>But with the introduction of zero-knowledge proofs, on-chain privacy on public ledgers is possible.</p>Warren Paul Anderson giving a talk on privacy at NYC&nbsp;NFT<p>A number of projects came up to him after his talk to understand how they could integrate Findora’s privacy tech for things like private payroll and protecting simple payments.</p> “Wen Regulatory Clarity?” <p>There was a lot of talk about future securities regulations and how to prepare for them. L1s, like Findora, will need to self-regulate and make it clear to users and regulators what their tokens are&nbsp;for.</p><p>They’ll also need to make sure user data and IDs are protected.</p><p>Smart contractors will likely be licensed the same way building contractors or insurance agents are licensed now. There will be some sort of licensing board that allows teams to go from project to project writing smart contracts.</p> Teams Need Better Documentation <p>Deploying NFTs isn’t necessarily complicated, but that doesn’t make it easy. There were a number of issues during the ETHNewYork Hackathon that showed basic documentation is still needed when talented teams couldn’t fix&nbsp;bugs.</p><p>Projects need to make sure their documentation is in order and easy to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Findora has some of the best documentation in the Zk space (you can find our NFT documentation <a href="http://wiki.findora.org/docs/developers/evm/Mint%20NFTs/p1_deploy_nft/">here</a>) but it can always be better. Please feel free to join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/aPuyZd8mBJ">Discord</a> and make suggestions on how we can improve in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>We got a lot of feedback on what hackers want at a hackathon and hacker house and we have some exciting plans in the works for the next crypto convention!</p> Looking Ahead <p>NFTs will be a big part of the future and the space in 5 years won’t look anything like it does today. But no one really can predict the future…that’s a big takeaway from 2022 in&nbsp;general.</p><p>One of our biggest takeaways is that energy is still high even if markets are low. Many projects are exploring NFT use cases and building solutions. They’re looking ahead, not looking&nbsp;back.</p><p>Projects are working to integrate NFTs into the legal system and onboard them with institutions. Coding is the easy part; projects are now solving for the human factor, starting the long, hard process of adoption.</p><p>Privacy will be a big part of that adoption process because it is an essential function that institutions and individuals require. We’re excited to keep building in the space with teams from all around the&nbsp;world.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findoras-takeaways-from-nftnyc-2022-2a8ff34b5d48">Findora’s Takeaways from NFTNYC 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Privacy in crypto is an ongoing major theme, shaping innovations and driving discussions in the ecosystem. <br></p><p>The idea that all cryptocurrencies are private is fairly attractive and a narrative that has been sold to newcomers countlessly. After all, who would not want full control over their information and guaranteed coin security?<br></p><p>As enticing as the concept of default privacy in crypto sounds, it has (with exceptions) always been nothing but a common misconception, particularly on public blockchain networks, which represent the majority in the crypto space. Therefore, it is imperative to find a solution to interact on the blockchain without giving away sensitive, personal information. It’s also worth noting that a sustainable privacy solution can only be achieved by taking back control over our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/philosophy-legality-and-economics-of-privacy-how-privacy-spans-through-most-areas-of-our-lives-1b0d48945291/">privacy</a> while remaining within the boundaries of legislation and compliance.<br></p><p>In this article, we will explore the concept of on-chain privacy, why most cryptocurrencies are not private, and how this takes a toll on coin security. We will look into privacy coins and the validity of their claims towards creating private blockchains. Finally, we’ll explore the viability of achieving privacy in a <a href="https://www.leewayhertz.com/cross-chain-defi-technology/">cross-chain</a> interoperable DeFi ecosystem while achieving regulatory compliance.<br></p> Why blockchain anonymity is (for the most part) a myth <p>When Bitcoin emerged a decade ago, it promised an idea of pseudonymity and privacy. Naturally, people were excited about the ability to transact without giving up their personal information, unlike in traditional financial services. <br></p><p>At the time, few people noticed an inherent contradiction: On one side, the supposed pseudo-anonymity stood, and on the other, never-seen-before transparency was the major selling point of Bitcoin.<br></p>Bitcoin traceability diagram (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy">Source</a>)<p>Every transaction and activity related to interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain is recorded on an immutable ledger. No one can change the records afterward, nor could anyone conspire to alter the ledger. Yet, the Bitcoin blockchain has more than an unalterable bookkeeping function— it is <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/blocks">completely public</a>. Whereas banks can only reveal a statement to its account owner and maybe law enforcement, on the Bitcoin network, everyone can access all the information stored on the blockchain. <br></p><p>Taking this into consideration, “are Bitcoin transactions traceable?” is an incomplete question at best.<br></p> How do cryptocurrency transactions get traced?<br> <p>Given a Bitcoin address, you can check every transaction that ever involved it. You can also easily see how much Bitcoin it holds. Although the faces behind the addresses are hidden, every transaction is public. And, while Bitcoin is often lauded as a completely private and anonymous way to transact, there are ways that users' identities can be revealed. For example, if someone's identity is linked to their Bitcoin address, any transactions they make can be <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy">traced</a> back to them.<br></p><p>While chain analysis is something anti-crime organizations perform to take down criminals, there are also cases of users’ identities being tracked in the most mundane settings. A typical case occurs because virtual asset service providers (<a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-are-virtual-asset-service-providers-vasp/">VASPs</a>) like crypto exchanges are required to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Any transaction in or out of a crypto exchange wallet leaves a clear trail connecting all self-custody wallets to their user’s identity. This opens a door for law enforcement to subpoena the exchange for their KYC records and the user's transactions can be made transparent.<br></p><p>While Bitcoin promised anonymity, it could only deliver pseudonymity. Individuals who wanted to keep their transactions fully private searched for and developed methods to stay private, leading to the rise of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">Bitcoin mixers and coin tumblers</a>. In essence, the transparent nature of Bitcoin made it impossible for anyone to use the network privately.<br></p> Why are blockchain networks open and transparent? Why this is good for coin security? <p>Most cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks are open and transparent, for reasons that may surprise you. The founding idea behind Bitcoin, the mother of all cryptocurrencies and blockchains, is decentralization. And the concept of decentralization has been thrown around in crypto-centric circles enough for many to not know what it means anymore.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/17/bitcoins-value-depends-on-its-decentralization/">Decentralization</a>, in simple terms, means dissolving central authority and giving the right of governance to the stakeholders involved in the system, giving full control back to the ordinary user. <br></p><p>The idea of decentralization is quite familiar to how democracies work where instead of a single ruler making all the decisions, a government is mainly composed of an executive, legislative, and judiciary power keeping a check on each other. Similarly, decentralization takes the power from a single centralized authority and distributes it among all network participants keeping a check on each other. <br></p><p>Bitcoin is decentralized, as no company or group can lay claim to being decision-makers on the network. Unlike banks and governments, no one can freeze a person's access to the blockchain. However, this lack of a central authority poses a need for accountability of transactions since there are no governing bodies to verify them.<br></p><p>The Bitcoin network maintains its miners honest by issuing rewards to those that agree on an immutable network state. However, by design, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp">miners</a> alone shouldn't be trusted to verify transactions, as they’re likely to act in a way that maximizes their profit. Therefore, the network was made transparent and public so that anyone with access to the Internet could run a <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/academy/en/lessons/what-is-a-bitcoin-node/">Bitcoin node</a> and personally confirm if the miners' verification claims were true. <br></p><p>In this way, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that the radical transparency of public blockchains is both a feature and a bug. But doesn’t change the fact that It is secured with the same level of security employed by banks, the military, and virtual private networks (VPNs) to encrypt their systems: the 256-bit SHA hash algorithms. However, SHA hash functions provide each transaction a distinct fingerprint that cannot be reversed, unlike encryption, which can be decoded. Meaning that it grants your coin security.<br><br></p>Bitcoin – a shared public ledger. (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works">Source</a>) Need for privacy coins <p>Privacy coins were born as a next step in the evolution of cryptocurrency. <br></p><p>Bitcoin’s creator(s) never had access to the technology necessary to make transactions that were fully private possible. And, in their defense, “are Bitcoin transactions traceable” could’ve been taken as a silly question before the development of chain analysis tools and in an early stage of the network. <br></p><p>As soon as these standards were reached, new initiatives to restore true control over information to the average user and counterbalance the excess of transparency in the crypto space emerged. The earliest private blockchains such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/08/03/satoshi-nakamoto-collaborator-says-his-bitcoin-fork-zcash-should-go-proof-of-stake-and-wind-down-its-carbon-footprint/?sh=610aa2d47449">Zcash</a> were forked from the Bitcoin network. They adhered to the fundamental aspects of blockchain technology and the solutions that cryptocurrencies offered, but every similarity ended there. <br></p><p>Private blockchain networks didn’t take the path of open-ledger technology with all transactions open to the public along with receivers' and senders' addresses, amount of coins transferred, history of all transactions associated with addresses, etc. They, on the other hand, enabled users to conceal all these details.<br></p><p>Privacy-focused blockchains utilize privacy settings and advanced technologies like ring signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, and stealth addresses. Some of them have been largely successful at maintaining their users’ privacy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-knowledge proofs</a>, one of the most exciting technologies used in them, ensure that you can see that a transaction was successful but know nothing else about it –which, as you will learn, can have many applications.</p> Examples and comparison of privacy coins <p>The most popular privacy coins include Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and Secret (SCRT). Other popular options are Beam, Grin, Verge, and Horizon (ZEN). These cryptocurrencies use different technologies and cryptographic protocols to keep their users anonymous.<br></p><p>Out of all privacy coins, Monero and Zcash are the most well-known and have the highest market cap. Let’s have a look at these top two privacy coins and how they differ in terms of technology to enable privacy. <br></p>Comparison between Monero, Zcash, and Dash. (<a href="https://medium.com/@tabul8tor/privacy-coins-monero-dash-and-zcash-compared-686fdae6c0ba">Source</a>) Monero <p>Monero (XMR) has made a name for itself in the crypto space as a leader in the private cryptocurrency space. The network uses ring signatures and stealth addresses to hide the identities of both parties in a transaction, as well as Ring Confidential Transactions (<a href="https://unblock.net/ringct-vs-zk-snark/">RingCT</a>) to hide the amount involved in any transaction.<br></p><p>Unlike some of its competitors, Monero is a private-by-default blockchain. Although some groups have proclaimed to have cracked Monero's technology, most of those claims are largely disputed by the blockchain community.<br></p> Zcash <p>Forked from Bitcoin, Zcash famously <a href="https://nakamoto.com/zcash-the-https-of-blockchains/">claims</a> to be “HTTPS if Bitcoin stands for HTTP”. Using advanced cryptography, Zcash allows its users to shield their transactions. Its zero-knowledge proof setup also facilitates shielded transactions, allowing users to send and receive coins without revealing their addresses to third parties.<br></p><p>Zcash’s ZK proofs also hide transaction amounts, adding an extra layer of privacy. Its technology is widely used in the crypto space today, adopted by many as a transparent way to access privacy. Like Monero, the network has been successful at keeping its users’ privacy.</p> Private but flawed: The drawbacks of private blockchains and privacy coins <p>Most privacy coins are true to their promise of anonymity, but it comes at a huge opportunity cost. In the past couple of years, the rise of decentralized financial services (DeFi) and Web3 has clouded the crypto space at large. Built on the ethos of cypherpunks and leveraging blockchain technology, the DeFi ecosystem offers almost all of the financial services seen in traditional finance, but without trusted third parties or middlemen.<br></p><p>But there's a caveat: the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">DeFi ecosystem</a> at large is built on top of public blockchain networks. The same blockchain networks that antagonize private transactions or privacy in general. Privacy coins, on the other hand, offer top-notch privacy but lag behind in terms of DeFi innovations. <br></p><p>Furthermore, building a DeFi ecosystem on privacy coin networks would be like reinventing the wheel. Building a new DeFi ecosystem in silos rather than fixing privacy on existing DeFi carries along a range of complexities such as attracting new capital, training developers, fixing the same old <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/understanding-ethereums-scalability-problems-and-the-solution-on-the-horizon/">scalability issues</a>, etc.<br></p><p>The combination of complexities involved in building a new DeFi ecosystem, along with the composability issues in the existing DeFi ecosystem severely limits the prospects of private blockchains. This limits users’ privacy to mere simple wallet-A-to-wallet-B transactions, while missing out on financial services such as lending, borrowing, yield farming, stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, and <a href="https://defillama.com/top-protocols">many more</a>. <br></p> Regulatory compliance<br> <p>Another major drawback of privacy coins is regulatory compliance. Even though privacy coins allow users to hide their sensitive information from public view, it then becomes tricky for them to prove they’re compliant, or to do so without disclosing all their information..<br></p><p>Solution offering privacy without achieving regulatory compliance will always end up in a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/regulators-dial-up-the-heat-dash-zec-and-monero-reach-boiling-point">tussle with regulators</a>. This creates the need for a privacy solution that achieves regulatory compliance through voluntary, selective disclosures.<br></p> Panther Protocol: driving interchain privacy with compliance<br> <p>The Panther Protocol prides itself as an end-to-end solution to privacy in Web3 and DeFi. The protocol also seeks to aid financial institutions as they aim for regulatory-compliant participation in decentralized finance. Panther combines the power of blockchain privacy with transparency, restoring trust in the system without sacrificing privacy.<br></p><p>Panther adopts <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-a-cypherpunk-f9f72a0f5bcd/">zk-SNARKs</a> cryptography, allowing users to perform shielded transactions across DeFi platforms with zero-knowledge proofs. Through a powerful multi-asset vault, the average cryptocurrency user can deposit their coins into Panther's vaults and mint a corresponding amount in zAssets (zero-knowledge, fully collateralized versions of the deposit). These zAssets support interoperability, allowing the user to move them across different blockchains and transact privately on public networks.<br></p> Panther protocol vs privacy coins <p>Panther's moat is in providing privacy in DeFi while allowing users to achieve compliance without sharing underlying data. Panther allows users to generate zero-knowledge reports to voluntarily disclose parts or their full transaction history with select counterparties.<br></p><p>Furthermore, Panther <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9/">stands out</a> from the crowd because it provides privacy across several blockchain networks. When users deposits assets into Panther, they break the on-chain link but continue to perform on-chain activities privately using Panther's <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/minting-and-burning-zassets-a-semi-technical-deep-dive-18dea602a859/">zAssets</a>.<br></p><p>Panther’s vision is to provide privacy features and power of choice to the entire DeFi ecosystem, in which users have complete control of their data and an ability to reveal as much or as little as they want, to whomever they want, at all times.</p> So, are Bitcoin transactions traceable? Yes, very much. <p>Privacy on public blockchain networks is a myth, with the most popular cryptocurrencies only able to offer pseudonymity due to their transparency. Privacy coins have sprung up to fill the void, but their solutions do not make room for compliance or offer advanced financial services.<br></p><p>For a true solution to this dilemma, the crypto ecosystem needs to combine privacy, access to DeFi, selective transparency, and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/interoperable-privacy-building-privacy-bridges-to-all-of-defi-2eaa89c9c7ac/">interoperability</a>. Every attempt that fails to meet any of these requirements will either result in a siloed ecosystem, lack of public interest, or in further violations to users’ privacy. Private chains, even if they support smart contracts, are therefore not a solution to the need for privacy across the blockchain scene.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Staking your DOT just got a whole lot easier with Polkadot’s new staking dashboard. This new interface offers an intuitive, user-friendly alternative to the Polkadot-JS Apps developer tool for DOT holders who want to stake natively on Polkadot.</p><p>The Polkadot ecosystem is getting a long overdue upgrade to its staking experience for less-technical DOT holders. The new <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard">staking dashboard</a>, demonstrated today for the first time at <a href="https://decoded.polkadot.network/">Polkadot Decoded</a>, provides a simplified and streamlined interface to give users a more intuitive staking experience. Coupled with the expected launch of <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">nomination pools</a> (currently live on Kusama only), the new dashboard eliminates the need for newer and less-technical DOT holders to stake via third-party staking service providers.</p><p>The dashboard is now available for the community to try out in beta, with several features to continue improving the staking experience planned for future updates.</p><p>Polkadot uses a variant of proof of stake called Nominated Proof-of-Stake, or NPoS, which enables DOT holders to help secure the network by selecting validators and staking their tokens to receive rewards. In addition to improving the user experience, the new staking dashboard is also designed to encourage more participation with native staking directly on the Relay Chain rather than using third-party applications and custodial services, helping ensure the network remains secure and decentralized.</p> Polkadot Staking Dashboard Beta <p>It’s now possible to manage all Polkadot staking functions through the staking dashboard. The interface works by connecting to your existing Polkadot wallet, with support for the Polkadot-JS Extension and Talisman for now, and support for Subwallet coming soon. Additionally, read-only accounts are supported, allowing you to connect any account on a read-only basis to track your staking activity. The dashboard currently has support for Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend networks.</p><p>The staking dashboard currently offers the following features and functionality:</p>  Research, favorite, and nominate your choice of validators  See your payouts history thanks to an opt-in Subscan API integration  Support for nomination pools (currently live on Kusama only)  Handy definitions for staking terminology  Support for read-only accounts on mobile devices  Extrinsic-related data fetched directly from RPC node for better decentralization  Network-wide staking metrics   App walkthrough  Overview <p>The Overview tab provides information about the state of the network, including the cumulative supply of DOT being staked globally and the number of nominators on the network earning rewards. There’s also information on your staking statistics, such as the amount you have staked vs your free unstaked balance and an overview of your recent staking payouts. The announcements section features recent news on the network’s staking parameters that may affect your staking positions.</p> Staking <p>You can view all the relevant information about your staking activities at a glance under the Staking section. The ‘Stake’ tab provides an overview of your current staking setup and lets you start or stop nominating, adjust the DOT amount bonded, choose and adjust your selected validators, and select your payout destination. The ‘Payouts’ tab shows insights on your recent history of staking payouts.</p> Validators <p>The ‘Validators’ tab allows you to see an overview of network validators and relevant statistics that could affect your nomination choices. You can sort validators by commission rate and exclude inactive validators, oversubscribed and blocked validators, validators charging 100% commission, and validators without an on-chain identity. Once you’ve identified your favorite validators, you can pin them to save them in the ‘Favorites’ tab for easier reference and selection.</p> Get started with the Staking Dashboard <p>Go to the <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard">Staking Dashboard</a> to get started. Then, select ‘Connect’ to link an account from the compatible wallet extensions including Talisman and Polkadot-JS. Select ‘Read Only Accounts’ to import any account address directly into the dashboard.</p><p>Make sure your controller account and reward destination are set, then you’re ready to set up or modify your staking preferences. If you’re not familiar with any terms along the way, click the (i) to access the Staking Assistant.</p> Coming soon to the Staking Dashboard <p>The staking dashboard is a work in progress. There are two milestones active on Github [<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/milestone/5">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/milestone/4">here</a>] at the time of writing aimed at getting the codebase production-ready and feature complete — so users can expect changes and improvements across the board.</p><p>In addition to improving the existing code, a range of other validator discovery improvements including a search bar, a validator metrics card, fairer nomination generation, and integration of the validator selection algorithm are on the agenda before the initial release. High-priority items like proxy account support and SubWallet extension support are also on the near-term roadmap.</p><p>With this first-class staking portal, the community now has an easy, modern, and advanced interface to stake directly on the Polkadot Relay Chain. This should encourage more network participation as users are given an easier way to stake directly (versus through trusted third-party services), and ultimately a more secure network.</p><p>User experience will continue to improve beyond the beta, and the dashboard should help to inspire other components that will contribute to a larger library of reusable, generic UX components for the ecosystem and complement the other application-side initiatives that include style guides, validator discovery, metrics, and future Polkadot APIs.</p><p>Have any feedback on the beta or suggestions for future functionality? Check out the <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard#/feedback">feedback page</a> and leave your thoughts!</p><p>Interested in building on Polkadot or Kusama?<a href="https://info.polkadot.network/contact"> Get in touch</a>!</p>

<p>Tl;dr: Coinbase is introducing its innovative VSCode <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.relay">extension</a> created in collaboration with the Relay team, for the Relay GraphQL client, which is <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.relay">available</a> for developer use&nbsp;now.</p><p>By Terence Bezman, Coinbase Senior Software&nbsp;Engineer</p><p>In collaboration with the Relay team at Meta, Coinbase has built a VSCode extension to integrate with the Relay language server <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.relay">which is now available for developer use</a>.</p><p>The Relay framework is self-described as “the GraphQL client that scales with you”. As mentioned in a <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/rearchitecting-apps-for-scale-db438d058e79">previous blog post</a>, we currently use Relay to accelerate development for 300+ engineers on our core applications. Having a world class IDE experience is an important facet to improve engineer productivity — which is a top priority.</p><p>The extension allows for connection to the following:</p>  IntelliSense (autocomplete in your GraphQL&nbsp;tags)  Go to Definition for fragments, fields, GraphQL types,&nbsp;etc.  Diagnostics (Errors, Warnings)  Hover type information  GraphQL syntax highlighting   Motivation <p>Prior to this extension, syntax highlighting and IntelliSense were available by using any of the other existing GraphQL extensions in the VSCode Marketplace, so why did Coinbase decide to build another&nbsp;one?</p><p>From custom directives to its own compiler, Relay adds several features on top of GraphQL. A third-party editor integration would need to re-implement all of the work done in the Relay Compiler to achieve what we’ve built in this extension. This feature integrates directly into the Relay Compiler via a language server giving us the full context from the compiler. This level of context unlocks the following features in your&nbsp;editor:</p>  Showing Relay Compiler errors in your&nbsp;code  Jump to definition on Relay Resolver&nbsp;fields  Support for Relay directives  <p>As Relay continues to build more features, Coinbase wants to remain at the forefront of this innovation and help set the tone for a better developer experience.</p> Maintainership <p>Part of what makes a great open source contributor is ownership and maintenance of the work. Coinbase has allocated engineering resources to create the first version of this VSCode extension and for continued support in the future. It’s important that the community understands that we do not view this as a one and done project, but a relationship we want to maintain for years to&nbsp;come.</p> Giving back to the community <p>Rather than be a passive consumer of Relay, Coinbase is working to be an active and engaged part of this community. Through our shared cooperation with Relay, we are working to understand the product at a deeper level — and leveraging that knowledge to assist the community in closing old issues and submitting pull requests to ensure the project’s success.</p><p>The Coinbase team is thankful for the amazing work the Relay team has done thus far to create a better developer experience with Relay. We want to honor the value this project has brought to our team and continue to innovate in an open-source way that benefits our community.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/announcing-the-relay-vscode-extension-45f8f161bdb8">Announcing the Relay VSCode extension</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Validator Spotlights showcase the great teams working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain. Here are <a href="https://twitter.com/delightlabs_io">DELIGHT</a>’s responses to some questions from the Findora community:</p> 1. Tell us about&nbsp;DELIGHT <p>DELIGHT is a technology-driven team that has operated in the world of decentralized cryptocurrency since the beginning. Though we started just by running our own validator nodes, we now run validator nodes as a service for delegators. Our dApps and services are well-known to be stable and secure, showing our team’s high level of expertise.</p> 2. What should we know about the DELIGHT&nbsp;team? <p>We have contributed to many networks’ growth in diverse ways. Regarding node operation, DELIGHT is currently running validators on over 10 networks, including several cosmos blockchains, SKALE and Threshold Network. When it comes to the Dapp development, the team provided Dapps such as an AMM DEX. They have supported asset trading so that many users can exchange their tokens very easily since its&nbsp;launch.</p> 3. Why Should People Rely on&nbsp;DELIGHT? <p>We have proven reliable even in times of network volatility. DELIGHT was one of the validators holding the highest voting power in the Terra Network (now a.k.a Terra Classic), and proved our reliability when the network was congested due to the UST de-peg. We endeavor to enhance our availability and security by implementing custom monitoring tools that catch emergencies and prepare for&nbsp;them.</p> 4. Why was Findora an appealing network for&nbsp;DELIGHT? <p>Findora’s graceful integration of UTXO and EVM blockchain technology persuaded us to be network validators. Our team expects more and more people to want privacy on the blockchain in the near future, and we expect many other teams to build their dApps on the network soon. As the crypto market grows, so does the need for privacy, making Findora an essential piece of future web3 infrastructure.</p> 5. Where can the Findora Community learn more about&nbsp;DELIGHT? <p>Website:<a href="https://delightlabs.io/"> https://delightlabs.io/</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href="https://twitter.com/delightlabs_io"> https://twitter.com/delightlabs_io</a></p><p>Github:<a href="https://github.com/DELIGHT-LABS"> https://github.com/DELIGHT-LABS</a></p><p>Email: contact@delightlabs.io</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-validator-spotlight-delight-1ae645f96abe">💡Findora Validator Spotlight💡: DELIGHT</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: Today, Coinbase is announcing an easy and secure way for eligible customers to earn staking rewards on Solana&nbsp;(SOL).</p><p>By Thorsten Jaeckel, Senior Product&nbsp;Manager</p><p>At <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, we’re focused on offering more ways for customers to earn crypto rewards. Today, we’re announcing the expansion of our <a href="https://coinbase.com/staking">staking</a> offerings to include <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/solana">Solana (SOL)</a><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/cardano"> </a>with plans to continue to scale our staking portfolio in 2022. Solana staking will be progressively rolled out to all eligible customers.</p><p>While it has been possible for individuals to stake Solana on their own, or through a delegated staking service, the process can be confusing and complicated. With today’s launch, Coinbase is offering an easy, secure way for any retail user to actively participate in the Solana network and earn&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>With Coinbase&nbsp;staking:</p>  Start earning automatically. Once you buy Solana, you automatically start earning rewards via staking. The current estimated annual return for Solana staking on Coinbase is ~3.85% APY.¹ You’ll receive rewards in your account every 3–4&nbsp;days  You will always maintain control. Your Solana always stays in your account; you just earn rewards while keeping your crypto safely on Coinbase. You can opt out any time you&nbsp;want²  Watch your rewards grow. See your rewards accrue in your&nbsp;account  Earn on as much as you want. Start earning with as little as&nbsp;$1  Your peace of mind is our top priority. We take measures to mitigate the risks associated with staking and allow you to unstake&nbsp;anytime.  <p>The Solana network sets the underlying return rate depending on the number of staking participants. Coinbase distributes the return to customers, less a <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/fees">commission</a>.</p><p>You shouldn’t have to be an expert crypto trader to grow your crypto portfolio. Offering simple ways for our customers to earn crypto by participating in staking is an important step in building an open financial system. You can learn more about staking rewards on Coinbase at <a href="http://coinbase.com/staking">coinbase.com/staking</a>.</p><p>To get started, simply <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/solana">buy Solana</a> on Coinbase, or <a href="https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2340440-how-do-i-receive-digital-currency-from-another-wallet-">deposit</a> Solana to your Coinbase account from an external wallet, and you’ll start earning rewards automatically.³</p><p>You can sign up for a Coinbase account <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/signup">here</a> and download the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-bitcoin-wallet/id886427730?ls=1">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinbase.android">Android</a> app to start earning staking rewards&nbsp;today.</p><p>About Solana</p><p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/solana">Solana</a> is a decentralized computing platform that uses SOL to pay for transactions. Solana aims to improve blockchain scalability by using a combination of proof of stake consensus and so-called proof of history. As a result, Solana claims to be able to support 50,000 transactions per second without sacrificing decentralization, and is one of the largest proof of stake blockchains by market&nbsp;cap.</p><p>Solana aims to enable <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-smart-contract">smart contracts</a> to allow developers to build a wide range of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, new crypto tokens, games, and more. When users stake their crypto, they make the underlying blockchain of that asset more secure and more efficient. And in exchange, they are rewarded with additional assets from the network, which are paid out as&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>¹ The rewards rate is based on the estimated protocol rate, which is subject to change. Customers will be able to see the latest applicable rates directly within their accounts.</p><p>² No lock up periods imposed by Coinbase. You may request your staked assets be traded or transferred at any time, and Coinbase will use commercially reasonable efforts to execute, subject to protocol requirements.</p><p>³ Users can opt out at any&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-expands-staking-offerings-to-include-solana-fa5bec35edbd">Coinbase Expands Staking Offerings to Include Solana</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

         From Poker to Protocols                <p>BySam Eifling</p><p>PublishedJune 28, 2022</p>            <p>A lifelong competitor, Bryan Pellegrino is turning what might be crypto’s biggest challenge into his own game: connecting all blockchains securely, cheaply and efficiently.
</p>       



 
 
   
<p>In 2014 Bryan Pellegrino was one of the world’s best poker players, winning more money than ever—and having the most boring year of his life. The change felt sudden. After tens of thousands of hours of grinding online, and a big finish at the 2012 World Series of Poker, only fools or those new to the game would now play him online. What had once been his life’s great pursuit, working to outwit and outplay other poker stars, was reduced to a chore. Pellegrino sat in his apartment in Vancouver, British Columbia, staring at his laptop, playing rote perfection, pouncing on the rookies’ mistakes. “It was mind-numbing,” he says. “I felt like a monkey clicking buttons.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pellegrino had begun playing online poker at 15, well below legal gambling age, using an account his dad set up for him. Over a dozen years, poker helped Pellegrino travel the world for tournaments and for fun. He accumulated more than $500,000 in World Series of Poker purses alone. He spent 10 hours a day, for years, clicking through a half-dozen hands at a time. He’d won a fortune in return. But by 2014, his reputation had caught up with him, and there was no joy, challenge or purpose in playing the newbies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It felt incredible, he says, to be so good at something so hard. But poker had become a cul-de-sac. He knew, after he’d played this hand, there was going to be another, and another. There was no bigger point, no end goal. Once there was no one worth playing, the game wasn’t enough for Pellegrino. “I was just trying to be the best,” he says now. “Once I got there, I realized, hey—there’s no leverage. There’s no anything. I hadn’t realized until then, you need to focus on the utility payoff of what you’re doing.” So he closed his laptop and went looking for a payoff he could measure in more than money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Today Pellegrino is the co-founder and CEO of LayerZero Labs, a company that set out to solve one of the most fundamental, yet most difficult problems in the world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Pellegrino and his LayerZero co-founders Ryan Zarick and Caleb Banister—best friends since they worked together in computer network research labs at the University of New Hampshire—built a protocol that enables blockchains to communicate with each other frictionlessly, so people and programs can move assets or information across chains cheaply, swiftly and securely. They’ve named their new venture LayerZero because it offers a foundation with which any application on any blockchain (layer 1 or layer 2) can integrate. The ability for users to send information between blockchains is central to the promise of Web3, which some think will be the future of the internet. In this vision, the internet is organized on decentralized global ledgers called blockchains, allowing people to connect without central servers to store permanent digital records.</p>



<p>The problem Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister are solving with LayerZero is that, today, moving data between two chains is expensive, tedious and insecure. Blockchains have been in operation since the late 2000s, each uniquely coded to excel at a different task. But no single blockchain has emerged as the standard. Even as the larger chains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana grow, dozens of others keep popping up. For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFnF1dgbF00">data to move between blockchains</a> today, a message has to wind through a blockchain bridge, a series of centralized servers. Navigating a bridge can require clicking dozens of times through multiple programs for anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour. And it requires that a user have a coin or token on the destination blockchain to pay for the transaction fee, called gas, which can add up quickly. Another issue LayerZero is solving for is security. Pellegrino found the state of bridge security technology “horrifying” when he looked into it in 2020. To move, for example, $1,000 worth of cryptocurrency from blockchain A to blockchain B, a person has to send a message from A through a middle chain, which validates the transaction, and then that middle chain tells B that A has moved the funds. But those middle chains make enticing targets for hackers to attack. Cryptocurrency hacks cost more than $14 billion in 2021. The weakness of existing bridge solutions make the entire crypto ecosystem vulnerable, and could hobble its wider adoption.</p>



<p>Inspired by the thrill of a great challenge, Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister began writing the code in early 2021 that would become LayerZero. Not a bridge, but rather a new kind of messaging layer, they believed the tool they were working to create would make all of Web3—apps, money, security, games—better. For average users, their protocol would run as seamlessly in the background as standardized tracks beneath a railcar. Pellegrino had finally found something with meaning, with a global payoff, in his words, a “Holy Grail” problem to solve. It was something worth his time in a way poker could never be.</p>



<p>Along the way, they caught the attention of others in the space. Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire, who earned a physics PhD from CalTech, and had been tracking blockchain technology’s progression since the late ’90s, was following them. And after <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimordialAA/status/1451632573310857216">a notable tweet</a>&nbsp;from Pellegrino in October of 2021, he and Sequoia partner Michelle Bailhe prompted the firm in 2022 to co-lead a $135 million Series A+ fundraising round. “LayerZero’s technology is the glue of crypto,” Maguire says. “It is the thing that stitches the rest of crypto together. The collective value is much, much greater than the sum of its parts. Bryan wants all of crypto to win, wants to make every pocket of crypto more valuable.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Danbury, New Hampshire, had fewer than 1,000 residents when Pellegrino was born, and to him, it felt like a significant portion were his cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. By age 4, he’d already sized up his hometown, says his mother, Audrey, and declared that one day he wanted to live in a place where people were more different from one another. By age 6, he was such an evident math prodigy that his parents bought him a guitar, thinking that if he was going to be an outlier, he’d at least have music to share with others. Their worry was misplaced. Pellegrino was also unusually empathetic. Audrey recalls a youth soccer game when a larger kid crashed into Pellegrino hard enough to send him sprawling. “Don’t worry,” she told her son, “The bigger they are, the harder they fall.” He stopped playing to correct her, saying, “Mom, that is not nice.”</p>



<p>Pellegrino’s dad, Steven, was a UPS driver who got up early and came home late, so Friday and Saturday nights at the Pellegrinos’ were special, and all about games. The four siblings, Deanna, Manie, Bryan and Angela, bonded over long hours playing Risk, Monopoly, Stratego and bid whist. Pellegrino was a game savant, always willing to play, and winning almost all the time, at almost all costs, even if he had to stay up all night to do it. His family didn’t know it then, but these ordinary game nights would come to shape Pellegrino’s life and livelihood.</p>



<p>In high school he was a good kid—he took after his parents, abstaining from smoking or drinking—though he was not above reproach. When he was 15, Pellegrino spent a week at Georgetown University as part of the Presidential Classroom program, wherein bright high schoolers toured the nation’s capital and met political leaders. The idea was to inspire kids to go into public service. Instead, Pellegrino got into poker. A fellow participant invited him to play and Pellegrino bought in with $20 his mom had given him as spending money. His childhood obsession with games honed his sense of risk and strategy, which paid off almost immediately. Before the night was over, he’d turned $20 into $60, which he spent on a Georgetown sweatshirt that he’s pretty sure he still has. When he got home, he handed his dad another $50 to get his first online account started.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout high school, Pellegrino ran track, wrestled—and played online poker. Senior year, he barely studied and still graduated third in his class. He chose the University of New Hampshire out of frugality as much as anything. But the decision worked out. It was through working at a networking lab that he got close to Zarick and Banister, who would become his lifelong friends and LayerZero co-founders. And the college broadened his horizons. When he was 19, he applied to a study abroad trip to Budapest, Hungary, at the insistence of his brother-in-law, who had done the same trip years before and loved it. Pellegrino submitted his application at the deadline, got accepted, and truly left home for the first time. “I cried like a baby when I dropped him off,” Audrey says. “He cried like a baby. We never thought that he would never return home.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>During his first week in Budapest, Pellegrino lived in a hostel with fellow students while they were expected to find their own apartments for the semester. Pellegrino was in an elevator one day when the doors opened for Melanie, a French architecture student. She saw him and thought, “Oh, no. This is trouble,” she remembers with a laugh. With a mini French-to-English dictionary in her pocket, Melanie got into a cab with Pellegrino, and they spent the day together. “Our first conversation, she had to look up every word, one at a time, with this little book,” Pellegrino remembers. “I don’t know what it was, but it was definitely there for sure.” Melanie asked him to split an apartment with her, strictly as roommates. That arrangement, she says, lasted about a week. They were married two years later.</p>



<p>In Budapest, Pellegrino earned enough money playing online poker to justify dropping out of school. He gave himself six months to make it as a pro or resume computer science studies. When Pellegrino told his family he wasn’t going back to school, his mother remembers telling him that she’d support him no matter what, so long as he kept his nose clean, paid his taxes, and stayed safe. “He could do anything he wanted,” Audrey says. “If he goes busto—that’s his word—he knows he can come home. There’s always home. He has a very tight-knit family.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>From this moment, until 2011, when America outlawed playing online poker for money, Pellegrino played poker 70 hours a week, most of the time at a computer. He was obsessed with the game, optimizing his performance and learning to make decisions about risk and reward in .3 seconds, over and over and over. He and Melanie traveled the world, hitting 80 countries, often while lugging a full-size computer tower across borders. Melanie remembers customs agents stopping them at airports, insisting that the computer proved Pellegrino must be traveling for work. But he explained he was a dedicated online poker player—and that’s just for fun, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>When America outlawed playing poker online for money, the Pellegrinos were living in Austin, Texas. Because online poker is where players could make the most money and have the most frequent opportunities to play, Pellegrino was ostensibly out of work. He agreed to join the fantasy sports betting site BuzzDraft and had become CEO by the time the company was acquired by another fantasy sports betting company shortly thereafter. Then, he went to Las Vegas to play in the World Series of Poker in 2012, where he finished second in one of the events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2013, Pellegrino had some money in the bank and was curious about the Bitcoin buzz between his brother and his brother-in-law. Cryptocurrency caught Pellegrino’s attention for a number of reasons, one of which was that it was a new kind of way to place a bet. He understood the cryptography and distributed systems that undergirded the blockchain, and he felt like he was good at crunching the odds of a payoff. And like poker, some cryptocurrencies paid out, and some went bust. The three men bought computers to mine Bitcoin, but then the cryptocurrency’s value plummeted in 2014. Its exchange collapsed, a Bitcoin Foundation board member was arrested for money laundering, and hackers repeatedly stole hundreds of millions of dollars. It had been a bad bet at the time. Pellegrino, now living in Canada, where online poker was legal, went back to playing. This is when he found himself listless, absent challenging competition, when he should have been having the year of his life professionally. “The game had changed,” Pellegrino remembers. Unlike so many other pros, he wasn’t driven by the money. He wanted a competitive challenge. And one with a meaningful payoff.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>For about three months circa 2015, Pellegrino actually contemplated retirement. He and Melanie took their infant son around the world to look for their ideal home, hitting 12 countries in 12 months. He was restless but not anxious. Then one day, as he watched YouTube, the algorithm served up a video of a DeepMind artificial intelligence called Agent57 playing Atari. Agent57 had, in fact, “learned” to play all 57 Atari games starting from zero, just pixels on the screen. As the AI failed and failed, it learned, and quickly taught itself to surpass any human. “This was one of the first steps toward artificial general intelligence, something that could take information with no context and learn to be incredible at it,” Pellegrino says. “That was super exciting. That got me thinking about reinforcement learning generally—machine learning, AI. Just excited about the field.” Pellegrino, awed, thought back on how the fantasy sports players he’d seen at BuzzDraft racked up millions in wins without the aid of machine learning. “I said, ‘That’s crazy. There has to be a better way.’ So I looked at all the sports and said, ‘OK, I hate baseball, but it has the best data set. Let’s go with that.’”</p>



<p>After their year of travel, the Pellegrinos settled back in Vancouver—it had a school the family loved—and Pellegrino found himself drawn to work on the baseball-AI idea. It was another puzzle to solve, a game to design. Pellegrino hypothesized that he could build an AI to crunch the data points to predict a pitcher’s pitch-by-pitch performance against a batter. It had been years since he’d routinely written code, but one thing led to another and, as can happen to a guy like Pellegrino, he wound up creating a machine learning tool he sold to several Major League Baseball clubs in early 2016. He still relishes the day when the phone rang and on the other end, ready to talk business, was Billy Beane, the Oakland A’s executive immortalized in “Moneyball” for his dedication to statistical analysis. Pellegrino had addressed a big problem for a few pro sports teams. But he wanted to work at something, and be the best at something, that would matter more.</p>



<p>He was becoming increasingly curious about cryptocurrency as a place to do that work. In late 2016, Pellegrino bought into Bitcoin with “a renewed conviction.” What started as an investment turned into Pellegrino building on the Ethereum blockchain, reading white papers and connecting with the community. He immediately saw how hard it was for people to start new cryptocurrencies. “It was a miserable process,” he says, one inaccessible for anyone without coding sophistication. At this time, a friend introduced him to Daniel Chen, then an engineer at Andreessen Horowitz. In 2017, the two friends decided to pursue something big—writing code that could democratize cryptocurrency launches. They launched OpenToken in 2018 as a platform that offered regular people the chance to launch their own cryptocurrencies. But both Pellegrino and Chen moved on to other projects as the work they did with OpenToken led to product pivots and an acquisition. Pellegrino turned back to experimenting with AI and gaming.</p>



<p>In the summer of 2020, he had a breakthrough, further solidifying his credibility as a master of games and machine learning. Pellegrino, his longtime best friends and co-founders Zarick and Banister, along with Facebook AI’s Noam Brown, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10442">published a research paper</a> that described their poker-playing AI, named Supremus. The AI clobbered the world’s previous best poker AI, and some of the world’s top pros. A key insight: players do not always optimize their odds, but are likely to play in such a way that gives them the fewest regrets about the outcome. Their paper has since been cited in game theory research published by DeepMind, the Alphabet AI lab. “All my life, I’ve just liked to work on hard problems,” Pellegrino says. “More than anything else, that’s what attracts me.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>In the fall of 2020, the Binance Smart Chain launched. As a rare non-Bitcoin, non-Ethereum blockchain product, it fascinated Pellegrino. The cryptocurrency exchange built a new blockchain designed to make it relatively easy, cheap, and fast for users to conduct transactions among more than 300 cryptocurrency tokens. Pellegrino decided he wanted to test this new tool. He lassoed Zarick and Banister and began, as so many technologists have over the years, by trying to create a game. The goal was to leverage the quick throughput and cheap transaction cost of Binance Smart Chain to play this game they’d invented—generating a bunch of gladiators to fight to the death—and in so doing create an NFT of the winning gladiator. The NFT would be stored on the Ethereum chain, a popular chain for NFTs but relatively inefficient and expensive for the work of gameplay. They soon realized that they had to move the NFT more or less manually, using a bridge they built themselves. The other bridges they could’ve used were too susceptible to hacking. They’d hit upon an aha moment: If existing bridges were a liability for moving an NFT, the risk in moving actual money was enormous.</p>



<p>They realized they needed more than a bridge. They needed a foundational code layer the bridge could be built upon to make it secure. But, more than a decade into the blockchain revolution, such a thing didn’t exist. And other multi-chain bridges were only moving “wrapped” cryptocurrencies, not NFTs or other kinds of data. Pellegrino says the most fundamental need was to get a generic message—the simplest, barest information packets—to operate across blockchains. What solution could facilitate that kind of interoperability among every sort of chain moving any kind of data? Pellegrino had found his big project, a challenge that could pay off in a way that no poker hand ever could.&nbsp;</p>



LAYERZERO



<p></p>



<p>The LayerZero team spent months hardening their messaging protocol, and in late May 2021 <a href="https://layerzero.network/pdf/LayerZero_Whitepaper_Release.pdf">released a white paper</a>, “LayerZero: Trustless Omnichain Interoperability Protocol.” The paper laid out how their free, open-source protocol would be the first to enable direct transactions across all blockchains while remaining decentralized, transparent and permanent. They never shopped their project as a company; Pellegrino smiles when he says LayerZero never created a sales deck. But stealthily, Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister were leveling up. When the renowned co-founder of SushiSwap, who goes by 0xMaki, left that decentralized exchange, he could’ve taken a job anywhere, Pellegrino says. But Pellegrino dropped him a Twitter DM and soon coaxed him aboard to integrate new clients and find new business for LayerZero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2021, feeling exuberant at the 0xMaki hire, Pellegrino tweeted a fateful claim: “We’re legitimately assembling the greatest team in crypto and nobody even knows about it yet.” Sequoia partner Michelle Bailhe saw it and sent a DM. “I didn’t know him,” Bailhe says, “but his contributions to crypto Twitter were optimistic and interesting. Plus, he had a Pudgy Penguin as his profile picture. When Shaun and I met him, Bryan’s intellectual horsepower and clarity of thought on one of the hardest problems in crypto was immediately compelling to us.” As it happened, Maguire had been an angel investor in OpenToken, and Chen, Pellegrino’s former co-founder at OpenToken, would soon become a visiting fellow at Sequoia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bailhe and Maguire recognized that LayerZero was, in one sense, tackling a massive, future-internet-shaping problem. It was, in another sense, inventing plumbing. The internet today is built on similarly boring breakthroughs. Before the creation of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (known as TCP/IP), the varied intranets that linked universities and government offices in different countries had no way to transmit data to each other. Further back, people standardized electrical currents, fire hoses and hydrants and myriad other things in which interchangeability determines the usefulness of two things together. They saw that Pellegrino wanted to build this kind of basic infrastructure, something worth his time and expertise because it had such a huge potential payoff for so many. And when he came to Sequoia to negotiate the terms of business, Maguire says Pellegrino showed that same spirit of wanting everyone to come out ahead.</p>



<p>“Heads-up poker is basically the same skill as negotiating,” Maguire says. “It’s reading people, knowing when they’re bluffing, all that. So despite the fact that Bryan has that skill, when he negotiated with us, he didn’t play poker, which was very interesting. He was just 100 percent upfront and direct. He said all of his constraints and basically implied, ‘Look, if I wanted to go negotiate and be a jerk and all that, I could do it. But I want to build a partnership with you guys.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March of this year, Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister launched their own proof-of-concept in Stargate, an application built on LayerZero that helps to move funds between blockchains smoothly. In its first 10 days, people moved more than $250 million worth of crypto assets using Stargate, which helped to get other applications to adopt LayerZero. Pellegrino and others in the crypto community saw it as an unmitigated success. His inbox is full, he says, of potential partners. But outreaches aren’t the same as customers or collaborators.</p>



<p>What lies ahead is anyone’s guess. Hundreds of developers are now working on applications that incorporate the free, open-source code of LayerZero, promising to flatten the silos that individual blockchains have built. Take a platform like OpenSea, the largest marketplace for NFTs. It had built three parallel versions of itself, effectively, one each for users of Ether, Solana, or Polygon. But none of the versions could transfer cryptocurrencies, information or digital art between them easily or affordably because they were all on different blockchains. By adopting LayerZero, OpenSea could allow a user holding any of those coins to spend freely on anything on the platform.</p>



<p>Pellegrino’s time these days is spent on business development, strategy and honing the product. And he now has three kids ranging in age from 8 years to 11 months, so he also spends time getting them up for breakfast, fed and out the door, playing little word games along the way. “In those short moments with my kids… when we’re in the car, we’re not just sitting, we’re doing something. (My oldest) loves this game where we throw out a letter, and on the entire commute, we’ll just throw words back and forth on that letter.” Of course, Pellegrino has also been playing cards with his oldest son since the boy was four. He says he’s a family man like his dad, working to spark in his kids the same excitement for games that his dad instilled in him. “I try to celebrate even a small moment,” he says of the car rides. “Then I go off and I do my thing.”</p>



<p>At work, he has no direct reports and no limit to the number of ways his platform could plug into the next version of the internet. “We’ve built something awesome,” he says. “But there’s a lot of awesome technologies out there that don’t get used. For us now, it’s purely expansion and adoption. It’s getting all of the largest projects in the world to build on top of us. To get every developer who’s thinking cross-chain, to think of us.</p>



<p>“The prior stage was launch, which was great. But as soon as you launch? People forget about the past. And now you’re in a totally new game.”</p>

<p>The birth of Bitcoin led to a Cambrian explosion of blockchains with different design decisions and use cases. While these distributed ledgers serve different purposes, they existed (and still exist to a certain degree) as silos with limited meaningful interaction.</p><p>Similar to the Internet which facilitates different types of computers in different parts of the world to communicate with one another, a similar technology that acts as the connective tissue between blockchains is necessary for true value accrual. The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol aims to serve this&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>IBC is a universal interoperability protocol that allows two different blockchains to communicate with one another. IBC guarantees reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most important properties of IBC is trust-minimization. In blockchains, the property of trust-minimization is inherently linked to security. No distributed system is entirely ‘trustless’. Therefore, the question of security boils down to who or what is trusted, and how can that trust be violated i.e., what does it take for the trusted entity to be corrupted?</p><p>In this sense, and unlike most bridging solutions, IBC uses no trusted third parties. This means that if you trust two particular chains to use the functions they provide (and by default their consensus mechanisms), then there is no additional trust assumption required while using IBC to interact between said&nbsp;chains.</p><p>IBC is also more than just a bridge that facilitates token transfers. It is a general-purpose message passing protocol. This means that any form of data can be communicated over&nbsp;IBC.</p> How does IBC&nbsp;work? <p>In order to understand how IBC works, it is important to separate the two different layers of IBC — 1) the transport layer and 2) the application layer.</p>High-level depiction of IBC packet flow between two blockchains Transport Layer <p>Messages communicated over IBC are transported within <a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Data_packet">data packets</a>. And the transport layer is responsible for transporting, authenticating, and ordering these data&nbsp;packets.</p><p>The transport layer does not specify anything about what the data in the packets should be or how they should be interpreted by a receiving chain. From the transport layer’s point of view, information within data packets are just random&nbsp;bytes.</p><p>The key components of the transport layer are light clients, relayers, connections, and channels.</p><p>A light client is a lightweight representation of a blockchain. Unlike a <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/VALIDATORS_FAQ.md#what-is-a-full-node">full node</a>, light clients do not store the entire history of all the messages contained in a blockchain. Neither do they execute transactions. Rather, light clients are designed to connect to a full node, and verify block headers (a summary of the data contained within a block). This allows light clients to be efficient in terms of storage and computation.</p><p>Two independent blockchains A and B interacting over IBC have <a href="https://medium.com/tendermint/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-tendermint-light-client-f80d03856f98">light clients</a> of the counterparty chain. This means that A has a light client on its blockchain which acts as a lightweight representation of B’s blockchain. When A wants to communicate a certain message ‘X’ with B, it sends the header of the block in which that message exists, along with a commitment proof of that message to B. The commitment proof is used to verify the presence or absence of a particular message on A. Using the block header and proof, B cryptographically verifies that A did indeed perform X. It is this use of light clients in IBC that allow blockchains to exchange messages with one another without the need for a trusted third&nbsp;party.</p><p>But A and B do not directly send these messages/data packets between each other. Instead, when A wishes to send a message to B, it commits or stores a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hash.asp">hash</a> of a data packet containing the message in its <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16447/state-machine">state machine</a>. Relayers, which are off-chain processes, constantly observe for such messages. When they see that A has committed a message intended for B in its state machine, they simply pick up this message and pass it onto B. Note that relayers are permissionless and therefore can be run by&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>Connections are responsible for connecting light clients on two different chains. And channels are conduits for transferring packets between modules on these different chains. Therefore, while connections are chain-specific, channels are module-specific. Each channel end has a unique channel ID (and a port ID) that is used to accurately route packets between two&nbsp;modules.</p> Application Layer <p>The application layer is what end-users interact with. It consists of various applications that use the transport layer to build on top. The transport layer does not specify how data packets need to be interpreted. This role is performed by the application layer.</p><p>IBC supports a variety of applications such as fungible/non-fungible token transfers, cross-chain oracle feeds, <a href="https://interchain-io.medium.com/welcome-to-the-ibc-gang-lets-talk-f469883e0ffe">Interchain Accounts</a>, Interchain Queries, <a href="https://interchain-io.medium.com/ibc-relaying-as-a-service-the-in-protocol-incentivization-story-9922c7b953f0">Fee middleware</a> (to incentivise relayers), etc.</p><p>For example, the IBC-level application for token transfers — termed <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/master/spec/app/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer/README.md">Interchain Standard 20</a> (ICS 20) — specifies how data packets should be structured and how they are to be interpreted by receiving chains. In the case of fungible token transfers, data packets contain information regarding the sender, receiver, amount, and denomination (IBC denom). The denom field traces the path that a particular token has gone through to reach a certain chain. Logic regarding how the packets are to be acted upon are also specified by ICS&nbsp;20.</p><p>A simple analogy that can be helpful in understanding IBC is that of the mail delivery system. When you send a letter to someone, you send it through a postal service that collects the envelope containing the letter from you and deposits it into the recipient’s mailbox. The recipient then opens said envelope and reads your letter. The transport layer of IBC can be thought of as the postal service. The postal service does not tell you what the contents of the letter should be, or how the recipient should interpret your&nbsp;message.</p><p>Neither do they know what the contents of the envelope are. It only performs the action of collecting the envelope from point A and sending it to point B. The envelope itself can be thought of as IBC packets that are sent from one chain to another. And on this envelope, you would specify the address of the recipient. This is similar to how IBC packets contain information regarding who sent the packet (specified by the channel ID) and to whom it is intended for (specified by the counterparty channel ID). In the end, it is the receiver (application) that is responsible for opening the envelope (data packet) and interpreting the contents of the&nbsp;letter.</p> What can IBC be used&nbsp;for? <p>Apart from fungible token transfers, two other IBC-level applications include Interchain Accounts, and <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-security-is-coming-to-the-cosmos-hub-f144c45fb035">Interchain Security</a>.</p><p>Interchain Accounts facilitate chain to chain interaction while remaining on a single interface. This effectively means that any action such as transfers, staking, or voting on governance proposals which can be performed on B (called the ‘host chain’), can be performed from A (called the ‘controller chain’). Interchain Accounts significantly increases composability within the Interchain by improving user-experience.</p><p>Interchain Security is the Cosmos Ecosystem’s version of shared security. It enables a blockchain to lease security from another chain in a completely opt-in manner. This is especially useful for new chains that can choose to tap into the security offered by an already established network such as the Cosmos Hub. Interchain Security removes the need for chains to bootstrap their own validator set.</p><p>The scope of applications that can be performed using IBC as a core primitive is consistently growing. Cross-chain NFT transfers and Interchain Queries (where one chain can read state from another chain) are currently being developed and will soon be production ready.</p> What problem does IBC&nbsp;solve? <p>In a sentence, IBC solves the problem of blockchains existing as silos with limited interaction. Interoperability between blockchains is necessary for maximal value&nbsp;accrual.</p><p>Each blockchain caters to one or more specialized use cases. If these use cases cannot be leveraged across multiple blockchains, it severely handicaps their utility. The breakthrough that the internet provided is that information can easily flow across different parts of the world with ease. Similarly, the utility of different blockchains need to be freely accessible across multiple platforms.</p><p>For example, users might want to use stablecoins from one blockchain, to generate yield through a liquidity pool (LP) on a decentralized exchange (DEX) that exists on another blockchain. Or they might want to leverage the privacy preserving properties that a different blockchain provides. Interoperability between chains are required to realize these use cases and&nbsp;more.</p><p>IBC not only solves the problem of interoperability, but it does so in a trust-minimized, secure, extensible, and general purpose&nbsp;manner.</p> How can I as an application developer use&nbsp;IBC? <p>The modular nature of the Cosmos SDK prevents developers from having to concern themselves with some of the layers of abstractions such as light clients, connections, proof verification, etc. For developers, the most relevant requirements and functions to familiarize with are <a href="https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/overview.html#channels">channels</a> and <a href="https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/overview.html#ports">ports</a>. For more detailed information on IBC, <a href="https://tutorials.cosmos.network/">you can refer to our developer porta</a>l.</p><p>If you are building your blockchain using the Cosmos SDK, the necessary steps to enable IBC for an SDK module are <a href="https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/apps.html">detailed here</a>.

<p>Tl;dr: We’re announcing two big updates to our Commerce platform: instant, free payments from Coinbase users to Commerce merchants, and seven new cryptocurrencies that can be used for payments through Commerce.</p><p>One of Coinbase’s goals is to become a platform that brings together consumers and businesses in the cryptoeconomy. By making cryptocurrency transactions easier and more accessible, we are continuing to drive towards this goal. One of our key strategic pillars is to build products that enable crypto as a new financial system. Coinbase Commerce supports this pillar by providing access to safe and convenient payments.</p><p>Instant and Free Payments:</p><p>Earlier this year, we launched instant and free payments from Coinbase users to Coinbase-Managed Commerce merchants. This new feature leverages Coinbase’s unique access to both Coinbase customers as payers and to merchants as payees to enable instant, free payments using off-chain transactions. An off-chain transaction involves an account-to-account transfer processed outside of the blockchain through a separate channel, which means we can offer this benefit to payers with Coinbase accounts.</p><p>Payer Benefits</p><p>Consumers have told us that fees are among the top reasons they choose not to pay in cryptocurrency. Following this launch, existing Coinbase users will be able to complete crypto payments for free if they are sending money to a Commerce merchant on our Coinbase-Managed product, and funds will be settled to the merchant instantly. This makes online and in-person payments even more seamless.</p><p>Merchant Benefits</p><p>One of the biggest drawbacks for merchants looking to accept cryptocurrency is price volatility. Instant transactions (10 minutes or less) along with auto conversions to fiat currency can help to ensure that you are receiving the right amount from the&nbsp;payer.</p><p>Nathan Scherotter, Vice President of Direct-To-Consumer at Commerce client Constellation Brands commented on the company’s excitement about the new capability for the Robert Mondavi NFT store: “Coinbase was the perfect partner for Robert Mondavi to launch our NFT project. The product, team and infrastructure allowed for seamless crypto transactions, automatic conversion and easy integration. Without Coinbase’s Commerce product we would not have been able to accept crypto for this project, and being able to offer instant and free payments is a huge&nbsp;win.”</p><p>More Crypto Payment Options on Commerce:</p><p>We’ve also added support for seven new crypto assets on the Commerce platform. Merchants and consumers now have more options for their crypto payments. We’ve been getting requests to enable payments with additional cryptocurrencies and we’re excited to add this new capability that will meet the needs of both sellers and&nbsp;payers.</p><p>We now support BTC, ETH, USDC, BCH, LTC, DOGE, DAI, USDT, APE, and SHIB. Merchants can easily manage which cryptocurrencies they want to accept, turn off the ones they don’t, and choose to hold or auto-convert any cryptocurrency balance to&nbsp;USD.¹</p><p>By removing friction and increasing flexibility within the crypto payment process on both sides of the ecosystem, we are taking another step towards mainstream adoption and leveraging the network effect of our brand. <a href="https://beta.commerce.coinbase.com/sign-in">Log in</a> to your account to explore these new features. You can also visit our <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/commerce/getting-started/for-merchants">Help Center</a> or <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/contact-us">contact us</a> if you need&nbsp;support.</p><p>Keep an eye out for more exciting Commerce updates to come later this&nbsp;year!</p><p>¹Only Coinbase-managed accounts are eligible for auto-conversion.

Previously, Warren held the title of VP of Product at Discreet Labs where he has proven instrumental in helping to develop and launch many technical milestones over the past year on <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3575036-1&amp;h=2818776398&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ffindora.org%2F&amp;a=Findora">Findora</a>, a high-performance EVM-compatible public blockchain utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to bring privacy to&nbsp;Web3.</p>Warren Paul Anderson, CEO of Discreet&nbsp;Labs<p>Warren is a startup founder and a strategic product creative with valuable experience building distributed systems and open protocols using applied cryptography. Before joining Discreet Labs, Warren led crypto products at <a href="https://ripple.com/">Ripple</a> for over 4 years, working on open protocols such as XRP Ledger, Interledger, &amp; PayString, the RippleX developer platform, and RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity enterprise product.</p><p>Prior to Ripple, in 2014, Warren co-founded Hedgy, one of the first DeFi platforms for institutional OTC bitcoin transactions using programmable, escrowed smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>Warren got started in the crypto industry as a hobbyist Bitcoin miner in 2011, back when one could still mine a block with a CPU. Warren earned two bachelor’s degrees from Northwestern and did graduate studies at Harvard. Warren is a regular presence in the blockchain community and press, a frequent public speaker, and has also guest lectured at institutions such as Stanford, Northwestern, UC Berkeley, Wharton, University College London, and the University of Zurich on topics related to blockchain, cryptocurrency, fintech, and technology more&nbsp;broadly.</p> Dr. Weikeng Chen Becomes Chief Scientist at Discreet&nbsp;Labs Weikeng Chen, Chief Scientist at Discreet&nbsp;Labs<p>Dr. Weikeng (pronounced “waken”) Chen has also joined Discreet Labs as Chief Scientist where he will be leading cryptography research and development. Weikeng recently completed his Ph.D. at U.C. Berkeley’s world-renowned Security &amp; Applied Cryptography Group, where he focused his research on systems and applications of ZKPs and multi-party computation (MPC) with an emphasis on efficient implementations. Beyond his academic research, Weikeng has also been a core contributor to several ZKP open-source projects implemented in Rust including: <a href="https://github.com/arkworks-rs/">arkworks</a>, an ecosystem for developing and programming with zkSNARKs; <a href="https://rustrepo.com/repo/scipr-lab-marlin">Marlin</a>, a Rust library that implements a preprocessing zkSNARK for R1CS with universal and updatable SRS; <a href="https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkVM">snarkVM</a>, a virtual machine for ZKPs; and <a href="https://dzk.org/">DZK</a>, a decentralized system for practical end-to-end zero-knowledge proofs. Weikeng was also instrumental in implementing ZEXE (Zero-knowledge EXEcution), a ledger-based system for enabling decentralized private computation. He was advised by Professor Raluca Ada Popa, a 2022 ACM Grace Hopper Murray Award&nbsp;winner.</p><p>Dr. Weikeng Chen has already made many voluntary contributions to the Findora open source project, especially <a href="https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/zei">Zei</a>, a cryptographic library of advanced ZKPs. Weikeng is among a small group of cryptographers that have dedicated their academic careers to the technologies that Discreet Labs is building to scale web3&nbsp;privacy.</p> Discreet Labs’&nbsp;Progress <p>In one year’s time, Discreet Labs has shipped multiple exciting protocols, platforms, and products for Findora, including an advanced multi-chain architecture, which combines privacy and scalability on Findora OG (UTXO chain) with programmability and interoperability on Findora X (scalable Web3 privacy solution with full EVM compatibility). Discreet Labs also recently launched Prism, a trustless atomic swap protocol that bridges Findora OG and Findora X. To interoperate Findora’s multi-chain architecture with the growing ecosystem, Discreet Labs launched Rialto, which is a non-custodial bridge between all EVM compatible chains and&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>With the launch of toolkits like <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/components/Prism/Overview">Prism</a> and <a href="https://rialtobridge.io/">Rialto</a>, as well as a cryptographic library of advanced ZKPs, Discreet Labs is now focused on extending Findora privacy to EVM-based dApps with smart contract functionalities. Most recently, on April 22nd, Discreet Labs, in partnership with <a href="https://twitter.com/ColumbusDAO_">Columbus DAO</a>, launched <a href="https://twitter.com/Yellow_Subm">Yellow Submarine</a>, the first Web3 dApp to enable privacy on Ethereum-compatible projects. In a historic, industry first, Yellow Submarine uses a practical implementation of ZKP to allow private transactions across BNB Chain, Ethereum, and other EVM compatible chains, in a simple, intuitive, and user-friendly way.</p><p>We are proud to welcome Warren as CEO and Weikeng as Chief Scientist of Discreet Labs and look forward to the future innovation they will drive forward for Findora and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Media contact:<br>media@findora.org<br>Jonathan@melrosepr.com</p><p>About Discreet Labs<br><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3575036-1&amp;h=1991756025&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscreetlabs.io%2F&amp;a=Discreet+Labs">Discreet Labs</a> is building scalable privacy systems for web3.

 Announcing the Verida Credentials Incubator &amp; the inspiring first projects coming to&nbsp;market Announcing the Verida Credentials Incubator<p>Self-sovereignty is a key objective of Web3. “Not your keys, not your crypto” is a common mantra. Verifiable credentials are a way to bring self-sovereignty to your identity and build digital attestations in order to access products and services, both on and off the blockchain.</p><p>Enabling privacy preserving credentials on public blockchain is critical to enable regulatory compliance and unlock trillions of dollars of capital from traditional finance to flow into Decentralized Finance&nbsp;(DeFi).</p><p>Verida offers the world’s first mobile wallet that incorporates a blockchain wallet, verifiable credential support and a decentralized database storage network that is capable of storing verifiable credentials in a regulatory compliant manner.</p><p>As such, we have seen an explosion of interest in recent months to utilise our wallet and storage network to build credential related products and services.</p><p>The Verida Credential Incubator is bringing together a collection of these organizations and emerging technologies to enable the rapid development of end-to-end credential products and proof of concepts.</p><p>These projects are supporting use cases such&nbsp;as:</p>  Blockchain enabled KYC for Decentralized Exchanges, DAO’s and DeFi lending and insurance protocols to become regulatory compliant  Blockchain enabled credit scores for DeFi protocols to enable under collateralized loans  Healthcare worker credentials for nation state healthcare systems to increase trust and efficiency  <p>Verida, along with the technology partners in the incubator program, provide a composable credential technology stack that allows projects to innovate at speed, demonstrate real world use cases and increase interoperability with complementary projects.</p><p>Many of the technical partners are actively participating and helping shape the standards that support verifiable credentials, including the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID-Core</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p><p>Verida is committed to the Verida Vault and the Verida private data storage network continually being upgraded to support these emerging standards as they are ratified and accepted by their respective communities. This will provide a reliable, end-to-end, interoperable technology platform for projects requiring credentials.</p> Current Challenges With Credentials <p>We have been approached by many organizations to help them build out products using verifiable credentials and the Verida technology stack. Through our discussions with these partners, it’s become clear that credential technology is rapidly evolving and projects need help in several&nbsp;ways:</p>  End-to-end infrastructure for testing credential products and new technologies  Accelerating collaboration and adoption between complementary projects  Support to create PoC’s that demonstrate new technology enhancements  <p>Additionally, the technical standards and implementations of verifiable credentials are rapidly evolving. Here are some of the problems being tackled by participants in the incubator, often through involvement with standards working&nbsp;groups.</p>  Private credential storage: Credential holders need the ability to store their credentials in a private database, owned and controlled by the&nbsp;holder.  Business model: Verifiable credentials construct an ecosystem where a user owns data about themselves. This creates challenges around who should pay for the work involved with issuing a credential. The holder or the verifier? How should that payment be privacy preserving? Can the payment be made with fiat and / or&nbsp;crypto?  Interoperability: There’s an emerging Verifiable Credential standard, however there are many varied implementations and lack of definitions in some key areas required for mass adoption. How do we create an architecture that supports both on-chain and off-chain use cases? How can wallets easily support many different credential implementations? Is an NFT a credential?  Revocation: One area lacking clarity is the revocation of credentials. Can or should that occur on the blockchain? Should that remain private with a standardized set of REST API calls? When should revocation occur? When should revocation be&nbsp;checked?  Trust anchors: A credential is signed using the private key of an issuer, which is linked to a public key. This public key is simply letters and numbers. How can an individual be confident their public key is actually controlled by the government, a bank or a healthcare organisation?  On-chain bridging: How can an off-chain Verifiable Credential be used on the blockchain? What are the privacy implications? How can zero-knowledge technology help? What is the role of Oracles? How does an on-chain credential work with revocation and trust anchors? How do we create an architecture that’s multi-chain?  Data connectivity: How can a user’s personal data be consensually obtained and shared (by its rightful owner) in a way that meets the principles of self-sovereignty?  Adoption: Gaining widespread adoption of credentials in the off chain world (Web2) and the on chain world (Web3) requires both technical and business consensus, with an understanding that flexibility of approaches is required for different use&nbsp;cases.   The Verida Credential Incubator: A composable tech stack for&nbsp;Web3 <p>It’s been clear from conversations over the past three months that many projects are coming up against the challenges listed above. Builders and developers need support in different ways.</p>  Projects addressing a technical challenge (ie: revocation) require a full end-to-end credential technology stack where their contribution to a broader solution can be integrated, easy to demo, and rapidly iterated on for end to end proof of concepts.  Projects have customers wanting to issue credentials or build new tokenized business models with credentials, but lack the end user products, expertise and tools to quickly deliver a solution.  Web2 companies see the huge opportunity emerging with Web3 credentials and want to rapidly build PoC’s and partner with others to launch new products and services.  <p>The Verida Credential Incubator provides a composable credential technology stack. This enables projects to easily collaborate with each other on proof of concepts via a highly flexible technology stack that offers technology consensus.</p>A composable credential technology stack.<p>When combined with some of Verida’s solutions to the challenges above (ie: private data storage, self-custody credential wallet) and open source reference implementations, it provides an ideal environment for projects driving credential innovation across&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>This incubator will assist all participants to better collaborate, innovate and launch new products that drive forward adoption of both credential solutions and broader adoption of Web3 solutions.</p><p><a href="https://www.verida.io/credentials">Learn more about Verida Credentials</a></p> Discover what’s being&nbsp;built <p>Discover the projects Verida is collaborating with to accelerate the development of credential based solutions for&nbsp;Web3.</p>  cheqd — payment — cheqd is a decentralised network for data ownership and value creation.

  Arc Americas: Build for the Next Decade  <p>Applications are now open for the first Americas cohort of Arc, our seed-stage catalyst for outlier founders.</p>  <p>By Jess Lee</p><p>Published June 27, 2022</p>  



 
<p>Earlier this year we <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sequoia-arc-outliers-wanted/">unveiled</a> Arc, Sequoia’s seed-stage catalyst that helps outlier founders build category-defining companies that will endure. Our first Arc Europe cohort kicked off in May, and today we are thrilled to launch the <a href="https://arc.sequoiacap.com/">application</a> for Arc Americas—for companies headquartered in North America and Latin America.</p>



<p>In addition to receiving initial funding of $1M, each Arc founder participates in a seven-week program introducing them to Company Design, the Sequoia way to start, build and scale enduring companies.&nbsp;</p>


 A legendary field trip to Klarna HQ in Stockholm, Sweden. 


<p>Company Design draws on Sequoia’s five decades of experience to teach core concepts in product strategy, go-to-market, culture and more. The curriculum is taught by Sequoia partners along with visiting instructors and builders from our network, including founders and operators of our portfolio companies. To connect the dots between theory and practice, Arc blends foundational lectures, case studies, hands-on practice and a group field trip; the inaugural <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/outlier-founders-of-arc-europe/">Europe cohort</a> visited Stockholm to learn with the Klarna team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arc also connects participants with a powerful network for mentorship and support, through regular 1:1s with our partners and fellow founders, office hours, peer boards and Sequoia community dinners. In addition, participants get access to our Ampersand app, where Sequoia founders can share advice and explore a library of Company Design resources.</p>



<p>Six weeks into hosting Arc Europe, it’s been incredible to watch how these founders are already bending the arc of their companies, and we are excited for the first Americas cohort to embark on the same transformative journey.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“I love how each week takes a deep dive into a specific topic. Arc has provided me the knowledge, tools and network to bring Xelda to the global stage. I feel there’s no limit to what Xelda can achieve with the support of this group.”</p>India Healy O’Connor, Xelda</blockquote>



<p>Each week of the Arc curriculum is focused on a different question—such as “Who are you building for?” “How do you find traction?” and “How do you win talent?” As we work together to find the answers to those questions, the company’s story takes shape.</p>


 Founders explore Company Design cards at Sequoia’s London office. 


<p>Participants learn to articulate their unique founder story, as well as the stories of their customer, their product, their culture and their business. Each module builds on the next, starting with what makes an outlier and ending with understanding and sharing the scale of your company’s ambition—with critical lessons about how to get there learned along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“I thought I understood customer obsession and all it entailed. Being shown what true customer obsession looks like immediately changed how we see our customers and how we interact with them at every level.”</p>Ciaran O’Keefe, Akeero</blockquote>



<p>In the final week, founders synthesize the company story they’ll use in recruiting critical early hires, and present those stories to a group of Sequoia partners, visiting instructors and potential customers, getting feedback to help them grow.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Learning about the early days of legendary companies directly from the operators and founders who built them has massively raised both my personal ambition and my ambition for what we can achieve with Telescope.”</p>Camin McClusky, Telescope</blockquote>



<p>The first Arc Americas will take place September 12 through October 28, with Weeks 1 and 7 on-site at Sequoia’s offices in Menlo Park, a field trip during week 4 and the rest of the program held remotely. Applications are open through July 22. <a href="https://arc.sequoiacap.com/">Learn more and apply here.</a></p>

 The biggest Hacker House till date — Web3Auth and Solana Team Up in Bengaluru With unseen or unheard of early morning queues to enter the venue, the Solana x Web3Auth HH in Bengaluru turned out be a mega&nbsp;event<p>Earlier this year we made a special <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/solana-and-web3auth-team-up-to-organize-an-unforgettable-6-day-hacker-house-f78b95f9d2e9">announcement</a> about co-organizing 4 global Hacker Houses with Solana. The first such collaboration took place in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/solana-and-web3auth-team-up-to-organize-an-unforgettable-6-day-hacker-house-f78b95f9d2e9">Singapore</a> in February this year over 6 unforgettable days.</p><p>Regarding the next collaboration, we asked our folks on Twitter on where they thought we would be next and guess what, they got it right. Bengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India was indeed to become our second destination for the global&nbsp;tour.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth/status/1511300534048739339">@web3auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Highest Turnout Ever<br>India has one of the biggest developer communities in the world and not surprisingly, the event received way more registrations than the venue could accommodate. What happened as a result? A long queue that has never been seen in any of the Solana Hacker House conducted anywhere in the&nbsp;world.</p>Image from Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta">https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta</a><p>The participants mostly included enterprising college going folks between the age&nbsp;17–21.</p><p>We caught hold of 14-year old X to find out why he was at the Hacker House (and not in&nbsp;school)</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1532241513299578881">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Office Hours with Team&nbsp;Web3Auth</p><p>Fresh from participating at two major blockchain events, first at the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/what-happened-ethamsterdam22-89562c5e8d18">Paris Blockchain Week</a> and later at <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-at-the-paris-blockchain-week-2022-2a26345c9c06">ETHAmsterdam</a>, team Web3Auth was present in full force at the Bengaluru Hacker House. Web3Auth offered office hours which were attended by different participants. The Web3Auth team patiently spent time answering queries of different kinds ranging from UI/UX to user on-boarding to privacy and security.</p><p>Influencers on Stage — Tanmay Bhat and Biswa Kalyan&nbsp;Rath</p><p>Two major star attractions at the event were two of India’s most famous stand-up comedians. However, only one of them was at the event in capacity as a comic and that was Biswa Kalyan Rath who performed on the second day of the event leaving the young crowd thoroughly entertained.

<p>Before the PriFi (private finance) scene emerged, people looked into Bitcoin tumblers and privacy coins as the only means to exert their on-chain privacy.<br></p><p>Privacy is not only a fundamental right but a foundation upon which many other human rights are built. When we speak of privacy, we speak about privacy of body, correspondence, data, finance, identity, location, and territory. <br></p><p>However, when it comes to financial privacy, there isn’t much we can do to exert our rights, considering the limitations of our traditional financial institutions. When Bitcoin emerged as an alternative to the current global monetary system, there was hope — a hope to uphold our right to financial privacy with a completely new system that doesn’t rely on third-party or trust-based models.<br></p><p>With the rapid rise of blockchain forensics, analysis tools, and the inherent open nature of public blockchain networks, all transactions are open for everyone to see. This makes it impossible to transact privately on an open ledger.<br></p><p>Because of this, many users constantly wonder how to send crypto privately and if this is doable at all. In this article, we’ll explore the popular methods through which one can send crypto privately. These methods can be broadly categorized into three distinct categories, as mentioned before:<br></p>  Crypto mixers (or Bitcoin tumblers)  Privacy coins  Privacy solutions <br>  <p>We will also address common questions on how to use the blockchain privately and how privacy coins and cryptocurrency mixers work. <br></p><p>Let’s get started.</p> How do Bitcoin tumblers work? <p>Crypto mixers, also known as Bitcoin tumblers (even tho they can support a wide variety of crypto assets, including ERC-20 tokens), allow users to transact with their cryptocurrencies privately. They work by pooling together funds from different sources and then allowing users to withdraw from the pool to a destination address of their choice. Since the funds are lumped together and then distributed at random times, examining the trails behind exact coins and their new destinations becomes particularly hard, helping users gain privacy.<br></p><p>The dynamics of crypto mixers can be explained through an analogy: If you take ten $100 notes from ten people and put them all together in a bag, it is unlikely that each person will have the same note they put in if you ask them to retrieve their notes. If you then play around with factors such as the order of retrieval, where notes are delivered, in what order and at what times, it becomes even more difficult to track the transaction trail of an exact note.<br></p><p>Bitcoin tumblers follow a similar model. If more people contribute, it gets progressively harder to trace which note originally belonged to whom. Crypto or Bitcoin mixers create private pools and muddle them before sending coins out to pre-set recipient wallets.</p>Diagram showcasing how crypto mixers work (<a href="https://www.coincenter.org/education/advanced-topics/what-are-mixers-and-privacy-coins/">Source</a>).<p></p><p>There are two main types of cryptocurrency mixers. They are sufficiently different, although they stay true to the founding idea of how Bitcoin mixers work. <br></p>  Centralized mixers (tumblers) will receive your Bitcoin or tokens and send it to a designated address for a fee.<br>  Decentralized mixers are built on the blockchain and use a protocol to receive and send identical amounts of Bitcoins or tokens. They usually use a peer-to-peer or coordinated approach and involve many people, usually in the hundreds.   Benefits of crypto mixers (Bitcoin tumblers) <p>Regular cryptocurrency transactions are traceable and can be sufficiently proven by exchanges. If the coins you bought were involved in illegal activities (such as black market transactions), a crypto exchange could freeze your funds even if you weren’t complicit in that behavior. The traceability of blockchain transactions and KYC verification exercise make it possible for crypto exchanges to figure out and reveal the identity of persons involved in a certain blockchain transaction.<br></p><p>With mixers, the idea of untraceable cryptocurrency transactions is possible.<br></p><p>Cryptocurrency mixers help you stay private as you transact on the blockchain, keeping your dealings away from the public eye, preserving your identity, and obscuring sensitive information on the transactions you have made.</p> Flaws of Bitcoin tumblers <p>If you remove the benefit of keeping transactions and identities private from the picture, little is left regarding the benefits of using cryptocurrency mixers. Firstly, one major flaw of crypto mixers is supporting only one asset type at a time and only in a determinate amount (e.g. only in batches of 1 BTC at a time per mixer), thus severely limiting their privacy prospect.<br></p><p>Most crypto mixing services also operate in legal obscurity and might get you in trouble if your jurisdiction introduces a law against them and applies it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law">retrospectively</a>. On top of that, the unchartered territory of crypto mixers is riddled with scams, seizures, outright fraud, and shutdowns.<br></p><p>Fraudulent services aside, some cryptocurrency mixers provide somewhat flawed privacy. With the help of blockchain forensics and analytics firms, law enforcement agencies can <a href="https://protos.com/bitcoin-mixing-coinjoin-wasabi-chainalysis-samourai-privacy-wallet/">bypass</a> some of the mixing models these services use. This is particularly true when it comes to KYC’d accounts in centralized exchanges, for example.<br></p><p>Major crypto exchanges like Binance have begun blocking crypto transactions originating from mixers or freezing the accounts of users receiving or sending funds connected to mixing services. These companies cite money laundering and compliance with existing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/as-fatf-regulations-galvanize-crypto-mixing-applications-are-targeted/">regulations</a> as the reasons behind the clampdown, and they are not far from the truth.<br></p><p>Another problem with mixers is – how to make them profitable or even self-sustaining? It is the reason several current schemes are broken. Furthermore, these mixers often request users to withdraw the exact number of coins they put in, and only accept one type of asset. This makes mixers inconvenient and limits the scope of the privacy they're able to provide.<br></p><p>In essence, crypto and Bitcoin tumblers aren’t ideal for financial privacy because their flaws pose some unique challenges, particularly on the compliance side. Even though mixers aren’t inherently bad, they might be better positioned to succeed if they tackled regulatory concerns first and foremost.</p> All about privacy coins <p>A second popular way through which one can send crypto privately is through privacy coins. Unlike open ledger networks such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, privacy coins can offer greater obscurity.<br></p><p>By creating Layer-1 blockchains that are inherently more private than their pseudonymous counterparts, privacy coins go beyond what is possible with crypto mixers. This has attracted attention from privacy enthusiasts, financial regulators, and exchanges alike.<br></p> How do private cryptocurrencies work? <p>Privacy coins keep the flow of money on their networks from the public eye, usually by restricting vital information involved in a transaction (e.g.,wallet addresses, transaction amounts, senders’ and receivers’ wallet addresses, etc.) from public view. If you send a private coin to another address, other users cannot access the details of the transaction, as is the practice with Bitcoin and other open blockchain networks.<br></p><p>Popular examples of privacy coins are Zcash and Monero, which employ different methods to achieve privacy. <br></p><p>Monero uses three different mechanisms to hide transaction data. First, users send or receive coins with stealth addresses, which resemble one-time passwords that cannot be used twice. Then, Monero uses ring signatures to mix up actual transactions with old and fake transactions and ringCT, a privacy technology, to hide the transaction amount.<br></p>Diagram showing how Monero’s untraceable payments work (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/">Source</a>).<p></p><p>Zcash employs a different mechanism, incorporating an optional switch between transacting publicly and privately. The network receives a message validating each private transaction via zero-knowledge proofs, and this message withholds any additional information on the transaction. <br></p><p>Other examples of privacy coins include Beam, Grin, and PIVX.<br></p> How can you use privacy coins? <p>On a fundamental level, privacy coins operate in a similar fashion as those within open ledger blockchains. Like their counterparts, they hold qualities such as immutability, verifiability, distribution, and decentralization. As such, you can send or receive privacy coins with a cold or hot wallet, and some are available for trading on centralized exchanges. However, many exchanges like Coinbase UK and <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bittrex-to-delist-privacy-coins-monero-dash-and-zcash-2021-01-01">Bittrex Global</a> have recently delisted privacy coins.<br></p><p>To use Monero ($XMR), for instance, you would need a Monero GUI wallet. After setting up the wallet, you can buy $XMR on a centralized exchange or through a peer-to-peer network and transfer your coins to a Monero wallet. <br></p><p>Other private currencies like Zcash are also available on centralized exchanges, offering optional privacy functions like PrivateSend for Dash and shielded transactions for Zcash (ZEC).</p> Pros and cons of privacy coins <p>Like every innovation in the crypto space, privacy coins have their good side and also come with certain flaws. <br></p><p>For starters, you can keep your financial information away from the public with privacy coins, regaining control over how much information you want to disclose online.<br></p><p>A privacy coin keeps the details of transactions hidden, protecting the identities of both parties against third-party privacy violations. The record of such transactions exists, but the sending and receiving addresses, and the amounts involved, are unavailable to the public.<br></p><p>On the flip side, privacy coins occupy a precarious position on the books of centralized exchanges. Remember that we mentioned how you could access privacy coins through centralized exchanges? Under the Financial Action Task Force Travel Rule, exchanges are required to share information on transactions with law enforcement agencies on request. The absence of clarity on this subject has made certain exchanges <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/state-of-the-privacy-coin-fatf-pushes-delisting-and-exclusion/">delist</a> privacy coins.<br></p><p>Also, the question of legality hangs in the air. In some jurisdictions, privacy coins are as good as illegal, with their trading fully banned in South Korea. The United States is towing a different path, focusing on developing technology to crack privacy on the blockchain. They even offered a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/09/14/irs-will-pay-up-to-625000-if-you-can-crack-monero-other-privacy-coins/?sh=3db27e1b85cc">$625,000</a> bounty to anyone who could crack the Monero network.<br><br></p><p>Besides issues around legality, privacy coins seriously lag behind in terms of DeFi innovation. Open ledger networks such as Ethereum, with its Layer-2 solutions, are massively ahead in terms of offering a range of decentralized financial services such as lending, borrowing, stablecoins, etc. This limits the use of privacy coins to simple transactions, making them less attractive in comparison.<br></p><p>The lack of privacy in the existing DeFi ecosystem then raises an important question: what can we do to incorporate privacy into what already exists? This is where Panther comes into the picture to solve a previously unsolvable problem.<br></p> What is Panther Protocol? <p>In the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), the public nature of most L1 blockchains, while offering transparency, has the side effect of robbing traders of their advantages. Alphas and strategies become non-existent or less effective when surveillance and observation of a DeFi user's strategy and transaction records are possible. <br></p><p>With Panther, DeFi users can keep their transactions private while ensuring compliance with regulations as they trade on the blockchain. Panther integrates with the existing DeFi ecosystems on multiple chains rather than trying to reinvent the parts of them (e.g., protocols, underlying structures, etc.) that are currently most popular and in use. Through this, Panther aims to create a cross-chain interoperable privacy-preserving DeFi ecosystem for all players to thrive.</p> The technology behind Panther <p>Panther restores privacy through zAssets, versions of regular digital assets that enhance privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/26/snarks.html">zk-SNARK</a> cryptography (short for zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge) allows users to provide proof of transactions without giving up sensitive information, ensuring compliance without violating privacy rights.<br></p>Panther’s unique architecture, from <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/panther-protocol-v-1-0-1.pdf">our whitepaper.</a><p></p><p>Panther's zAssets operate across several blockchains and allow users to protect their privacy as they interact with DeFi applications. Presently, Panther is building on several networks, including Elrond, Ethereum, NEAR, Polygon, Flare, and more. Panther’s native token $ZKP governs the Panther ecosystem and is used to reward users for enabling the protocol’s privacy.</p> Using Panther Protocol <p>DeFi traders can mint zAssets by depositing their corresponding digital assets into Multi-Asset Shielded Pools (MASPs). They can then use their zAssets across different blockchains through a system of private bridges. Rewards are available for users that deposit and interact with the shielded pools.<br></p><p>For instance, when you deposit USDC into the pool, you can mint the corresponding privacy-enabled zAsset, zUSDC, which breaks the on-chain link and allows you to transact privately. After transacting, you can redeem your deposited USDC to a new stealth address, and the zUSDC is removed from circulation.<br></p><p>Panther also supports a feature called Panther Reveals, which allows you to disclose parts or the totality of your DeFi history if required by KYC verification, regulators, and financial institutions.</p> Final thoughts <p>The discussion around the subject of privacy on the blockchain may never cease. Users continue to clamor for increased privacy while regulators grow wary of the solutions currently in the market. Cryptocurrency mixers and privacy coins have enhanced users' privacy on the blockchain, but this has come at the cost of coming under scrutiny due to their lack of compliance concerns.<br></p><p>Panther solves this dilemma with a comprehensive solution, ensuring users can send and receive cryptocurrencies privately and compliantly. Panther offers an end-to-end DeFi solution that enhances trust on the blockchain and gives users control over the information they share. <br></p><p>The future of privacy will thrive in an ecosystem where there’s no additional cost or barrier for a law-abiding citizen to exercise their right to privacy. We’re at an important juncture of building a decentralized financial world – a global monetary system built on the ethos of transparent, private, and censorship-resistant. <br></p><p>It’s time to realize that our right to financial privacy cannot be ignored while building an open financial system.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 web3 on the platform of your choice — a closer look at Coinbase Wallet’s multi-platform approach <p>Tl;dr: The replatforming of Coinbase Wallet’s mobile app reflects our commitment to improving access to web3. In this blog, we discuss why the transition to React Native marks a critical turning point for both our users and our technical teams.</p><p>By Chintan Turakhia, Director of Coinbase Wallet Engineering, and Dan Coffman, Coinbase Wallet React Native&nbsp;Lead</p><p>gm</p><p>This week, we <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/making-web3-more-accessible-and-intuitive-meet-the-new-coinbase-wallet-mobile-app-6a29b6a71896">announced</a> the debut of Coinbase Wallet’s new mobile iOS and Android apps built using React Native. This launch marks a critical inflection point for Coinbase Wallet and its users, and we’d like to shed light on the motivation and journey to get&nbsp;here.</p><p>Our goal with Coinbase Wallet is to be the default gateway to the web3 ecosystem. We debuted a mobile app on iOS and Android in 2017 to make the benefits of crypto, self-custody, and the nascent dapp ecosystem accessible to all — regardless of network or blockchain, country or currency, crypto savvy or crypto beginner.</p><p>In 2021, we saw an uptick in web3 engagement via desktop, driven largely by NFTs and DeFi dapps. This led us to launch a Coinbase Wallet <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coinbase-wallet-extension/hnfanknocfeofbddgcijnmhnfnkdnaad?hl=en">browser extension</a> using React, providing users with the option to engage with the crypto economy on a desktop platform. This also gave our product, engineering, and design teams an opportunity to entirely rethink how a self-custody product should look and feel for power users as well as newcomers to&nbsp;web3.</p><p>Launching the browser extension unfortunately meant that our engineering teams now needed to code the same features for three different platforms, since Wallet’s browser extension, iOS, and Android apps leveraged different codebases. And as a consequence, our shipping velocity on extension far exceeded our pace on mobile. We knew that this wasn’t a viable long term solution to keep up with the innovation in web3. In order to maximize efficiency of our developers and designers as well as ship a consistently reliable, safe, and simple multi-chain wallet on all platforms, we would need to migrate our mobile products into a common framework.</p><p>Enter React&nbsp;Native.</p> Build once, ship everywhere <p>We embrace the mantra of build once and ship everywhere. Replatforming Coinbase Wallet’s mobile apps to React Native means we can more easily ship new features to Wallet’s browser extension, iOS, and Android apps in tandem, streamlining workflows and allowing us to deliver the same great user experience across desktop and&nbsp;mobile.</p><p>In 2020, the Coinbase app successfully <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/announcing-coinbases-successful-transition-to-react-native-af4c591df971">transitioned</a> from native mobile to React Native, a software framework which allows us to ship the same TypeScript code and React UI on both iOS and Android. Our goal since then was simple: leverage those paved roads to ship a highly performant mobile app while affording users a consistent design experience using the Coinbase Design System (CDS). We were able to quickly leverage paved roads including react navigation, deeplinking, and configuration in&nbsp;code.</p><p>By unifying our Coinbase Wallet mobile app and browser extension into a single data layer that handles all business logic, we can continue to ship products quickly across three platforms. We moved away from class-based RxJS and shifted to functional context-based repos to enable greater leverage of React core libraries. The additional challenge was migrating the data layer while continuing to build and ship features on the Extension. Web3 pauses for nobody, and so we carefully orchestrated the replacement of our entire Wallet engine while still&nbsp;flying.</p><p>Wallet will also be able to bring new features to market in a fraction of the time. A recent example of this is our DeFi portfolio, which took two months to build for the Wallet browser extension and only five days to port to our new React Native mobile app. The majority of complex logic resided in the data layer, and since these are now shared between all platforms, we were able to build it once and ship it to all platforms. Only client UI for mobile was remaining, and fortunately, with a common CDS, porting UI elements to mobile was simple. Thanks to these types of efficiencies, we expect to see the velocity at which Wallet launches new products continue to increase in the months to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Not only will users benefit from Wallet delivering features faster, the mobile experience as a whole will be snappier, more responsive, and more reliable.</p> Bridging the&nbsp;gap <p>Several of the features we released over the past year were built for the Wallet extension and have yet to be introduced to the Wallet mobile app. With our migration to React Native, we’re launching now ready to launch several great features in the mobile app for the first time, including support for storing, sending, and receiving Solana and SPL tokens, real-time price charts, an in-app dapp browser, token management, and a DeFi portfolio view.</p><p>How do you port 110+ features on a new React Native tech stack, while adding new functionality to the existing Chrome Extension platform all the while maintaining the existing Native mobile product? The common data layer was a force multiplier which enabled the team to keep building features for extension which would seamlessly port to RN mobile. We also prioritized feature parity of our existing mobile product while maintaining a high bar for quality and performance through benchmarking.</p><p>The team built foundations for a scalable and extensible performance monitoring system to measure client-side performance of the new app, including page load, UI thread blocking time and app responsiveness for every commit. We optimized loading and screen render times using a bespoke incremental rendering solution, memoizing components, and optimizing expensive hook computations. We also shipped countless improvements to the data layer through batching state updates and optimizing caching strategies, which benefited asset and NFT loading on both the new react native app and extension.</p> More than a fresh coat of&nbsp;paint <p>If you’ve noticed the new look-and-feel of the mobile app, it reflects much more than a fresh coat of paint. Coinbase Wallet is now an integral part of the Coinbase Design&nbsp;System.</p><p>Coinbase’s Design System is a robust architecture of reusable design and motion components built within React. We’ve found that the CDS enables our product, engineering, and design teams to focus on building high-quality product experiences while ensuring a consistent experience for users across Coinbase products. Beautiful design elements, like the motion-driven “warm welcome” that greets new users, are just a small preview of how we are providing a visually rich experience for a global audience.</p><p>Since Coinbase Wallet’s browser extension was built using this design system, desktop users will now enjoy a more consistent experience within Wallet’s mobile app. As an added bonus of this consistent approach, users who are familiar with Coinbase’s flagship app will immediately feel at home in Coinbase Wallet’s new mobile experience.</p><p>Another exciting result of this work is Wallet users now have an opportunity to personalize their mobile experience. Our research showed that users prefer dark mode, so the mobile app will open in dark mode by default. We’re also adding the ability to select a theme color for Coinbase Wallet, which can be selected in the Settings&nbsp;tab.</p> Looking ahead <p>The new Coinbase Wallet mobile app began rolling out globally across <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-wallet-nfts-crypto/id1278383455">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.toshi&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a> this week, and we expect the rollout to be complete over the next few weeks. Make sure your app is up to date by visiting the App Store on iOS or Google Play on Android, and follow <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbasewallet">@CoinbaseWallet</a> on Twitter for the latest news and&nbsp;updates.</p><p>Coinbase Wallet is a self-custody wallet providing software services subject to Coinbase Wallet <a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.

 Introducing Privy’s new&nbsp;look <p>I wish this title were a computer science joke. It’s not. We’re just very excited to introduce our new look. Thank you to the great team at <a href="https://unfold.co/">Unfold</a> for working with us on this redesign.</p>We’ve taken to calling it&nbsp;blobby What’s in a&nbsp;brand? <p>The French say “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/l%27habit_ne_fait_pas_le_moine">the clothes do not make the monk</a>” and we recognize this: Privy is only as good as its APIs are useful. We are here to build simple, powerful developer tools to help you manage user data safely and put users back in control of their data on the web. That is our core&nbsp;mission.</p><p>And yet, we also recognize the power of brands to create movements and foster community. Here are a few we look up&nbsp;to:</p><p><a href="http://uniswap.org">Uniswap</a></p><p>We’d know that hot pink anywhere. Yes, they may be building an AMM, but from the horse 🦄 to the socks 🧦, you can tell they care about their art. (June 22 edit — <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/genie">indeed they&nbsp;do</a>).</p><p><a href="http://flashbots.net">Flashbots</a></p><p>You recognize a Flashbots team member from the ⚡🤖 and the <a href="https://twitter.com/Yamer">Yamer</a> pfp. Along with their comically understated site, these are hackers first and foremost. They ship code, with a&nbsp;purpose.</p><p><a href="http://dune.xyz">Dune</a></p><p>The website, the palette. This is about information architecture and surfacing data, plain and simple&nbsp;📈.</p> Enter Blobby <p>We built Privy to help developers delight their users without putting them at risk. It’d be a shame for us not to find delight in our own&nbsp;work.</p><p>As a developer, dealing with user data must become simple again. You should be able to build wonderful products without stripping your users of control, or putting your product and org at risk. Privacy is table-stakes. More than that, our data future will unlock new, interesting experiences on the Web. It must be secure, engaging and&nbsp;playful.</p>What do you leave behind as you surf the&nbsp;web?<p>We’ve done our best to convey a sense of this across our work. We hope you’ll like&nbsp;it.</p> Privacy as a&nbsp;prism Before /&nbsp;After<p>The new carries with it some of the old. Simple as it was, part of our old logo tried to convey change; that user identity is not uniform or fixed in time, but depends on time, place, counterparty, etc. So too, the data you&nbsp;present.</p><p>So why does the same unshakable data trail follow you throughout the web?You would not wear the same outfit to church, the office, or a club. And so while the clothes do not make the monk, you should get to pick what you wear&nbsp;online.</p><p>We see our new mascot as a version of what you can be online: your astral projection on the web, changing as you surf to continually protect and delight you. That’s the future we are building&nbsp;toward.</p><p>This brand will evolve along with our APIs, our org and the web and we can’t wait to help it&nbsp;morph.</p><p>In case you were wondering: <a href="https://hot-alphabet-53c.notion.site/Privy-Careers-b4a51920dc5548e9b0f53bd0c7c186b0">yes, we are still hiring.</a> We’d love for you to come shape Privy with&nbsp;us.</p>We can’t wait to see what we build&nbsp;together<p>Exciting times&nbsp;ahead!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/new-threads-who-dis-cc6b2e054c2e">New threads, who dis?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Private, independent search engine exits beta phase on its first anniversary, with innovative features that help users de-Google their search</p>
<p>One year ago, <a>we launched Brave Search</a> to give everyone online a real choice over Big Tech: a privacy-protecting, unbiased alternative to Google and Bing, and a truly independent alternative to providers—such as DuckDuckGo or Startpage—that rely on Big Tech to run.</p>
<p>Today, Brave Search is exiting its beta phase. It’s the default search engine for most new Brave browser users, and any user can search privately using Brave Search in their favorite browser by going to search.brave.com. It’s had rapid user growth, released a slew of innovative features, and challenged the Big Tech monopolies head on. All while staying true to core principles:</p>
 
 Independence: We serve results from our own built-from-scratch index of the Web 
 Privacy: We don’t track you, your searches, or your clicks 
 User-first: We put you first, not the advertising or data industries 
 Transparency: We don’t censor, bias, filter, or downrank results (unless legally required to) 
 Seamlessness: Brave can offer a best-in-class integration between the browser and search—from personalization to instant results as you type—without compromising privacy 
 
<p>To celebrate this one-year anniversary, we’d like to take a moment to highlight growth, give a sneak peek of Goggles, and review other innovative features of Brave Search.</p>

 Unparalleled growth 
<p>Brave Search has grown faster than any search provider since Bing. Some numbers:</p>
 
 2.5 billion queries in the past 365 days 
 A high of 14.1 million queries per day 
 5 billion queries annualized (projection based on current monthly totals) 
 
<p>For comparison, it took Google <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Search.html?id=FAJ9DAAAQBAJ">more than a year</a> to reach 2.5 billion queries, and DuckDuckGo <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic">more than 4 years</a>.</p>
<p>While we’ll never stop improving, in many regions Brave Search already has a level of quality that competes with other established search engines such as Google and Bing. Thanks to this quality, growth, new features, and continued rise in global independence scores, we’re pleased to announce that we’re removing the “beta” label from Brave Search.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>“Since launching one year ago, Brave Search has prioritized independence and innovation in order to give users the privacy they deserve. The Web is changing, and our incredible growth shows that there is demand for a new player that puts users first,” said Josep M. Pujol, Chief of Search at Brave. “Today we’re releasing Goggles to alter the way search has traditionally been done and to put users in charge at last. The world is too diverse for a single ranking, so Goggles opens search ranking and filtering transparently for everyone to use, share, and improve.”</p>

 Search without limits: Goggles beta release 
<p>We’re excited to announce the long-awaited beta release of an innovative new Brave Search feature: Goggles. Goggles will enable anyone, or any community of people, to create sets of rules and filters to constrain the searchable space and / or alter the ordering of search results. Anyone could then choose to apply a Goggle—or extend it—to their view of Brave Search results. Essentially, Goggles will act as a re-ranking option on top of the Brave Search index.</p>
<p>This means that, instead of a single ranking, Brave Search can offer an almost limitless number of ranking options, enabling search use-cases that could be too specific for a general purpose search engine. While Brave Search doesn’t have editorial biases, all search engines have some level of intrinsic bias. Goggles allows for users to counter any intrinsic biases in the algorithm.</p>
<p>Brave Search is committed to openness in search. It does not manipulate its algorithm to bias, filter, or down-rank results (unless it’s compelled by law to do so). Contrast this with the world’s two largest search providers—Google and Bing—who <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-google-interferes-with-its-search-algorithms-and-changes-your-results-11573823753?mod=hp_lead_pos10">openly manipulate their rankings based on political leanings or other factors</a>.</p>
<p>Goggles takes this commitment to openness a step further by allowing users to choose, alter, or extend the ranking of Brave Search results. In the sample query “search engine” below, you’ll see the power of Goggles in action. You can see that a simple query that would normally favor more common news outlets instead here shows results from individual bloggers.</p>



    



    


    


    
    




    



    


    


    
    

<p>Goggles can work much the same way for any topic, any media, any website. With Goggles, users can search without Big Tech’s bias—they can search without limits.</p>
 
 
<p>To get started with the Goggles beta, simply conduct a search at search.brave.com and click the Goggles tab on the results page.</p>
 
 
<p>Anybody can make Goggles, use ones created by others, and see the source code for already existing Goggles—and extend it—by <a href="https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart">visiting the Github repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Read the full <a>Goggles white paper</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The Goggles available at launch (listed below) are demos, created by Brave for educational purposes only, and to showcase the Goggles’ syntax and their simplicity. They’re meant as examples so users can understand the impact and potential for new Goggles, and developers can extend or fork them. Brave will not actively maintain or extend those Goggles, and will delete these specific Goggles once the community has begun building their own.</p>
 
 
<p>Tech blogs—Rerank results to boost content found on technical blogs.</p>
 
 
<p>Hacker News—Prioritizes domains popular with the Hacker News community, minus those that would rank among the top 1000 most-viewed websites.</p>
 
 
<p>No Pinterest—Rerank results to remove pages / threads hosted on Pinterest.</p>
 
 
<p>Rust programming—Rerank results to boost content related to the Rust programming language.</p>
 
 
<p>Copycats removal—Rerank results to remove “copycat” content (e.g. StackOverflow threads or GitHub translations).</p>
 
 
<p>1k short—Rerank results to remove pages found on the top 1,000 most-viewed websites.</p>
 
 The lists of tech blogs are drawn from multiple sources, including blogsurf.io and refined.blog, and not vetted by Brave. The list of top sites in the “1k short” Goggle are drawn from tranco-list.eu. Newly up-ranked sites are not vetted by Brave. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Community engagement with Goggles has already started. The team at <a href="https://allsides.com/">Allsides</a> has built Goggles based on their knowledge of political biases in the media. Note that Brave is not affiliated with any of the Goggles’ independent creators.</p>
 
 Left-leaning sources—Rerank results to boost content from left-leaning sources. 
 Right-leaning sources—Rerank results to boost content from right-leaning sources. 
 
 
 

 Discussions 
<p>Brave Search isn’t just about offering a newer, more private alternative to the same old search. We’re also adding brand new features to improve search results.</p>
<p>In addition to Goggles, <a>in April, 2022 we announced</a> Discussions. With Discussions, search results on Brave Search are augmented with actual conversations related to the query, pulled from popular forum sites including Reddit. This allows users to easily see what various communities are saying about a topic, rather than just reading content curated by websites.</p>
<p>Discussions bring multiple points of view to search, and a readymade method—upvotes and likes—to measure an answer’s quality. They also allow Brave Search to combat the so-called “SEO spam” that’s <a href="https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying">become so prominent on Google</a>. Brave Search is already better than other search engines at handling SEO content—with Discussions, we’re enhancing results even more to bring real human conversations (and answers) right to the search results page.</p>

 How we’ve grown 
<p>Of course privacy, independence, and innovation are nice. But search lives and dies on accuracy. From the beginning, we set out to build a search engine that delivers the quality, nuance, and depth that people expect from Google or Bing. And we set ourselves that mission all while committing to stay true to our principles.</p>
<p>So Brave Search then became an enormous engineering challenge: How to build the index—and the ranking algorithm—without collecting user data? We came up with a handful of ways:</p>
 
 <a>The Web Discovery Project</a>: A privacy-preserving way for users to anonymously contribute browsing data, and thus improve the coverage and quality of Brave Search. 
 <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/google-fallback">Fallback mixing</a>: An anonymous way for Brave to check Google in cases where our index isn’t complete or refined enough (especially for “long-tail” queries), and “mix” the results for you. 
 <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/anonymous-local-results">Anonymous local results</a>: A way for Brave Search to serve localized search results (e.g. for the query “restaurants near me”) without knowing your physical location or broadcasting your IP address. 
 <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/feedback">Listening to your feedback</a>: We have a strong community of Brave Search users who provide feedback, requests, and suggestions on everything from results, features, infoboxes and widgets, and more. And we act on as much of this feedback as we can. 
 

 Independence scores 
<p>Together, the above show it is possible to thread the needle: to both improve the index for all users, and preserve their privacy and anonymity online. In addition to the rapid growth Brave has seen, we’re also checking another metric to measure the success of this mission: the independence score.</p>
<p>In isolation, this score—shown for both individuals and users globally—is a measure of the percentage of our results served directly from the Brave Search index. But it also does something much more important: It ensures free access to information, without Big Tech’s manipulation. Search engines that depend too much, or exclusively, on Big Tech are subject to their censorship, biases, and editorial decisions. The Web needs multiple search providers—without choice there’s no freedom.</p>
<p>Brave is building an alternative to what already exists, not window dressing the same old thing.</p>
 
 The global independence score for all Brave Search users is 92% 
 This is up from 87% when Brave Search first launched one year ago 
 



    



    


    


    
    


 Let me de-Google that for you (LMDGTFY) 
<p>When Brave first acquired the Tailcat team and began to lay the foundation for Brave Search, we knew what we were up against: The monolith of Google. It was audacious enough to take on a global brand that dominates 85% of search volume and over 60% of desktop browser usage worldwide. Doing so in a way that preserved user privacy and relied on an independently built index of the Web was a huge challenge. But it was consistent with Brave’s mission of putting users first and fixing the Web.</p>
<p>Coupled with our privacy browser, Brave now provides the first truly viable, private browser+search alternative to the Big Tech platforms. We’re making it seamless for users to browse and search with guaranteed privacy, all while fighting the censorship and overreach of Big Tech companies. And, rather than just offer a privacy-first copy of Google, we’re continuing to innovate with features such as Discussions and Goggles.</p>
<p>Ever hear the phrase “Let me Google that for you?” How about letting Brave de-Google that for you instead?</p>

  CBDCs are far from how they were initially conceptualized, as revealed by Oliver Gale, founder of the first digital dollar project.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The current concept of CBDCs is diametrically different from the values cryptocurrencies initially embodied. <br></p><p>State-controlled, opaque, fully-surveilled exchange networks within which only government-issued currencies are used certainly differ from Bitcoin, a decentralized public network of democratically- mined money. <br></p><p>But what if we told you CBDCs were not always meant to be this way?<br></p><p>This is the story of how our co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, got involved in the invention of CBDCs, stepped away for ideological reasons, and joined the fight for privacy in DeFi and Web3.<br></p> A digital dollar project in the sunny Caribbean<br> <p>Oliver, an early investor in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies (think Mastercoin days!), founded the first crypto exchange in the Caribbean, <a href="https://bitt.com/">Bitt.com</a>. He and his co-Founder quickly noticed the disruptive role cryptocurrencies could play in remittances, particularly within Oliver's native Barbados.<br></p><p>The founders realized that, with US dollars trading at a premium in Barbados, using BTC for remittances would be a lower-cost solution. Through this they hoped to create demand and adoption for BTC, increasing people’s access to decentralized finance.<br></p><p>The only problem was Bitcoin's volatility.<br></p><p>At the time, Tether had just launched using the BTC blockchain as its network. This inspired Oliver and the other founders to use the Colored Coins protocol to launch one of the first-ever stablecoins, the <a href="https://www.bitt.com/blog/why-has-bitt-created-barbados-digital-dollars-on-the-blockchain">Barbados Digital Dollar</a>. The stablecoin would make it easier to hold funds in the exchange and send remittances without users being afraid of losing money due to volatility along the process.</p> Which of course, got them blacklisted by banks<br> <p>A crypto exchange was not for the faint-hearted at the time. Traditional financial institutions might be <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">relatively open</a> to the idea of cryptocurrencies (even if they don't use them themselves) nowadays, but Bitt.com quickly got "de-risked" (a fancy word for “blacklisted”) by its local banks, operating under the direction of their correspondent banking overlords.<br></p>Oliver Gale on the Bitt days. ‌ ‌<p>Bitt.com, however, had proven that the blockchain was a superior alternative for many of the financial problems nations face. And the Barbados Digital Dollar project, taking advantage of distributed ledgers' auditability, accountability, distributed, and open-source nature, had certainly drawn some international attention.<br></p> Innovation always happens during crises (or how the digital dollar project was re-born)<br> <p>After hurricane Maria devastated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Caribbean_Currency_Union">Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU)</a>, governor of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), Timothy Antoine, called for innovation to help the region “develop a digital ecosystem from which [the] region can reap <a href="https://www.tbstat.com/wp/uploads/2020/08/KPMG-CBDC-Report.FINAL_.v.1.02.pdf">huge digital dividends</a>”<br></p><p>The natural disaster that brought great pain to the islands was a harsh wake-up call. The local authorities were forced to realize that reconstruction was going to be hard. Without financial and technological innovation that attracted capital and resources, the island's future would be far from insured.<br></p><p>This, along with the splash that Bitt had made, created a path for their financial services suite to receive the first-ever contract to deploy a CBDC into a production environment. And so the government got on board with the Eastern Caribbean Digital Dollar, $DXCD.<br></p> But governments seldom like true permissionless tools<br> <p>The project for the Eastern Caribbean Digital Dollar sounded like an ideal CBDC and was far from the projects we know today. <br></p><p>As originally projected, the DXCD would be legal tender, a bearer cash equivalent, with no risk of bank runs, no mechanisms for seizure or freezing someone's balance, or for unwarranted censorship. While initially open to the project, the Central Bank soon realized the implications of this and slightly shifted towards opting for a ledger they could control and audit. In their eyes, the project was to be launched on a permissioned blockchain, where they could freeze and seize assets and print money directly.<br></p><p>This ideological shift, the antithesis the original CBDC project, is what ultimately caused Oliver to leave the digital dollar project in 2018. <br></p> Do CBDCs have a future?<br> <p>When questioned about his current stance on CBDCs and government efforts to incorporate blockchain technologies, Oliver points out that nearly all forms of money since the dawn of civilization have been private. Private money, he says, "is necessary for honoring our fundamental freedoms and equal human rights."<br></p><p>Oliver also adds:<br></p><p>"We need private digital cash because it preserves fungibility. Bitcoin's traceability destroys fungibility.<br></p><p>I honestly believe that, when it's all said and done, all CBDCs will be privacy-enabled. They must protect their citizens and the nation itself from espionage, and if they don't embrace Privacy-Enhancing Technologies they won't have a future.<br></p><p>In the same way they now fight privacy finance, some argued in favor of <a href="https://reason.com/video/2020/10/21/cryptowars-gilmore-zimmermann-cryptography/">banning encryption in 1992</a>, predicting it would be used everywhere on the Internet and would facilitate criminal activities. Today it's instead used overwhelmingly as protection for honest users against bad actors in any website that involves payments or sign-ins. We wouldn't have Web 2.0 without encryption, and Web3 will eventually be equally reliant on privacy.<br></p><p>There is a greater benefit to society by being able to preserve your privacy on the Internet than there is a cost and risk of nefarious activity. It's a matter of tracking 0.001% of society against 99.999% of people having safety, security, freedom of speech, and the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/philosophy-legality-and-economics-of-privacy-how-privacy-spans-through-most-areas-of-our-lives-1b0d48945291/">right to privacy</a> as a matter of protection, human rights, and dignity.<br></p><p>You can police nefarious activities by targeting the access points where the protocols are used, not the protocols themselves. The Internet is a great example, as it is used for the good, the bad, and the ugly. It's not safe to have our underlying infrastructure be designed to disclose everything by default."<br></p> Why Panther<br> <p>For his next venture, Oliver wanted to build something that represented a step in the right direction for fundamental rights and freedoms. In Panther, which he conceptualized along with CTO and co-Founder Dr. Anish Mohammed, he saw a system that allowed people to have a choice. Regulatory compliance was a priority and fully possible, but Panther wouldn’t mandate it on people.<br></p><p>In Oliver's eyes, Panther is building the tools to enable a safer economy, allowing the properties of sound money to be delivered on Web3. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9/">Protocols like Panther</a> can translate privacy into confidentiality and then into safety. They allow users to disclose only the data they want, and only to who they want to. <br></p><p>To this day, Oliver is not entirely against CBDCs, provided they run on infrastructure that doesn't endanger their users. A fully digital economy is not to be feared, he says, if we create the right systems for this to happen. <br></p><p>Indeed, Oliver’s views seem to have been echoed across the industry. Noticing the reputation the initiative held, the <a href="http://cbdctt.com">CBDC think tank</a> (an independent group of academics that cooperates with government officials) <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3891121">published a paper</a> in relation to employ zero-knowledge proofs to support full privacy, even citing Zcash.<br></p> Creating a path<br> <p>When smart contracts were first conceptualized, they were seen as a computing renaissance in the crypto realm: thanks to them, some thought, we would be able to interact on-chain in ways entirely dictated by open-source code. This would all happen in the open, using hard assets, building from cryptocurrencies, the latest evolution in finance.<br></p><p>Today, we know that this comes with the danger of users being monitored, surveilled, and endangered. Should we not figure out a solution to total transparency, the alternative is closer to zero privacy. And this means censorship and tight controls.<br></p><p>The battle for individual financial empowerment is being fought in the field of encryption. And Panther is working hard to help take financial empowerment one step further.<br></p><p>Help us spread the word about privacy in DeFi by sharing this article!</p> Disclaimer <p>Olive Gale was interviewed for this article.

         Partnering with Deno: Application Development for the Modern Web            <p>Ryan, Bert and the Deno team are breathing new life into the server-side JavaScript ecosystem.</p>  <p>ByLauren Reeder and Mike Vernal</p><p>Published</p>       



            



 
 
   
<p>Today, we are incredibly excited to announce that we are partnering with Ryan Dahl, Bert Belder and the team at <a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a>.</p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, application development has moved to the cloud. If you want an auto-scaling database, a warehouse or a message bus, you have MongoDB, Snowflake or Confluent available at the click of a button. Yet for core application logic, developers still need to worry about pods, instances, versions, ports, regions and everything between. Whether it’s deciding to run your application in US-east1 or US-east2, or choosing the right instance type out of the dozens of options—it all feels archaic and far too complex.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t need to be that way. We deeply believe in a serverless future—one where developers can write their core logic in a simple, accessible way, and the cloud will be responsible for auto-scaling and globally distributing that code to all of the machines needed to serve their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also believe that in that future, Deno will be the easiest, fastest way to build applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ryan has been making full-stack application development dramatically more accessible for well over a decade. He is the creator of Node.js, which brought the power of JavaScript—and later TypeScript—outside of the browser and into the cloud. But as Ryan detailed in his 2018 presentation “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA">10 Things I Regret about Node.js</a>,” it was built in and for a different era. That’s why he and co-founder Bert created Deno: to bring the world a modern JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.</p>



<p>Deno has become <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno">tremendously popular</a> in the last four years; with more than 83k stars, it’s already nearly caught up to Node. The recent launch of <a href="https://deno.com/deploy">Deno Deploy</a> made it trivial to build serverless apps in a globally distributed way—and since then, Deno has seen strong adoption by both individual developers and as the new default environment for products such as <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/announcing-serverless-compute-with-edge-functions/">Netlify’s serverless Edge Functions</a> and <a href="https://deno.com/blog/supabase-functions-on-deno-deploy#:~:text=With%20Deno%2C%20Supabase%20Functions%20get,websites%2C%20services%2C%20and%20apps.">Supabase’s Functions</a>. For those customers and countless others, Deno is a much-needed breath of fresh air. No more puzzling over or tweaking instances or pods—just write your app with JS/TS with Deno and then deploy and auto-scale around the world.</p>



<p>But Ryan, Bert and their team are just getting started on their mission to make it dramatically easier to write global-scale web applications, and we are thrilled to partner with them on that journey by leading this Series A. If you’re interested in Deno, you can check it out <a href="https://deno.com/deploy">here</a>. And if you’d like to join the team, please reach out—they’re <a href="https://deno.com/jobs">hiring</a> now!</p>

<p>By Kian Paimani, Parity Technologies</p> Notable Contributions: Nomination Pools. <p>After deploying to Westend, we got numerous valuable bug reports and immediately it gave us some work to do. Most notably:</p>  The pool can now also `<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11426">chill</a>` itself. This is important for the pool dismantling scenario  Pool roles can now be <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11411">optional</a>. This is HUGE! A pool now can be created, and the pool operator can publicly express that they no longer wish to control a certain aspect of the pool, and leave it only to the governance. See the PR details for more info.  <p>To facilitate those who are interested in building on top of nomination pools: 1</p>  There’s a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/21/views/1">dedicated github project</a> for nomination pools now.  There’s a <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io">dedicated element room</a> for support and discussion.  <p>Thinking about contributing? Look for issues in the Substrate repo with the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AZ1-mentor">mentor tag</a>, or the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/projects/10">NPoS and Elections project</a>. All successful contributions will get an on-chain tip initiated by the staking team.</p><p>Also, if you are interested in contributing long-term, there’s a “<a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/parity/jobs/5064110003">Staking / PoS Engineer</a>” position available at Parity Technologies, targeting exactly those who will contribute to the staking system.</p> Nomination Pools: Detailed Release Schedule. <p>Kusama, as scheduled, has been upgraded to include Nomination pools in the v0.9.22 release. At the time of this writing, 50 pools are already active on kusama and earning rewards. There have also been <a href="https://www.dotreasury.com/ksm/tips">some tips</a> opened for some of them. </p><p>We initially planned to deploy the pools on Polkadot in v0.9.23, but some of the aforementioned PRs were not merged in time, this is now scheduled to happen in the v0.9.24 or v0.9.25 release.</p> More UI Changes <p>Parity has been working on a <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard">new UI for staking</a>, and it is finally ready for users to try out! Be aware that it is in beta phase for now.<br></p><p>Moreover, &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/7179#discussion_r874580712">Thanks to </a><a href="mailto:nikolaos@parity.io">Nikos Kontakis</a> ’s PR, the staking page of the Polkadot.js Apps will be totally revamped soon. </p><p><br>In the new UI, the overview page covers only some metrics and numbers, and the list of validators has been moved to a different page. These metrics aim to answer FAQ that most users deal with, such as:</p>  How much stake does a validator need to be in the active set?  How much stake does a nominator need to actively earn rewards? <br>  <p>Since these numbers basically cover the metrics that we had in our “By the Numbers” section here, we decided to remove that section henceforth. <br><br></p>

To that end, we put on weekly “Findora Fridays” designed to help developers understand how Findora works and how to get&nbsp;started.</p> Why Validate on&nbsp;Findora? <p>A big way for developers or retail users to partner with Findora is to become a validator to secure the&nbsp;network.</p><p>As with any other Proof of Stake network (PoS), validators are rewarded for securing the network. Findora offers both a block reward and the block proposer reward to validators and those that delegate funds with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Beyond the financial incentive, validating with Findora means you are contributing to the future of privacy in DeFi and Web3. Privacy is necessary to accelerate mass adoption because it is required by many institutions before they enter the&nbsp;space.</p><p>Though privacy sometimes has a negative connotation, it really serves as a financial primitive. Some use cases for privacy include private payroll, private markets that won’t reveal proprietary trading strategies, DAO signing of community wallets, and DAO voting without discrimination or intimidation. Validators on Findora will be part of&nbsp;that.</p><p>Watch the workshop <a href="https://youtu.be/NEc2dijbllM">here</a> or read a few highlights below.</p> Validator Best Practices <p>It’s recommended that validators use a cloud service like AWS or GCP services to run a node since this way, you don’t need to worry as much about downtime.</p><p>AWS and GCP have backup systems that can keep your nodes live. Self-hosting a validator node means that you may suffer from slashing penalties for power outages or hardware failures. When self-hosting a node, you will need to tend your node yourself or face slashing penalties for downtime.</p><p>Validators should keep in mind that their voting power is limited to 20% no matter how much they have staked on a node. Findora doesn’t want to incentivize the creation of whales, just “baby whales” with multiple nodes. The more nodes run on a network, the healthier and more secure it ends up&nbsp;being.</p> Slashing Stake <p>“Slashing stake” is when a network burns some of the tokens a validator and their delegators have staked as a penalty. It’s a critical mechanism all PoS networks have to incentivize good behavior and network&nbsp;health.</p><p>With Findora, there are four reasons why a validator and their delegators might have their stake&nbsp;slashed:</p>  They are unreliable with long periods of downtimes — this might result from a power outage or just a validator turning their node off. When this happens, a very small amount, around&nbsp;.1% of their stake, is burned for every block missed. There is a new block on Findora every ~15&nbsp;seconds.  Serious Attacks — If a validator tries to attack the network with an attack like a double signing attack, they will lose 5% of their total staked amount. A double signing attack is when a validator tries to vote twice on the same block and corrupt the consensus mechanism.  Light Attacks — Findora will slash 1% of the total amount staked for attacks that aren’t as&nbsp;serious.  Unknown and Undefined Attacks — Though rarer, these can be serious threats to the network. As a result, 30% of the total amount staked will be&nbsp;slashed.  <p>Findora runs on the Tendermint consensus engine, and the slashing helps protect the network from malicious actors. There are also rewards to incentivize network health. Slashing rates are balanced with reward rates in order to provide a carrot and stick incentive structure to protect networks.</p> Findora Reward&nbsp;Rates <p>As stated before, there are two types of rewards paid to validators — a block reward and a block proposer reward. Delegators who stake with a validator share in the block reward and any slashing penalties.</p><p>The more delegated to a validator, the more rewards they can earn. The APY reward for staking on Findora with a validator is on a sliding&nbsp;scale:</p><p>The reward rate increases as the amount staked FRA that is in circulation decreases to encourage more staking. Rewards decrease as more and more FRA get staked. The Rate Modifier Constant is set at 0.0536 (as of 5/1/2022) and is responsible for determining the reward rate for each value of % circulating supply staked. The community is able to vote on the modifier constant as&nbsp;needed.</p><p>To learn more about the rewards paid to validators and delegators, check out the <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/components/Staking/rewards">updated Findora&nbsp;Wiki</a>.</p> Findora Epoch&nbsp;Cycles <p>Rewards to validators are paid after every epoch cycle which is only every 4 blocks. Since there is a new block every 15 seconds, once you start validating with Findora, you can start getting rewards within a&nbsp;minute.</p><p>Validators can check their rank, earnings, or the health of their node by visiting <a href="https://findorascan.io/">findorascan.io</a>. Currently, the top 74 validators are listed on Findorascan.io but that number should be increased eventually to&nbsp;100.</p> What to Consider as a Delegator <p>Delegators stake FRA by entrusting it to a validator. Having funds delegated to validators helps them earn more rewards and delegators in turn share in those rewards, but it also means you are penalized when they&nbsp;are.</p><p>As a result, it’s worth researching a validator before staking with them. You can research all kinds of things about a validator using findorascan.io. Here are perhaps the top three things to consider when doing your research:</p>  Validator Uptime  Number of blocks&nbsp;proposed  What reward rate is being given out by the network? At the time of this recording, the reward rate is around 50%&nbsp;APY.  <p>You’ll also find their commission rate which is what they charge for using their node. Though some offer a 0% commission rate, which is generous, it’s always good to tip your local validator. They need to be rewarded for their work, and some validators even try to offer 0% commission because it’s a way to boost voting power for a malicious attack.</p> When Can I Get Back the Amount that I&nbsp;stake? <p>To unstake or unbond FRA requires 21 days. Requiring an unstaking period of a few weeks is not uncommon because the period has to be long enough to prevent long-range attacks in which actions taken don’t affect the network for another 10–15&nbsp;days.</p><p>Having an unstaking period in which delegators and validators could still have their funds slashed prevents both long-range attacks and other types of malicious activity.</p> How to Start the Validation Process <p>Before becoming a validator, it’s good to <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/introduction/intro">learn the basics about Findora</a> from the wiki and get some FRA to stake. Just below that tab in the menu you will find the <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/Introduction/changelog">change log</a> which you can check for&nbsp;updates.</p><p>After that, go ahead and check out the validator start guide on the <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/validators/validators-get-started">Findora Wiki</a>. It will walk you through step by step how to do a manual setup or an automatic setup. Although the automatic setup works perfectly well and is easier, doing the manual setup will give you a better understanding of what is happening under the&nbsp;hood.</p><p>If you’re running multiple nodes, manual setup will make it easier to manage them. You’ll know where your keys are, how your folders are set up, and give you more control of your directories.</p><p>We put on regular workshops for developers to prepare them to develop on Findora.

<p>Brave also includes DApp support on desktop (Solana) and Android (Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains)</p>
<p>Today’s <a>Brave browser release (v1.40)</a> is expanding on the mission of making <a>Brave Wallet</a> a safe, easy-to-use onramp to Web3. It gives users easy access to new chains and decentralized apps (DApps), right in the browser, no extensions required.</p>

 Brave Wallet now integrates with the Filecoin blockchain 
<p><a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/filecoin">Filecoin is a decentralized storage provider</a> that allows users to store their most important files and documents on a decentralized network, rather than a centralized service. With Brave’s 1.40 release, we’ve integrated the <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> blockchain directly into Brave Wallet. With this integration, Filecoin’s token (FIL) is fully supported as an asset in Brave Wallet. Brave users can frictionlessly send and receive FIL directly in the Wallet without worry due to Filecoin’s extremely low transaction fees.<br>
The Filecoin integration also complements <a>Brave’s native integration</a> with the <a href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) network</a>, and sets the stage for future utility of Filecoin in the decentralized Web. Brave users can access content directly from the IPFS network by resolving ipfs:// URLs via a gateway or installing a full IPFS node in one click. The integration gives users options for a more resilient Web, increases the availability of content they care about, and more.</p>



    



    


    


    
    


 Brave Wallet now has more preloaded EVM chains 
<p>With the 1.40 release, the following blockchains compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) will now be pre-loaded in Brave Wallet, offering users more choice across popular networks:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.avax.network/">Avalanche C-Chain</a> 
 <a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en/smartChain">Binance Smart Chain</a> 
 <a href="https://celo.org/">Celo</a> 
 <a href="https://fantom.foundation/">Fantom</a> 
 <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> 
 <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a> 
 
<p>Assets on each of these preloaded networks are supported with <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4416863200141-How-do-I-manage-crypto-assets-in-Brave-Wallet-">Brave Swaps</a>, and <a href="https://www.0x.org/">powered by 0x. Brave</a> also supports fiat-to-crypto purchases for most of these networks via <a href="https://www.0x.org/">partners </a><a href="https://ramp.network/">Ramp</a> and <a href="https://www.sendwyre.com/">Wyre</a>. We plan to extend support to even more networks in the months ahead.<br>
In addition to the networks above, <a>Brave also recently announced plans to support Aurora as a default chain</a>, an EVM that offers Ethereum compatibility with the speed, low fees, and scalability of <a href="https://near.org/">NEAR</a>.</p>



    



    


    


    
    


 New DApp support 
<p>Finally, Brave is bringing more support for <a>decentralized apps (DApps)</a> to Brave Wallet users.</p>
<p>Brave launched the first part of its Solana integration with the <a>1.39 Wallet release</a>. On the desktop side, we’re carrying that integration forward with a developer release of DApp support for Solana. Users can now test Solana DApp support in Brave Wallet in the <a>Brave Nightly</a> (v1.42) version of our desktop browser. We encourage the community to test and provide feedback.</p>
<p>More Solana support on all platforms—including DApps and swapping—will be available in the <a>release channel of Brave</a> in the coming months.</p>
<p>In addition to buying, sending, and swapping crypto assets, <a>Brave Wallet Android users</a> can now access and explore Web3 DApps and services in Ethereum and EVM-compatible ecosystems. This will soon be available for iOS users as well (DApp support is already available for Brave Wallet desktop users).</p>

 Brave Wallet: More chains, more features, better security 
<p>Brave Wallet brings added security to Web3. Being native to the browser, Brave Wallet removes the risk of installing 3rd-party extensions that can be easily spoofed, and brings an easy, safe onramp to the decentralized web.</p>
<p>However, Brave Wallet is about more than security. From the beginning, we wanted it to compete with any other wallet on integrations, speed, fees, user experience, and more. With our 1.40 release, Brave is introducing an even richer set of features for all Brave Wallet users, and any Brave browser user who’s curious about Web3.</p>
<p>Ready to get started with Brave and Brave Wallet? <a>Just download Brave for desktop, Android, or iOS</a>, and click the  in the address bar to get started.</p>

 Update to staking supply and active set — and the impact on mix node&nbsp;APY <p>This week there have been some important updates to the reward sharing parameters in the mixnet contracts. Namely, the stake supply and the active set, which in turn affects the mix node saturation point. You can see evidence of these changes already in <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">the explorer</a>: the active set number, stake saturation point and the estimated rewards are all affected. These changes have been made in order to ensure a better quality of mixnet and better&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This blogpost will give an overview of what exactly has changed and why it matters — especially if you are a mix node operator or someone who has delegated to a mix&nbsp;node.</p><p>Before we go into further details, these changes may require some action on your&nbsp;part:</p>  If you are a mix node operator, your % saturation will look different, as will your estimated rewards. There is now competition to be in the active set, so make sure your node is fully operational!  If you are a delegator, note that the stake saturation has changed, so you should check if the mix nodes you have delegated to are above saturation and consider redeeming your rewards and delegating to a different set of nodes! (This is now even easier through the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">new wallet</a> interface).   What has&nbsp;changed? <p>Stake supply adjusted to&nbsp;100M</p><p>The reported stake supply has been adjusted from an assumed total supply of 750M to 100M, to better reflect the real world stake&nbsp;supply.</p><p>This does NOT mean the supply of NYM tokens has changed (total NYM supply is 1bn), it just means that the max supply that is currently liquid or in the vesting contract available for staking is only approximately 100M.</p><p>So the reward sharing algorithm has been adjusted accordingly and now assumes there are 100M NYM tokens available for staking at this point in time, rather than the full stake supply of 750M (1bn minus the 250M mixmining pool). This change is important and affects stake saturation point and improves the APY, described below.</p><p>NOTE: there is a small bug, meaning the stake supply changes have not fully gone through yet. Core dev are fixing it as we speak so you should see evidence of higher rewards as a result of this change by next&nbsp;week.</p><p>Active set (k) adjusted to&nbsp;240</p><p>The active set has been changed from 720 to 240 to ensure competition and better performance. When the active set was set to 720, all nodes were selected as the actual number of nodes was less. This meant the mixnet was not performing well as it included low quality nodes. With the adjustment, the overall quality of the network should start to&nbsp;improve.</p><p>There is now no standby set because it is not needed at this early stage of the network. This means a mix node is simply either active or inactive at a given epoch, with a higher probability of being in the active set if the node has good performance and high stake saturation.</p><p>Stake saturation point is now&nbsp;416k</p><p>A mix node’s stake is the total of how much an operator bonds and how much token holders delegate. Combined, it represents the confidence in that mix node, and affects its probability of being selected to the active set to mix traffic and be rewarded.</p><p>The stake saturation point is a softcap, meaning any additional stake that a node receives above that point will no longer be of benefit — it will in fact begin to reduce the overall rewards for all stakers on that node by spreading out the share. The softcap is to ensure stake doesn’t centralize and that people delegate stake to a sufficient number of well performing nodes.</p><p>The stake saturation is found by dividing the total stake supply by the number of nodes in the active set (100M/240). The rewards algorithm is designed such that nodes with 100% stake saturation will get the full share of mixmining rewards pool. The previous stake saturation was 1M, calculated on the basis of a 750M stake supply. This number is far from the actual reality at this early stage of the network, meaning the saturation point was far too high making it impossible for the majority of nodes in the network to get close to saturation. The adjustments from 750M to 100M means the saturation point is now 416k and more nodes will get full share of the rewards making them look more attractive to prospective delegators.</p><p>This also means that some nodes are now way oversaturated! So delegators, it is time to redeem your rewards and redelegate to a different set of nodes! And node operators, encourage your delegators to redelegate!</p><p>You will be losing out on rewards if you continue to stake on oversaturated nodes. To help distributing stake more evenly across nodes, the next release of the wallet will simply have delegation and compounding disabled for over-saturated nodes.</p><p>Go to the explorer, click on “Stake Saturation” to view nodes by saturation and you will see the over saturated ones with a red warning&nbsp;color.</p> Why were these changes&nbsp;made?   Improve the quality of the&nbsp;network  <p>The quality of the mixnet is currently not good enough for broad adoption and usage. There are simply too many nodes and gateways dropping packets. What is more, this is affecting the reputation of other mix nodes. There has been some dissatisfaction with the way that a mix node’s uptime is displayed because good performing nodes are at times seeing their uptime&nbsp;drop.</p><p>Here is what is happening: a node’s uptime is measured by measurement packets. These report back on whether the packet was successfully routed through the full path, meaning through a gateway, three mix nodes and another gateway. The implication is that a well performing mix node can have their “uptime” affected by being in a pathway with an underperforming gateway or mix&nbsp;node.</p><p>Measurements have to happen like this. However, mix nodes with good performance should start to be less implicated by badly performing nodes now that the active set is smaller, because there will be more competition.</p><p>The probability of being in the active set will decline for bad nodes. And this means higher performing mix nodes will be less likely to be in the same path as low performing nodes.</p>  Encourage competition  <p>When the active set was 720, all nodes currently bonded in the mixnet were selected for the active set in every epoch because there were less than 720 nodes. This means there was no competition and no quality control. By reducing the active set number to 240, there will be actual competition to be included in each epoch, encouraging node operators to run functioning nodes, and ensuring that node reputation and delegations actually&nbsp;matter!</p>  Make delegations count  <p>Before reducing the active set to a more competitive number, delegated staking had no actual effect on whether a node was selected or not because all nodes were selected! With a smaller set, only about half of the current number of nodes are selected for each epoch, which means the delegated stake will begin to make a real difference for a mix node’s probability of being in the active set — in turn affecting the rewards it will receive and the share that delegators receive.</p><p>This should make the whole network a lot more dynamic and ensure people will begin to see some real differences in rewards for good versus bad nodes and overall better&nbsp;APY.</p>  Improve APY  <p>Last but not least, all the above means better rewards for well performing nodes. The simulations that we ran before making these changes in fact <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-mixnet-apy-initial-simulations-for-first-quarter-139ac49d5348">reported an APY of up to 40%</a> (annualized) for mix nodes with 100% uptime and stake saturation for the first months of the network, after which the rewards will begin to tail off to a more stable&nbsp;level.</p><p>Any questions - the Nym <a href="https://discord.gg/7F6g9cWh">Discord</a> and <a href="https://keybase.io/team/nymtech.friends">Keybase</a> channels are&nbsp;open!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/update-to-staking-supply-and-active-set-and-the-impact-on-mix-node-apy-df0db507845b">Update to staking supply and active set — and the impact on mix node APY</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 OXT Visualizer Update A picture is worth a thousand&nbsp;words Intro <p>A financial flow (transaction graph) analysis aims to track a single entity’s spending over multiple transactions. By naively mapping the flow relationship of bitcoins, analysts can miss obvious signs of coins changing&nbsp;hands.</p><p>Additional information known as wallet or software “fingerprinting” can be used to help determine when bitcoins are spent by a different software. Spending by wallets with a new fingerprint is a heuristic for coins changing ownership. The latest OXT transaction graph update visually encodes changes in wallet fingerprints on the graph to improve analysis accuracy.</p> Entity Tracking Recap — Change Detection <p>To track an entity, “change detection” heuristics are used to determine which transaction outputs are payments and which outputs are “change” returned to the original spender. The analyst evaluates the full transaction details including the input and output amounts, script types, output positions, and more. If one or more change heuristics can be applied, the analyst continues tracking the spender to the next transaction. We previously presented several change detection heuristics in these <a href="https://medium.com/oxt-research/understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt-part-1-4-8177a40a5923">posts</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEnL5k0R08w&amp;list=PLIBmWVGQhizLrPjpFMN5bQdbOZRxCQXUg">Youtube playlist</a>.</p><p>Applying these simple heuristics in combination can be extremely accurate. Academic researchers are looking to thoroughly establish the accuracy of change detection heuristics using machine learning algorithms as presented <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05749">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13882">here</a>.</p><p>The results of these papers indicates that including wallet fingerprinting such as different script types, version numbers, and lock times encountered during a transaction graph analysis can be used to improve tracking.</p> OXT’s New Fingerprint Mode <p>OXT’s transaction graph is a directed acyclic graph. Nodes on the graph represent transactions. Edges (lines) map the relationships between nodes. To provide maximum detail and minimize cognitive load on the analyst, OXT’s new Fingerprint Mode encodes the various transaction and TXO data in different ways.</p><p>Transaction details are encoded by varying node shapes and shading. TXO details are encoded by varying edge linetype and&nbsp;color.</p>Multiple peel chains showing different script&nbsp;types<p>The end result makes change detection easier for analysts and visually displays different fingerprints to transaction graph observers without the observer needing to know what these differences are.</p><p>With this new data visualizer, bitcoin users can keep pace with the advances in academic research and evaluate the impacts of using wallets that do not support <a href="https://medium.com/oxt-research/understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt-part-3-4-9a1b2b572a8">anti-fingerprinting defaults</a>.</p> Menus and&nbsp;Buttons <p>A summary of the buttons on the transaction graph tool bars is presented below.</p>Toolbar buttons<p>Quick access menus for transactions, TXOs, and comments are presented below.

 Our latest partnership with LI.FI introduces BlockWallet users to their advanced bridge and DEX aggregator through Transferto — LI.FI’s simple UI that provides an easy way to bridge and swap across multiple&nbsp;chains. <p>As the blockchain ecosystem shifts toward multi-chain applications, <a href="https://li.fi/">LI.FI</a> provides an easy way to interact with your favorite chains and DApps. And with <a href="https://li.fi/">LI.FI</a>’s plug-and-play feature, users can swap any asset from any chain on all DApps that apply their solution.</p><p>As of today, <a href="https://blockwallet.io/">BlockWallet</a> is officially integrated with <a href="https://transferto.xyz/swap">Transferto</a>, the intuitive interface powered by&nbsp;<a href="https://li.fi/">LI.FI</a>.</p> LI.FI is redefining the status&nbsp;quo <p>The existing bridge-swapping solutions are simply not good enough. With their limited chain support, coupled with low liquidity, the result is a poor experience for users. Not to mention, frequent downtimes from existing protocols.</p><p><a href="https://li.fi/">LI.FI</a> solves these problems by implementing multiple chains through a feature called smart routing, which algorithmically decides the best route for swapping, reducing gas fees. They also connect bridges with DEXs and dex aggregators to support swap-bridge functionality, where Blockwallet users can swap from any asset on any chain into any other asset on a different chain (Any-2-Any swaps).</p><p>If all that seems too complicated, don’t worry. Because all you need to know is&nbsp;this:</p><p>As self-proclaimed UX maxis, LI.FI makes bridging and cross-chain swapping incredibly simple, with less fees and greater reliability.</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a privacy-first self-custodial browser extension wallet where you can store, send or receive crypto and interact with your favorite blockchain apps privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy poses real security risks. BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating friction and making privacy accessible for everyone.</p><p>BlockWallet protects you and ensures privacy by default. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain apps, BlockWallet routes all node requests through Privacy Proxies, which mask the IP address and other metadata, that can be used to identify and track you on a blockchain. You can also use the Privacy Pools feature, powered by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zk-snarks">zk-SNARKs</a> technology, to deposit and mix funds in a smart contract. This allows transferring funds without links to your history and identity on the blockchain, effectively rendering them untraceable. BlockWallet offers integrated Flash-Bot Protection, shielding you from sandwich attacks when you trade on DEXes. Meanwhile, the Phishing Protection feature combats phishing scams by generating unique artwork on all sensitive pages.</p><p>BlockWallet is not a compromise. It’s privacy-first, but it still packs all features you would expect from a wallet. With full Web 3.0 support, the wallet allows you to connect to any&nbsp;DApp.</p><p>Become a part of the BlockWallet community today:</p><p><a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Homepage</a> | <a href="https://blockwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetBlockWallet">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/blockwallet">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/69gvNKatdb">Discord</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EKVZ2xWXEH">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://hello@blockwallet.io/">E-mail</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet/blockwallet-partners-with-li-fi-84e29ca1dac4">BlockWallet Partners With LI.FI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet">BlockWallet</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Validator Spotlights showcase the great teams working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain. Here are <a href="https://twitter.com/Terminet123">Terminet</a>’s responses to some questions from the Findora community: <p>1. Tell us about&nbsp;Terminet</p><p>Terminet has years of technical expertise in distributed high-performance computing, node infrastructure, network, hardware, API support, and storage for the web3 ecosystem, and is dedicated to helping investors and ordinary token holders profit from digital assets. By building a reliable, secure, and easy-to-use web3 infrastructure service layer in order to lower web3 onboarding barriers and web3 application development thresholds, Terminet powers web3 development.</p><p>Terminet provides a public staking service and has successfully run multiple PoS&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>2. What should we know about the Terminet&nbsp;team?</p><p>Terminet is a web3 startup team, with core members from global companies and years of experience in the industry. The core team consists of experienced developers, product and operations experts, and blockchain enthusiasts with more than 5 years under their belt in the industry. The technology stacks of team members include Javascript, Python, Rust, Golang, and&nbsp;Java.</p><p>3. What makes your dashboard stand out from the&nbsp;rest?</p><p>The core responsibility of nodes is to maintain the security and stability of the entire network. Terminet has accumulated a lot of experience in this area, including 24/7 operation and maintenance monitoring, automatic node start/stop, disaster recovery plans, high availability, etc. Therefore, delegating to Terminet can guarantee safe and stable access to delegated yield.</p><p>Secondly, node types are mainly divided into three categories: professional mining pool nodes, investor nodes, and community nodes. Due to the current unstaking period (e.g. takes 21 days to unstake, other chains may take longer, and there is no reward during this period), many old nodes are not too willing to participate in the ecosystem construction and development of the community after acquiring the delegated amount. Terminet sees this as an opportunity and hopes to break the situation of “choppy” node delegation and to form healthy competition, which will boost the chain, community users, and ecosystem development.</p><p>4. Why was Findora an appealing destination for Terminet?</p><p>Findora’s focus on being “a public blockchain with programmable privacy” is exactly what our team believes in. We believe that privacy solutions for web3 are essential for business users so they can ensure important financial data is not leaked and also secure trade secrets. Privacy is therefore an important piece of missing financial infrastructure necessary for the mass adoption of&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>We see huge growth potential for web3 in the next 5–10 years, and there are still some participants at this stage which don’t have the requisite amount of community commitment. For this reason, Terminet is developing and iterating MPC-based key security management solutions to provide systematic support for B-end users to participate in the blockchain network.</p><p>Terminet sincerely hopes to grow together with&nbsp;Findora</p><p>5.

<p>As we described in our initial blog on <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-proof-of-stake-research/">Proof-of-Stake Research</a>, we are releasing updates to the Zcash community as we go.</p>



<p>In this post we describe major technical research areas we intend to focus on moving forward. We will go over a number of topics, including these focus areas, approach, and next steps. We’ll adjust throughout the process as we discover new needs.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, it’s important to understand how ZEC might be best suited to find its niche in the overall marketplace. The core of this research is to improve the overall use experience, and broader use case, for Zcash and ZEC.</p>



 



 



 



 Approach 



<p>With <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/eccs-north-star-building-a-world-class-ux-for-zec/">ECC’s North Star</a> and research goals in mind, we are adopting this broad approach to developing a successful proposal:</p>



 



 Go-to-market process 



<p>This status update is focused on an initial technical research phase as part of a comprehensive go-to-market process. The broader process has these components:</p>



  Requirements definition to establish specific goals for a PoS transition proposal  Market research to identify the target market, user needs, and market landscape  Technical research to identify the range of feasible technical designs  Engineering R&amp;D to develop a concrete design and deployment roadmap  Zcash proposal (with a specific decision) to present to the Zcash community   Go-to-market execution, for an accepted proposal, to ship usable and valuable products to users  



<p>In practice, the first three components are interleaved: As we explore technical designs and learn more from market research, we will refine our requirements, which may require further technical and market research. We will iterate these three efforts until we develop high confidence that we have the best requirements.</p>



 



 Technical research process 



<p>The technical research process has three main components:</p>



 Protocol survey 



<p>First, we’ll focus on researching existing proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols to understand trade-offs and risks. From there, we’ll select our preferred candidate, using our vision for ZEC and Zcash to guide our choice of trade-offs. We’ll share this comparative analysis and our preferred candidate protocol early in our research process to get review and feedback from the broader community.<br><br>Our preferences: We have a strong bias toward protocols that have significant pre-existing deployments that have matured and hardened in the market, as well as strong theoretical underpinnings. Protocols that have both of these traits present the least possible risk for this emerging technology.</p>



 Zcash specialization 



<p>Second, with a preferred protocol candidate in hand, we’ll carefully investigate which design facets may need customization or alteration to support ZEC. We’ll especially consider usability, safety, privacy, and monetary policy constraints that serve as ZEC’s strengths.<br><br>Our preferences: We maintain a security and technical strategy that minimizes changes or innovations, and we strongly prefer to use proven designs as much as possible. The ideal candidate would require no changes. As stated in our research goals, our aim is to target a minimum viable protocol, with the assumption of future improvements, rather than aim to include all valuable potential Zcash specializations up-front.</p>



 Transition plan 



<p>Finally, after developing a proposal for this minimally customized candidate PoS protocol, we’ll develop a more comprehensive proposal, including a transition plan, for safely migrating Zcash from its current proof-of-work (PoW) network to the new target PoS protocol. The transition plan is likely to require significant effort, and there are a range of feasible approaches. We intend to present several possibilities earlier in the research process to get community input on their trade-offs.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Our preferences: We prefer to select an ideal target protocol independent of developing a transition plan to that protocol. If we find the transition plan introduces new constraints or requirements on the target protocol, we will refine the target protocol requirements later in the process.</p>



 



 



 



 Research areas 



<p>Given our goals and approach, we’ve currently identified a number of major areas of technical research for the protocol survey and Zcash specialization phases. These research areas do not yet focus on the transition plan. We will turn our attention to the transition plan as other areas, and broader market research and requirements, become clearer.</p>



 



 Shielded wallet UX and security 



<p>A high priority for our technical research is to consider shielded wallet usability and security, especially for mobile devices. We do not expect the consensus protocol to directly impact shielded storage and transfer functionality or usability. Beyond that, participants in a PoS protocol also may contribute ZEC to staking bonds, validate blocks, propose blocks, and select blocks.</p>



<p>The interaction between the shielded pool and staking is an essential interface of the design. Staked capital must be in bonds visible to the protocol to select block producers and potentially slash for misbehavior. A plausible simple design for this interface would be to support single-use bond positions with a public amount and no associated addresses. These can only be funding from, or withdrawn to, the shielded pool.</p>



<p>In this simpler design, block producers are likely to operate using the target PoS protocol mechanics with minimal Zcash customization.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Our preferences:</p>



<p></p>



  We prefer to enable any number of shielded mobile wallet users to delegate ZEC to staking bonds with a first-class user experience.  



  We prefer the plausible, simple integration between stake delegation and the shielded pool described above for the initial PoS protocol.  



 



 Cross-chain interoperability 



<p>A key pillar of our vision for ZEC’s value in Web3 is to enable interoperability between the Zcash blockchain and any number of other blockchains.</p>



<p>Our preferences:</p>



  We prefer protocol interoperability features with the best balance of current and future potential reach against complexity. For example, interoperability with Bitcoin may have the largest current reach in terms of market capitalization, yet interoperability with the Cosmos ecosystem may have more reach with lower complexity.  To that end, we have a preference for a protocol with finality, as described below in the Dynamic availability vs finality section.  We prefer to target existing, standard cross-chain mechanisms without requiring privacy innovations. We prefer to design the interface between the shielded pool and cross-chain mechanisms similarly to our preference for the interface between the shielded pool and stake delegation.  



 



 Proof-of-stake security 



<p>While we strongly favor protocols that are proven via real-world production hardening, we additionally require a strong theoretical foundation.</p>



 Incentives and resource cost security 



<p>A core concept in security arguments for cryptocurrency protocols is incentive alignment: If it’s in the best interest of independent block producers to follow reinforcing consensus rules, the protocol should be robust against deviations (aka attacks). This is an important departure from earlier work in Byzantine consensus protocols, which typically only distinguished between “honest” or altruistic nodes versus malicious nodes.</p>



<p>If security relies on incentives, then feasibility of an attack depends on the payoff given the cost. So, for example, a proof-of-work attacker with a tiny fraction of mining capacity is unlikely to execute a long rollback within some window. However, as an attacker’s resources scale up, their ability to successfully execute attacks improves (despite the larger cost of the attack).</p>



<p>So, arguments for security in cryptocurrency consensus analyses often rely on the cost to maliciously control a key resource: hashpower for proof-of-work and staked tokens for proof-of-stake. Sites like <a href="https://www.crypto51.app/">crypto51.app</a> provide cost estimates for 51 percent attacks against PoW chains, which exemplifies this mode of reasoning about security.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pwt-EdnjhDLc_Mi2ydHus0_Cm14rs1Aq/view">Ethereum 2.0 Economic Review by Hoban &amp; Borgers</a>, the authors compare the estimated 51 percent attack cost against ETH1 (PoW) to the cost of controlling sufficient validators for a safety attack against ETH2 (PoS) as a heuristic to determine whether the newer protocol is as safe as the previous protocol.</p>



<p>Our preference: We believe the “attack cost comparison” used in the Hoban &amp; Borgers paper is one useful guideline in analyzing the safety of a transition from PoW to PoS, as long as we exercise caution in not relying too heavily on this single heuristic.</p>



<p>A key safety mechanism in PoS protocols is an “unbonding period” during which a staker cannot access their staked funds without some delay. This delay underpins security guarantees, for example, by ensuring a bond may be slashed some time after a slashable behavior occurs.</p>



<p>Our preference: We don’t anticipate deviating from an existing candidate protocol’s design for unbonding period length, while ensuring it is tuned to a conservative value for our security requirements.</p>



 Wrinkles in incentive space 



<p>While the notion of relying on participants to follow incentives seems reasonable, we are acutely aware of three big risks in the “cost of resource” attack reasoning from the last section:</p>



  Attack costs may be overestimated  Pay-offs may be underestimated  Or more generally, real incentives for participants may not be correctly modeled  



<p>Attack costs can be overestimated in the simple “cost of consensus resource” security model due to financial mechanisms, as well as combined attack modalities. For example, <a href="https://jbonneau.com/doc/B16a-BITCOIN-why_buy_when_you_can_rent.pdf">Why buy when you can rent?</a> explores how an attacker can use “bribery” to gain temporary control of PoW mining capacity to execute an attack, without incurring the larger and longer term capital cost of acquiring the mining equipment. A similar case could occur in PoS if, for example, an attacker acquires staking capital through a financial mechanism that lowers their direct cost.</p>



<p>Pay-offs may be underestimated, especially because the attack-cost models tend to ignore payoffs altogether. If an attack costs the equivalent of $X billion USD, that may seem reassuring, but what if an attack can net $10X billion in proceeds?</p>



<p>Finally, those two problems are more specific cases of the real incentives of participants being incorrectly modeled. On this more general point, evolving real-world incentives may threaten the security of consensus protocols even when there is no “attacker” with malicious intent. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00919">Competitive equilibria between staking and on-chain lending</a> the researchers analyze how the amount staked in a PoS protocol interacts with a model defi lending platform. In that analysis, staking security may become perilously low through self-interested behavior of participants, none of whom intends to “attack” the network. The meltdown of the Terra staking token Luna, as described by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-11/terra-flops">Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine</a>, would seem to be a real-life event related to this research that is likely to become a canonical example of how financialization mechanisms when attached to a proof-of-stake token can lead to security disasters.</p>



<p>So, many kinds of financialization or financial mechanics can impact security, including defi, bridging, multi-asset support, and off-chain custodial financial services impact security.</p>



<p>All of this complexity not only complicates analysis of a protocol, but it also opens the design space to incorporating financialization mechanisms. Existing networks are exploring this area of design space with staking derivatives, such as staking-backed derivative tokens (often simply called “staking derivatives” or “liquid staking”), <a href="https://medium.com/osmosis-community-updates/osmosis-superfluid-staking-faq-a7b49797cb72">superfluid staking</a>, and more. <a href="https://research.paradigm.xyz/staking">On Staking Pools and Staking Derivatives</a> mentions a common argument that liquid staking may lower security and it then presents an argument that for some given assumptions it can actually increase security.</p>



<p>Finally, all of this discussion of incentives has skirted around a core economic design component impacting PoS security, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-tHNTedhBNCRI6p7mGm0Gyfy_RIIGqXRgBXNJecLnrI/edit#heading=h.v6vihtk2cvzs">Issuance Policy</a>, which we discuss separately below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our preference: Our preferences around issuance are described in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-tHNTedhBNCRI6p7mGm0Gyfy_RIIGqXRgBXNJecLnrI/edit#heading=h.v6vihtk2cvzs">Issuance policy</a> section. Our belief around financialization is that it generally produces value, is inevitable, and that ZEC can be safely incorporated into it, so long as we understand and mitigate risks as they develop. Our preference for incorporating financialization into the consensus protocol is to be extremely conservative and only consider such mechanisms, such as liquid staking, when there is a strong argument for their benefit versus their risk and complexity. We prefer to propose a simpler “V1” protocol and may consider such mechanisms in later iterations of future PoS protocol improvements.</p>



 Dynamic availability vs finality 



<p>The research literature highlights a fundamental trade-off in consensus protocols between “dynamic availability” vs “finality”. This extends earlier research from distributed computing around a similar trade-off popularized as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12636">CAP theorem</a>.</p>



<p>Dynamically available protocols can continue making progress during network partitions, at the cost of reverting transactions when the partitions later reconnect. Finalizing protocols ensure that once a transaction is final it cannot be reverted, at the cost of halting the network during a partition.</p>



<p>Both transaction reversion (aka “rollbacks”) and network halts cause economic damage to participants. A protocol which allows transaction reversion can lead to “half-executed” economic exchanges, which leave one party harmed. Protocols that can halt will prevent the users from accessing their capital, introducing opportunity costs.</p>



<p>An example of a half-executed exchange in a dynamically available protocol (such as Zcash PoW), is when Alice sends Bob 0.001 ZEC, and Bob makes and gives Alice a latte, then Alice consumes it. If there is subsequently a network rollback that reverts the transfer, Bob will not receive the 0.2 ZEC, thus causing Bob to not be compensated for their work. By contrast, in a finalizing protocol, if Bob receives the payment he has a guarantee it cannot be reverted, and can safely sell the latte. Meanwhile, if a finalizing protocol halts, Alice cannot pay Bob at all. Neither party loses out in direct terms, but they cannot complete an exchange which has opportunity costs. (For example, should Alice wait in the cafe? For how long?)</p>



<p>However, it’s important to note that network halts in finalizing protocols can be particularly damaging for financialized mechanics that should respond in real-time to market conditions, such as collateralized systems that may liquidate positions when real-time prices cross some threshold.</p>



<p>Our preference: We have a strong preference for finalizing protocols. A network halt affects all users consistently whereas a rollback only reverts a portion of transactions (those on one of multiple partitions) and harms one participant in every economic exchange for all reverted transactions. Currently, the Zcash network has minimal programmability enabling use cases such as financial systems that respond to real-time price oracles, so we suspect that class of harm from network halts is lower than other crypto networks. Finally, we believe, separate consensus protocols which provide finality can interoperate more safely with less complexity.</p>



 Block producer decentralization and resilience 



<p>Because permissionlessness is a key property of Zcash, we need to consider how resilient the consensus infrastructure is.</p>



<p>The infrastructure that selects from proposed blocks is critical to censorship resistance and capture resistance, although shielded transactions and the possibility of a community-organized chain split are even more fundamental protections. If entrance to the set of block selectors can be limited outside of freely open, nondiscretionary competition, that presents a capture risk.</p>



<p>Among proof-of-stake protocols with nondiscretionary rules for becoming a block selector, there are several constraints to entry:</p>



  Participation has capital and operational costs beyond staking bond capital itself, such as network connectivity, operations &amp; maintenance, executive functions, etc… We refer to this as “out-of-band costs”.  Participation has competitive in-band staking bond capital requirements, or “in-band costs”.  Different protocols may have resource constraints on the number of participants. For example, Ethereum Consensus Layer aims to support thousands of block selector nodes, while Tendermint has a practical limit of hundreds of block selectors.  If entry is in-band, the existing block selectors must accept in-band transactions that allow new entrants to register. There is a risk that existing block selectors could censor these registrations to prevent their competitors from freely entering the system.  



<p>Our preferences: For each of the above constraints, our preferences are:</p>



  We prefer to prioritize permissionless entry and competition into block producer infrastructure.  We prefer in-band staking bonds to be delegatable with low cost and ease of use by a very large number of users. We believe the ability for users to freely redelegate their stake to different block selectors enables free competition between the selectors.  We prefer the practical “floor” amount of ZEC for delegating stake to be as low as feasible, ideally less than $1 USD.  We prefer not to prioritize having a large number of block selectors based on the belief that delegatable stake supports free competition sufficiently. We also believe finalizing protocols tend to have lower limits on the number of block selectors supported, and our preference for finality supersedes the desire for a large number of block selectors.  We strongly prefer protocols that protect the permissionless entry of new validators in free competition to preserve overall consensus permissionlessness, resist capture, and lower validation fees.  We believe with this combination of properties, delegator returns should approach block producer returns through open competition.  



 Other security risks 



<p>There are a multitude of other security risks related to PoS which we anticipate will be shared between Zcash and other PoS networks, including long-range attacks, a variety of network attacks (eclipse attacks, Denial-of-Service, initial node introduction risks), and more.</p>



<p>Our preference: Based on the belief that these risks will not be unique to Zcash, we optimistically anticipate existing PoS protocol designs have been hardened against them. Where we discover weaknesses we intend to collaborate with the broader PoS protocol design ecosystem to address those.</p>



 



 Issuance policy 



<p>For cryptocurrencies, beginning with Bitcoin’s breakthrough design, monetary policy sits firmly in the intersection of macro- and micro-economic dynamics, protocol security, governance, usage, and adoption. This area of protocol design is truly multidisciplinary and novel.</p>



<p>We aim to publish a more detailed exploration of issuance policies and PoS security in an upcoming blog post.</p>



 Issuance rate security 



<p>Existing proof-of-stake protocols have a variety of issuance policies. We’re just beginning to familiarize ourselves with research related to how issuance relates to Proof-of-Stake Security.</p>



<p>Our Preference: We aim to provide supporting arguments from research around the protocol security for the specific issuance policy we propose.</p>



 Issuance policy discretion 



<p>There are several design options around issuance policy involving discretion and the schedule itself.</p>



<p>Issuance could be more or less discretionary. A prime example of a schedule with minimal discretion is Bitcoin’s issuance schedule, which is fixed. The only way to alter it would be a core protocol change that would require an economically dominant majority of users to adopt a hardforking consensus rule change. An example of a protocol with discretion over monetary parameters would be MakerDAO or many other DAOs which can alter rates, fees, or other economic parameters through on-chain governance. A middle-ground example might be Ethereum, where the current issuance schedule is fixed in the protocol, yet there is precedent to alter this through consensus rule upgrades.</p>



<p>Our Preference: We prefer an issuance policy with as minimal discretion as possible. Because Zcash already has a culture and precedent for backwards incompatible protocol upgrades, this is likely to include social norms about the “Overton window” of acceptable issuance changes, placing a high burden on proposals to motivate changes to issuance. An example from Zcash history of the threshold to enact a significant change was the establishment of the Development Fund which involved a multiyear referendum-like process.</p>



 Issuance rate schedule 



<p>There are four major possibilities for issuance schedules:</p>



  Keep the current Bitcoin-like schedule completely unchanged.  Adopt a schedule that’s strictly equal or lower than the current schedule, thus keeping the 21M ZEC cap.  Adopt a “reasonable” well-known schedule that doesn’t maintain the Bitcoin-like limit.  Something else further afield.  



<p>Our preference: We have a preference for the second option, a rate that’s lower than the current Bitcoin-like schedule. If this is feasible from a security perspective, we believe it would be acceptable to the vast majority of current and potential future Zcash users, while lowering the costs paid by holders for the security of the network. This option would maintain the 21M ZEC cap. We may find in our research phase that this option cannot support sufficient security, in which case we’ll surface the issue for Zcash users as soon as we formulate the concern.</p>



 



 On-chain governance 



<p>Proof-of-stake protocols track the amounts of tokens in bonds, and use that information for making consensus decisions (such as which nodes are able to become block producers). Thus, it’s very natural to also enable on-chain governance mechanisms, where the amount of coins are used for other decisions outside of direct block production consensus.</p>



<p>Our preference: We prefer not to propose binding governance on Zcash protocol development using coin-weighted polling. However we do have a strong preference to enable non-binding coin-weighted polling where anyone can submit petitions or polls and ZEC holders can weigh in using on-chain coin-weighting data. We believe this gives the best balance between capture resistance and governance signaling, and follows the Zcash tradition of incrementally improving governance in safe and sensible stages.</p>



 



 Reducing protocol complexity 



<p>Zcash has successfully evolved throughout its lifetime with Bitcoin-compatible functionality through Transparent Addresses, and three separate shielded protocols (Sprout, Sapling, and Orchard). The benefit of this has been to enable wider technical adoption and backwards compatibility. There are several drawbacks to this “technical debt”:</p>



  Each kind of transfer technology interacts with a single common ZEC supply, so supply integrity failures in any of these tech stacks present a risk to the entire system. While the “<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/turnstile-enforcement-against-counterfeiting/">Shielded pool turnstile</a>” mechanism protects the overall ZEC supply, such a failure would still harm users and shake confidence in the overall protocol.  The protocol must be complex to support multiple different technologies, making it more difficult for new implementations.  The same complexity inhibits protocol designers from safely extending or improving the protocol, and Zcash needs continuous innovation to remain relevant into the future.  Older shielded pools are rarely used, so even users who need that functionality in the future may find that wallet support has either been removed or has unintentionally accrued bugs for that rarely used use case.  



<p>It may be feasible and a good path forward to couple the need to reduce protocol complexity with a transition process to PoS. It may, however, introduce extra complexity and risk, so this is an area that needs more research and discussion across the community.</p>



<p>Our preferences: We prefer to design the new PoS protocol with support for only newer technologies, and to include a standard migration system to address the issue of technology evolution moving forward. We prefer for the Zcash protocol to introduce fees for users of older technology to incentivize migration and additionally to restrict migration to the new protocol to the newer technology stacks.</p>



 



 



 



 Next steps 



<p>As our technical and market research progresses, we will regularly post articles on specific topics, our current understanding of that area, any preferences we hold, and next steps for that topic. The next topic we will dive into for this technical research blog series is issuance in PoS protocols and how that relates to Zcash.</p>

 TL;DR <p>❗Issue your own tokens with unique parameters in the Findora Wallet on the native&nbsp;chain.</p><p>❗ FRA can be easily and reliably transfered between Findora UTXO ledger and the Findora EVM ledger, which is an account-model chain.</p><p>❗Prism Transfer interatomically links Findora’s two layers. It’s a bridge that cannot fail because it shares the same consensus mechanism as the Findora blockchain.</p><p>❗Triple Masking provides complete privacy protection for on-chain transactions by shielding asset type, transaction amount, and the sender or receiver address in a transaction.</p><p>❗Use <a href="https://findorascan.io/nodes">Findorascan.io</a> to look up your transactions or research validators before&nbsp;staking.</p> Developing Next-Generation Privacy with the Next Generation of Developers <p>Findora is dedicated to bringing privacy to Web3 and working with talented teams across Web3 to make that vision a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Part of that process is providing developers with the tools and documentation they’ll need to build on Findora. To that end, Findora puts on weekly “Findora Fridays” designed to help developers understand how Findora works and how to get&nbsp;started.</p> The Findora Wallet and Native&nbsp;Token <p>One critical workshop done recently was on the Findora Wallet and native token:&nbsp;FRA.</p><p>Dylan, Findora Developer Evangelist, and Charlie, Findora Chancellor of Code, created this workshop to go over the basics of the wallet and the FRA token and how Prism Transfer links the UTXO ledger with the EVM layer. They also touch on gas fees, block speeds, and the consensus mechanism.</p><p>They spend a lot of time on the <a href="https://wallet.findora.org/">Findora Wallet</a> because it is key to understanding and using Findora — it allows users to conduct confidential transactions, create their own custom tokens, stake, use Prism Transfer, and import EVM wallets like MetaMask.</p><p>Here’s a brief recap, along with time stamps for developers who want to dive deeper. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi0xDXRfs7I&amp;t=2s">full workshop here</a> to understand FRA and what the future of privacy finance looks&nbsp;like.</p> Issue Your Own Tokens in the Findora&nbsp;Wallet <p>Using Findora, you can make your own custom asset. Your asset will have the same privacy-preserving capabilities as FRA but have the parameters you&nbsp;set.</p><p>Making tokens inside the wallet is easy. <a href="https://wallet.findora.org/">Download</a> the wallet, point to the network you want (testnet or mainnet), and name your token. You’ll then have some parameters you can set depending on your needs. Everyone can make their own token or stablecoins with programmable privacy using the Findora&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>The tokens you create can be linked to FRC-20 smart contracts so that you’ll have both a smart token and a UTXO that work together simultaneously.</p><p>Learn more starting at&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/pi0xDXRfs7I?t=1384">23:04</a>.</p> The Findora UTXO Ledger and the EVM Extension. <p>FRA token flows seamlessly and atomically between the UTXO ledger and the EVM&nbsp;chain.</p><p>The FRA token is the native token on the UTXO ledger and the Findora EVM ledger. By linking the two layers and giving them the same native token, Findora combines the scalability and privacy of a UTXO-model chain with the programmability of an account-model chain. FRA, Findora’s native token, has to exist on both models. But linking a UTXO ledger with an account-model chain is difficult — but key to how Findora&nbsp;works.</p><p>Findora is more versatile than other privacy projects because it can leverage both models synchronously. The UTXO layer (sometimes called Findora OG) provides privacy protections, and the EVM layer (sometimes called Findora X) extends Findora’s capabilities. Developers can use either model when developing dApps on the platform, depending on which model they&nbsp;need.</p><p>This is how Findora gives account-model tokens privacy-preserving functionality.</p> What is Prism and How Prism Transfer&nbsp;Works <p>The key to Findora’s ability to connect the UTXO ledger with an EVM-compatible chain or dApp is Prism Transfer.</p><p>Prism is a blockchain bridge that interatomically links the two chains so that they can act as one. Using Prism, developers can leverage either a UTXO model or an account model, depending on their needs. In the Findora Wallet, Prism lets users transfer tokens between the UTXO wallet and an EVM-compatible wallet (like MetaMask).</p><p>Prism Transfer can’t fail because it shares its consensus mechanism with Findora OG. Since both the chain and the bridge share the same consensus engine, every transaction is atomically processed. Blockchain bridges typically link two networks running on two separate consensus engines, which can easily get out of sync. Since Prism shares its consensus mechanism with Findora, it can fuse the two chains together.</p><p>The design is truly revolutionary and has never been achieved&nbsp;before.</p><p>Learn more about Prism at <a href="https://youtu.be/pi0xDXRfs7I?t=3376">56:15</a>. At <a href="https://youtu.be/pi0xDXRfs7I?t=3844">1:04:02</a>, Charlie goes more in-depth into how Prism works. In the workshop, you will also get to watch Charlie execute a confidential transfer with Prism in real-time and show off what we call “Double Masking.”</p> What are Double Masking and Triple&nbsp;Masking? <p>Double Masking was implemented on the original implementation of the Findora UTXO ledger (sometimes called Findora OG). Using Bulletproofs, the UTXO ledger can shield the token type and token amount used in a transaction on-chain.</p><p>Triple Masking will be the next iteration, using Turbo-PLONKs. Triple Masking will allow users to shield the sender and receiver addresses along with the token type and transaction amount.</p><p>(For a live demo of what Triple Masking could do, check out <a href="https://ys.finance/">Yellow Submarine</a>, a confidential cross-chain transaction protocol that uses Findora. Dylan and Charlie didn’t get a chance to demo Triple Masking this&nbsp;time).</p> Use Findorascan.io to Research Validators <p>In the workshop, you get to see Double Masking in action (and what Triple Masking will look like) and what it would look like to outside observers using findorascan.io.</p><p>Findorascan is built into the native wallet and is a tool that lets users research transactions and validators before they delegate&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Delegating funds to validators on Findora is a great way to earn FRA passively, but choosing a validator that is right for you is essential. You can quickly and easily see states about a validator using <a href="https://findorascan.io/nodes">findorascan.io</a>:</p><p>To learn more about staking rewards on Findora, check out our wiki <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/components/Staking/rewards">here</a> or our latest article on tokenomics <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-network-tokenomics-921bea47cbfd">here</a>.</p><p>Or, explore validators and transactions on Findora for yourself at <a href="https://findorascan.io/">findorascan.io/</a>.</p>We wanted to call the tool “FinDora the Explorer” but couldn’t get the copyright.<p>We put on regular workshops for developers on Fridays to prepare them to develop on Findora.

 Meet our new hire — Jordan Bates, Community Management <p>#15 — This is the fifteenth post in our “Meet our new hire” series, where we introduce you to the latest additions to our team here at BlockWallet.</p><p>We’d like to introduce our latest hire, Jordan Bates! Jordan began his journey with BlockWallet as a community member. Through his active participation and consistently providing valuable suggestions and contributions to the BlockWallet community, we saw a natural fit for Jordan to transition into a Community Manager&nbsp;role.</p><p>Read more to learn about Jordan, his position at BlockWallet, and his thoughts on&nbsp;crypto.</p> What’s your job position? <p>I’m a Community Manager at BlockWallet and I’m in charge of the following:</p>  Educating the community around BlockWallet  Keeping the community engaged  Relaying information between the team and community  <p>I’ll also be helping out with writing short informational pieces and doing the occasional bug fix wherever necessary.</p> Which projects have you worked on&nbsp;before? <p>I’ve been a part of a few crypto-focused communities, such as Axie Infinity and a few other p2e projects, since finishing my computer science University course last year. BlockWallet is the first crypto project I’ve worked for full time and so far it’s been&nbsp;great!</p> When did you first get involved in&nbsp;crypto? <p>I’ve been keeping track of crypto for a few years now, but really started looking into Bitcoin and Ethereum in more detail around December of 2020. My existing interest in computer science was highly relevant and helped me understand the inner workings of some of the bigger Layer 1 blockchains. After a few months of research I bought my first batch of Ethereum and shortly after, I started getting involved with the BlockWallet community.</p> What made you interested in BlockWallet? <p>I’ve been searching for high potential low cap projects for a little while when I stumbled across BlockWallet in April of 2021. I loved the branding and thought the idea of a MetaMask alternative that focuses more on user privacy was a fantastic idea! I started getting involved with the community and made suggestions and contributions wherever I could — and as soon as I heard there was a community manager role available I jumped at the&nbsp;chance!</p> Why do you think privacy matters on blockchains? <p>Without privacy your data is often at the mercy of the highest bidder, who may not have your best interests at heart. This idea is well known in the traditional financial world, which is why your bank balance isn’t open to the public. When it comes to public ledgers, however, your financial information is easily accessible if you don’t take extra steps to protect&nbsp;it.</p><p>If you wouldn’t expose your bank account activity in Web2, why would you do the equivalent in&nbsp;Web3?</p> Do you have any predictions on where crypto will be 5 years from&nbsp;now? <p>5 years from now I think the crypto space will be largely the same, just with a larger market cap and more of a focus on user privacy. I also think that the average Ethereum user won’t have to use MetaMask anymore&nbsp;😎</p> Parting thoughts <p>I’m really glad to be a part of this amazing community at such an early stage and can’t wait to see what the future holds for BlockWallet 💪🔲</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is the most private, non-custodial browser extension wallet, where users can store funds and interact with their favorite blockchain applications privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy poses real security risks for newcomers and enthusiasts alike. BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating the friction faced by millions of users and making privacy accessible for everyone, everywhere.</p><p>Blockwallet uses battle-tested privacy-enhancing technology to protect your financial data. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain applications, the requests are sent through Privacy Proxies by default, concealing the IP address and other metadata, which can be used to identify the user. You can also use the Privacy Pools feature, powered by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zk-snarks">zk-SNARKs</a> technology, to deposit and mix funds in a smart contract. This allows transferring funds without links to your history and identity on the blockchain, effectively rendering them untraceable.</p><p>Anyone can easily install BlockWallet and start reaping the benefits. Besides full privacy functionality, BlockWallet comes packed with an array of features that go beyond privacy for a seamless user experience.

<p>Like its predecessor, Wasabi Wallet 2.0 &nbsp;is an open-source, non-custodial, privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet for desktop, that implements trustless WabiSabi coinjoin over the Tor anonymity network.<br></p><p>This newest iteration promises more privacy at less cost for the user. The zkSNACKs coordinator in Wasabi Wallet 2.0 offers an initial coordinator fee of 0.3% which only fresh UTXOs will pay. Remixes (even after one transaction), Wasabi Wallet 1.0 coinjoin outputs and UTXOs of 0.01 BTC or less pay no coordinator fees in Wasabi Wallet 2.0 coinjoins. </p><p>We know you've all been impatiently waiting so we've compiled a concise list of some of the newest features in Wasabi Wallet 2.0. Read more about it below.</p><p></p> Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Welcome Screen  <p>After the Wallet has been downloaded and installed users are greeted by a completely revamped User Interface and color scheme that welcomes them to the wasabi experience and outlines the project’s core values.</p><p></p> Loading Your Wallet  <p>The login screen has been completely redesigned/revamped since the TestNet release. The border of the wallet has been changed and the previous sliding sidebar on the left has been replaced with a sleek transparent design.</p><p>Wasabi 1.0 users who have upgraded to Wasabi Wallet 2.0 will be able to access their wallets using their previous login information, new users will be presented with the following prompts:</p> Create a New Wallet <p>After the user has selected the ‘create a new wallet' option &nbsp;from the ‘Add Wallet’ prompt, they will then be able to:</p>  Name the wallet and create a password  Write down the numbered recovery words in the correct numbered order  Confirm recovery words by entering particular words in the sequence they were given.  Choose a coinjoin strategy  <p>Connecting to hardware wallet<br>The user can connect a hardware wallet to Wasabi<br><br>Import a wallet<br>Import an existing wallet to Wasabi <br><br>Recover a wallet<br>Recover an existing wallet using the Recovery Words</p> Loading the wallet <p>Initiates the Auto-start coinjoin countdown - a feature which usually starts within the first 15 minutes of loading your wallet. However, the user can start coinjoin immediately after the wallet has loaded by clicking on the ‘play’ button.</p> Coinjoin Strategy <p>There are 3 default coinjoin profiles meaning that they have specific default settings regarding the coinjoins. The user can choose which one it prefers or create their own customized one. The defaults are: </p>  Minimize costs  Maximize speed  Maximize privacy   <p>The customize feature allows you to adjust the settings for the coinjoin</p>  Enable/disable Automatically start coinjoin  Anonymity score target (2-300)  Coinjoin time preference (hours, days, weeks, months).  <p>The wallet home page displays the user’s balance, the privacy progress, the current exchange rate (BTC/USD) and the transaction history list. Users loading newly created wallets will have an empty wallet with a Privacy Progress of 100%.</p><p>Privacy progress indicates the percentage of progress in making your entire wallet private/making the coins in your wallet private. Users will have a privacy progress of 100% when there are no coins in their wallets. </p><p>Discreet Mode (formerly known as Privacy Mode) hides all the sensitive information on your screen by changing the numbers to hash symbols.<br><br>Other options on the Wallet Home Screen include:</p><p>Wallet Info (wallet fingerprint, derivation path &amp; key information)</p><p>Wallet Settings (coinjoin related settings &amp; Verify Recovery Words)</p><p>Wallet Statistics &nbsp;(UTXO count, balance, address &amp; key gap information)</p> Sending Bitcoin with Wasabi Wallet 2.0   To send bitcoin, users need to click on the Send button in the upper right corner of the wallet’s home page.  Enter the address you want to send bitcoin to or use your webcam to scan the QR code (available for Windows only).  Enter the amount of bitcoin or dollar value you would like to send. The wallet automatically calculates and converts this amount to the amount of bitcoin that will be sent.  <p>Before Sending transactions, the wallet provides a Transaction Preview that gives a summary of your transaction. This &nbsp;includes:</p><p>-The amount of BTC you are sending<br>-The address you are sending the BTC to<br>-Who could know about this transaction (only if non-private coins are used)<br>-The estimated transaction confirmation time<br>-The transaction fee<br></p> Privacy Suggestions <p>To avoid change, users will have a single transaction with no transaction change returning to their wallets. Thus creating a smaller digital footprint on the blockchain and making your transactions a bit more private. Users can avoid change by sending more or sending less bitcoin than originally intended. </p> Get suggestions to avoid privacy leaks by having no change in the transaction <p>The wallet tries to maintain coins with differing denominations and tries to find the best coin combinations that will produce the least difference for the target amount.</p> Receiving Bitcoin with Wasabi Wallet 2.0  <p> <br>To receive bitcoin, users need to click on the Receive button in the upper right corner of the wallet’s home page. Label the address by entering the name of the entity or person you are receiving bitcoin from and then click the continue button to generate the receive address.</p><p>All previously generated bitcoin addresses which haven't been used yet, are displayed at &nbsp;Unused Receive Addresses.</p> Advanced Features  <p>The Wallet Coins displays all the wallets' utxo's.

 Introducing Sign-in with Web3 — Building a Non-Custodial World <p>In a much needed multi-chain extension to Sign-in with Ethereum, users will now be able to control their digital identity with their Ethereum/ENS, Solana, and Starknet accounts instead of relying on traditional/custodial profiles.</p><p>Importance of building a non-custodial future</p><p>In crypto, there is a saying that goes “Not your keys, not your crypto ‘’ exemplifying the importance of non-custodiality, — the need to shift the dynamic of ownership from entities to the end-user. The principle also extends beyond just the crypto you hold to your very identity itself. While traditional Web2 entities have done a tremendous job in making the user experience incredibly intuitive but that has also come at a cost — the cost of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There is excessive monetization of the users’ activity and their residing information on the web. Security compromises even among the biggest names in cybersecurity are increasingly common. As the average user is becoming more and more aware of these tradeoffs, the voice to safeguard their identity is growing louder by the day. We at Web3Auth firmly believe that non-custodiality is the future and we want to lead the way in making it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Sign-in With Web3 — You Own Your&nbsp;Identity</p><p>Web3 has to a large extent cracked the code for the user privacy problem. The power of public and private keys, enabled by crypto technologies, allows users to own their username, and profile data, and use their accounts across different applications. This is the fundamental on which built Web3Auth was built — to leverage the power of threshold cryptography to shift the dynamic of power from entities to individuals. When the Ethereum Foundation announced Sign-in with Ethereum, it was not only an important(albeit silent) innovation for the internet, it was also a solid validation and acknowledgement of our core&nbsp;values.</p><p>Sign-in with Web3 adds on to that innovation with a powerful multi-chain twist. It extends that innovation to some of the biggest chain ecosystems. Starting today, users on the Ethereum, Solana, and Starknet chains can log in to any Web2 application using their web3 identities thereby bringing the security and privacy of Web3 authentication to&nbsp;Web2.</p><p>What Does Sign-in With Web3&nbsp;Solve?</p><p>Today, there are multiple blockchain platforms and thus naturally, there arises a need to have a standard specification for authentication with Web3 identities. This led to the birth of<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md"> CAIP-74</a> which allows for creating a chain-agnostic Object Capability (CACAO), based on a signing message as an IPLD object. Sign in with Web3 endeavours to maintain compatibility with CAIP-74, thereby adhering to a chain agnostic standard.</p> Supported Chains<a href="https://siww.web3auth.io/#supported-chains">​</a> <p>Currently, Sign-in with Web3&nbsp;supports</p>  Ethereum  Solana  Starknet  <p>**Support for more chains coming&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Do check our<a href="https://siww.web3auth.io/"> documentation</a> for a step by step guide on how to build a Sign-in with Web3 flow to navigate the authentication logic. Feel free to reach out to us in case you have questions on our<a href="https://t.me/web3authdev"> Telegram&nbsp;Chat</a></p><p>Additionally, Web3Auth, the creator of Sign-in with Web3, offers a dedicated <a href="http://docs.web3auth.io">suite of authentication</a> tools for all Web3 Developers. This includes support for OAuth and native biometric login using our Plug and Play SDK.

<p>In this episode from October 2019, a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen and former a16z podcast showrunner Sonal Choksi bring on MIT economist and bestselling author Andrew McAfee to discuss why the lessons of human growth in times past, from the Industrial Revolution onwards, might not apply to our future. It used to be that the only way for humanity to grow — and progress — was through destroying the environment. But is this interplay between human growth vs. environment really a zero-sum game? Even if it were true in history, is it true today? If capitalism is not responsible for environmental degradation, than who or what is? And where does (and doesn’t) technology come in?</p><p>The conversation is based on McAfee’s 2019 book <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/More-from-Less/Andrew-McAfee/9781982103576">More from Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using Fewer Resources -- and What Happens Next,&nbsp;</a> ranging broadly across many areas of growth, from the future of energy and agriculture to the role of capitalism and technology today and tomorrow, from dematerialization &nbsp;to Tesla, Buckminster Fuller, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>Privacy is best conceptualized as the right to control information about yourself, selectively disclosing only what you intend to.<br><br>If you think about it, the way our society uses the words "public" and "private" gives up quite a lot of information about our nature. It speaks about how we perceive what we allow (or don’t allow) others to see. <br><br>We say of someone that they're very private if they don't post a lot about their lives on social media. A public building is a government facility or one the government pays for and maintains. And the private sector is constituted by companies that are overseen by a government but held privately by individuals who can operate as they think is best. <br><br>This is just one example of the many ways in which the desire for privacy influences our daily lives. As we’ll elaborate on throughout this article, privacy is more than a social construct —it is a key component of the human experience. We all have thoughts, memories, and aspects of our lives that we choose not to let everyone see. <br><br>If you're reading this, chances are you highly value the human right to privacy. However, you might not have thought deeply about the roots of this belief and why some might oppose it. You may also have never considered that privacy can be seen through the lens of philosophy, ethics, and legality. <br><br>Let’s see what happens once we put on these different lenses.</p> The New Secret: A framework to think about privacy <p><br>Panther's co-Founder Anish Mohammed and philosopher Shaj Mohan deeply explored privacy in their 2011 article <a href="https://www.epw.in/journal/2011/13/commentary/new-secret.html">The New Secret</a>. In the light of the previous year’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-wikileaks-enlightened-us-in-2010/">WikiLeaks scandals</a>, the authors delved into how secrets are traditionally viewed, kept, and treated.</p>Privacy could be considered an intrinsic part of human nature and so could the desire to uncover secrets.<p>The New Secret characterizes a secret as all information that one would like to keep from the knowledge of others, for whatever reason. A secret could range from your true feelings about your spouse's decoration taste to your credit history. In fact, secrets have a few fascinating properties of their own.</p> Characteristics and different flavors of secrets <p></p><p>Secrets have different structures and properties that cause quite unique social dynamics around them. These properties are that they have consequence, extractability, are weaponizable, and obey hierarchy.<br><br>Let’s start with consequence. A secret's importance (and therefore the care with which it is kept) is tied to its potential revealing's consequences. A secret's uncovering could result in a national security crisis, as WikiLeaks did for the United States, or in a $1 library fine.<br><br>Another, more abstract property of secrets is that they are extractable. <br><br>A spy on an enemy state can utilize her position to extract secrets for the benefit of her nation. This shows that secrets' importance often lies in their ability to be weaponized. Another way to extract secrets is by knowing a specific procedure, as a hacker can utilize his encryption knowledge to decrypt a password.<br><br>Secrets are also hierarchical. For example, in a private (again, pun intended) company, a CEO theoretically has the right to request all kinds of information from and of their employees, while this is often not true the other way around. In nation-states, the State sits alone at the top of the hierarchy of secrets.</p> Secrets in a digital society <p></p><p>In an era of non-stop data exchange, Instagram stories, leaked videos/photos, and a 24/7 need for social media scandals, the properties of secrets remain unchanged. Some would even say that they’re magnified.<br><br>Our authors argue that the WikiLeaks case also exemplifies that the more critical a secret is, the greater the credibility of its revealer becomes. That is that, by revealing a secret of a high member of a hierarchy, its revealer gains hierarchical importance as well.<br><br>WikiLeaks famously revealed secrets from the United States’ government, arguably the top member of most global hierarchies. These secrets carried great consequence to the reputation of the State, incentivizing it to prosecute their revealers with all its force. Having obtained secrets by extracting them from within the system (as opposed to the State voluntarily disclosing them), WikiLeaks gained great prominence as a source of truth. </p>Whereas previously a secret would have only helped the revealer gain a weapon, nowadays, it also can boost the revealer's reputation.<p>Another law that influences secrets is that information obtained by revealing a secret has a higher chance of being true, as demonstrated by video espionage. Leaks such as leaked celebrity videos, secret audio recordings, and photographs covertly taken with a telescopic zoom are perceived as carrying more truth and importance than statements to the press. Information extracted secretly or by force, even in the press, is more likely to be considered true. This makes entertainment portals and magazines that leak or divulge secrets for the first time have a great incentive to do so. <br><br>Another example that shows the laws that govern secrets at play is how, in the information age, victims of abuse by powerful people have a higher perceived credibility than ever. Abuse sufferers now have a better vehicles to reveal secrets without being censored, and the secrets that they revealed about members of high hierarchy can turn into powerful weapons, especially if presenting information obtained covertly or by force.</p> A brief history of privacy  Origins of privacy <p><br>It could seem backward to look at privacy through history after analyzing its implications and how it unfolds in our world. However, understanding privacy and secrets in a modern context will help you realize that very little has changed over time.<br><br>Throughout history, privacy has been proven to be innate to human beings. It is valued universally by all societies in one form or another. The most powerful individuals in all ancient societies had an undisputed right to the secrets of others and the ability to seclude themselves if they chose to.<br><br>There are hints that the desire for privacy is intrinsic to biological life. Many<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.784794/full#B1"> animals</a> (including powerful predators such as lions) have been observed to desire it. This hints at a non-socially constructed nature of the yearning for privacy in humans. You can see a brief list of these species and how and when they secure their privacy below:</p>Species showing privacy-related behaviors. Some of them, you may note, are incredibly similar to their human counterparts. (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.784794/full#B1">Source</a>) Privacy in the first modern societies and today <p></p><p>One area in which we can almost universally see the principle of privacy through history is democracy.<br><br>It didn't take long after the advent of democracy for ancient civilizations to figure out that privacy is an unimpeachable aspect of the democratic process. Secret ballot voting ensures a citizen can't prove (or be proven) to have cast a vote for a particular candidate, thus severely diminishing the efficiency of bribing, threatening, or intimidating voters to win elections.<br><br>Although secret voting was <a href="https://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/7781/4839">partially adopted by the Athenians</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4477105">fully embraced by the Romans</a>, more than a millennium would elapse until it came back with the French Revolution. And, while it took a while to get fully adopted worldwide, democracy is nowadays considered a human right by the United Nations, and is omnipresent in all but the most blatant autocracies.<br><br>Other factors such as ancient records of Mesopotamian houses being designed with a heavy <a href="https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198788218.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198788218-e-19">focus on privacy</a>, most ancient tribes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_of_Sexual_Behavior">showcasing a preference for privacy</a> in their sexual lives, and secret confessions being a part of most religions (derived from ancient customs) - showcase that privacy has always been an integral part of the human experience.</p>Is it a coincidence that these raccoons “feel” more human to see when safeguarding their privacy? Possibly not!<p>Nowadays, the question of whether privacy is a right by its very nature is <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/">highly debated by philosophers</a>. Some attribute the right to privacy as an extent of the right to own and control property, or the right to self-protection. Others consider privacy to be an indissoluble part of the right to human dignity. There are still those who deny that privacy is a human right and consider it a contemporary, potentially disposable social value, but they’re hardly the majority.<br><br>Privacy in our times is a requirement for exercising one's individuality. Having your personal space and belongings and being able to control them as you see fit is crucial for the idea of being distinct from others. What a person chooses to do in their personal space or belongings is subject to their terms. Thus even in interacting with the outside world, explicit or implicit conditions preserve privacy to an extent. There’s even a comparative punishment in restricting someone’s privacy and freedom when putting them in prison.</p> Is the law friendly towards privacy? <p></p><p>The law has always played an interesting role in the relationship we have with our own privacy. Nowadays, the State attempts to do a balancing act between two major concerns: Individuals’ desire for privacy and nations’ interest in policing their populations. From some perspectives, privacy is more of an obstacle than an aid to this mission.<br><br>Interestingly, we can see that this has been the case for most of history.<br><br>In the English-speaking world, privacy rights slowly developed as an extension of the castle doctrine (for which registries go as far back as Ancient Rome). According to it, individuals “have the right to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves against an intruder in their home.” Famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semayne%27s_case">cemented into English common law by a court case in 1604</a> reported by Sir Edward Coke, the castle doctrine has always retained certain exceptions within which public officials may enter uninvited. These exceptions, you could argue, have helped its replication in most Western nations.</p> Privacy and law in the digital age <p></p><p>This blog has extensively covered <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-in-the-age-of-surveillance-a-pipedream-or-something-worth-fighting-for-341a67f1db76">(1)</a> <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-economics-of-privacy-an-overview-of-the-economic-consequences-of-total-transparency-fed489e71d47">(2)</a> <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/interoperable-privacy-building-privacy-bridges-to-all-of-defi-2eaa89c9c7ac">(3)</a> the importance of digital privacy, why it’s necessary, and the <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">kind of privacy solutions we’ll need</a> as we move into Web3. Because of this, as opposed to covering the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-a-cypherpunk-f9f72a0f5bcd">cypherpunk fight</a> and the developments in encryption and zero-knowledge technology, we’ll only briefly focus on the government-initiated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">Crypto Wars</a>.</p><p>It's no secret that governments are typically <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/26/government-is-racing-against-clock-keep-encryption-secure/">high spenders</a> on and hardcore users of cryptography.</p><p>What you might not know is that for most of modern digital history, several governments (the US' first and foremost) have <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/deciphering-the-cryptography-debate/">pushed back</a> against encryption-related exports and public products, arguing that they would enable a variety of crimes. Had these restrictions stayed in place, becoming as strict as intended, today we would live in a very different world. Backdoored software, unencrypted or only slightly encrypted Internet data (which would, paradoxically, enable several other crimes), and perpetual cellular surveillance would be an everyday matter.</p><p>This period of retaliation is now known as the Crypto Wars, and some consider it ongoing. Fortunately, largely thanks to the efforts put in place by intellectuals, civil rights and privacy advocates, and private sector pressure, the distribution and export of software related to encryption now enjoy a more solid, permissive <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/web-security-privacy/0596000456/ch04s04.html">legal stance</a>.</p> Is our privacy getting better or worse? <p></p><p>We are also now seeing the first <a href="https://unctad.org/page/data-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide">laws</a> trying to empower users’ digital privacy, as we let devices that can record our every activity into our homes, transact online, and unintentionally create <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/features/your-digital-footprint-its-bigger-than-you-realize/">deep digital footprints</a>. In fact, this is only possible thanks to technologies our governments previously worked against.</p><p>Nowadays, there are <a href="https://unctad.org/page/data-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide">regulations around customer data</a> of many kinds. The European <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> is considered by many the most comprehensible legal framework around data privacy. At the same time, in the United States, a handful of domain-specific federal laws such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act">HIPAA</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COPPA">COPPA</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Credit_Reporting_Act">Fair Credit and Reporting Act</a>, dictate how businesses may handle customer data. However, a similar level of investment and policymaking goes towards surveillance and control of digital activity, leading to a “privacy vs security” discussion, although some may argue this is a false dichotomy.</p>At least in most polls, there is no clear winner in the privacy vs safety discussion. Economics of privacy  Financial Privacy <p></p><p>There is undoubtedly a <a href="https://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/consume/2006_06_privacy.pdf">financial aspect to privacy</a>. </p><p>Most of our private activities leave financial traces that may reveal sensitive information or point those interested in violating our privacy closer towards it. Campaign donations show where you lean politically, medical expenditures may <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/?sh=5ac329646668">expose</a> illnesses or concerns of a patient, and a credit card charge from a local business testifies that you have been there and consumed their goods or services.</p><p>Breaches of financial information can have significant negative consequences, not only of the monetary kind. These consequences include, but aren’t limited to: </p>  Harassment by salespeople.  Political, ethnical, identitarian, or religious persecution.  Increased exposure to cyber-attacks and fraud attempts.  Hyper-specialized targeting.  Digital price gouging, <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/online-marketplaces-could-expose-third-party-sellers-to-price-gouging-liability">a very present, current issue. </a>  <p>All of the above can vary in gravity based on a number of factors, but the last one showcases one of the main issues with lack of financial privacy: the (sometimes hidden) exposure of an individual to being manipulated using their data. </p><p>For example, due to non-private financial data, a person that an algorithm detects has a family member with an illness could see an increase in price for medicine purchases. This can happen automatically through algorithms. However, it’s perhaps more preoccupying that a lot of our data may have been already irretrievably leaked.</p>Amazon claims that their algorithm <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/amazon-price-gouging-1.5719050">radically increasing the price of basic goods</a> during COVID-19 related shortages was merely incidental.<p>Unfortunately, if we can’t transact through means that are <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9">inherently private</a>, our data won’t be so. It also sheds light on a major issue with traditional and on-chain payments, as they tend to carry with them a significant amount of data.</p><p>In the case of on-chain transactions, it’s also important to note that an additional danger associated with them is the transparency of public ledgers (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-economics-of-privacy-an-overview-of-the-economic-consequences-of-total-transparency-fed489e71d47">of which we’ve also spoken at length</a>). This can lead to users being front-runned, arbitraged, having their value extracted, and similar problems.</p> Data leaks and consumer privacy <p></p><p>In today’s internet, the capability of service providers to collect and store data grows faster than their ability to secure it. For that reason, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches">customer data leaks</a> have unfortunately become commonplace. Billions of database entries with personally identifiable information, credit card numbers, billing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and passwords are available all over the internet. Every new leak potentially worsens those that came before it, as data on an individual can be complemented and updated. With enough information at hand, <a href="https://youtu.be/WaaANll8h18">identity theft</a> becomes a trivial endeavor, and <a href="https://www.lifelock.com/learn/identity-theft-resources/lasting-effects-of-identity-theft">real-world consequences</a> are disastrous.</p><p>Government data leaks are also a predominant issue. The State’s power makes data breaches from government databases particularly severe. In the financial realm, the very existence of such a centralized database presents the risk of its citizens being compromised by hackers. This is why some, including Panther, might point out that in a digital era we should start heading in a direction of more, not less, financial privacy when it comes to disclosing information.</p> Is it possible to put a price on privacy? <p></p><p>Different economic studies have tried to <a href="https://techpolicyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Prince_Wallsten_How-Much-is-Privacy-Worth-Around-the-World-and-Across-Platforms.pdf">price privacy</a> using several mechanisms. Using the "<a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/">Do Not Call</a>" registry in the United States is an interesting example.</p><p>Through this registry, economists have tried to put a price on privacy by contrasting the potential savings of users outside the registry vs. users that do not access the benefits offered by telemarketers. <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.54.2.442">Different studies</a> place privacy's "price" between $0.50 and $98 a year using this technique in the United States.</p><p>However flawed studies like the one mentioned above &nbsp;be, there is an indication that privacy could have an economic value. The transition to an on-chain economy might allow us to see this more clearly, as the adoption of tools for users to transact privately may showcase how much users are willing to pay to add privacy to their transactions, and at what point this barrier becomes too high.</p> (non-) Conclusion <p><br>Although the debate on whether privacy is a human right or a disposable aspect of our lives will likely continue through the ages, it’s more than clear that it is an all-encompassing matter in modern society.</p><p>There are still many debates to be had over privacy from many different possible angles. Some may even argue that definitions upon financial and data privacy will determine whether we continue to evolve to a more egalitarian society as a whole. Through action, regulations, and surveillance, we will collectively decide whether privacy becomes a default (and in what areas), our nations have complete control of all our information and what to do with it, or privacy is left to people's own devices.</p><p>Whichever side you stand on, what's important is that you're aware of the importance of privacy. As an issue that impacts everyone, it must be at the center of our political, ethical, and philosophical discussions before it is too late. The matter of privacy is indeed too important to leave in the hands of the few.</p><p>If this article made you think about what privacy means in your life and how important it is to preserve it, please make sure to share it with a friend.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a><br><br></p>

<p>Nym components are continuously evolving to make it easier for all actors in the Nym ecosystem to contribute to and interact with the Nym privacy network. And this week is seeing some important updates to the Nym smart contracts and a new wallet&nbsp;release.</p><p>Firstly, a quick update on the contracts: these are being adjusted so that staking supply better matches real world numbers as well as implementing a more competitive active set. These are important changes that will result in a more dynamic token economics and will have the effect of increasing expected staking APY (up to 40% annualized) for the next couple of months, after which it will tail off to a more stable rate (<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-mixnet-apy-initial-simulations-for-first-quarter-139ac49d5348">read&nbsp;more</a>).</p><p>The wallet and the explorer have some exciting new features which should make it much easier&nbsp;to…</p>  manage your&nbsp;accounts  <a href="https://youtu.be/sRMZY6Ez1bA">bond</a> a node into Nym mainnet or Sandbox&nbsp;testnet  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZAVoCmYGNFQ">delegate</a> stake to mix nodes as reputation to earn a share of their&nbsp;rewards  <p><a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Download</a> the new version of the wallet. The wallet is <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym">open source</a>, unpermissioned and can be forked by anyone wishing to extend functionality.</p><p>Now let’s go through the new features!</p> 1. Multi account management <p>Until now you could only have one account/address under your login. In this version of the wallet we have added the feature that enables creating multiple accounts under the same login or import existing ones. To create or import accounts, make sure you have a password set for your wallet and that you are logged in using password (as opposed to logging in using your mnemonic).</p><p>Then click on the “Account” notion on top of the wallet (as shown). In the next window import your accounts one by one using their mnemonic or create new accounts.</p><p>For each step you will have to confirm actions using your password. When creating a new account always remember to save your mnemonics in a safe&nbsp;place!</p> 2. Better overview of your delegated stake <p>Here is where we have added the most new features to the new wallet. If you hold NYM tokens, you can delegate your tokens to mix nodes operating the mixnet. This will boost that node’s reputation and enable you to earn a share of the rewards it receives for providing privacy.</p><p>In the new wallet release, it is now easier to maintain an overview of who you have delegated stake to and manage your delegations.</p><p>First thing you will notice is a new table that lists your delegations. If you have never delegated to a node before you can start doing so by clicking on the “Delegate” button.</p><p>To find a mix node to delegate to, go to the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes">Nym network explorer</a>, where you can sort the nodes based on their different parameters i.e Stake Saturation, Profit Margin, Uptime etc. or browse the delegators channel in the <a href="https://discord.gg/7F6g9cWh">Nym&nbsp;Discord</a>.</p><p>When selecting a node make sure not to select the ones with more than 100% stake saturation. Stake saturation of &gt;=100% is now shown in red on the explorer (see below image) meaning those nodes already have too much stake delegated to them and so any extra delegation will just lower the share of rewards for all delegators of that node. You can read more on how to select nodes to delegate to&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">here</a>.</p><p>Once you have selected a mix node, simply copy its identity key from the explorer and the amount you want to delegate and paste in the delegation window as&nbsp;below.</p><p>Once you confirm that you want to delegate stake to the given mix node, your delegation will be queued up and visible in the “Pending Delegation Events” in the bottom of the page. It can take up to an hour (one epoch) for your delegation to take effect. After that you can see the details of your delegation like the following.</p><p>You can keep delegating to more nodes by following the same process explained above. All your delegations will be listed on the same&nbsp;page.</p> 3. Easier interface for managing your delegations <p>Now let’s look into what you can do with each of your delegations. Click on the action menu shown with 3 dots on the right edge of the delegation table (as shown&nbsp;below).</p><p>You will notice 4 actions that you can take. Let’s explain each of&nbsp;them;</p><p>Delegate more: If you are happy with the performance of the node you have delegated to, you can always add more stake to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Undelegate: Undelegate your stake and withdraw the rewards you have accrued by undelegating from the mix&nbsp;node.</p><p>Redeem: Redeem rewards you have accrued from a node and transfer the amount to your account&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Compound: In order to get compounded rewards for your stake delegation, you will need to compound your rewards manually using this&nbsp;button.</p><p>Note that all of the above actions will require some tiny amount of NYMs to pay for transaction fees. Make sure you always have some NYMs left in your balance to be able to pay for&nbsp;fees.</p><p>This sums up the new features of this&nbsp;release.</p><p>Until next time, happy delegating!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-wallet-v1-0-5-is-out-f4ad282ee389">Nym wallet v1.0.5 is out!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>How when it comes to privacy — the more the&nbsp;merrier!</p><p>The mass surveillance of today’s internet has to be met by a movement for mass privacy, as the communications paradigm of tomorrow.</p><p>Privacy cannot be a question of individual preference because the nature of online surveillance means that one person’s choices and actions online reveals a lot about another person&nbsp;too!</p><p>Nym makes a collective approach to privacy possible, technically and economically. And the aim is to power up a whole ecosystem of privacy preserving applications.</p><p>This blogpost gives an overview of Nym and how it is built to bring forth an ecosystem approach to securing privacy. With the launch of the core Nym infrastructure the next phase is for a plethora of privacy enhanced apps (PEApps) to be built on this network layer privacy&nbsp;system.</p><p>As we’re fond of saying, privacy loves&nbsp;company!</p> A privacy layer for any app, wallet or&nbsp;chain <p>Nym is a privacy layer for any application and is chain agnostic. Nym is a mixnet that takes any digital communications, encrypts it and mixes it with other communications so that no one can trace the patterns of communication. Even when your communications are encrypted, the timings and patterns of communication traffic reveals a lot about you and your relationships. With Nym, your communications are effectively “lost in the&nbsp;crowd”.</p><p>What this means is that the more people communicating through the mixnet, the better for everyone’s privacy!</p><p>Whether a Telegram or Signal message or a cryptocurrency transaction broadcast across a peer-to-peer network, the network is designed to provide privacy for any app, wallet or chain. And in turn this generates an income for mix nodes and delegators who are rewarded through fees for providing this&nbsp;service.</p><p>This approach is an infrastructural approach, where privacy is not just reserved for technical experts (or those with enough money to hire them), but for everyone — integrated into the very apps and wallets you are already using. In this way, Nym is similar to a public utility, think of it like the water mains or the electricity grid.</p><p>By providing the infrastructure on which a truly private internet can be built and maintained, Nym frees up developer time to create user-facing apps that are private by design — just as protocols such as TCP provide the building blocks for the existing internet.</p> The Nym ecosystem <p>Nym is already made up of a global ecosystem of mix node operators and validators who are operating the Nym mixnet (mixing traffic) and the Nyx blockchain (maintaining the reputation and topology of mix&nbsp;nodes).</p><p>The Nym <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">wallet</a> is the interface for anyone wishing to get involved with the core infrastructure. The wallet is a simple interface that allows people to either bond NYM tokens and run a mix node themselves, or delegate NYM tokens to mix node operators to earn a share of their&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>But this is just the core infrastructure….</p> It is now time for the&nbsp;PEApps! <p>This ecosystem now needs to grow, with user-facing apps so that ordinary people can finally go about their digital lives in the knowledge that what they do and say online will not be used to target themselves or&nbsp;others!</p><p>As the mass-adoption of Signal and Protonmail has demonstrated, when given half a chance, most people will not hesitate to adopt privacy preserving applications over other&nbsp;options.</p><p>Now is the time for PEApps! This is what we have started calling the privacy enhanced applications that will be running on&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>The Nym docs can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">here</a>.</p><p>Our <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-permanent-testnet-sandbox-264e561adb65">Sandbox</a> environment allows developers to explore&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>For more information on developer grants, contact: <a href="mailto:grant@nymtech.net">grant@nymtech.net</a></p><p>Join the privacy ecosystem</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/privacy-loves-company-dc877a672038">Privacy loves company</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Partnership includes bridging BAT cross-chain for Aurora ecosystem utility</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Announcing the news today in Austin at the Consensus conference, Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave and BAT, and Alex Shevchenko, CEO of Aurora Labs, explained how the companies will collaborate to integrate Aurora, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the NEAR Protocol, into Brave Wallet. This means greater multi-chain functionality in Brave Wallet and expanded utility for the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token (BAT)</a>.</p>
<p>In the coming months, this integration will bring support for Aurora as one of the preloaded chains in Brave Wallet (in addition to Solana and Ethereum). Complementing the addition of the Aurora EVM into the multi-chain Brave Wallet for Brave’s 60 million monthly active users, the partnership includes bridging BAT cross-chain for use in the growing  <a href="https://aurora.dev/ecosystem#exchanges">Aurora dApp ecosystem</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 More multi-chain functionality in Brave Wallet 
<p>Aurora will become a preloaded blockchain available in the multi-chain Brave Wallet (in addition to Solana and Ethereum). The integration with NEAR’s EVM comes on the heels of <a>last month’s announcement</a> of a full integration with the Solana blockchain, and shows Brave’s commitment to increasing the pace of development toward an open, multi-chain experience in Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Addition of Aurora brings significant added value to Brave Wallet users. Aurora fees are up to 1,000x lower than Ethereum’s. For example, the cost of transferring an ERC-20 token is below $0.01, while for Ethereum (at 50 Gwei and an ETH price of $3,000), it’s around $5.40. Aurora is also able to host thousands of transactions per second, representing an increase of 50x compared to mainnet Ethereum.</p>
<p>In the coming months, this integration will mean Brave users can buy, sell, store, and swap Aurora tokens directly in Brave Wallet. It will also bring support for Aurora assets like NFTs, and DApp support on the Aurora chain.</p>
<p>“Integrating the Aurora chain with our Brave Wallet will enable more users and creators to participate in Web3 by taking advantage of low fees and fast transactions, right from the Brave browser,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave and BAT. “Soon, access to Aurora tokens and assets will be just clicks away in the Brave Wallet, and the Aurora Bridge will enable BAT holders to easily use their assets on NEAR’s Aurora chain.”</p>
<p>“This is a very significant partnership for the future advancement of Web3 and mass adoption, offering a multi-chain integration bridging the Ethereum and NEAR communities via Aurora - and one of the first big integrations via Brave,” said Marieke Flament, CEO of NEAR Foundation. “With the new Brave Wallet there will be a host of Web3 functionality supported such as NFT and Swap - all of which will provide the protection of a privacy-preserving, in-browser wallet that’s secure and mass-market ready.”</p>

 Expanded utility for BAT 
<p>The NEAR ecosystem partnership also brings expanded utility for the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token (BAT)</a>. It will allow BAT holders to use their assets on the Aurora chain, via <a href="https://near.org/bridge/">Aurora Bridge</a>. The Aurora Bridge (based on <a href="https://near.org/bridge/">Rainbow Bridge</a>) provides for the permissionless transfer of tokens and data between Ethereum and Aurora.</p>
<p>In the coming months, we will also expand access to the Aurora ecosystem by partnering with Aurora DeFi partners. For example, holders will be able to earn rewards by staking BAT in Aurora liquidity pools. In addition to DeFi, the <a href="https://aurora.dev/ecosystem">Aurora DApp ecosystem</a> has grown to include blockchain gaming and NFT marketplaces where BAT could be utilized through the Brave and NEAR partnership.</p>

 Brave Wallet: Secure, multi-chain access to Web3 
<p>From the start, we envisioned Brave Wallet as a secure onramp to Web3. The Brave Wallet enables multi-chain access right from the browser, and brings expanded utility for the Basic Attention Token. Today’s announcement of the NEAR partnership brings us closer to realizing that vision.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for specific timing about Aurora access, and more announcements about the Brave / NEAR partnership.</p>
<p>Ready to get started with Brave and Brave Wallet? Just download Brave for desktop, Android, or iOS, and click the  in the address bar to get started.</p>
<p>About Brave</p>
<p>Brave Software’s fast, privacy-oriented browser, combined with its blockchain-based digital advertising platform, is reinventing the Web for users, publishers, and advertisers. Users get a private, speedier Web experience with much longer battery life, publishers increase their revenue share, and advertisers achieve better conversion. Users can opt into privacy-respecting ads that reward them with the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a frequent flyer-like token they can redeem or use to tip or contribute to publishers and other content creators. The Brave solution is a win-win for everyone who has a stake in the open Web and who is weary of giving up privacy and revenue to the ad-tech intermediaries. Brave currently has over 60 million monthly active users and over 1.5 million Verified Publishers. Brave Software was co-founded by Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla (Firefox), and Brian Bondy, formerly of Khan Academy and Mozilla.</p>
<p>About Aurora</p>
<p>Aurora is an Ethereum Layer-2 built on top of NEAR Protocol. Aurora delivers 1000x lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum and sub-two-second transaction finalization. Aurora is fully interoperable with Ethereum, with ETH used as a base token and all existing Ethereum tools usable out of the box. Aurora includes the trustless Rainbow bridge, allowing for bidirectional transfers of any information from Ethereum, including ERC-20s. To learn more about Aurora, please visit <a href="https://aurora.dev">aurora.dev</a>.</p>

<p>Going from old to new while staying&nbsp;private.</p><p>We are on the eve of Aztec Connect’s <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/countdown-to-aztec-connect-b7b754b1e539">mainnet release</a>, and <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a>’s relaunch.

That means it’s migration season — time to withdraw funds from the old system and get it into the new&nbsp;one.</p><p>As previously discussed in our prior post outlining <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/layer-by-layer-a-guide-to-aztecs-security-approach-87df087093c0">Aztec’s security approach</a>, user aliases have been preserved, but due to the system hard-fork, funds must be manually migrated to the current version of <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a>.</p><p>Existing users can access the “old” system at — you guessed it — <a href="http://old.zk.money">old.zk.money</a>. Start&nbsp;there.</p> Step 1: Log into “old”&nbsp;zk.money <p>In order to migrate funds, navigate to old.zk.money and click&nbsp;“Login”:</p>The <a href="http://old.zk.money">old.zk.money</a> homepage<p>Navigate to your MetaMask or WalletConnect supported wallet and use the Ethereum address that you originally used to register your alias with zk.money to log&nbsp;in.</p><blockquote>⚠️ Important note on aliases: only the most recent alias associated with each unique Ethereum address has been migrated to the new system.&nbsp;⚠️</blockquote><p>If you misplaced your old.zk.money alias at any point and had to re-register with a new alias, those older aliases are&nbsp;lost.</p><p>Sign the Signature Requests prompted by MetaMask.</p>Sign where it says&nbsp;sign!<p>You will then be prompted with the familiar old.zk.money account balance page. Click “Send” to initiate a withdrawal to Layer&nbsp;1.</p>The <a href="http://old.zk.money">old.zk.money</a> balance&nbsp;page<p>You will then be shown a Withdraw modal. Remember to follow privacy best-practices:</p>  Select a withdrawal amount not associated with your deposit — avoid unique quantities like&nbsp;0.696969  Withdraw to a fresh wallet that is NOT associated with your deposit&nbsp;wallet.  The <a href="http://old.zk.money">old.zk.money</a> withdrawal modal<p>Sign the signature request when prompted by MetaMask.</p>Sign to allow Aztec to generate a spending key and send funds to Layer&nbsp;1.<p>You’re done! If the transaction isn’t showing up in the “Transactions” tab on <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a>, please click on “Internal Txns.”</p>A little-known secret&nbsp;;) Step 2 (the fun part!): Access “New”&nbsp;<a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> <p>New <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> can be accessed straight at <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a>! When you land on the homepage, click on “Shield Now” to be taken to the wallet connection screen.</p>Clicky click.<p>At the sign up screen, click on “Log in” to be taken to the login&nbsp;screen.</p><p>Here’s the key part: stay on or switch to the address you want to migrate from old.zk.money. Then, when prompted, enter your existing alias. Your alias has already been migrated and preserved!</p><p>It’s important to note here that if you are registering a fresh address and want a new alias, you must now record your alias. Aliases can no longer be recovered, so if you forget your alias you will no longer have access to your account and&nbsp;funds.</p><blockquote>⚠️ Important note on new aliases: pick a memorable alias and write it down! Losing your alias means losing account access.&nbsp;⚠️</blockquote><p>Once you’re at the <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> Wallet screen, click “Shield more” to add funds to your&nbsp;balance.</p><p>It’s worth repeating deposit best practices:</p>  Do not deposit idiosyncratic amounts (e.g. 0.696969)  Depositing many smaller quantities is better than depositing extremely large quantities  Deposits are capped at launch to 5 ETH / 10,000&nbsp;DAI  Enter the amount you want to shield and click “Next.” Remember best practices!<p>On this screen you can also select your transaction speed and fee quantity. “Slow” transactions ride along with many others, and settlement time average approximately an hour. “Instant” transactions involve paying for the entire rollup to go, prompting the rollup to settle to Ethereum as soon as the proof is constructed.</p><p>Once you’ve entered your amount and speed, click&nbsp;Next!</p><p>You’ll be taken to a Transaction Confirmation page which summarizes the amount to be shielded along with the Transaction Fee. Click “Confirm Transaction.”</p><p>You should see a Transaction Confirmed! Acknowledgement once the transaction goes through successfully.</p>Woot woot!<p>You will then be taken back to the Wallet screen, which will show a fresh “Shield” transaction under “Transaction History.” It should show one green check ✅&nbsp;, which means the transaction has been sent to the Rollup Provider for settlement to Layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>Hovering over the ✅ will also tell you approximately when the transaction will settle (updated in real&nbsp;time!).</p>One ✅ means confirmed, two ✅ ✅ means&nbsp;settled!<p>Once you see ✅ ✅, the transaction is settled and your balance will show up in the “Net Worth” component up top on the Wallet&nbsp;page.</p><p>Note that “Net Worth” reflects the value of all your positions — liquid or illiquid — whereas “Available” funds reflects just your spendable balance.</p><p>These figures can therefore differ — don’t be&nbsp;alarmed.</p><p>Once you get the double-green checks, you’ve got <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> baby! Shielded funds can then be sent internally, forwarded to another Layer 1 address, or deposited with our launch partners Lido and Element for&nbsp;yield.</p><p>Many more use-cases are coming, so stay tuned, and stay&nbsp;private.</p> 🏗 Build with Aztec Connect&nbsp;SDK <p>Are you a developer who wants to bring privacy to your favorite DeFi protocol?

         Building a More Trustworthy Internet                <p>ByAshley Nash</p><p>Photography:IAN BATES</p><p>PublishedJune 8, 2022</p>            <p>A relentless researcher and builder, Christina Cacioppo solves security and compliance automation to make the internet more trustworthy. </p>       



 
 
   
<p>In 1997 Christina Cacioppo, age 11, was managing a flourishing Beanie Baby business on eBay. It started when her mom came home one evening from Ohio State University, where she was a professor, and announced, “I used the world wide web today.” Cacioppo says she immediately imagined a string web on the wall, and she couldn’t figure out what her mom had used it for. But she was determined to figure it out.</p>



<p>She was, in fact, an especially driven kid, the kind who wanted to learn everything she could about a new idea, who leafed through encyclopedias and who took pleasure in figuring out complex concepts. At a foundational level, this came, she says, via “osmosis” from her parents, who were academic researchers, dedicating their careers to solving problems. So sitting at the computer, reading while waiting for the dial-up connection, it felt natural for Cacioppo to log on and explore the wide world online and outside Columbus, Ohio. Soon, she dove into Beanie Babies, then at the height of their popularity, and realized she could not only collect them, but help others collect them, and make a little money, too. “It’s cool to be interested in things. It’s way more fun than being jaded. You can go down rabbit holes and come up with new things. If you just push enough, you can learn all the things, right,” she says with a laugh, a bit tongue-in-cheek. Reflecting on how this perspective led her to start Vanta, the fastest-growing startup in the internet security space, she says, “It’s not like I was smarter than everyone, [or] I just did a thing and it worked. No. It was like, you go immerse and do the grunge work for a year-plus. Put in the work, and you get stuff out.”</p>



<p>Today Vanta helps thousands of companies strengthen their security with compliance automation software. It is determined to create a new gold standard for security across the internet. And while Cacioppo took a roundabout path to becoming an internet security CEO, the challenge of securely transacting business online began dogging her in her first Beanie Baby hustle. “I didn’t have a credit card, and I was too afraid to steal my mom’s,” Cacioppo says. She did, however, have access to a Kroger. To keep her entrepreneurism secret, she managed payments through money orders bought at the nearby grocery store. “I was showing up on my bike with like $8.42 and sliding it across the counter,” Cacioppo says. It was her first time solving problems as an entrepreneur. And, driven by an innate confidence in her ability to figure things out, to make something good and useful, it was something she’d keep doing—no matter the obstacle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia Capital partner Andrew Reed, who led its 2021 participation in Vanta’s Series A fundraising, describes Cacioppo as the kind of person who has “read every book” and who can effortlessly quote from them. Cacioppo has a self-aware sense of humor about all that she’s mastered, pointing out that she can still name all the original Beanie Babies—Legs the Frog, Splash the Whale—in what she laughingly refers to as a “not-good cocktail party trick.” But she is also quick to emphasize that the key to founding Vanta, as well as the other companies she started, is her ambition; that’s what pushes her to research, to learn, to synthesize and to keep going when things are difficult or discouraging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cacioppo has always been like this, willing to make her own way and figure things out. When she was a kid, she mastered stuffed animal arbitrage to earn spending money. The summer after her freshman year of college, she worked at a Rwandan human rights organization—she started the summer knowing no one but ultimately developed what she describes as a foundational sense of self-confidence. The next year, she interned at the United Nations in Bangkok, and she spent the summer following junior year interning at Google. And after her senior year, she covered technology and business at a newspaper in Uganda, writing about the transformative power of mobile phones. Cacioppo is a rare person who is curious about the wider world, confident enough to pursue big ideas about it and do the dogged research necessary to see those ideas through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Cacioppo says she both wanted to get out of Ohio, even though she loves her family, and wanted to be in Stanford University. There, she figured she could build on the advanced placement computer science classes she’d enjoyed in high school, or follow up on any number of things she was into. She switched her major “a zillion times,” she says, from French to political science to international relations to creative writing to economics to computer science and so on. She says this taught her that the key to success was her ability to research: “I could really pick anything and, with sufficient work, pick it up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pretty quickly, she started to feel like everyone at Stanford had been coding since they were 5. But there was something else, too. In the mid-2000s at Stanford, and in America broadly, the story of who became a founder was about one kind of person—a man who was a tech obsessive. The university’s list of alumni who’d founded tech companies was long, but almost exclusively male (and mostly white) at the time. So even though she’d started her first business as a kid, Cacioppo didn’t see herself as part of that culture. “As silly as it sounds, I used to think you need to be Mark Zuckerberg, and you need to have been coding since you were 6 years old,” she says. “You need to have gone into your room, and, in a Red Bull-fueled haze, made a thing that entranced thousands of people. And of course, you don’t. But that is where the lore is.”</p>



<p>After graduating with her master’s in 2009, Cacioppo started in 2010 at Union Square Ventures, a small venture capital firm in New York City. She also launched an informal business. She had a good, cool job and people would ask her how she got it, and if she knew of others. She started sending emails when she heard about openings at VCs and startups, then launched a newsletter, and later a website, charging people to list jobs. She remembers making about $30,000 in a year. “It was more successful … than all this other stuff I tried to do [later] that was much harder. There was probably some lesson in there for me,” she says with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Union Square, she met about 10 founders a week for 24 months, each a different kind of person, succeeding and working in different ways. She started to see that there wasn’t just one kind of founder. “I realized that I didn’t need the time machine. I didn’t need to go back to age 7. It wasn’t too late,” Cacioppo says. Inspired by this, she left to start on her path as a startup founder. It would not be a smooth one.</p>

<p>***</p>



<p>Cacioppo started to design a book website that she describes laughingly as “Goodreads, but better, but worse.” Then she and fellow Stanford alum Matt Spitz, operating as the startup Nebula Labs, experimented with an Android app called Hoot. She describes it as “Snapchat, but worse, and themed with owls.” But what was supposed to be a cute, fun month-long project snowballed into nine months of experimentation, until they realized they’d failed to solve a problem, or find a market. “I think both of us woke up, and we were like, ‘What are we doing with our lives? How does this happen?’” Cacioppo says. They decided to try to sell the app and Cacioppo started pitching Twitter, Dropbox and other potential buyers. At one such pitch that was clearly not landing a buyer, she says, “The person was like, ‘Would you like a job?’ I said, ‘Yes! Interviews please.’” Spitz joined Dropbox, and the two sold the app to a teenage entrepreneur in Tennessee for $20,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She could’ve gone with Spitz to Dropbox, but she says she didn’t want to give up on her dream of building something meaningful in the world just because her first ideas didn’t work out. So she started over, and built a coding education platform to help young people learn more quickly and easily than she had. Advertising her work on Craigslist, she tutored high school students in AP computer science classes. Halfway through the year, she left New York to move to San Francisco to be closer to peers, and kept tutoring, until she realized that even with referrals, there was not a big enough market. So she called Dropbox and asked for a job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2014, she joined as a product manager on a 10-person team building Dropbox Paper, a collaborative document-editing product. The team was composed half of people who’d worked at Hackpad, a web-based collaborative text-editing startup that Dropbox acquired the year before, and half legacy Dropbox team members. She says the team felt like they were the “cool kids in the corner,” working on something special. Two years later, when Paper got rolled into the main Dropbox product, she says it felt like a good time to take what she’d learned—how to speak up, how to lead a team, how to create a successful project and launch it—and take another run at launching her own company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>At Dropbox, the <a href="https://dropbox.tech/security/security-culture--the-dropbox-way">emphasis on security</a> had made an impression. It’s a place that’s renamed October as “Trustober,” a month dedicated to evangelizing security practices to employees. After she left, Cacioppo noticed a series of big news stories on the theme in 2016. First, the personal information of 57 million Uber customers and drivers was leaked. (Uber ultimately paid out a reported $148 million in 2018 to settle claims.) Then Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta’s email was hacked via a typical phishing scam. Then, in 2017, Equifax reported the data of nearly 150 million users had been breached.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She couldn’t stop thinking about why these security breaches happened to people with a lot of resources and support. “There was this curiosity of thinking, these are smart, motivated people. How did they mess that up?” says Cacioppo. She had an insight: there must be something especially difficult about online security for so many people and institutions to be making so many mistakes. “So you can either take the more pessimistic stance and think, ‘Well, they’re just incompetent at their jobs.’ Or the more generous one of, ‘This must be harder in a way that I don’t understand. What is that?’ That puzzle was just interesting to me, and it informed what Vanta ended up becoming.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Cacioppo was more than interested. She was confident she could research the issue, figure out what the problem was, and solve for it. That inclination to figure out how to help is something former coworker Devdatta Akhawe admires about Cacioppo. Now head of security at the web-based design tool Figma, Akhawe worked with Cacioppo at Dropbox in 2015. “Her drive, her empathy, her interest in solving real problems, her product mindset, all those things remind me of some of the best founders and founder-driven companies that I have seen or talked to,” he says.</p>



<p>So in 2017, Cacioppo and a former Dropbox colleague started investigating why people thought security was important but didn’t prioritize it. She interviewed startups and asked them about their best practices and how they handled security audits, which are evaluations of a system’s software, user practices and physical configuration, and how those things comply with regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We heard a lot of, ‘I get I should be doing things that I’m not [for my company’s security], and I kind of know what they are, but I’ve got to focus on building or selling my product, and if I don’t, I go out of business!” says Cacioppo. It wasn’t until she interviewed an engineer at Figma that Cacioppo encountered protocols that seemed substantial: laptop-management solutions, cloud infrastructure monitoring, quarterly pen tests, and more. When she asked why, she learned that Google mandated this rigor as a prerequisite for partnership. Cacioppo spotted a need for a tool that not only managed all of these protocols, but automated them. But she realized her idea wouldn’t just be useful to people who want to collaborate with Google. She could design a tool that helped all software companies with all kinds of compliance needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her early founder missteps, Cacioppo learned the importance of finding a big market. Now she’d found a huge one—essentially every software company, anywhere in the world. She also had a unique insight that would shape her company’s approach: Traditional security software companies try to scare customers into buying packages with threats of what could happen if data is hacked, but she realized it would be more effective to focus on the idea that strong security leads to strong growth: “Do the right thing and grow your business. It’s much more forward-looking and optimistic—going-toward rather than running-from.” Cacioppo saw a path forward, knowing once she spotted a market she could work backward to design the product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>In 2017, generally, the prevailing wisdom said every software company was different and needed unique security practices, so security audits relied on manual processes performed by consultants. Cacioppo disagreed, and started compiling every protocol she could find: issues with systems operations, internal and external communications, data storage and transactions. She researched relentlessly and learned what it took to verify compliance with security mandates like HIPAA and GDPR and near-countless others. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed remembers, “Data privacy and security is one of the things that is important and getting harder over time, as opposed to getting better over time. … And she decided she wanted to solve that thing as opposed to the number of other areas that are getting easier and easier over time.” Cacioppo started writing code that would automate these processes, a task she likens to locking up a house before leaving, “except there are thousands of doors, and they change, and it’s actually legitimately hard to remember to lock them all.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cacioppo and her co-founder quietly built out Vanta for a year and a half before hiring anyone. She remembers it as a difficult time, but one she knew was worth pushing through. “When you’re in that place of, ‘Hey, I quit my job and I’m starting a startup, but I haven’t hired anyone and I haven’t built anything, but I’m going to go tell people I started a startup …’ That just feels awful,” she says. Spitz (her partner in the owl-themed Snapchat clone) says Cacioppo is one of the most capable, resilient people he’s met. “Going through crushing defeat after crushing defeat week to week with the same person teaches you a lot about what it’s like to work with them.”</p>



<p>By the time they launched a public-facing website, in 2019, Vanta already had grown its customer base by word of mouth. Ari Shahdadi, now Vanta’s head of people, partnerships and legal, discovered the product as a customer when he was CFO/COO at a startup called Enigma and in need of SOC 2 certification. “We bought Vanta, and then also got hooked up with an external security consultant, and got the whole thing done in 30 days,” Shahdadi says. “So we went from having spent a year puttering around, spending a lot of money, not getting anything done, to now this magical piece of software gets installed.”&nbsp;Today, Vanta is used by more than 3,000 organizations in 45 countries, and Cacioppo is working toward a future in which “Vanta Verified” is a shorthand for a secure company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today Cacioppo is still fueled by what she describes as a “hard-edged” ambition, the same one that led her to three international internships while still in college. And she’s still driven by her college-major-switching insight—that if she can understand things deeply, if she can keep learning, she can create optimal outcomes—for her business, for her colleagues and partners, for everyone she serves. “I think by the time I started Vanta, it was a little bit of a trope in startups where founders, particularly founder-CEOs, have to learn all this stuff and the job changes all the time … I think I just embodied that, and was like, ‘Okay, well game on. Here we go.’”</p>

<p>I often hear people say that tools like mixers or using fresh addresses for every crypto transaction are sufficient privacy protections because they provide plausible deniability. This is a naive understanding of how surveillance works.</p>



 Military surveillance 



<p>In a previous life, I led a program to equip a country in the Middle East with surveillance capability. They were interested in tracking military movements of a nearby country that posed a threat. We built a rich dataset of “facilities and assets,” largely by ingesting satellite imagery, but also intelligence from drones and other sources. The imagery was processed, analyzed and augmented with third-party data sources, such as <a href="https://www.janes.com/">Jane’s</a>.</p>

<p>A signal snapshot of a facility at a given point in time revealed data. But, it was the changes in data that yielded the most meaningful information. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection">What aircraft is there</a>? Where did it come from or move to? What other types of supporting infrastructure is around? Has anything changed? Where is electricity being used in the buildings? Has that changed? Based on the data, and changes in that data, what might that country be intentionally or unintentionally signaling?</p>



 Commercial digital surveillance 



<p></p>



<p>Later, a coworker from the intel project and I used some of the same techniques to surveile the internet, first for targeted marketing campaigns, and then in an effort to help companies connect with freelance workers. We were able to combine data from over two dozen sources to create rich profiles of people. It was fairly trivial to obtain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a>. But it was the aggregation of data over time that yielded the richest insights.</p>



<p>For example, you can infer how much money someone makes based on their job history and location. You can infer someone’s travel and spending habits by the pictures they post online, which contain both metadata (e.g., date, location) and also what’s in the photo, just as we could determine what type of plane was at a given airbase. Using clues from language and cross links, it was often the case that we could find pseudo-anonymous accounts of known profiles. What we were able to discover was troubling, and we shut down the program.</p>



<p>This is happening around the world, both commercially, as we were doing, and in countries like <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/how-china-harnesses-data-fusion-to-make-sense-of-surveillance-data/">China</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_center">US</a>.</p>



 Shield your assets 



<p>Mixers provide some level of <a href="https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1502083108081963009?s=20&amp;t=GcOkAw3WIF14a-GNZsSriw">probabilistic privacy</a>. But that probabilistic information is extremely useful to surveillers, especially as the tapestry is woven over time. If a surveiller can create probabilistic models, it is enough to build incredibly rich profiles in order to predict, influence, or manipulate future behavior by testing and gauging responses.</p>



<p>The best means to protect yourself from this type of privacy intrusion is to reduce leakages. This makes it more difficult to create a complete picture. For example, it was more challenging to build rich profiles on civil engineers than programmers, simply because civil engineers tended to post less things online.</p>



<p>Reducing leakage includes limiting your use of public blockchains, where your financial dealings are stored in a public database, for everyone to see, for all time — and where it can be correlated with your other online behaviors. Tools like mixers may help obscure a particular transaction, but surveillance technology is rapidly getting more sophisticated, and it’s increasingly easier to probabilistically determine the counter parties of a single mixed transaction and to build profiles based on the aggregation of these probabilities over time. The best option in crypto to minimize data leakage is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpRzKqEfpP4">store your wealth in a shielded address</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no such thing as perfect privacy. But you can take steps to protect your current and future self from the prying eyes of others who may wish you harm.</p>

<blockquote>“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us…” — Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two&nbsp;Cities</blockquote><blockquote>“We are as gods and better get good at it,” — Stewart Brand (updated)</blockquote><p>As we wrote in our <a href="https://medium.com/@blueyard/an-evolution-blueyards-v2-thesis-a-new-website-gm-new-york-84080f7b191d">v2 thesis</a>, humanity is very likely in its most important century ever: i.e. this might very well be our best century ever, or quite possibly our last century. Through technology, we increasingly will have the potential to become a resilient super species that further contributes to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xaj407ofjNE">cosmos knowing itself</a>, to create abundance for all, to move up on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale">Kardashev scale</a> — while doing so in harmony with our&nbsp;planet.</p><p>However, potential only implies “having or showing the capacity to develop into something in the future” — and by no means should we take our technological and societal advances for certain. In fact, recent events have reminded us that great darkness exists within humanity. But darkness also provides contrast, and contrast helps to see things more clearly. So we now more clearly see our v2 thesis and mission as a firm within the backdrop of having to ensure that liberal and open societies remain well ahead in terms of any thinkable technological advances before any other competing societal / governance system acquires them. We believe&nbsp;that:</p>  Capitalism paired with democracy is the best system bar none; while appreciating that capitalism has significant market failures and mis-priced externalities (see point on climate below), while democracies are increasingly vulnerable and under attack from&nbsp;within  We should be able to have an optimistic outlook on a growing humanity that has more energy at its disposal to advance civilization and the human experience; while acknowledging that on its current trajectory humanity might peak within the next decades and then potentially begin a phase of steady decline — magnified by our current creation and consumption patterns that will only further advance civilizational decline due to climate breakdown  In order to live up to our cosmic level responsibility to help the universe understand itself, we should aim to upgrade humanity’s resilience and longevity by using new capabilities to author life to understand, augment, and engineer our biology to a new level; while understanding that unless we unlock evolution’s algorithms more rapidly we will remain woefully unprepared, e.g. for the next pandemic, to defeat cancer as the emperor of all maladies and to remove chemicals from the environment that are increasingly disrupting the body’s core&nbsp;systems  We have to increase humanity’s computational capacity at an increasingly exponential pace to help us build and scale all of the technologies required for a thriving species that can live in harmony with the planet; appreciating that it will be a struggle to stay on the Moore’s Law&nbsp;curve  We must understand that climate breakdown is not only about the planet or nature, it is very much about the survival of the human species itself; while acknowledging that too few people understand that resource and nutritional volatility will lead to unimaginable global scalable conflicts. Markets, wealth and growth are irrelevant in a future with no humans (having squandered our rare cosmic scale potential)  Diversity and inclusion are not just a matter of fairness, but also about the ability to harness the full potential of humanity; while appreciating that much of humanity’s potential lies systematically idle as of&nbsp;today  <p>It is within this context that we are today announcing that we have raised BlueYard 3, a $185m early stage fund (bringing our AuM to $500m). We have increased our fund size slightly from BY1/2 ($120m each), but remain committed to small early stage funds — however had to factor in that market dynamics require slightly more capital to continue our early lead investor strategy.</p><p>BlueYard has made 17 investments (e.g. from zK-SNARK hardware acceleration, RNA to protein manipulation, to programmable chemistry) over the last twelve months across <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/blueyard-2-3d0bbaf1f1b6">BlueYard 2</a> and <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/blueyard-crypto-1-c0af4636bd24">BlueYard Crypto 1</a> and will continue to be active through economic cycles with BlueYard 3 along our v2&nbsp;thesis:</p><p>“BlueYard backs founders building the interconnected elements that can become the fabric of our future. A future where markets are open and decentralized, where we have solved our largest planetary challenges, where knowledge and data is liberated and humanity can live long and prosper.”</p><p>while allowing us to keep focusing on the technologies we think will have the highest impact as fabric layers for a positive future for humanity:</p> Web3: to create “open by default” and resilient infrastructure for free markets and self sovereignty   <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> (next generation internet protocols)  <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> (distributed web protocol)  <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> (safe and resilient storage network for humanity)  <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a> / <a href="https://forta.org/">Forta</a> (security for decentralized applications)  <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle</a> (decentralized backbone for the world’s code&nbsp;base)  <a href="https://www.textile.io/">Textile</a> (interconnected tools for the decentralized web)  <a href="https://www.airtm.com/en/">AirTM</a> (p2p financial liberty platform)  <a href="https://centrifuge.io/">Centrifuge</a> (real world assets to&nbsp;DeFi)  <a href="https://violet.co/">Violet</a> (layer 2 for identity)  [Stealth] (mitigating negative externalities of&nbsp;MEV)  <a href="https://housecat.com/">Housecat</a> (broadening access to crypto and DeFI investing)  <a href="https://github.com/flashbots/pm">Massa</a> (L1 for both decentralization and scalability)  <a href="https://www.kiln.fi/">Kiln</a> (formerly Skillz) (staking as a&nbsp;service)  <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a> (user data and privacy layer for&nbsp;web3)  [Stealth] (zK-SNARK hardware acceleration)  <a href="https://cryptio.co/">Cryptio</a> (crypto accounting)  <a href="https://syndicate.io/">Syndicate</a> (A decentralized investing protocol and social&nbsp;network)  <a href="https://metapals.pet/">MetaPals</a> (Making web3 more fun and accessible)  <a href="https://dxos.org/">DXOS</a> (Decentralized application development and deployment platform)   Programmable biology: to enhance human resilience and mitigate planetary challenges   <a href="http://www.bit.bio/">Bit Bio</a> (programmable stem-cells)  <a href="https://www.meatable.com/">Meatable</a> (animal free&nbsp;economy)  <a href="https://www.positive.co/">Positive</a> (next-gen convenience food)  <a href="https://biofidelity.com/">Biofidelity</a> (accurate and affordable cancer diagnostics)  <a href="https://www.rarebase.org/">Rarebase</a> (rare disease therapy breakthroughs)  <a href="https://origin.bio/">Origin.bio</a> (bio based goods and materials)  Clock Bio (novel anti-aging therapeutics)  <a href="https://www.zafrens.com/">Zafrens</a> (manipulating how RNA become proteins)  [Stealth] (reinventing transgenes)   Breakthrough computation and engineering: to stay on (or exceed) Moore’s Law curve and to equip us with the tools and resources to support a growing&nbsp;humanity   <a href="https://seeqc.com/">SEEQC</a> (digital quantum computing )  <a href="https://marvelfusion.com/https://marvelfusion.com/">Marvel Fusion</a> (laser-induced fusion)  <a href="https://dance.co/https://dance.co/">Dance </a>(e-bike based clean urban transportation)  <a href="https://vsparticle.com/">VSParticle</a> (nanoparticles R&amp;D+&nbsp;scaling)  <a href="https://www.corintis.com/">Corintis</a> (enabler for high performance computing)  <a href="https://freedomfi.com/">FreedomFi</a> (personalized 5G network operator)  <a href="https://spaero.bio/">Spaero </a>(enabling scientists to quickly automate experiments)  <a href="https://www.chemify.io/">Chemify</a> (programmable chemistry)  [Stealth] (distributed electronic defense)   Knowledge and data liberators: because information wants to be&nbsp;free   <a href="https://pitch.com/">Pitch</a> (platform for creating and sharing&nbsp;ideas)  <a href="https://autocode.com/">Autocode</a> (low code platform)  <a href="https://www.nextmatter.com">Next Matter</a> (all-in-one platform for operators)  <a href="https://grid.is/">GRID</a> (new spreadsheet layer)  <a href="https://www.vectary.com/">Vectary</a> (VR/AR 3D design platform)  <a href="https://www.wonder.me/">Wonder</a> (where large groups meet&nbsp;online)  <a href="https://golottie.com/">Lottie</a> (reimagining a child’s first digital&nbsp;steps)  <p>And if this all sounds interesting to you, why not <a href="https://www.notion.so/blueyardcapital/BlueYard-Job-Board-d25e5dcbcfe448f19da666d94b5ddd97">join our&nbsp;team</a>?</p>

 The partnership will work towards making it easy for everyone to interact with the blockchain — self-custodially and without seed&nbsp;phrase <p>Web3Auth and StarkWare Sign-in a Strategic Partnership</p><p>Web3Auth and StakWare enter into a Strategic Partnership that will provide a major push to our shared vision of onboarding the next billion users into Web3. The genesis of StarkWare lies in improving scalability and privacy on the blockchain so as to accommodate more and more users. Web3Auth’s origins lie in the fact that seed phrases create a huge entry barrier in onboarding mainstream users into blockchain applications. Given their strikingly similar genesis, it is only natural that both ecosystem stakeholders joined forces to increase mainstream adoption of&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>What does the partnership entail?</p><p>Uri Kolodny, CEO &amp; Co-Founder, StarkWare:</p><p>“Our teams share the mutual goal of bringing web3 closer to mainstream users. With Web3Auth providing easy login and onboarding of users, and with StarkWare providing low gas costs and security, this partnership is a natural and important step in achieving this&nbsp;goal.”</p><p>StarkWare Offers Grant to&nbsp;Web3Auth</p><p>In a major endorsement for Web3Auth’s mission, StarkWare has offered Web3Auth a grant to ensure its self-custodial private key infrastructure powers as many dApps and wallets in the Web3 eco-system as possible. How we onboard users and handle their private keys in the next few years will largely determine the pace at which the Web3 eco-system will grow. The grant will be used by Web3Auth to to make its authentication suite available and accessible to as many developers as possible and by doing so, to more and more applications and&nbsp;users.</p><p>Web3Auth Announces Sign-in With StarkWare</p><p>Also as part of the partnership, last week, Web3Auth and StarkWare <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/sign-in-with-starkware-711d48f2dbbd">announced Sign-in With StarkWare</a>, a unique initiative that brings in the security of StarkWare to Web2 allowing users to sign-in to any Web3 application using their StarkWare account.</p><p>Quote from Zhen, CEO &amp; Co-founder, Web3Auth:</p><p>“Our partnership with StarkWare is a natural evolution of both our organizations’ genesis — to make blockchain more accessible to the masses.

<p>Brave’s native crypto wallet now features integrations from ApeSwap, Arken, Bogged, DODO, Open Ocean, and Skiff</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>The introduction of the multichain <a>Brave Wallet</a> in the Brave browser enables Brave’s 60 million monthly active users to easily onboard to Web3, the decentralized iteration of the Internet that will shift power from Big Tech to users. No other platform combines Brave’s privacy and security protections with such easy, user-first opportunities to directly connect with Web3 decentralized applications (DApps).</p>
<p>When Brave Wallet users have their wallets active, the Brave browser automatically detects Web3 DApps. However, many users benefit from the inclusion of the Brave Wallet as an option among those enumerated to DApp users, including users who have yet to discover Brave Wallet or are navigating the Web in Brave with their wallet still in a locked state.</p>
<p>To address this, we’ve created the Brave Wallet Partner Program. The pilot phase of the program involves outreach to the top DApps in decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835">DeFi</a>), exchanges, marketplaces, private email and collaboration, and gaming for networks supported in the multichain Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>The program aims to drive awareness about Brave Wallet, while providing an opportunity to discuss ways that Brave and partners can collaborate on additional BAT utility programs or integrations. Partners in the program integrate Brave Wallet into their wallet connection list, and co-promote their DApp integration with Brave through marketing channels in Brave, blog posts, communities, and social media.</p>
<p>The DApps that were first to integrate the Brave Wallet in the pilot program range from DeFi to Web3 utility, across networks currently supported by the multichain Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Collectively, the first set of partner DApps for the Brave Wallet Partner Program have over 646,810 90-day unique wallets and over $3,663,404,340 total 90-day volume across over 10 blockchain networks.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to announce the first partners that have integrated Brave Wallet into their DApps through the program, as more and more users are looking to easily access DApps and take advantage of Web3 technology to be in charge of their data,” said Luke Mulks, Vice President of Business Operations at Brave. “We’re looking forward to sharing updates about more partners added through the program, as well as announcements about partners on BAT utility collaborations in the months ahead.”</p>
<p>ApeSwap</p>
<p><a href="https://apeswap.finance/">ApeSwap</a> is a decentralized finance platform offering a full suite of tools to explore and engage with the future of wealth building, overseen by the ApeSwap Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The community and partners can tap into the next generation of financial innovation through their decentralized exchange, utility token staking, premium launchpad, lending network, and NFT marketplace in a secure, transparent, and globally accessible way.</p>
<p>“Integrating Brave Wallet into the ApeSwap protocol is a natural partnership. We share the mission of giving our audiences the freedom to explore and innovate on their terms, without interference from other parties. Moreover, ApeSwap consistently holds the deepest liquidity for BAT on the BNB Chain, giving Brave Wallet users the most DeFi options to earn through staking, farming, or lending on one of the most secure platforms on the market,” said DK, Co-Founder and Head of Business Development at ApeSwap.</p>
<p>Arken Finance</p>
<p><a href="https://arken.finance/">Arken Finance</a> is an all-in-one trading portal for DeFi traders. It offers the best-in-class, multi-chain tool for DEX traders to track thousands of tokens and synthetic assets within a single point of entry. Users can get access to real-time trading views, and best rate swaps with complimentary trading features such as Limit Orders, Price Alerts, and Best Rate Cross-chain Swaps.</p>
<p>“Adding Brave Wallet to Arken Finance is just the beginning. Partnering with Brave is a big move for us in achieving our team’s mission: to support the mass adoption of DeFi and make the user experience more accessible for everyone. We really hope that, along with the Brave team, we will create stronger decentralized finance applications for the world,” said Por, Head of Business Development at Arken Finance.</p>
<p>Bogged</p>
<p><a href="https://bogged.finance/">Bogged</a> is a suite of powerful DeFi trading tools, including DEX aggregator, limit orders, stop-losses, and more. Bogged is trusted with over $2 billion of trading volume and is available on ten chains.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to give Brave users the chance to experience Bogged’s extensive platform, which includes a variety of tools designed to help you trade like a pro.</p>
<p>Traders can now use Brave to access Bogged’s market-leading DeFi trading tools directly. Thanks to our full integration, you may now place orders, make trades, and more, all within the Brave platform at lightning speeds,” said Luke Martinez, Co-Founder at Bogged.</p>
<p>DODO</p>
<p><a href="https://dodoex.io/">DODO</a> is a decentralized multi-chain trading platform that uses the innovative Proactive Market Maker (PMM) algorithm to provide efficient on-chain liquidity for Web3 assets, making it easy for everyone to trade crypto assets.</p>
<p>“DODO has a strong commitment to providing open financial access to everyone. Integrating Brave Wallet with the DODO DApp brings us closer to this goal and provides our users with more options than ever before,” said Diane Dai, CMO at DODO.</p>
<p>OpenOcean</p>
<p><a href="https://openocean.finance/">OpenOcean</a> is crypto’s most efficient DEX aggregator, providing users the best swap rates on all major blockchains with deep liquidity and low slippage.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to integrate Brave Wallet as one of our top wallet options for our users to use. Our partnership will bring our users a seamless and efficient experience in trading and earning crypto across multi-chain,” said Cindy Wu, Co-Founder at OpenOcean.</p>
<p>Skiff</p>
<p><a href="https://skiff.com/">Skiff</a>’s integration with Brave Wallet allows users to access privacy-first, end-to-end encrypted email and collaboration. With only two clicks, all Brave Wallet users can seamlessly log into Skiff’s privacy-first application suite and start using end-to-end encrypted email and collaboration. The integration allows for email and collaboration among Brave wallets as well, one of the first uses of a crypto wallet for end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>“Bringing privacy-first collaboration and communication to all Brave users aligns deeply with Skiff’s and Brave’s mission. We’re thrilled to work with the Brave Wallet team to empower freer and more private communication and collaboration,” explained Andrew Milich, CEO and Co-Founder of Skiff.</p>
<p>For the current pilot phase of the Brave Wallet Partner Program, Brave is approaching leading DApps in each vertical that meet a minimum criteria of 90-day volume and unique wallet counts (on-chain). We also aim to adapt the pilot program to a public-facing program later this year so that additional DApps can submit requests to participate.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you’re a developer interested in simply integrating Brave Wallet into your DApp, we provide <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">detailed developer documentation here</a>.</p>
<p>About Brave Wallet</p>
<p>Brave Wallet is a crypto wallet built natively into the Brave browser, enabling Brave users to store, manage, grow, and swap their crypto portfolio from a single wallet. Unlike most crypto wallets, Brave Wallet does not require extensions; it’s browser-native, reducing security risks and reliance on extra CPU and memory. Users can transact with almost any crypto asset with superior safety and performance, as well as connect with other wallets and Web3 DApps. Brave Wallet is available on desktop and mobile.</p>

Yet accurately tracking transactions, asset values at a specific time, profitability of trades, gas fees, etc. is still hard — and it is even harder to combine this data into an enterprise grade audit environment.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://cryptio.co/">Cryptio</a>, which tracks crypto assets and transactions from DeFi protocols, wallets, exchanges, and institutional custodians to construct a complete picture of a company’s digital asset activity.

<p>Recently, the Nano (XNO) cryptocurrency recovered, at least temporarily, from a nearly six week long denial of service (DoS) attack. According to a Nano Foundation blog post, the attack exploited five different attack vectors. Although varied, these attack vectors have the net effect of exhausting resources on Nano validator nodes.&nbsp;…</p><p>While the Nano developers issued a patch that helped clear backlogged transactions, much of the recovery from this recent attack can be attributed to a reprieve from the attack itself. Indeed, as of writing this post, a new attack on Nano is underway, temporarily crippling the Nano&nbsp;network.</p><p>In today’s blog post, I describe differences between the Stealth and Nano protocols, and how these differences result in Stealth’s having far better DoS resistance than Nano. These differences distill to the prohibitive difficulty of exhausting Stealth’s resources by spamming the blockchain. In this description, I underscore that one key to Stealth’s superior DoS resistance is Stealth’s novel network timekeeping mechanism.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> Nano <p>Nano is arguably the leading cryptocurrency for feeless transactions. A feeless transaction does not require the sender or recipient to provide any extra money as transaction fees. Instead of a fee, a user includes a digital attachment with each transaction. This attachment of only a few bytes cryptographically proves that the user did a small amount of computational work specific to the transaction. This “work proof”, allows the transaction to be executed without any additional monetary fee. In other words, if a user sends 1 XNO, then the recipient receives exactly 1 XNO and the sender’s account is exactly 1 XNO&nbsp;smaller.</p><p>The Nano protocol has many unique features. Most notably, Nano has a block lattice wherein each account has its own blockchain. Each blockchain records all incoming and outgoing transfers for that account. The lattice structure arises from so-called receiving transactions, where the recipient makes a separate record keeping transaction that references the incoming transaction. The receiving transaction is a prerequisite for spending&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Importantly, only the account holder can modify the account’s balance. With spending transactions, the account holder specifies how much to reduce the account balance. With receiving transactions, the account holder specifies how much to increase the account&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Although the two-part transaction may seem unnecessary to those unfamiliar with Nano’s design, it is critical for Nano’s high throughput because it allows validators to approve transactions asynchronously. The reason is that validators are never required to consider the ordering of transactions when determining whether an account balance can be spent. The account holder specifies the ordering of credits and debits, making it straightforward for validators to calculate an account balance prior to approving any transaction.</p><p>The following figure shows a small block lattice as might be found within Nano’s distributed ledger. Pictured are three chains for three accounts: A, B, and C. Each chain has four transactions (diamonds), numbered 1 through 4. Transaction 1 in chain A is called “A-1”, and so on. Each transaction references up to two other transactions. The first reference points to the immediately preceding transaction in the account’s chain. These types of references are represented by solid arrows. The second type of reference connects a receiving transaction to a spending transaction. These latter types of references are represented by dashed&nbsp;arrows.</p><p>The flow of money can be inferred from the dashed arrows. For example, account C sent account B money in transaction C-4. The transfer amount of transaction C-4 was credited to account B’s balance in transaction B-3, so an arrow connects B-3 to&nbsp;C-4.</p><p>Note that all arrows point backwards in time. In this latter example, transaction C-4 preceded transaction B-3 in time. This elaborate cross-linking of account blockchains results in a multidimensional lattice, giving the Nano ledger its&nbsp;name.</p><p>While time relationships between explicitly linked transactions may be inferred from these references, a full ordering of Nano transactions can not be guaranteed. For example, it is impossible to know whether transactions B-3 and B-4 preceded any transaction in chain A because no path of arrows (moving from tail to head) connect B-3 and B-4 with any transaction of chain&nbsp;A.</p><p>A profound consequence of the structure of Nano’s ledger is that Nano has no mechanism for timekeeping. For example, transactions B-3 and B-4 could be separated by one millisecond, or they could be separated by one million years. We can only know, in some cases, a relative ordering by following references, as described above for transactions C-4 and B-3. That Nano transactions don’t have timestamps underscores this absence of timekeeping.</p><p>Because Nano has no mechanism for timekeeping, the ages of Nano transactions are impossible to determine with certainty. For transactions that have been approved by validators, the lack of timestamps amounts to little more than an accounting inconvenience. However, for transactions that have yet to be approved, the lack of timekeeping can pose serious problems because validators and other network participants have no temporal information with which to expire transactions.</p><p>At first thought, the ability to expire transactions might not seem important. However, the crippling DoS attacks suffered periodically by Nano could be rendered orders of magnitude more difficult if “backlogged” transactions expired and were completely cleared from the Nano&nbsp;network.</p><p>Consider the following backlog estimate, generated recently within the Nano Discord&nbsp;chat.</p><p>This output shows that over one million Nano transactions are backlogged. A result of the ongoing spam attack, the vast majority of these transactions are generated by the attacker. As transactions build up, the strain on computing resources makes it increasingly difficult for validators to approve (clear) new transactions, creating a vicious cycle of resource depletion.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> Stealth <p>Imagine if unapproved Nano transactions expired after only two minutes. To maintain a crippling backlog of one million transactions, the Nano attacker would be required to create 500,000 transactions per minute, or 8,333 transactions per second (tps). Imagine further that Nano were redesigned such that it required a backlog of not one million transactions to cripple Nano, but around ten&nbsp;million.</p><p>Now, imagine further that Nano used a hashing algorithm wherein each transaction requires, on average, one second on one 3 GHZ CPU. Now imagine that when saturated with feeless transactions, the Nano network required on average about nine times the work for a single transaction. Translated to GPU computing power, about $7000 of GPU hardware could average about 9 tps. So it would require $63,000,000 of GPU hardware running at full capacity to saturate the Nano network with 5 million transactions per minute and create an ongoing backlog of ten million transactions, given this unimaginably effective design.</p><p>Not only would the attacker need $63,000,000 of hardware dedicated to this task, he’d have to pay the exorbitant electricity bills to keep it running all the time. Worse yet, if this nefarious mining setup ever went down, the entire backlog would expire after just two minutes. Even the “stuck” transactions of legitimate users would expire after two minutes, meaning Nano users would never experience the frustration of waiting hours or days for a transaction to&nbsp;process.</p><p>All that hardware and all those electricity bills would produce nothing but a temporary inconvenience for Nano users, completely remedied after two minutes of cessation. Clearly it would be foolish to attempt to attack Nano with spam, all because transactions can&nbsp;expire.</p><p>Even if an attacker mustered the bankroll to execute an effective attack, the notoriety of the expense itself would likely bring more positive attention to Nano, more than offsetting the potential negative attention that inspired the attack in the first place. Imagine the headlines: “Who is spending $400,000 per day to spam the Nano network?”</p><p>In case you are thinking that such a system is too good to be true<br>– I just described Stealth’s approach to fighting&nbsp;spam.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> Stealth’s Distributed Network&nbsp;Clock <p>At the core of Stealth’s spam fighting technology is a novel and unique distributed network clock. I have discussed Stealth’s timekeeping <a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend/stealth-development-blog-017-04-12-2019-894a2e9f5c30">elsewhere</a>, but in short, it obviates the need for network-wide time averaging, depicted in the following image.</p><p>In the above image illustrating network time averaging, the network time is 00:00:02 while the real time is 00:00:00, as reported by an official timekeeper like NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). Each computer that joins the network queries the network time from its peers, then applies an offset to its own internal clock. For example, computer A has an offset of +1, while computer B has an offset of -1. If a block is produced (right), it carries a timestamp reflecting the network&nbsp;time.</p><p>Note that in this type of network timekeeping, no computer has any incentive to keep the correct time. In fact, keeping network time relies purely on altruism.</p><p>As a result, this type of network clock is highly fragile and can therefore result in fragile networks. The main reason is that this type of network clock is subject to clock drift. In the above example, the hypothetical network has drifted two seconds from the real time. In practice, cryptocurrency network clocks can drift by many minutes. For example, Solana’s network clock is currently <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/149112/solanas-blockchain-clock-loses-track-of-time-now-running-30-minutes-behind">30 minutes behind</a> real time. Barring a hard fork intervention, this clock drift will likely never be&nbsp;fixed.</p><p>Another problem with time averaged network clocks is that malicious computers can join the network and report the wrong time, starting a chain reaction of unsynchronized offsets. For cryptocurrencies, this has resulted in forks that arise because some subset of computers invalidate blocks with inappropriate timestamps. An example is a block that may have a timestamp in the future relative to the network time of some subset of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Instead of a time averaged network clock, Stealth uses a distributed network clock. In Stealth’s clock, computers never query the network time. Instead, they get network time from block timestamps. Blocks carry timestamps given to them by the computer that produced the block. Blocks are rejected or accepted independently by every computer on the network, based on comparison not to the computer’s internal clock, but to other blocks known to the computer.</p><p>In this system, block producers are incentivized to correctly guess the internal times of all other block producers without ever asking. If block producers guess incorrectly, they run the risk of having their blocks rejected.</p><p>This system distills to focal point game theory, where the best guess for the internal clocks of other computers is a known standard, like NIST time. In other words, no block producer is required to keep good time, but keeping good time maximizes their opportunity for block rewards. The bottom line is that the network doesn’t have clock synchronization, but it still has an emergent accurate and distributed network clock. This network clock is embodied by the chain of blocks produced by the&nbsp;network.</p><p>A critical feature of Stealth’s network clock is a robustness that arises from the fact that clock ticks are concrete events — namely blocks themselves. This design means that no amount of poor timekeeping by individual nodes, or spikes in network latency, ever influences network time. Moreover, the Stealth network never experiences drift because there is an ongoing incentive for block producers to keep good time, making best effort internal adjustments as needed. In practice, the absence of an offset, and the influence of game theory, means that block times will never deviate from real time by more than the network&nbsp;latency.</p><p>This robustness gives a dependable standard for the expiration of transactions. In Stealth’s feeless protocol, feeless transactions must reference a specific block, and therefore a specific time. This reference is one input for the work required to create the feeless transaction. A computer on the network will invalidate all transactions older than two minutes, by comparing the network time to the block timestamp referenced by the transaction. Invalidation means that the transaction is erased from memory and no longer communicated to any new&nbsp;peers.</p><p>A consequence of expiration is that the work required to create the transaction is also expired. To create a new transaction, a sender must create new work. This overwhelming burden of work results in considerable ongoing expense to aspiring attackers.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> Stealth User Experience Under&nbsp;DoS <p>One question is whether users would be inconvenienced if an attacker attempted to spam the Stealth network. The answer is slightly.</p><p>First, users would be required to compete with the spammer for blockchain space. Users can do this in two ways. One way is simply by increasing the difficulty of their work calculations, waiting on average about ten seconds for the work calculation instead of one second. Another way is by paying a fee to ensure a spot in the blockchain. Currently the fee is equivalent to about 0.0001&nbsp;USD.</p><p>While a fee seems to forego the advantages of feeless transactions, this inexpensive work-around removes practically any reason to spam the Stealth network in the first place. In this way, the fee is a nuclear deterrent. It renders conventional warfare (spam DoS) obsolete, impotent, and certainly not worth the&nbsp;expense.</p><p>Second, users that do not produce enough work to compete with the sender will have transactions “stuck” in the mempool. Again, this inconvenience is mild and temporary. After two minutes, these stuck transactions will expire, even during an ongoing spam attack. Once expired, the user will be able to resubmit a transaction, either with more work or with the aforementioned small&nbsp;fee.</p><p>In summary, an attacker could attempt a DoS spam attack on Stealth. It would cost a fortune in equipment (millions of dollars) and another fortune in energy costs (tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a day). It would likely bring much positive press to Stealth as well. A successful attack would mean that users would have to wait two minutes for stuck transactions, and likely need to pay a $0.0001 fee to create a successful transaction after their transactions became unstuck via expiration. Once an attacker gave up, the network would require no more than two minutes to completely recover from the&nbsp;attack.</p><p>— — — — — — — — —</p><p>Dr. James Stroud,&nbsp;PhD</p><p>— — — — — — — — —</p><p><a href="https://stealth.org/">Website</a> / <a href="http://discord.gg/qGwMQQeRPm">Discord</a> / <a href="https://t.me/stealthsend">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend">Medium</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/stealthsend">Twitter</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthsend">Reddit</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend/stealths-network-clock-in-feeless-transactions-and-spam-resistance-ccecc3e6084e">Stealth’s Network Clock in Feeless Transactions and Spam Resistance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend">stealthsend</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Zcash’s Network Upgrade 5 was announced a few days ago. It includes a number of technical improvements to the protocol and is a massive step forward for our society and pursuit of economic freedom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The upgrades are technical in nature, but they have major implications for everyday users and their financial transactions. So, what does NU5 mean for all of us?</p>



<p>To truly appreciate its significance, we first need to understand our dependence on financial intermediaries.</p>



 The dependent financial system 



<p>The tech behind modern banking and financial services has made things infinitely more user-friendly. But as these services are made easier, corporations, governments, and other intermediaries gain access to our data. They often leverage this to surveil, censor, and at times, prohibit our means to transact.</p>



<p>We have to trust that these financial systems won’t shut down. We expect that banks and apps are always going to work. We rely on their infrastructure and, at times, doubt that potential single points of failure will ever be exploited.</p>



<p>We also hope that the controllers of these systems will never censor or block our ability to use, or access, our money.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies provide monetary systems that allow us to transact and store value without permission from centralized intermediaries. These systems of money are distributed, cannot be turned off by any single party, and to be completely censorship resistant, they don’t rely on any one person or group. In most situations, we shouldn’t view trust as a negative thing. However, trustlessness is vital for people to have maximum economic freedom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin is often seen as the pinnacle of decentralization, trustlessness, and censorship-resistant money. However, there have been instances where Bitcoin has fallen short of this goal, due to one major flaw.</p>



 Bitcoin’s failure 



<p>Bitcoin’s transparent blockchain gives governments and corporations an ability to surveil transactions and ultimately blacklist addresses (people) they don’t agree with.</p>



<p>When addresses are blacklisted, the owner (and likely any address associated with the address in the public ledger) cannot access services that make Bitcoin usable for most people. Think CashApp, exchanges, and Bitcoin ATMs.</p>



<p>In extreme cases, bad actors can even track down Bitcoin users, arrest them, and force them to give up their private keys. Users have physically seen their Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-protect-5-dollar-wrench-attack/">stolen by criminal groups</a>, or <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmnpd/the-freedom-convoy-bitcoin-donations-have-been-frozen-and-seized">frozen and seized by governments</a>.</p>



<p>This failure has sparked many conversations around cryptocurrencies being incapable of being politically neutral money.</p>



Satoshi thought on the importance of a private Bitcoin implementation<br>



<p>When situations like this occur, many say that the victims should have used Zcash. And while that is a valid suggestion, Zcash has had its skeptics due to its origin involving a complex setup ceremony.</p>



<p>When Zcash implemented the first use case of zk-SNARKs, the cryptography that enables truly private crypto transactions, it required a <a href="https://z.cash/technology/paramgen/">parameter generation process</a> to launch the currency. People have called this a “trusted setup” because users of the protocol would have to trust at least one of the six participants to act in good faith.</p>



<p>The ceremony was very well <a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony">documented</a>, and for almost everyone in the industry, there’s no legitimate reason to distrust it. If even one of the six participants in that ceremony was honest, the money supply would remain sound. A major upgrade of Zcash in 2018 required a new, even more secure ceremony involving hundreds of participants.</p>



<p>Further technical explainer: For any future counterfeiting of ZEC to occur, every ceremony participant would have to be a bad actor, and even in that case, the protocol’s privacy would remain uncompromised. We know no counterfeiting has ever taken place because we would be able to identify this in the liquidity pool.</p>



<p>But the reliance on a certain amount of “trust” has, in some people’s minds, prevented Zcash from reaching its goal as a truly decentralized, politically neutral money. This issue isn’t specific to Zcash. Every implementation of zk-SNARKs has required a setup ceremony.</p>



 No more tradeoffs 



<p>Halo’s zero-knowledge proving system, implemented in Zcash NU5, solved zk-SNARKs’ setup ceremony problem. The newly created Orchard payment protocol became the first payment network created without a so-called trusted setup.</p>



<p>This means when someone uses applications that support Orchard, they don’t have to put their reliance, or trust, in any one person or group. They can be confident that the system is completely censorship-resistant, will always allow them to transact, and the currency’s supply will never be altered.</p>



<p>This means users get truly private, fixed-supply, censorship-resistant money.</p>



<p>Zcash’s privacy has made it the best way to avoid financial censorship, and now the Orchard pool enables a unique system where users don’t have to choose between reliance on a group of people and privacy.</p>



 The future of peer-to-peer money 



<p>As mentioned in a <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash/">previous blog</a>, “the efficiencies built into this upgrade make possible — for the first time ever — private, trustless digital cash payments on mobile phones.”</p>



<p>This creates a digital peer-to-peer money that gives users ultimate confidence and sovereignty over their money. This level of ownership moves humanity closer to economic freedom and equality.</p>



<p>While we can get lost in the technical side of NU5, we mustn’t discount the impact it has on the future of our financial world. Its impact will be solidified as teams develop applications that deliver ZEC user experiences that rival modern, digital banking.</p>



<p>The future state of Zcash has yet to be fulfilled, but the NU5 announcement lays the foundation on which the future of money will be built. A future of money that is digital, private and not reliant on any person or group.</p>

<p>As Brave continues to grow, we find many users who haven’t heard of us yet, so we try new marketing channels for efficacy, reach, affordability, and of course, privacy.</p>
<p>Since 2020, Brave has been experimenting with direct mail via the United States Postal Service’s <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/every-door-direct-mail.htm">Every Door Direct Mail</a> (EDDM) program. EDDM allows businesses in the US to create and distribute mailers to addresses across one or more ZIP Codes. Direct mail allows Brave to reach more people across the country, including in regions where alternative marketing options—such as digital advertising—may be less effective.</p>
<p>EDDM is attractive to Brave because the process and system never expose any private, or otherwise sensitive, information regarding potential recipients. Further details about this effort and process were shared a few months ago in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/brave_browser/comments/t4gzuw/update_on_braves_ongoing_direct_mail_marketing/">a transparency post on Reddit</a>. To ensure privacy, also to avoid confusion, our mailers were intentionally designed to exclude names.</p>





    


    


    
    

<p>After having completed several test campaigns, Brave this year scaled up our efforts to reach seven major cities: Atlanta, Fresno, Milwaukee, Nashville, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and San Antonio. In this process, our EDDM vendor made a significant mistake by not excluding names, but instead including names before addresses, resulting in the distribution of personalized mailers.</p>





    


    


    
    

<p>Because addresses are printed only after Brave’s quality-assurance has finished (so as not to expose any sensitive information to Brave), this issue was not caught in time to prevent distribution.</p>
<p>Upon hearing from surprised recipients about this error, we froze any further printing of direct mail until the issue could be corrected. Any printed mailers with individual names which had not yet been sent were stopped and destroyed, while all future mailers were corrected to be anonymous (as originally intended), excluding printed names. We are evaluating whether further action needs to be taken due to the significance of the mistake.</p>
<p>We completely understand that some users are upset or confused about receiving a mailer addressed to them by name, and we sincerely apologize for this error. We’re committed to fixing this kind of issue systematically, so it never happens again, and we appreciate all of you who helped us catch and correct the problem.</p>

         Partnering with Chainguard: A Foundation of Trust for the Software Supply Chain            <p>Dan, Matt, Scott, Ville and Kim are making open-source artifacts secure by default.</p>  <p>ByBogomil Balkansky</p><p>PublishedJune 2, 2022</p>       



      Team Chainguard.      



 
 
   
<p>Digital signatures are to software what nutrition labels are to packaged food: a way to see who produced it and what’s inside. Just as knowing the origin of ingredients is important to trusting that what you eat is safe, you want to know where each software component came from. But it may come as a surprise but the overwhelming majority of software running today is unsigned, meaning there is no easy way to trace who really made it and how.</p>



<p>Instead, we are left blindly trusting that software is doing what we expect it to do—and nothing more. As recent debacles like the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack">SolarWinds exploit</a> have shown, however, such blind trust is naïve and misplaced. Bad actors have figured out that one of the best ways to attack software systems is to sneak their malicious code inside a legitimate program—while that program is being written, packaged or distributed. In the case of SolarWinds, attackers compromised the SolarWinds software build platform, managed to injected a backdoor into the company’s Orion product, and distributed the compromised software to unsuspecting SolarWinds customers under the guise of a regular update, allowing the attackers access to the systems of those customers. One of the most important vectors of cybersecurity today is securing the process of developing and distributing software, so similar attacks can be thwarted.</p>



<p>It took this major breach for the world to start waking up to the problem, but it is now waking up fast, with software supply chain security quickly gaining immense mindshare—all the way to the White House! President Biden last year issued <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2021-10460/p-54">Executive Order 14028</a>, which mandates enhancements to address the problem and directs federal agencies to <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cyber-supply-chain-risk-management/publications">establish new standards and guidelines</a>. And earlier this year, the administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/13/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-software-security/">summoned</a> representatives of government and the private sector to work together on a roadmap for better software supply chain security.</p>



<p>The Presidential communique of that meeting explicitly mentions code signatures as a best practice, but thus far the industry doesn’t seem to need much encouragement from the White House—thanks in part to the team at <a href="https://www.chainguard.dev/">Chainguard</a> and their contributions to the <a href="https://www.sigstore.dev/">Sigstore</a> open source project. Sigstore is the simplest, most developer-friendly way to digitally sign any kind of software artifact—a binary, a package or a container image—and, crucially, to verify that signature. Think of it as a notary for the digital world: an attestation that the software is what you think it is and will do what you expect it to. It is quickly becoming the de-facto standard for software signing, with early adopters ranging from major open source projects such as <a href="https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-adopts-sigstore-for-supply-chain-security/">Kubernetes (v1.24)</a> to financial services infrastructure such as Citi (<a href="https://blog.chainguard.dev/how-citi-are-building-the-secure-software-factory-with-sigstore-and-tekton/">which is building the secure software factory with Sigstore and Tekton</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Chainguard and Sigstore will, like all great innovations, seem obvious in hindsight, this problem is complex and multifaceted. But co-founders Dan Lorenc, Matt Moore, Scott Nichols, Ville Aikas and Kim Lewandowski are uniquely positioned to solve it, having built the respected supply chain security framework <a href="https://slsa.dev/">SLSA</a> when they worked together at Google. They defined the scope of the problem in their <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html">original blog post</a> introducing SLSA, and the principles from that post laid the foundation for what is today the most comprehensive industry consortium framework for supply chain security. SLSA offers a simple approach to assess an organization’s maturity in securing its software supply chain, and a pragmatic roadmap to improve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Chainguard is continuing to build on those principles, and on the momentum of Sigstore, with two products that allow companies to make substantial progress in their supply chain security journey. <a href="https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-enforce">Chainguard Enforce</a> protects containerized environments from supply chain threats by inventorying which containers are running and where they came from, integrating with CI/CD systems to trace how containers are built, and allowing teams to set policies for which containers can run in the cluster. Chainguard Images, which was announced today, offers a set of hardened Linux container images with SLSA Level 3 provenance and software bill of materials (SBOM).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, even a founding team as experienced as Dan, Matt, Scott, Ville and Kim can’t solve such a global and existential problem alone. That’s why they’ve built a team of original thinkers and thought leaders in supply chain security, including highly experienced open source developers. Now 40 people strong and growing fast, Chainguard has become a magnet for talent—as the <a href="https://twitter.com/lorenc_dan/status/1492504968871526402">conversation on Twitter</a> shows.</p>



  



<p></p>



<p>In short, Chainguard is in the right place at the right time to lead the way toward better supply chain security—and they have the right team to do it. We at Sequoia are thrilled to lead their Series A and be a part of their journey!</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>Another month went by, and full of developments it was.</p><p>Looking back, it’s positively satisfying to see progress in so many areas of our project as we move towards delivering Panther Core v1.</p><p>Let’s have a look at what happened in the different areas of Panther.</p> Tech and Product  Proposal to fix the Classic Staking unstaking bug <p>We started the month with the discovery of a bug in our Staking solution as users tried to withdraw their Ethereum Mainnet rewards at the end of the staking period. This unfortunate event was quickly solved by <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x2bf595137b5fe3f0fdea29dcb85ab0a0be6fffbc3ea3b7cd9aecb966ab8aa887">Panther Improvement Proposal #5</a>, approved on May 9th and implemented on May 12th.</p><p>Anecdotally, solving the unstaking bug involved collaborating with Snapshot.org to solve a UI bug, resulting in a net positive for the multi-DAO ecosystem. Fixing the unstaking bug allowed us to finally move on to testing Advanced Staking.</p><p>For all relevant details about the unstaking bug and the fix’s implementation, see the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/post-mortem-for-the-classic-staking-unstaking-bug-fix-8e2d474a5b51">post-mortem blog post</a>.

We addressed Terra LUNA’s collapse (the topic of the moment), e-Money’s sustainable model for interest-bearing stablecoins, the need for privacy in creating a surveillance-free online economy, and much more.</p>“The compliance use case [for zero-knowledge proofs] is particularly powerful when you think about private stablecoins, private dark pools, private payment networks, and so forth. (…) And again, stablecoins are the fastest growing and most relevant sector.”- Oliver Gale, Panther CEO.<p>This first Partner Spaces was an incredible opportunity to showcase how e-Money and Panther can profoundly benefit from our mutual partnership. Stablecoins need privacy, and Panther is more than glad to onboard them on our token-agnostic privacy solution. Partner Spaces will be an excellent tool for us to engage with and be on the radar of our Partners’ community, spreading the word about the need for privacy in DeFi.</p><p>Panther zTalks</p>If you’d like to get to know developments in the Panther ecosystem and meet the team more informally, Panther zTalks are a fun listen.<p>Our marketing team hosted the first <a href="https://youtu.be/watch?v=P7CbFUTKtaE">Panther zTalks</a> on May 9th, discussing our previous monthly update, news about Panther, and what’s on the horizon, including a DeFi integration Proof of Concept and Advanced Staking.</p><p>We’ll continue to issue episodes of Panther zTalks whenever they feel relevant, involving different members of our team.

<p>Zcash Network Upgrade 5 (NU5) activated on mainnet today, May 31. It is the most important milestone for Zcash since the cryptocurrency launched in 2016 — and as our Electric Coin Co. (ECC) CEO Zooko Wilcox put it, “<a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1524505677514698752">an historic step forward for human society</a>.”</p>



<p>NU5, the first major upgrade since November 2020, includes the launch of the Orchard shielded payment protocol, utilizing the Halo proving system to remove reliance on complex setup ceremonies. The efficiencies built into this upgrade make possible — for the first time ever — private, trustless digital cash payments on mobile phones. Halo also paves the way for increased interoperability by providing a system that could unlock private cross-chain proofs at scale.</p>



 
 <blockquote><p>It’s here!!! Zcashd 5.0.0! If the Zcash users choose to run zcashd 5.0.0, then at the end of this month Zcash Network Upgrade 5 will activate on mainnet. This is an historic step forward for human society.<a href="https://t.co/X5LT1H4rXq">https://t.co/X5LT1H4rXq</a></p>— zookoⓩ (@zooko) <a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1524505675459891200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2022</a></blockquote> 
 



 



 No more ceremonies 



<p>When Zcash launched, its zero-knowledge proofs required a setup phase to produce public parameters that allowed users to construct and verify private transactions. This was called <a href="https://youtu.be/D6dY-3x3teM">the Ceremony</a>, or trusted setup. This technique was pioneered by ECC, and it required multiple parties in different locations and complex security measures. A similar process was required for the Sapling upgrade in 2018 and involved more than a hundred participants. (The story of Zcash’s original Ceremony was<a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony"> well told</a> by Radiolab.)<br>Today, <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html#:~:text=A%20trusted%20setup%20ceremony%20is,some%20cryptographic%20protocol%20is%20run.">many protocols</a> rely on trusted setups, but as Joeri Cant at <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-company-behind-zcash-announces-proposed-solution-to-trusted-setup">Cointelegraph put it</a>, “they are difficult to coordinate, could present a systemic risk and always have to be repeated for each major protocol upgrade.” With the Halo proving system (<a href="https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/new-agreement-between-filecoin-foundation-and-electric-coin-co-63df066212b1">open source</a>), reliance on these kinds of processes is eliminated and protocols like Zcash benefit in efficiency and safety.</p>



<p>Zcash Media released a video about the original Ceremony, its participants (including Edward Snowden), and how Halo makes “trusted setups” obsolete.</p>



 
  
 



 



 Halo proving system in NU5 



<p>The Halo <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021.pdf">paper</a>, authored in 2019 by ECC.’s Sean Bowe, Jack Grigg, and Daira Hopwood, introduced a new technique for creating practical, scalable, and trustless cryptographic proving systems, ending an almost decade-long pursuit by the cryptography community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mike Casey, at Coindesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/14/zcashs-halo-breakthrough-is-a-big-deal-not-just-for-cryptocurrencies/">wrote</a> about Halo: “If the discovery by ECC researcher Sean Bowe holds up to scientific scrutiny, it could one day unleash a host of powerful, real-world applications for the digital age that go far beyond cryptocurrency.”</p>



<p>Zcash NU5 implements a “2.0 version” (<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/announcing-zip-224-bringing-halo-2-to-zcash/">Halo 2</a>) of the new zero-knowledge proving system that was first detailed in that paper. It eliminates protocol reliance on complex setup ceremonies, as mentioned above, and provides a catalyst for Zcash user confidence and scalability while making the protocol more attractive, faster, and less expensive for others to build on.</p>



<p>A technique called recursion, or nested amortization, also introduced in the Halo paper, is under development at ECC, bolstered by <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ethereum-zcash-filecoin-collab/">an agreement</a> with Protocol Labs, the Filecoin Foundation, and the Ethereum Foundation. As Bowe put it, this cryptographic breakthrough “allows a single proof to attest to the correctness of practically unlimited other proofs, effectively allowing a large amount of computation (and information) to be compressed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recursion is a crucial building block for a layer 1 scalability solution on Zcash — and for many other projects in and out of the crypto space.</p>



 



 Unified addresses 



<p>A new address format in the Orchard payment protocol removes the complexity of a user having to juggle multiple address types. In NU5-supporting wallets, a <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/unified-addresses-in-zcash-explained/">unified address</a> is generated from a set of multiple Zcash address types (e.g., transparent, Sapling and Orchard). Combined with auto-shielding, a feature currently supported by the ECC mobile wallet SDKs, any ZEC received to a unified address can be automatically routed to the latest shielded pool supported by the user’s wallet. So, even if the sender is only able to send ZEC transparently, it will end up in the receiver’s private storage — shielded by default.</p>



 



 Summary 



<p>Here’s a full list of what’s included in NU5 plus upcoming ECC releases:</p>



 Included 



  Zcashd, NU5-compatible consensus node<br>Zcashd is the consensus node for Zcash. It includes the Orchard shielded payment protocol (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0224">ZIP 224</a>), non-malleable transaction IDs (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0244">ZIP 244</a>), a new transaction version format (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0225">ZIP 225</a>), unified addresses (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0316">ZIP 316</a>), and other various updates.  



 Coming soon 



  ECC wallet<br>The ECC wallet (yet to be officially named) will become available in the Android and iOS stores later this year. Our goal is to deliver a wallet that provides an industry-leading user experience for ZEC, as well as features that will benefit crypto more broadly. Releasing a wallet of our own will allow us to deliver more features, more quickly, than is possible through the normal protocol-upgrade cadence and through our influence over third-party wallet providers.  Updated ECC reference wallet (iOS and Android)<br>The ECC reference wallet is a reference implementation of a Zcash wallet for Android and iOS, available as open source. The next version will include the code for the ECC wallet, plus documentation.&nbsp;  NU5-compatible wallet SDKs<br>ECC maintains wallet SDKs for Android and iOS. The next major release of these SDKs will support NU5, including a new transaction format, the Orchard shielded pool, unified addresses and the following features:  Auto-shielding (update)<br>Auto-shielding lets users (more specifically their wallets) automatically move funds from a transparent address to the latest shielded ZEC pool. Auto-shielding, along with unified addresses, will facilitate increased user privacy and a better overall user experience. Through auto-shielding, wallets can offer their users funds that are shielded by default, regardless of the originating address.  Auto-migration<br>Auto-migration is a mechanism for wallets to seamlessly move funds to the most modern shielded pool supported by the wallet. This feature will also make it easier to deprecate older pools.  Improved note management<br>Improved note management reduces the time users need to wait between sending transactions. This means that lightclients will be able to send one transaction immediately after another.

<p>PRESS RELEASE</p><p>PRESS CONTACT<br>contact@pivx.org</p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>Private Cryptocurrency PIVX has New Core Team&nbsp;Members</p><p>PIVX launched six years ago, makes changes in its push for liberty and efficiency through cryptocurrency.</p><p>May 29, 2022 — The PIVX community, having committed time recently to form a clear picture of its purpose and direction, announced today the formation of a new core&nbsp;team.</p><p>Software developers are an important part of the core team, and PIVX has enjoyed outstanding programming talent over its six-year life. The community is grateful for all who have participated. Until recently, PIVX had three core developers. However, with sound technology in place, a change was recently made to support a single core developer.</p><p>This continuing core developer, who goes by the handle Fuzzbawls, is the new development leader. Fuzzbawls has been with the PIVX project for years and knows it&nbsp;well.</p><p>Under Fuzzbawls’ leadership, other community members are learning and mastering the PIVX source code. PIVX is a code fork of Dash, which was built on the Bitcoin source code, and this connection gives history, reference, and learning material to new PIVX developers that augment the teaching provided by Fuzzbawls.</p><p>Other team members have also changed, in the areas of project management, business development, and marketing. The new team is diverse with rich experience and exciting new ideas. One prominent team member, who goes by the handle Sparrow, is the new Project Management Specialist.</p><p>“Sparrow, with confidence from his business experience, is moving the project forward quickly,” said Eric Stanek. “He brings out the best in other community members.”</p><p>Other new team members can be seen on the PIVX website at <a href="https://pivx.org/team">https://pivx.org/team.</a></p><p>These personnel changes will advance PIVX’s mission.

Open Meta hosts regular AMAs. In this spotlight, Vincent Boon, Community Manager, shares his thoughts on building for an Open Metaverse.<p>On May 18, <a href="https://www.openmetadao.com/">Open Meta</a> hosted our second AMA, this time focused on building communities. The AMA was hosted by Ryan Gill, Founder and CEO of Open Meta and Crucible. He was joined by Vincent Boon, Head of Community.</p><p>The AMA was hosted on <a href="https://www.beem.xyz/">Beem</a>, a decentralized Web 3.0 platform.</p><p>We’ve collated some highlights from the AMA, but you can watch the whole thing by clicking&nbsp;here.</p><p>Vincent’s Background</p><p>“I’m leading community efforts here at the Open Meta DAO. Community has been my passion for over 20 years. I started in the late 90s as a hobby, trying to communicate and create guilds. This led to me finding online communities and thinking, ‘oh, this is actually really&nbsp;fun!’</p><p>“I was working in the computer games industry back then for a company called Eidos. One of the games I was testing was called “Championship Manager” and it was all about football. I wasn’t a big fan of soccer, so it made sense to get fans of these sorts of games to test it. So I worked with the marketing department, we contacted people on the email list, set up a website that linked to my database, and got about 100 people in to begin&nbsp;with.</p><p>“I grew that pool to around 20,000 people who were testing that game with me. As it was based on football [soccer], people created leagues. It was such rich content that it ended up being reflected in the final game. The game was released and became a big success…Working with people to create something cooler is just something I really enjoy.”&nbsp;2:44</p><p>“[At Playstation] I was really building the community and working with the members. Eventually, we created a full-on game. The community came up with the characters, they designed them, decided how they could move, what they could do, the weapons they had, and the story. Then we had a game development studio come in and create the game.”&nbsp;6:46</p><p>“I got a little more corporate. I started to work for a huge telecommunications firm and the goal there was to have a whole company that was founded on community, and that’s what we did. From marketing to product development to the way it was sold, it was led by the community.” 8:46</p><p>Relationship to Open&nbsp;Meta</p><p>“With the advent of DAOs, ‘community-led’ has become something real. We have a DAO and the community can decide what to fund, what to build, and what to think about. For me, this is the pinnacle of where my work has always been leading. How do we create a company that works as a group that creates something for the benefit of us all? That’s what led me to the Open Meta DAO.”&nbsp;10:24</p><p>“When I first heard about the Web 3.0 space and some of these communities that were really explosive in terms of the number of people joining within weeks, I was really surprised. I couldn’t believe it. I’ve been building communities for twenty&nbsp;years.</p><p>“I know how long it takes to get a core of people that are so engaged with what you’re doing, really likes what you’re doing, and feels like they’re going to benefit in some way. With Open Meta, it’s easier to see the value you’re getting. People will genuinely be able to make a living. Web 3.0 is an investor community, so people often move as a swarm. But is that a community? Maybe it’s a community amongst themselves, but when you look at what they’re trying to do and how many people are trying to reach that end goal, it doesn’t seem like one.”&nbsp;12:30</p><p>The Role of Open Meta&nbsp;DAO</p><p>“The Open Meta DAO should be seen as a key component of your journey to the Metaverse. These are people who are genuinely building. Because they’re trying to create a future for themselves, they start thinking about the peripheral problems that there might be. How do we ensure it’s frictionless for people to move around this space?”&nbsp;14:54</p><p>“Building an Ecosystem where people are genuinely thinking about these issues and then getting to a point where they’re starting to collaborate and work together takes a lot — and it takes a lot for us as an organization. We need to be putting things in place that make the movement into the Metaverse supported. People want to help out; they just don’t know how.”&nbsp;15:14</p><p>How Open Meta Helps Builders and&nbsp;Creators</p><p>“We have the concept of Houses, where we’re defining our community in a set of disciplines and where we’re looking at a range of disciplines that people generally fit in due to their work or their passions. This could be fashion, policy, virtual production, and things like that. All of those elements are what makes up the eventual existence of an Open Metaverse. For us, when we think about supporting this community of creators, builders and thinkers, a key aspect is the kind of community we’re building. We work out loud. We understand how to work with communities and the kinds of difficulties that arise.”&nbsp;20:57</p><p>“A lot of beautiful stuff comes out of finding the people in your community that add value. Taking a proactive approach is so necessary and you can’t just sit around and wait for the community to be engaged.” 24:10</p><p>Open Meta&nbsp;Houses</p><p>“The Houses are disciplines and eventually, we’ll want them to collaborate. The future of the Houses is assigning Heads of Houses. These will be able to change over time, but the idea is that they start creating policies and strategies around that House to help it achieve its goals and overcome issues in that discipline.” 27:23</p><p>“A House should be a place for people to come to in order to find industry knowledge. If you’re trying to think about building in the Metaverse, where should you go? How do you figure out how to do that? Part of what Houses can do is become educational and help people find their way into the Metaverse.” 29:01</p><p>“When you’re building as a community, it’s important to see where the passion lies with everyone, where they want to see progress, or even just what people find fun. We’re currently working on the DAO portal, where we’re creating a forum that’s more of a regimented place of discussion than Discord.” 36:01</p><p>DAO and Emergence</p><p>“[On the relationship between Protocol and DAO] As with all things, you need to start from somewhere. There has to be something in place before others can build on it. We’re putting in a lot of structure to allow people to build on. That’s similar to Emergence and the way it’s evolving. Emergence is a toolkit that allows people to move what they’ve created to a Web 3.0 experience, but it’s so wide in what it can become. We don’t know where it’s going to go.”&nbsp;44:19</p><p>The Future of Open Meta and Web&nbsp;3.0</p><p>“I’m worried about interoperability and how easy it is to move from one space to another. But the ability this new set of tools gives us is everything I’ve wanted! We can go around in spaces in items of clothing I want to wear instead of being constrained by whoever thought up the experience I’m in…It becomes so much more about who you are and how you experience life, rather than this weird, fragmented, ‘I have an account here and there and everywhere’ experience. You can create much more of your own space and it becomes much more you, rather than [the feeling that] you’ve created something in someone else’s space. The ability to bring that history with you is what’s going to change in how we experience the Metaverse. Owning your history is the big change.”&nbsp;49:49</p><p>“I’ve built my career on helping customers of companies influence them and be a part of them. It’s impossible to start a conversation with the companies you purchase from. For me, it’s always been incredibly important that consumers have a voice and, if they want to, get involved. Companies need to create those openings. Traditionally, it’s been hard to create models with any kind of reciprocity where people who get involved get something genuine out of it. With DAOs, that’s now possible. We’re still figuring things out, especially the management piece of the puzzle, but we’re going where the world should be going. That makes me really excited!” 52:30</p><p>“In the near future, we’ll be appointing four Heads of Houses. That’s the initial batch we’re bringing in to work on how to shape each House. Once we’ve got a feel for it, we’ll be bringing in more and more Heads. Once we go open, we’ll be moving discussions from Discord to Agora so we can work more closely with community members and start work on projects. By the end of the year, I’m hoping to have some building underway.” 57:31</p><p>To learn more and to help us map and build the future of the Open Metaverse please join us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/openmeta">Discord</a> and follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenMetaDAO">Twitter</a>.</p>

 New technical capabilities allow influencers and communities to turn social tokens from one-dimensional curiosities into widely usable currencies carrying reliable real world value, that are far better positioned to capture additional value for their issuers and others through building substantial and automated economies centered around the&nbsp;token.   social tokens offer the promise of branded digital currency that allows creators to capture the value created by their community  in the first generation of social tokens, technical features are one-dimensional, allowing for sending back and forth and to be included in liquidity pools like Uniswap — they can be related, with hard work, to off-chain economic activity but have no on-chain economics — actual value is aspirational, not provable, reliable or predictable  social tokens hold promise but have yet to really take off like they should — leading platforms require programming or a permissioned facilitator, have limited capabilities — there’s no long tail&nbsp;activity  additional capabilities and low-cost permissionless, easy launches will unleash potential — built-in direct liquidity, stable and predictable values, attached namespaces to create a full spectrum digital goods economy centered on the token; real value creation that is direct and measurable through directly connected on-chain economic activity like nfts, fan profiles, memorabilia, tickets, discount codes, coupons, log-in unlock, etc; measurable economic activity with clear results attracts speculators who can measure and predict engagement that inevitably leads to real&nbsp;value  the Verus project, in non-stop development for five years, has built-in blockchain primitives that make these capabilities a reality now, offering more functionality, to more people — smart contract platforms cannot match these capabilities today absent an enormous engineering effort in bringing together multiple interoperating complex smart contracts  additional capabilities include privacy enhancement, moral hazard resistance, easy group&nbsp;dynamics  provable decentralized bridges to ethereum give the best of both worlds — intelligent next generation social tokens that can also emerge automatically, without programming, as&nbsp;ERC-20s  experiments to prove these concepts require no programming, are risk-free and extremely low cost — core protocols exist now, tooling and apps still require build-out in a collective effort   Social Tokens — the&nbsp;Promise <p>Googling the term “social tokens” brings a host of articles discussing socal tokens as the next big thing. The idea has been around for a while since ERC-20s mainstreamed the idea of token creation riding on top of a base layer blockchain. Creating digital scarcity and expressing that as a transferable token was now possible without creating an independent blockchain; it could be done at relatively low cost and with low maintenance. Soon, people began thinking about tokens where an influencer, brand or community creates a branded token, pre-mines a little bit of it, gets their fan-base/customers/community to transact in it and, presto, the token will start to gain a little bit of&nbsp;value.</p> The First Generation <p>Early market leaders soon arrived, such as <a href="https://tryroll.com/">tryroll.com</a> and <a href="http://rally.io/">rally.io</a>. These platforms are well-funded venture businesses that managed to onboard perhaps thousands of creators into their own social tokens. Despite some fanfare though, there’s not much to these tokens other&nbsp;than</p>  enforced digital scarcity — they help creators create and issue ERC-20s (or Solana now, for Rally), helping them through what is an otherwise arduous process requiring some&nbsp;skill  automated market making — they help set up Uniswap-like liquidity provision, but to gain actual liquidity creators must, in the words of the Roll website: “encourage their communities to contribute liquidity”  handing creators a roadmap and examples to “build value” — this generally involves activities, services or products that creators will offer to their fans so that they can get their communities to buy the token and then trade the token for these goods — the idea is to generate real-world demand for the&nbsp;tokens  <p>On the roll website, this last concept is pitched as: “After minting, you determine all the ways your token will be distributed and used across platforms, closing the loop that gives your social token its own independent value and starts your social token economy.”. But, as described in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/the-social-token-network-rally-friends-with-benefits-and-the-future-of-branding/">this article</a>, “I discovered that it’s just a sh**tload of work to keep a token&nbsp;going”.</p><p>The end result is that value in social tokens remains fleeting or aspirational. Liquidity through liquidity provision in automated market makers can be a big problem. For a liquidity provider, risks are high, probably untenable since impermanent loss risk in an AMM with a fragile token approaches 100%. It turns out that liquidity provision in this context is a wholly altruistic activity, or worse, done by people who are unaware of the enormous risks. WIth minimal liquidity provision comes little market depth and unstable&nbsp;value.</p><p>Also, value for the token is tightly locked to a creator’s ongoing real world efforts to provide experiences, or events, or products, in order to drive continuous demand for the currency. There are no automated economic activities. If the creator’s activity stalls, or dries up, the token will lose value rapidly. Predictably, the vast bulk of these currencies peter out, and are forgotten, living on as zombie ERC-20s on ethereum.</p> No Long&nbsp;Tail <p>Anyone that’s really interested in creating a social token is met with an odd reality in the “decentralized” blockchain world. Both Roll and Rally, the social token leaders, require creators to go through a detailed application process, and then wait for approval. The Rally website says they’re looking for: “1) Evidence of a significant community size,&nbsp;… 2) Evidence of current transaction activity within your community&nbsp;… 3) Evidence that you have strongly considered the role that a social token economy would play in your ongoing projects.” Creators then wait for a review before being approved. Roll’s business model is to take a portion of the creator’s token for themselves. Rally’s is a little more sophisticated, attempting to have value created in their own token and sidechain in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This makes sense for Roll and Rally because there is significant engineering and other work required to get the contracts up and running that define the social token and provide it liquidity. Creators who want to “do it themselves” are met with an arduous and limiting process — essentially, they need to be decent developers to get their tokens going. And to do all that for a one-dimensional token that can only be sent back and forth or placed in an AMM seems to be an unattractive proposition.</p><p>The result is that social tokens have yet to fulfill their promise. There’s no easy way for just anyone to do permissionless experiments at little cost, and little risk. And, when they do experiment, there is only the hope that by tying real world activities to their token, they might generate some value there, at least while they continue to offer those activities. This purported value is difficult to measure, and tough to capture, and exhausting to maintain. So there’s no real innovation and no “long tail” that allows unexpected modes of organization and value creation to&nbsp;emerge.</p> New Capabilities <p>What would it look like if there were new capabilities around social tokens? What are some of these, and how would they function?</p><p>Easy launch — low cost, permissionless, easy launch through point and click or simple commands. This would lower barriers and allow for just anyone to try out social token experiments. The law of large numbers tells us that some would stumble into real success, perhaps in ways, and through methods, we don’t yet understand.</p><p>Built-in Direct Liquidity — five years ago, the Bancor project pioneered <a href="https://blog.bancor.network/smart-tokens-101-63edc2cc5a89">smart tokens</a>, which they called “money that holds money”. Bancor seems to have abandoned this concept in favor of competing with Uniswap, but the idea has real merit. A social token with this property would not need an automated marketmaker to be able to be a liquid token. Instead, users could convert into and out of the token directly, after first being “seeded” by the founder. This eliminates liquidity provider risk — and, in essence, every single holder of the token ends up providing liquidity, automatically. This leads to more market depth, and thus more stability and predictability in value. The fact that each token is “money that holds money” leads to provable value, and these tokens will be treated with care, as near money. Another result of this capability is that social tokens would have dynamic supply, where more tokens are automatically minted in response to increasing demand, and burned if the demand reverses.</p><p>Attached Namespaces — tokens have names, of course. If these are cryptographically unique names (like, for example, crypto addresses), they can be the root of a namespace. ERC-20 names are not unique and so cannot be namespace roots (unless referred to by their contract number). A different model for tokens, where their friendly names are defined in the protocol and processed as UTXOs just like native blockchain currency, points to whole new capabilities. For example, if someone called “Influencer” creates a social token called “Influencer”, they will have also defined a namespace called “Influencer”, opening up unique digital goods opportunities.</p><p>Digital Goods — a namespace on a blockchain protocol renders unique power; a simple model for digital goods on a namespace would&nbsp;include:</p>  object definition — a protocol could allow unique friendly name identifiers within the namespace, meaning fans could register identities/names that are associated with the namespace, eg. “fan.influencer@”, or an influencer could assign meaningful names to digital goods attached to their namespace, eg. “ticket0001.influencer@” or “coolnft.influencer@” or “schedule.influencer@”  object control and transferability — a protocol could allow defined objects to be controlled by private keys and to be transferable from one set of private keys to another, either by command, or in an atomic swap transaction, eg. fans could transfer their objects to and from each other at will, or on automated marketplaces without intermediaries  objects as destinations/addresses/endpoints — as addresses on a blockchain protocol, these objects could receive, send and hold funds, or control other objects; eg. money could be sent to or from “fan.influencer@”; also, objects could be endpoints, and so could receive messages or be unique points in a communications network  object metadata — objects could contain space for metadata, and leverage data structures and off-chain storage (either centralized or decentralized, like arweave) to allow for arbitrary and updateable data to be associated with the object. Coupled with #3 above this allows objects to exist as NFT art, or <a href="https://verus.io/verusid-lookup/mike@">verifiable online&nbsp;profiles</a>  object signatures — being cryptographically unique, objects could provide verifiable signatures to arbitrary data, thus allowing for applications like sign-on/access, or&nbsp;voting  <p>Immediately we see that meaningful digital goods economies could spring up around successful influencers. Examples of such digital goods would&nbsp;be:</p>  Fan IDs — the simple act of creating a fan ID/address for just a few dollars could be seen as a show of support, or status symbol in an influencer community; or fans could create and trade meaningful IDs  Nfts — influencers, or even their fans, could create digital collectibles/art/memorabilia to be auctioned, sold or given away to&nbsp;fans  Fan Profiles — updateable, verifiable fan profiles are&nbsp;possible  Ticket — an object could represent a ticket to an&nbsp;event  Coupons/gift cards — an object could represent a right to buy&nbsp;merch  Discount Codes — an object might give a right to get ongoing discounts on merch or&nbsp;events  Memberships — an object can provide exclusive membership to influencer clubs or&nbsp;forums  Log-in/access — an object can give rights to enter websites or other digital&nbsp;arenas  Voting — objects could be used to signal support for an initiative, idea or&nbsp;proposal  <p>This is far from an exhaustive list, and the “long tail” will surely draw out ideas which we’re not even capable of conceiving right now. Many of these goods would be automatic or community created and so could thrive even without continuous activity from the issuer. This is important for the longevity of the social token economy. It’s not difficult to see how strong community-created activity could thrive and&nbsp;persist.</p><p>An Economic Model for the Digital Goods — to capture value for the issuing influencer (and others), there is no necessity ever to sell tokens directly to the public (which might bring securities laws into the issue anyway). The social tokens would always be just a commodity/good/coupon that can be acquired to show support, or to be used (exclusively) to acquire digital goods like those described above. An issuer would always, likely, issue “free” tokens to themself as part of the creation process (a “premine”), or retain the right to issue new tokens at will (perhaps only after the passing of a period of time). They would also need to “seed” the token with a little bit of real world money to provide initial value to the token. Note that this seed money would never actually be at risk of loss, and could always be recovered; in fact, recovery (and more) would be quite easy in the case of thriving token economies. Once this is done, then fans could acquire the tokens (directly, without an AMM) by converting their currency, like USDC, into the social token. Every time a fan does this, they increase the supply of the token a little bit, and they also drive up its value. When they spend the token on digital goods (like ID creation, buying a NFT, getting a membership, etc.) the amount that they spend gets burned from the supply of the token, which reduces its supply and further drives up its value. During this process, too, the robustness of the reserves of “real” currency are improved, providing more depth and stability to the token’s value. It will become easier and easier for the issuer to start selling down their “premine”, or to issue themself new tokens, and thus capturing the created value, without crashing the value of the&nbsp;token.</p><p>With this model, further value enhancement might come from speculators who see that an influencer is growing in power. Speculators like these would be analogous to collectors who have an eye for talent, and that can spot trends. All they need to do to profit is to get in early on the right tokens by the right influencers with the right potential economic activity that would *inevitably* drive value increases. In this way, market dynamics might allow influencers to capture future value&nbsp;today.</p> This Exists Today — the Verus&nbsp;Project <p>This is not just theory, but is about to be put into practice. Five years in development, and with a working network (minus these token capabilities) for the last three years, the <a href="http://verus.io/">Verus Project</a> has built the protocols. Verus aims to be a public good. There are no VCs funding the project and so no returns on investment that need to be drawn from users to pay back investors. It is a community developed FOSS blockchain protocol. The only fees involved in creating and using social tokens on Verus will be paid, as in bitcoin, to miners who power the&nbsp;network.</p><p>These capabilities as described do not exist on smart contract platforms today. Perhaps they could be engineered on a case by case basis by a team of competent smart contract developers. But, this would require complex interconnecting smart contracts to deal with all of the disparate elements. It would be an enormous engineering effort, fraught with risk and complexity. On Verus, using primitives as building blocks, these tokens can be issued in just a few minutes, with bespoke variables, by non-programmers, and at little&nbsp;cost.</p> Additional Capabilities <p>Apart from the core functionality of social tokens described above, there are also some interesting capabilities that enhance the concept. First, as a fork of zcash, Verus offers private transactions on its native currency. And, as a UTXO blockchain, wallets control multiple addresses which cannot necessarily be traced to the same wallet. This gives the ability for intelligent apps to protect user’s privacy as they interact with social&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Also, on-chain escrow mechanisms allow for issuers to timelock their holdings for arbitrary periods. This helps reduce potential moral hazard where fans and speculators might be concerned about issuers dumping their holdings and “rugging” their community. Roll has always been concerned about this possibility, and that led them to provide centralized escrow services for their issuers. Unfortunately, a <a href="https://tryroll.com/security-incident/">security incident</a> at Roll led to these “escrowed” amounts being stolen and liquidated.</p><p>Social tokens might be tied to entire groups, rather than a single influencer. In this case, Verus protocols allow multisignature approvals for the issuance or sale of the tokens. Multisigs can be up to 13 of 25 different participants.</p><p>Finally, Verus testnet currently includes a provable decentralized bridge to and from the ethereum network. This bridge allows any token created on the Verus network to be bridged to ethereum, where it *automatically* emerges as an ERC-20 token, without any additional programming required. This is a crucial element, as ethereum is currently where the users are. Once created on Verus, an influencer can bridge tokens over to ethereum, where it can be used for giveaways, liquidity provision, or any other purpose for which social tokens are used today by Roll or Rally. Similarly, tokens can be bridged from ethereum, meaning that USDC, ETH, WBTC and other valuable currencies will exist on the Verus&nbsp;mainnet.</p> Status <p>These protocols exist now on the Verus testnet and are scheduled for imminent release to the Verus main network. As a community project, and FOSS project focused on core protocol development as a public good, Verus community members have not yet advanced consumer-ready tooling and apps that can take full advantage of these core capabilities. Nevertheless, forward-thinking influencers can start now, since experimentation is inexpensive, permissionless and easy, and some of the tooling and apps do exist for capable users. More importantly though, there is a business opportunity here for companies or entrepreneurs to leapfrog Roll and Rally, or for those companies themselves to pivot to, or supplement their current offerings with, a more capable rent-free platform. The Verus community stands by to assist anyone who would develop tools and applications and businesses leveraging the protocols.</p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discuss and explore all Verus has to offer on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/the-coming-of-age-of-social-tokens-518aed68c8f2">The Coming of Age of Social Tokens</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Web3 Architecture and Tech Stack&nbsp;: A Beginners Guide <p>If you’re a beginner in the Web3 space, the initial inertia of understanding things might be overwhelming for&nbsp;you.</p><p>I wrote this blog around three months ago when I started to get a gist of what Web3 is and how everything works coming from a Web2 world. I was bewildered about studying what, how, and whatnot when I started up. Some people say this blockchain is better, and others say another. Some include many products into their architecture, making it so complicated that it looks like a different world altogether. Just Google around looking for the Web3 tech stack — everyone gives you an explanation of what it is in their perspective, and a typical marketing blog is what I always find, I’d&nbsp;say.</p><p>So when I started writing this blog, my focus was just one thing — let’s transition our knowledge from Web2 to Web3 and know which technologies support what. Once that is figured out, it will become far easier to choose and start our developer journey into it. This blog will generally be over the top, although that’s what you need as a beginner, right?</p><p>But first, we need to understand what we mean by Web3 — the idea people might change the internet as we see&nbsp;it.</p> What is&nbsp;Web3? <p>One of my friends recently mentioned that Web3 is just another fancy name for the blockchain ecosystem. He’s partially correct, at the same time, wrong on a whole different level.</p><p>Although the foundation of Web3 is centered around blockchain, when you start developing over it, you’ll realize that blockchain is just a part of it. To draw a comparison, a blockchain in a Web3 app might be similar to how a database might be for a typical web app (Web2) you might develop. As a comparison, we&nbsp;take:</p><p>Web1 = the internet of information; i.e., The HTML CSS websites you cannot interact&nbsp;with.</p><p>Web2 = the internet of interactions; i.e., Modern platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc., that allow you to be connected end to end with&nbsp;others.</p><p>Web3 = the new internet of value, i.e., the internet where centralization of information is eliminated.</p><p>So if we try to define Web3, we can say that it is the concept that aids the development of decentralized applications(dApps). Yes — the same decentralized internet we heard from <a href="https://silicon-valley.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Hendricks">Richard in Silicon&nbsp;Valley</a>!</p><p>However, we do not have a compression engine platform like what he had built to build this. Instead, we have a range of protocols and platforms that enable this development system. These protocols are a set of rules that govern how your application works, while multiple platforms facilitate the creation of your application.</p><p>Okay, fine, but why do we need dApps in the first&nbsp;place?</p><p>The most significant benefit of creating a dApp is Ownership and Identity. Ownership of data, content, literally everything with your self-identity — a concept that got blurred with the coming of age of these top institutions like Google and Facebook.</p><p>Another significant benefits people talk about is Composability, one of the central pillars of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Every single software company out there right now is focused on collecting user data, which is their single biggest asset and differentiates them from one another. Not the product but the data they hold. Companies competing with each other, with similar UI/UX and slightly different business logic, are valuable independently because of the “data” they have aggregated.</p><p>This is what Web3 will disrupt, making every application composable by sharing &amp; consuming their data between different applications. Think about a metaverse where you can buy things from Meta and use them in the Microsoft ecosystem. This is the most exciting and interesting aspect of Web3. It is making the web genuinely composable!</p><p>But that’s not all; with the high amount of trust and reliability these applications bring in, the possibilities are endless; we haven’t even imagined what the future might look like with dApps being omnipresent. I feel Web3 might start the same revolution that open-source brought into the developer ecosystem.</p> Understanding the Web3 Architecture <p>Now that we have defined Web3, we need to understand how these protocols and platforms work together to help us build these&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>When we imagine a general web app, we envision an architecture constituting the&nbsp;follows:</p>Basic Web2 Architecture<p>Although I’ve not depicted things like caches, queues, etc., a general over-the-top architecture looks like&nbsp;this.</p><p>For a Web3 app, The frontend will remain the same, but some exciting changes start to happen on the backend side of things. Let’s see how that&nbsp;works:</p>Basic Web3 Architecture<p>If we compare Web2 and Web3, the Blockchain Node is doing the heavy lifting and managing our data, which is decentralized into a network of blockchains. Since it is expensive to store directly on the chain, we have some off-chain File Storage and a P2P Database facilitating data storage. Finally, to build a secure layer, we have a Wallet or a Private Key-based Authentication to verify the individual’s identity.</p><p>Please note that this is just an over-the-top depiction of the architecture. In reality, we have much more complex applications and need architectural parameters from both Web2 and&nbsp;Web3.</p> The Web3 Tech&nbsp;Stack <p>So far, we have learned what a Web3 architecture generally looks like. Now, let’s deep dive into each of these components to better understand the tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>So let’s start from the&nbsp;bottom:</p> Blockchain <p>If I talk about selecting a blockchain to build upon, it is one of the most challenging tasks one needs to decide on. There are many factors at play here; decentralization, transaction throughput, gas fees, ecosystem/interoperability, and many more, and we won’t be debating them all as it’ll never end. It is like choosing your programming language. Every single one works; a few are better in specific cases and others for other use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Although, as a beginner, I might recommend starting with <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a> with <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/">Solidity</a>. This is because of the massively present developer community around&nbsp;it.</p><p>EVM acts as the virtual machine, the bedrock of Ethereum’s entire operating structure. Ethereum brought in the concept of smart contracts and is the most used blockchain out there. Solidity is the language used to make smart contracts. It is very similar to JavaScript in syntax, which might be helpful if you’re a Web2 developer. Under the hood, Solidity is compiled into low-level instructions called <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/opcodeshttps://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/opcodes">opcodes</a> for the EVM to interpret.</p><p>When you’ve learned this, it will be easier to understand the concepts of other technologies in the ecosystem, like:</p>  <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>: Another blockchain like Ethereum focuses on providing faster transaction times and cheaper fees. The smart contracts can be written in Rust, C, and&nbsp;C++.  Layer 2’s (L2): L2 refers to a secondary protocol built over an existing blockchain system, generally Ethereum, borrowing the main chain’s consensus security. There are many options here, but the top ones remain <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://arbitrum.io/">Arbitrium</a>, <a href="https://starkware.co/starkex/">StarkEx</a> &amp; <a href="https://starkware.co/starknet/">StarkNet</a>, <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a>, etc.  Application Chains: Although you won’t require this as a newbie, I feel this is the most exciting option out there. You can build your own blockchain/consensus system with platforms like <a href="https://tendermint.com/">Tendermint</a>/<a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a>, <a href="http://polkadot.network">Polkadot</a>, etc.   Blockchain Node <p>For deploying an application in production, you need a server. A blockchain node does this job for blockchains. Blockchain nodes are network stakeholders or devices running the “blockchain software”. Hence, they are authorized to keep track of the distributed ledger, serving as communication hubs for the network tasks. A P2P (Peer to Peer) protocol allows nodes to communicate within the network and transfer information about transactions and new&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>You can self-run blockchain nodes or get a Node service provider like <a href="https://www.quicknode.com/">Quicknode</a>, <a href="https://moralis.io/">Moralis</a>, <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a>, etc., that offer APIs to create automated flows. For self-hosting, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/">AWS Cloud</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/solutions/blockchain/">Azure</a> have images for you to spin up for the more popular chains. Otherwise, most chains make it easy for you to run your nodes/validators. The only thing that can be a hassle is to ensure uptime and maintenance, which depends on your&nbsp;network.</p> P2P Database <p>The first question that anybody would ask here is: Why do we need a database when we’re using blockchain in the first place? Additionally, will it not hinder our idea of a&nbsp;dApp?</p><p>As a simple answer to that, storing data on a blockchain is slow and expensive. We need an additional database to access data off-chain, ensuring that we’re not accessing the chain again and again. To have that decentralization part of it, we use peer-to-peer or P2P databases that store and host all of the data in streams to eliminate centralized database servers, blockchains, or local storage. Think about how your torrents get downloaded!</p><p>The <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic network</a> is the most common decentralized database provider out there, as I know of personally.</p> Decentralized File&nbsp;Storage <p>Like every other application, we need a dedicated file storage system (similar to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> for Web2 applications). Databases essentially are tabular data, while file storage is that folder-based data you need to store your large media files. <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> is the most common P2P file system protocol with excellent community support. <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a> is another option focused on keeping data permanently. You can use platforms like <a href="https://docs.filecoin.io/about-filecoin/what-is-filecoin/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://siasky.net/">Skynet</a>, <a href="https://storj.io/">Storj</a>, and <a href="https://0chain.net/">0Chain</a> to host these file storage&nbsp;systems.</p> Authentication in&nbsp;Web3 <p>In my honest opinion, authentication is one of the most essential aspects of Web3. Without logging in users into the smart contract, one cannot access their wallets and make the most straightforward transactions. You should note that signing a transaction enables every interaction with a blockchain.</p><p>Looking at traditional login methods in the Web2 world, we have a simple form structure where the user details are stored in a database and cross-checked for verification. Additionally, services like Google &amp; Facebook offer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, enabling access to some basic information to the app directly, making the process seamless. Although this approach is convenient, this cannot be now used in a dApp since you need a private key to sign a transaction.</p><p>In Web3, we do not have the user’s data, but actually, we have wallets (which are essentially a wrapper around a private key), wherein cryptographic signatures are used to prove ownership of those blockchain addresses. It is essential to know how to access and interact with a user’s address and private key as a Web3 developer.</p><p>The fascinating aspect of owning a blockchain wallet is that once a user loses their <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/public-private-keys-cryptography">private key</a> to the wallet address, no one can recover it for them. This is useful and scary at the same time. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/13/half-a-billion-in-bitcoin-lost-in-the-dump">stories of crypto millionaires</a> who have lost it all by storing their private keys in a lost hard&nbsp;drive.</p><p>Many projects have tried different ways to go around this and help users recover that key, the most common of them being Seed Phrases. The most famous wallet out there, <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>, uses the concept of 12 word Mnemonic Phrases, which goes through a <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/mnemonic-generation-bip39-simply-explained-e9ac18db9477">BIP39 Algorithm</a> to generate the array of unique wallet addresses and private keys for you stored in your MetaMask account. But then again, remembering 12 randomly generated words in proper order for each wallet account group a user owns is difficult.</p><p>While trying to figure out a solution to a lousy UX like this, I encountered <a href="https://web3auth.io/">Web3Auth</a>, and interestingly enough, I ended up joining them within the next two months. Web3Auth is one of the most popular solutions for new users, bridging the Web2 and Web3 worlds. A simple auth infrastructure that gives those OAuth capabilities to Web3 applications in a self-custodial way for the user. By self custodial, we mean that the user has custody of the key and not the application or Web3Auth. This is done through a unique MPC architecture, and hence the private key is never stored in a single server/ node or method with complete access. Read more about the infrastructure <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/overview/key-management">here</a>.</p><p>I think it can be a massive thing for a project onboarding process. I would recommend checking it&nbsp;out.</p> Implementing the&nbsp;Frontend <p>Many developers might not know, but the frontend technologies for Web3 and Web2 are the same. The only difference is where you need to reimagine the UX of the application because the authentication, processing in the blockchain, and general flow of the application are slightly different from Web2 applications.</p><p>I would recommend going on with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> &amp; <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> since most developers are currently using this in the Web3 world. I might be biased, but almost every other project presently features a React integration. If you’re using Webpack 5, make sure that there are certain polyfills you need to take care of while developing an application; the rest of everything is generally the&nbsp;same.</p><p>For the client-side backend, things get a bit different. Here is where you need to understand how to interact with the blockchain you’ve created. Web3 Interaction libraries help you with that, but you need to know how they work and interact with the blockchain properly.</p> Blockchain Interaction (Web3) Libraries and development tools: <p>Web3 libraries allow you to interact with nodes using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket. These libraries help developers write intuitive, one-line methods to initialize the JSON RPC requests (under the hood) that interact with whichever chain you’ve&nbsp;chosen.</p><p>On Ethereum, some of the Web3 Libraries are <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/">Web3.js</a>, <a href="https://docs.ethers.io/">Ethers.js,</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openethereum/js-libs/tree/master/packages/light.js">Light.js</a>. On top of that, many chains have developer tools that provide features that allow for much faster iteration than public testnets. Tools like <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache">Ganache</a>, <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle">Truffle</a>, <a href="https://hardhat.org/">Hardhat</a>, and <a href="https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Brownie</a> are examples&nbsp;here.</p><p>For starting up with Ethereum development, I’d highly recommend checking out the <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix IDE</a> — it is the best place for a beginner to learn Solidity and Ethereum concepts. You can easily directly interact and test out your code without setting up all these libraries.</p> Wrapping up <p>In all, I believe Web3 comes with an exciting opportunity for new developers out there to try out something different and break away from the traditional aspects of software development. At the same time, drawing this comparison and understanding where to start is extremely necessary for anyone looking to build decentralized applications since there will always be a combination of both in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Web3 is here to stay, but this does not mean that the concepts of Web2 are dead. Learning the new tech stack while understanding its key usage and characteristics is the only way a developer can pioneer this new industry.</p><p>I hope this blog might have helped you understand some key aspects of how a Web3 app is put together. Please do let me know if I’ve missed or messed something up because I’m still a learner trying out different stuff in this new world&nbsp;:)</p><p>Cheers!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/a-beginners-guide-the-basic-web3-architecture-and-tech-stack-81f2061d263c">A Beginners’ guide the basic Web3 Architecture and Tech Stack</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The Privy Mindmap — the path&nbsp;ahead  Part 2: self-sovereignty through&nbsp;impact <p>We believe <a href="https://medium.com/privy-io/technical-decisions-are-moral-decisions-19d128b0a10e">building in the open is core to building better data infrastructure</a>. Accordingly, we are proud to present the Privy mindmap — this second part runs through the work ahead for Privy and how we build for a future of data ownership. For more on how Privy works today, <a href="https://blog.privy.io/the-privy-mindmap-privy-today-f963a3909c52">check out part&nbsp;1</a>.</p>Pure alpha right&nbsp;here Self-sovereignty through&nbsp;impact <p>Too much of web3 today is built around visions for how protocols can shape the space over decades, rather than focused on helping developers ship safer, more delightful products&nbsp;today.</p><p>We believe data self-sovereignty will come from pragmatic, usable software that helps developers build great products right now and enable us to move web3 beyond purely financial use cases. To that end, our first order of business at Privy is to make it easy for developers to take on user data safely in web3&nbsp;today.</p><p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/the-privy-mindmap-privy-today-f963a3909c52">We are starting with very simple APIs</a> to help developers securely manage user data but this is not where things end. Through this work, we set the basis for sovereign data systems in which developers define schemas (data needs) but the users control permissions (data access) and can easily grant or revoke access to their&nbsp;data.</p><p>How do we get from here (user data management) to there (self-sovereign data)?</p>No Wizard of Oz on our way up the yellow brick&nbsp;road<p>We do this by building Privy along three core&nbsp;epics:</p>  A more user-controlled Privy&nbsp;🥸  A more integrated Privy&nbsp;🤝  A more decentralized Privy&nbsp;🫥  <p>These epics mean building at the cutting edge of product design, applied cryptography and distributed systems, respectively.</p><p>I’ll break these down in turn. While each deserves its own write up, I’ll cover some high level ideas and specific roadmap items we’re especially excited about for&nbsp;each.</p> User-controlled Privy — 🥸 <p>Today both schema (what data is needed) and permissions (who can access it) in Privy are set by developers. This enables them to securely take on user data without having to store it on their stack or risk data leakage through db misconfigurations or a breach of their perimeter.</p><p>While this introduces very little friction for the user, the end-goal is to enable sovereign data, by which users have full visibility and ultimately control over their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The path forward is&nbsp;simple:</p><blockquote>secure data management — &gt; permission transparency — &gt; user&nbsp;control</blockquote><p>We start with enabling developers to easily take better care of their user data and protect their users. Thereafter, we give users the tools to understand how their data is being used. This means building transparent audit logs by which users can track data accesses. Privacy is about control over data and informed consent. Let’s keep users in the&nbsp;know.</p><p>This then allows us to move to user control — enabling users to grant or revoke data access reactively.</p>A user granting data permissions to a dapp they just signed&nbsp;onto<p>User control is key to data resiliency and composability. Enabling users to break out of silos and take their data with them from app to app will unlock amazing new experiences in&nbsp;web3.</p><p>At a technical level, the journey involves the following:</p>  🖖 User-centric auth — a datastore is only as secure as its authentication is trusted. We’ve already integrated <a href="http://login.xyz">Sign-In With Ethereum</a> (SIWE) as a first example of user-centric auth whereby users authenticate with Privy directly rather than having to trust third-party auth.  🪟 User facing audit logs — better privacy policies in which you see exactly what data a company has on you and how they are choosing to use&nbsp;it.  🌍 Global namespaces for data—we need standards around user data names and namespaces so users can effectively control data across platforms. How else can we know that Uniswap and Fractional (e.g.) mean the same thing you do when they request an “address?”  🤨 Reusable UX components—reusable, open-sourced UI to enable users to set permissions as they begin sessions (you can think of iOS perms when you turn on an app) that can be audited and improved to prevent dark patterns and give users consistent experiences across apps and platforms.  💪 Data control centers—where users can easily track what services have access to what data, and revoke access as their needs&nbsp;evolve.  A sample view of the user data control center we are envisioning<p>Permissions are a major unsolved problem on the web. Data self-sovereignty means reshaping how we think through informed consent on the web and is one of the most exciting systems and product design questions we face today! This work must be built atop open standards so users are not tied to a single service provider.</p> Integrated Privy — 🤝 <p>How do we let developers do more to delight their users with less&nbsp;(data)?</p><p>Safer data will unlock whole new experiences in web3, provided it is easy to integrate into apps. The fallback for developers remains dumping data into siloed dbs. So the name of the game is to make sovereign data not just safer but more powerful and easier to integrate than its captive alternative.</p><p>We want to unlock new capabilities for devs without requiring them to become domain experts or build in increasingly complex&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>This epic revolves around the following:</p>  🔗 Native web3 integrations — Integrating with web3 wallets directly to use self-sovereign cryptographic materials; integrating with smart contracts to react to on-chain events (to trigger notifications or auditable permissions changes) and write attestations to the chain (to write integrity proofs on-chain and make permissions delegation resilient).  🥩 Bridging web2 data — Integrating meatspace (real world) data into the web3 experience means being able to process it with web2 tools when needed. This means integrations with sendgrid, twilio, docusign to bridge on-chain experiences with off-chain rails.  🛠️ Use of better primitives — Privy must be modular and upgradable so it can make the most of cryptography as primitives improves. Integrations with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">ZKPs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem">TSS</a> will enable us to improve system auditability without compromising on&nbsp;privacy.  <p>As we start down this path, we’ve built Privy’s sendEmail() call to enable developers to send emails to on-chain address without having to pull down user&nbsp;emails.</p>The `sendEmail()` demo we’ve built&nbsp;:)  Can we improve system visibility and auditability for everyone without leaking data? Can data be processed without anyone decrypting it? Can we continually grow the set of coordinated trusted parties needed to perform actions on behalf of&nbsp;users?  <p>Web3 has spawned a renaissance in cryptographic research. Modern data systems must make use of novel cryptography in order to cut down on tradeoffs made between privacy and usability!</p><p>All of the above is predicated on opening up Privy’s core platform so developers can integrate into it themselves. You should not have to use Privy-built integrations if you do not want to. Optionality is decentralization’s complement in our quest to bring about data sovereignty. We seek to build modular tooling with strong, sane defaults for developers and&nbsp;users.</p><p>This brings us to our third&nbsp;epic.</p> Decentralized Privy — 🫥 <p>When it comes to data sovereignty decentralization is a means to an end. The end is ownership.</p><p>Real control over a system comes from having options about how to integrate it across layers of a stack. You shouldn’t have to trust Privy-built systems if you don’t want to. To that end, Privy is built for gradual decentralization.</p><p>This epic is about system architecture rather than user experience. It breaks down&nbsp;across</p>  key control and encryption management,  permissions enforcement and auditability, and  storage   🔑 Key&nbsp;control <p>Non-custodial Privy is coming. Users should control their data using the same keys they use to control their digital assets. Data pipes in web3 must be built on non-custodial rails.</p><p>This begins with a deeper integration into wallets (beyond auth) so PII is encrypted under user keys. We are excited to collaborate with wallet providers in building for a more sovereign future as key management evolves.</p> 🤝 Permissions <p>If a user encrypts their own data, who decrypts it when they’re not online? <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">We agree with Moxie</a>: people do not want to run their own&nbsp;servers.</p><p>Permissions delegation is a key part of Privy’s design. Today, Privy is your user’s data guardian: it enforces permissions on their behalf. The next phase will be to open up delegation so users can choose who enforces permissions for them. Ultimately, this means going back to the chain as the transparent backstop for permissions control (read on-chain permissions using&nbsp;TSS).</p><p>The evolution is as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>trust Privy (but verify) → choose who you trust → trust no single&nbsp;party</blockquote><p>Actionable auditability is a system invariant throughout.</p> 💾 Storage <p>Privy’s threat model today is built around data leakage, not censorship resistance. This is why we’ve started with cloud storage. It is cheap, reliable, fast.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is also subject to centralized control. You should be able to decide where you want your data stored. Privy was built modularly so the storage brick can be swapped out. This means opening up so your data can be hosted on Privy’s AWS account, another third party’s GCP instance, Filecoin, an IPFS cluster, your home machine,&nbsp;etc…</p> In conclusion: It takes a&nbsp;village <p>Now is the time to build for self-sovereignty. The web3 stack today is like the universe after the big bang: molten matter slowly shaping into planets. Tooling sets standards through usage — we believe the best privacy tooling is that which gets&nbsp;used.</p><p>Accordingly, Privy’s main goal today is to enable developers to easily build great products without putting their users at risk. With this, we are working so users take back control over their data&nbsp;online.</p><p>We cannot predict our stack’s future but we can help shape it by building delightful tooling today. Through greater transparency, intuitive controls, strong standards and integrated tooling we believe web3 will be the nexus through which users take back control over their data&nbsp;online.</p><p>If you’re building data standards in the space, <a href="mailto:hi@privy.io">holler</a>, we can’t wait to build with&nbsp;you!</p><p>If you’re as excited to shape this new stack as we are, <a href="https://hot-alphabet-53c.notion.site/Privy-Careers-b4a51920dc5548e9b0f53bd0c7c186b0">please join us</a>!

							<p>The largest slice of the <a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a> is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is selected by a poll of the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcash-community-advisory-panel/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (ZCAP).&nbsp;</p><p>The first Committee was elected in <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and has branded itself <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG). To date, the committees have approved over $5.1m in grants, and has paid out nearly $2.8m (the remaining $2.3m represents future milestone payments). As of block height 1,682,399, ZF holds over 120,000 ZEC and $2.6m of funds earmarked for major grants, and the ZEC balance grows by 0.25 ZEC with every new block (an average daily increase of 288 ZEC).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							 The Upcoming Election <p>Having served as a member of the Committee since it was first constituted in late 2020, Hudson Jameson has decided to step down. As a result, we will be holding an election at the end of June to select Hudson’s replacement.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG Committee. Members are responsible for assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications. The Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks. Members currently receive a stipend of $1,500 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC).&nbsp;</p><p>Prospective candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">governance zcg-elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining their priorities and vision for Zcash. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly as replies to their respective posts.</p><p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on 15th June 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p><p>The week commencing June 20th, ZF will host a community call. All the candidates will be invited to attend, and questions will be collected from community members in advance, via the forum. Candidates aren’t required to attend, but we strongly encourage them to do so, as it will give them an opportunity to connect and communicate with the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p><p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/expanding-the-zcap-ahead-of-the-june-2022-zcg-election/">newly-expanded Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a>, to select a single candidate to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st July 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting for one new committee member out of the pool of candidates. The candidate with the most votes will become the new ZCG Committee member. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 30th June 2023. Committee members may stand for re-election at the end of their term.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							 Conflict of Interest Policy&nbsp; <p>Prospective candidates should be aware that they are subject to a conflict of interest policy, which can be summarized as follows:</p>  Serving ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG.  A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn).  A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee.  Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF.  Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, the newly-elected Committee member will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members will be required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to this topic on the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

<p>The Cosmos technology has emerged as one of, if not the, premier solutions for new blockchains. The quality of the chains that use it is testament to its power and robustness. It has unleashed a new marvel, the Internet of Blockchains, an emergent topology of sovereign, interoperable communities on the frontier of the Community Computer revolution. Consider this technology, run in production by its many communities, to be the Body of&nbsp;Cosmos.</p><p>But Cosmos is not just a technology. From inception, Jae and I conceived of Cosmos as a <a href="https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1248847725350846469">philosophy of blockchain design</a>.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1248847725350846469">@buchmanster</a></p></blockquote><p>At the heart of Cosmos are the principles of sovereignty and interoperability — the right for communities to be sovereign over their own infrastructure and applications, and for sovereign communities to be able to peacefully interoperate with one another. This philosophy is grounded in our humility before the extraordinarily rich cultural diversity of human beings. It is a tacit recognition of the fundamental limits of our discretionary reason in organizing planetary sustainability, and yet a call to use technology as simply and as best we can to facilitate sustainable self-governance. Cosmos offers a meta political economy, one that recognizes the need for representation of different interests at different scales and for an approach to money that can <a href="https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1330600004419989518">bridge the gap from local to global and back</a>. Let’s call this philosophy the Mind of&nbsp;Cosmos.</p><p>The philosophy of Cosmos, its Mind, permeates the entire project, from the modular design of the software, to the independence of each blockchain, to the emergent topology of their interconnections, and on to the structure of the core development teams themselves. Cosmos is unique among L1 blockchains in that it has many organizations and lines of business contributing to the core software, including Interchain GmbH, Informal Systems, Strangelove, Iqlusion, Regen Network, Osmosis Labs, Confio, Orijtech, Hypha, Vulcanize, Iris, and more among a long tail of contributors. There is no one core team. The thrust of Cosmos has grown far beyond Jae and I, its original founders, both technically and organizationally. Among other L1s, perhaps only Bitcoin is like that. This makes Cosmos an incredibly unique and exciting place to build the future of blockchains as we live and breathe our values, of sovereignty and interoperability, at every level, in our pursuit to transform the landscape of decentralized organizations.</p><p>At the same time, it poses challenges. The lack of a singular centralized company led by a singular figurehead means decision-making can be more complex — but it can also be more representative and robust. The proliferation of blockchains and entities with a stake in the core development of Tendermint, the Cosmos-SDK, IBC, and the Cosmos Hub means there are more interests to align and organizational challenges to sort out. Yet, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing — it’s a sign of the long-term vitality and value of the project. This grand social experiment is propelling development forward across the entire Cosmos stack, staying true to a product market strategy that emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and generality as key to a secure, scalable, and sustainable blockchain design. The team’s current focus, across the stack, is a major infrastructure upgrade to enable another explosion of innovation around the core technology.</p><p>In Tendermint, the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/docs/rfc/rfc-013-abci%2B%2B.md">ABCI++</a> will allow chains to experiment with leading innovations, from threshold encrypted mempools to zero-knowledge proofs of execution, and more. In the Cosmos-SDK, upcoming improvements to the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-053-go-module-refactoring.md">module system</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/discussions/9182">wiring of applications</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-055-orm.md">storage abstractions</a> collectively allow much more independent experimentation and release cycles that will unlock all kinds of new possibilities to collaborate more effectively on Cosmos software development. The Cosmos-SDK is also seeing a major upgrade to the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-042-group-module.md">governance and multisig system</a> to allow much finer grained and powerful delegation of capabilities within Cosmos chains. IBC, having proven itself in token transfer across Tendermint chains, is expanding to more diverse interchain application logics like <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/faqs-about-interchain-accounts-b404f1bb9ca2">Interchain Accounts</a> and more diverse consensus engines. And the Cosmos Hub, after sacrificing itself for years at the altar of service to the wider Cosmos, will, with <a href="https://informal.systems/2022/05/09/building-with-interchain-security/">Interchain Security</a>, finally unlock its own development ecosystem and capacity to innovate in the provision of interchain services and the support of interchain organizations. The dawn of a new era for the Cosmos Hub is&nbsp;here.</p><p>The success of Cosmos, coupled with its organizational diversity, calls for a more deliberate and positive construction of our collective self-governance. One of the entities that has stepped up to provide stewardship in the midst of this complexity is the non-profit Interchain Foundation. The ICF is committed to engaging with the community more directly, providing more transparency and accountability in funding, and serving the needs of the core development teams in their own efforts to achieve sustainable self-governance.</p><p>The Cosmos Hub, too, has an essential role to play here. To date, governance on the Hub has been relatively limited, with a focus on small community spend proposals and parameter changes. Of course there have also been larger, more contentious signalling proposals about product direction, like the recent <a href="https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-69-rejected-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243">Prop69</a> around CosmWasm on the Hub. Prop69 was an incredible demonstration of how much the community cares about the future of the Cosmos Hub. But it was also an opportunity to ensure we nurture a political landscape of collaboration, trust, professionalism, and respect; a political environment where we can safely share our opinions, rigorously debate technical merits, and balance the demands of the market today against those of the market tomorrow while being excellent to one another. This is what Cosmos strives&nbsp;for.</p><p>The Cosmos Hub has a unique role to play. As a conservative chain with a long-term orientation to be an <a href="https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-69-rejected-include-cosmwasm-in-rho-upgrade/6243/30">anchor in a thrashing sea</a>, it is a center for the politics of the larger Cosmos ecosystem. But the Hub will need to step up to this role, to expand its capacity to organize and fund the core development of public goods so critical to the ecosystem. We are already seeing the ecosystem working towards this, as each sovereign team builds expertise and contributes to improving the technology, and initiatives like the new Builders Foundation get off the ground. But the opportunity to accelerate our progress through tight collaboration is enormous:</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/sunnya97/status/1528833756701900801">@sunnya97</a></p></blockquote><p>Once upon a time, many of us worked together in a single company: All in Bits, which did business as Tendermint Inc., and now Ignite Inc, or possibly NewTendermint Inc. The past and present of All in Bits is confusing. But due to strong disagreements on how an organization should be run, most of the core development team left that company in <a href="https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/2020-03-13-happy-1st-birthday-cosmos/">2019/2020</a>. However, virtually everyone that left All In Bits is still working hard on Cosmos today, leading teams and companies in a new constellation of organizations working to realize the future of Cosmos. And that future is incredibly bright.</p><p>The constellation of core Cosmos development organizations is operating on the frontier of decentralized internet services. They are experimenting with new ways to organize themselves, to collaboratively finance and develop public goods, and to push the boundaries of what is possible, both technically and organizationally. It is this collaboration of sovereign organizations, from core development teams to individual community members to anyone dedicated to the success of the Interchain, that we can rightfully call the Soul of Cosmos. It is not something we <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/25/jae-kwon-returns-to-newtendermint-to-battle-for-the-soul-of-cosmos/">battle for</a>, but something we nurture, and grow, collectively.</p><p>This constellation of organizations successfully shipped the Cosmos whitepaper with the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/28/cosmos-set-to-take-lead-in-blockchain-interoperability-with-februarys-stargate-release/">Stargate upgrade in 2021</a>. This was a <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/how-seven-teams-collaborated-to-deliver-the-biggest-software-upgrade-in-the-cosmos-universe-2288f4f9afe8">monumental effort</a>, the result of a huge cross-entity collaboration across the Cosmos technology stack to pay down past technical debt and launch a new interoperability standard that would define the future Internet of Blockchains. Thanks to that group of organizations, the <a href="https://mapofzones.com/">Internet of Blockchains</a> is emerging before our eyes. And this is just the beginning.</p><p>The Cosmos whitepaper has shipped. Sovereign Cosmos chains are seeing enormous success and usage of IBC is exploding. This new era of interoperability calls for a renewed vision of where the Internet of Blockchain goes from here — Cosmos 2.0, if you will. A vision of how we, a decentralized collective of blockchains, organizations, communities, and individuals, collaborate to build a more sustainable future — for the planet and its people. This is the task we are working on. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/the-mind-body-and-soul-of-cosmos-140ee7cec0cd">The Mind, Body, and Soul of Cosmos.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Fork your system if you want&nbsp;fork.</p><p>Aztec Connect represents the culmination of years of cutting-edge cryptographic research, signaling a new privacy paradigm for Ethereum.</p><p>As a result, we are pursuing a security-first approach to unleashing its full functionality — starting with last week’s test deployment of contracts to mainnet Ethereum and reinforced by the offer of bug bounties totaling $2 million in partnership with ImmuneFi.</p><blockquote>👾 <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-raises-bug-bounty-to-2-million-for-critical-vulnerabilities-8e42df622659">See our full Bug Bounty announcement here</a></blockquote> 🌅 A New&nbsp;Paradigm <p>Private DeFi transactions have never been done on Ethereum before. While mixers like Tornado Cash allow for the obfuscation of funds in transit from one address to another, they have not — before now — allowed for the direct encryption of generalized Layer 1 computation.</p><p>Aztec Connect changes the paradigm. It allows for arbitrary integration of Aztec’s zkRollup with any Layer 1 smart contract, bringing ironclad privacy and cost-reduction to nearly any Ethereum use-case.</p> 🍴State 0+ <p>Aztec Connect also offers myriad upgrades to system architecture and capability:</p>  Scaling the rollup to 896 transactions  Transaction-chaining for faster fund settlement  Gas savings via optimizations to our root verifier&nbsp;circuit  Multi-asset DeFi interactions  Flashbots support and integration  <p>Given the amount of technical complexity, we have decided not to upgrade the rollup’s contract on Layer 1 and instead hard fork the protocol, creating a new state root that will encapsulate all Aztec Connect transactions going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Existing zk.money payments and account balances (“old” zk.money) will remain isolated in their own state, meaning any bugs present or exploited in the former system will not carry over to the Aztec Connect release, while users who wish to retain funds on the older, battle-tested system can still use private payment functionality there during the migration period.</p> 🧳 Alias Migration <p>In the coming days, new account registrations will be paused on the existing zk.money system as we work to deploy Aztec Connect. Once the new system launches, existing user aliases will be seamlessly migrated, while access to the additional functionality of zk.money will be unlocked.</p><p>Note that only the most recent alias registered by each unique will be migrated.</p><p>Because we want to retain user aliases, the new system will start with non-zero state. Evidence that the new state contains only user alias information — and no funds or other potentially compromising data — can be proven with a simple tool we’ve built to verify the hard fork to be published as we get closer to our launch date of June&nbsp;9th.</p><p>We think the usability upgrades–speed, throughput, and DeFi integrations–are well worth the cost of migration.</p> 🎛️ Aztec&nbsp;Controls <p>As the inventors of the PLONK proving system, we believe Aztec is at the vanguard of zkSNARK innovation. Because the technology is so cutting-edge, our philosophy has been to retain contract upgradeability in order to be able to “hot fix” critical&nbsp;bugs.</p><p>We recognize this carries a measure of centralization and core team control. In the interest of full transparency, we want to present the facts faithfully. Liveness and access to the Aztec system is controlled by two multisignature wallets:</p>  A 4-of-7 administrative multisig that controls Aztec’s contract upgrade&nbsp;keys.  And a 2-of-8 multisig with emergency pause functionality. When emergency pause is enabled, rollup contract functions cannot be called, allowing for incidence response in case of severe issues with the rollup contract.  <p>We expect the emergency pause multisig to be deprecated as the system proves its stability, with the administrative multisig removed over time in line with our longer-term decentralization roadmap.</p> 🪜 System Escape&nbsp;Hatch <p>Because rollup construction is still undertaken by a single central validator operated by the Aztec core team, Aztec Connect has an “escape hatch” functionality to ensure system liveness:</p><p>Every 8 hours, a two hour escape hatch window opens for anyone to send rollup proofs to Ethereum to prove transactions and facilitate user funds exiting the system. During the escape hatch window, proof constructors are under race conditions; anyone can submit a proof but it’s first-come first-serve as to which submitter is accepted.</p><p>Our rollup provider is also open-source: anyone can build their own backup rollup provider and run it on reasonable community hardware.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/tree/master/falafel">📜 See the full rollup provider repo&nbsp;here.</a></blockquote> 🚸 Transaction Limits <p>Initial deposits into Aztec Connect will be capped at 5 ETH and 10,000 DAI each, as a way to throttle deposit growth and slowly ramp up the deposit pool within this release of zk.money.</p><p>We hope that intentional growth of the depositor set will achieve a number of&nbsp;aims:</p>  Allow the most dedicated Aztec users to test our system live on&nbsp;mainnet  Grow confidence in the security of the system in a deliberate manner  Encourage white hat developers to examine our codebase in production and participate in the bug bounty with real funds at&nbsp;stake  <p>Our plan is to raise the caps according to the following timeline:</p>  Month 0 (launch): 5 ETH, 10,000&nbsp;DAI  1–3 months: 15 ETH, 30,000&nbsp;DAI  3–6 months: 50 ETH, 100,000&nbsp;DAI  <p>Users should treat this version of our smart contracts as a beta — and be aware that despite external and internal audits, this is experimental technology.</p> 🔍 Audit&nbsp;Repos <p>There are three core components that make Aztec Connect&nbsp;work:</p>  Underlying cryptography  Core rollup contracts  Bridge Contracts (community-written interfaces)  <p>As of May 26th, we have completed our internal audit of Aztec Connect’s upstream contracts and cryptography systems.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect">See our public code repo&nbsp;here.</a></blockquote><p>An external audits of the rollup smart contracts with Solidified has been returned with two minor vulnerabilities patched.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/solidified-platform/audits/blob/master/Audit%20Report%20-%20Aztec%20.pdf">See our smart contract audit by Solidified here.</a></blockquote><p>A cryptography fuzzing audit with Sentnl has also been completed and returned.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/blob/master/audits/Security%20Audit%20%20Results%20-%20Aztec%20Protocol.pdf">See the cryptography fuzzing audit by Sentnl&nbsp;here.</a></blockquote><p>External audits of the two launch integrations–Lido and Element–have also been completed. As we roll out further integrations, each will be reviewed in turn by Solidified.</p> ∴ Conclusion <p>Aztec has a unique position at the leading edge of the crypto world, deploying breakthroughs in zero knowledge to Layer 1 Ethereum. Despite this, security is our number one priority, and we will continue to build the safest, easiest to use generalized privacy solution in blockchain today.</p><p>Thank you for your ongoing support, and we can’t wait for you to use the services you love and trust, all with the safety of Aztec&nbsp;privacy.</p> 🏗 Build with Aztec Connect&nbsp;SDK <p>Are you a developer who wants to bring privacy to your favorite DeFi protocol?

Vitalik spoke about Key Management, many users were left upset at our booth (read to know more) and there were countless integrations with Web3Auth! Amsterdam Calling <p>Team Web3Auth was recently in Amsterdam participating first in Ethereum Foundation’s DevConnect and then later at ETHGlobal’s ETHAmsterdam. The venue for both events was the iconic Beurs Van Berlage, the former commodity exchange building.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1516702166353911808">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Devconnect is a week-long in-person gathering that featured independent Ethereum events, each with a unique focus. The goal was to focus on depth-first sessions rather than size, and to bring the Ethereum community together in smaller groups to talk, learn about, or make serious progress on specific subjects. ETHAmsterdam is a hackathon gathering some of the top minds building on Ethereum with integration bounties being offered by some leading entities in the ecosystem.</p> When Vitalik opened the event and we couldn’t be more&nbsp;pleased <p>The opening of the event saw Ethereum founder Vitalik share insights on various topics pertaining to different aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem including the much awaited “merge”. Vitalik also jokingly predicted that Ethereum coins would touch 12,000 in value, but he did leave the currency unspecified. However, it was his insight on the importance of private keys that particularly struck a chord with us. Vitalik emphasized social recovery, an implementation where one has the ability to share a part of their key with people they trust, which is what the vision is for the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">Auth Network</a> as&nbsp;well.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518209570648244224">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> What Happens in Amsterdam… <p>Our booth at the event caught quite some attention for its magical theme. Our team had developed a “horcrux” inspired mobile application to demo how our private key sharing infrastructure works.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1517472026239328256">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>However, the “horcrux” demo was not the only attraction athe booth. We had a special attraction at the booth that left a lot of visitors rather upset. Why is that? Find out for yourself!</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1519716765990891520">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> The Team conducted workshops… <p>Our Head of Engineering Chaitanya Potti and Sr Software Engineer Subham Rathi conducted workshops on “how to Plugin self-custodial social logins into your app/wallet via MPC with Web3Auth”. Both workshops were attended by developers who were quite surprised to know that it is possible to use social log-ins to onboard users while continuing to keep the solution self-custodial.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1517544150723350529">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/ETHGlobal/status/1517601383762907136">@ETHGlobal</a></p></blockquote> We did a UI/UX&nbsp;AMA <p>Our UX Team had offered free UX consultation for those who looked to increase their visibility and outreach. The consultancy booth was swarmed with visitors spending an average of 35 mins getting their queries patiently answered.</p> What if Elon Musk took over&nbsp;Twitter? <p>There were over 700 wonderful devs at the event and we caught them off guard with a few fun questions including what would they want Elon Musk to change about Twitter after purchasing it.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518634766572138496">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1517795743863562240">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> Web3Auth was widely integrated and we offered over $8500 in&nbsp;bounty <p>Over 700 devs submitted 165 projects in the course of the hackathon and many of these projects had integrated with Web3Auth.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518231615004106755">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518234728284966912">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> Until next time, Amsterdam! <p>All in all, DevConnect and ETHAmsterdam brought together some of the brightest minds in the Ethereum ecosystem who were acquainted with Web3Auth’s state of the art self-custodial private key management infrastructure in a fun and appealing way.</p> Stay in touch with&nbsp;Web3Auth <p><a href="http://web3auth.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">Docs</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/web3authdev">Telegram</a> | <a href="http://discord.gg/web3auth">Discord</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3auth">Linkedin</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/what-happened-ethamsterdam22-89562c5e8d18">What Happened @ ETHAmsterdam’22?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>TL;DR: ZPrize’s goal’s to help develop the zero-knowledge industry, which strongly resonates with Panther’s heart and soul. We’re joining forces to empower open-source ZK development!</p><p>Although the innovations in the zero-knowledge field have brought unprecedented advancements to online privacy and blockchain scalability, there is still much to do to continue its development. Challenges such as hyper-specialization, a lack of funding and incentives, and its relative novelty stand in the way of realizing its full potential.</p><p>However, this development is crucial for true user privacy to be reached in a Web3 context. Within the industry, the direction of the most pressing challenges is well-known; they just need to be addressed and tackled correctly due to their difficulty and innovation hurdles.</p> Joining Polygon, Ethereum, Polkadot, Mina protocol, and several other industry leaders <p>40+ leading Web3 organizations, including Aleo, Anoma, the Ethereum Foundation, Mina Protocol, Polkadot Pioneers Prize and Panther, To help solve these issues and allow the zero-knowledge industry to move forward, have partnered to organize the ZPrize competition.</p><p>ZPrize will grant more than $7M in prizes to research teams for their winning submissions on 12 <a href="https://www.zprize.io/#prizes">zero-knowledge problem categories</a>. These $7M will be divided into several individual prizes, awarded to those that engineer new algorithms and techniques that achieve performance metrics unmatched by the best zero-knowledge systems deployed in the blockchain industry today. These include solutions to accelerate zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) in mobile hardware, multiscalar multiplication on GPUs and FPGAs, and other possible relevant breakthroughs for ZKPs.</p><p>As a Silver Partner, Panther will be responsible for architecting challenges and contributing to grants awarded to teams. The first of these challenges, architected by Panther, is the following:</p> Accelerating the Poseidon hash function <p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf">Published for the first time in 2019</a>, the Poseidon cryptographic hashing algorithm is remarkably suitable for zero-knowledge applications, especially inside zkSNARKs. This challenge aims to reward the team that submits the Poseidon implementation with the fewest constraints or the lowest cost.</p><p>Poseidon is considered a state-of-the-art hash function for zkSNARKs due to its reduced use of constraints. Further improvements in its efficiency equate to less use of resources when generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs, lower gas costs for on-chain implementations, and entirely new possibilities for zero-knowledge applications in mobile and embedded devices. Participants in this challenge have to build an open-source implementation that meets a set of requirements to earn <a href="https://www.zprize.io/prizes/fast-hashing-for-zero-knowledge-applications">a prize worth USD 155,000.</a></p><p>Panther’s CTO, Anish Mohammed, expressed his enthusiasm about this challenge and the ZPrize initiative. In his words:</p><p>“The zero-knowledge field represents our best collective bet on a future in which users can be in control of their own data. This alone should be sufficient to get people excited about ZPrize, but the fact that so many different projects in the blockchain space are joining forces to support this showcases every strength of the crypto ecosystem as opposed to the traditional finance and tech worlds.”</p><p>Panther will continue to contribute to ZPrize as well as conduct open-source zero-knowledge technology research within its team.</p> About ZPrize <p><a href="https://www.zprize.io/">ZPrize</a> is a collaborative effort by 40+ partners in the blockchain industry and the broader tech space — names such as AMD, Polygon, Algorand, and Panther.

  A currency gains value from its use — call it Community Contributed Value  National currencies aggregate this contributed value and centralize the benefit to the government and adjacent&nbsp;actors  People see this, and Community Currencies have been attempted to capture this value locally, instead of sending it on to financial centers and&nbsp;capitals  Community Currency experiments have generally failed for various reasons — difficulty of creation/use, lack of transparency or auditability, moral hazard, lack of immediate convertibility, instability of value, inability to see, measure and capture Community Contributed Value  Blockchains have shown a pathway to overcome some, but not all, of these roadblocks; until now, no successful local currency projects on blockchain  A new set of blockchain protocols has emerged in the Verus Project, which is developing rent-free public blockchain infrastructure — use of these open protocols allows for low risk, low cost experiments such as Community Currencies that overcome traditional roadblocks  Without programming, a community can quickly create a made to suit local currency that is easy to use, is transparent and auditable, defeats moral hazard, allows for instant conversion into other currencies, has a stable and predictable value, and can measure and capture Community Contributed Value, to be used for the betterment of the community  Adding intelligent namespaces to Community Currencies gives the potential to experiment with additional value enhancing opportunities, creating digital goods economies attached to the Community Currency  At this time, Verus is a project where developers are focussed on the core protocols. Rolling out a Community Currency for broad use would still require some additional work on user-facing apps.   The Problem <p>Like any other good, money is ruled by the laws of supply and demand. A currency in high use requires a constant float of supply to be circulating through its system. In the case of a fiat currency, the demand for holders to hold the currency gives it its value. In other words, as users of a currency, we collectively give value to that currency by our use. For something like the United States Dollar, its value comes from use in its domestic economy, as the global reserve currency, as the petrodollar, as the primary numeraire in financial markets, as the base currency for most foreign and corporate debt, as a predominant store of value, etc. etc. If we live in the United States and we zoom in, looking at our own local community, we can see that we are providing some small fraction of value to the overall value of the USD through our community’s aggregate use and holdings. However small that might be in relation to the global forces of supply and demand, it might still be a relatively large amount of value when considered from the community’s point of view. Little work has been done in quantifying this actual value provided by a community through its demand for a prevailing currency, but new technical tools might allow us to see this more clearly through actual experience. That’s what this sample case study is about — let’s call this value created by a community, “Community Contributed Value”.</p><p>Observing this in the world today, the first thing we see is that, at the local level, we have zero control of our own Community Contributed Value, nor do we experience much, if any, local benefit from it. The aggregate of all Community Contributed Value, worldwide, is centralized in the hands of the US government. In the fiat period, as the master of the global reserve currency, the US government has proven that this aggregate value is enormous, allowing the government and country to run persistently high budget and trade deficits, and expand the money supply at will, while still maintaining a strong&nbsp;dollar.</p><p>In addition, although specific research is hard to find on this issue, it does seem as if powerful private forces that are adjacent to the United States Government, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, are conferred certain advantages through their proximity to the controller of the USD. Connected and powerful people and corporations may be, directly or indirectly, tapping into this Community Contributed Value.</p> Solutions — pre-Blockchain <p>All of this is obvious enough to have given rise to a long history of efforts to start local community currencies, to keep some of this contributed value in the community. Prior to the development of the blockchain, these efforts really seem to have been doomed from the start. Currency issuance in the paper money world is difficult to control and has huge security and moral hazard issues (counterfeit, over-issuance, etc). These currencies cannot easily be made transparent, or auditable. The funds can’t be reasonably saved or protected in banks. There is no plausible way to have readily available conversion at market rates between the community currency and the USD, nor is it plausible to keep a local currency at a stable and predictable value. For users, using community currency was hard, and for communities, making community currency was hard — and so, except for a handful (or less), every effort ran&nbsp;aground.</p> Solutions — in the Dawn of the Blockchain Era <p>Interest in community currencies perked up in the blockchain era, as it became clear that auditable, transparent tokens could be created at will (eg. ERC-20s), and the tokens could be securely stored and controlled through digital wallets. Bitcoin itself is an example of a type of community contributed value, where demand to use and hold gives it its value, to the benefit of a worldwide virtual community of early adopters. Ease of creation and use has been enhanced as against paper currencies, at least for the technically adept. Still, no longstanding successful cases of broad local community use have emerged. In fact some, such as CityCoins, have been notorious failures.</p><p>It seems that auditability, transparency and digital wallets are not enough. Other key issues&nbsp;are:</p>  community currencies still require some sophisticated engineering capability to implement  there is no method for easy, reliable convertibility into the prevailing fiat currency, nor can conversion rates hope to be predictable or stable, even in the short&nbsp;term  there is no easy way to safely and measurably capture the Community Contributed Value  there are no additional enhancements to community or the currency through attached digital goods and a new digital goods&nbsp;economy   New Solutions — Bancor; Verus, public blockchains as a&nbsp;service <p>It is likely that, were these problems solved, and ease of digital wallet use addressed (along with personal privacy), motivated communities would find it far easier to bootstrap use of a community currency {“CommCurr”}. Imagine being able to spend your CommCurr anywhere in the community, from the babysitter to the gas station to the bank, and have it accepted with ease because the recipient knows that they can convert it easily and immediately, and without a counterparty, at the push of a button, to the USD, on a 1:1 basis (or very near thereabouts). And if community members could measurably observe the amount of Community Contributed Value that was emerging through widespread and persistent use, CommCurr would be easy to promote, and hard to&nbsp;resist.</p><p>One of the best efforts to deal with convertibility in community currencies is the project Bancor. They pioneered onchain reserves as part of a currency’s definition, dynamically expanding and retracting supply, tied to use, and the ability to convert directly to and from other currencies, using locked onchain reserves as a fractional backing. This proof of concept has existed since the first version of Bancor, as a smart contract capability on Ethereum. For any community, each particular implementation of a smart contract would need to be designed, engineered and audited by experts, in this case Bancor developers. But Bancor is a heavily funded venture business at root, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an ICO. Development of community currencies doesn’t pay, unlike commercially-driven defi, so Bancor soon abandoned any focus in this&nbsp;area.</p><p>At about the same time as Bancor emerged, former Microsoft fellow Michael Toutonghi, and some associates, released a vision paper focused on making public blockchain infrastructure that can be used by the world. Inspired by bitcoin’s approach to re-imagining money, they aimed for the development of usable blockchain primitives that could form the basis of distributed network applications that provide people a real chance of self-sovereignty and new ways to self-organize in many areas of&nbsp;life.</p><p>They began developing software and protocols, basing off Bitcoin and Zcash, and bootstrapped a worldwide network of self-interested miners and stakers who power a network that is capable of providing public blockchain infrastructure. Fast forward five years, and a good portion of the network has been running for years, providing the first parts of the system. Now, the rest of the full vision (and more) is about to transition from testnet to mainnet, and new capabilities for blockchain are about to become publicly available, including the ability to run advanced Community Currency experiments that are virtually risk-free for communities, can be carried out at low cost, and have several elements that will make them attractive and safe for broad community use.</p><p>Two key points to note about the Verus protocols, software and network&nbsp;are:</p>  no venture capitalists or investors have been involved in its financing or development, so there is no need to extract rent or payment from users to pay back investors — it is rent-free technology, the only payments necessary are network fees to provide sufficient incentive for outsiders to provide their compute resources to power the network;&nbsp;and  Verus does not use smart contracts — it is based on more traditional and longstanding distributed computing paradigms, and users access the software for basic primitives, which they then put into use and combine however they see fit. No contract programming or special blockchain engineering skill is required to carry out sophisticated actions. Recently, on the Verus testnet, one community member (a non-programmer) implemented a powerful community currency example in less than ten minutes with a few simple commands.   Currency Reserves — Convertibility <p>Verus provides the ability to define new tokens/currencies at will, without programming. Various options are available, as tokens carry a multitude of possible uses, from voting to tickets to currencies. For community currency experiments, one of the key options is to lock in reserves that are attached to, and back the value of, the newly issued currency. And, since Verus is bridgeable to and from the Ethereum network, you could back a new currency with ethereum or USDC or any other valuable currency from that&nbsp;network.</p><p>If a CommCurr is defined with reserves backing it, then users can freely mint new currency by converting their USDC, for example, directly to CommCurr. This would build up the locked reserves of CommCurr. Or, they could go the other way around, converting CommCurr into USDC immediately by converting it into its reserves, without any need to find a counterparty. This would reduce the locked reserves. The conversion rate in these situations is driven by Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, similar to Uniswap, although providing a MEV-resistant fair conversion experience for all users at the lowest possible&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Reserve backing in the Verus protocols is user-selected upon the creation of a currency, ranging from a 5% backing to a 100% backing, Multiple currencies, with arbitrarily selected weights can be used. There is a requirement to use the Verus coin as at least one of the currencies backing CommCurr, or any currency — it needs to represent at least 5% of the backing. This is due to interoperability goals, to ensure that networks built using the Verus protocols stay connected, as a worldwide network of value, where currencies connect to each other throughout.</p><p>These few simple options make for a host of use cases, which will not all be explored here. Instead, we’ll focus on CommCurr and note that a decent implementation might have backing consisting of two currencies — USD (represented by USDC bridged from the Ethereum network), and Verus, weighted 95:5 in favor of&nbsp;USD.</p><p>As a result of having valuable reserves, CommCurr is guaranteed to be valuable, and users can instantly convert in and out of it by simply sending it to themselves, or another person, choosing a conversion option. If a user sends USD and receives CommCurr then the reserves for USD will go up, and two things will happen to CommCurr — it will issue a little bit of new supply, and its value will go up. On the other hand, if a user goes the other way, sending CommCurr for USD, then some CommCurr supply will be automatically burned, and the value of CommCurr will decrease a little. In other words, CommCurr has a dynamically expanding and retracting supply, and a floating conversion rate, depending on the demand for the currency.</p> Capturing the Contributed Value <p>When creating CommCurr the best way to capture value for the community will be to create the currency so that it is only partially backed. For this sample case study, let’s say it’s backed at 80%. A community can easily engineer this precise amount of backing (which never changes, as a percentage, through the life of the currency) by choosing an initial supply of CommCurr, say 1 million, and then contributing 760,000 USD as reserves, and 40,000 dollars worth of Verus as reserves. We’ll avoid going into detailed mechanics here but the result would be that, upon the launch of the currency, the community currency issuer would own 1,000,000 CommCurr, which is 80% backed by real value, but is convertible, as its initial price to acquire or to sell, 1:1 with the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>Now, as we described above, if the issuer just starts converting their initial holdings of CommCurr (1 million units) into USD, they’ll start depleting the reserves and driving down the value of the currency. In fact, if they just dumped it all, they’d get all their initially contributed reserves back and the currency would be rendered virtually worthless. So, instead of doing that, they’ll encourage use by the community. Perhaps they’ll simply promote its use, or maybe they’ll offer small discounts on community services, and encourage others to do so, to bootstrap use. The overall idea would be to encourage use by the community at large. If use emerges, and people start to acquire the currency (by contributing USD into the reserves), and the issuing community does not sell any of its initial holdings, the value of CommCurr will begin to creep up (provided that not all of this currency is immediately converted back by the recipients). Under these circumstances, It should be easy enough for community members to become comfortable with the value of CommCurr, as they see that it can always be acquired and disposed for USD, immediately, and at a predictable and stable price. It’s important to note that if the issuing community doesn’t sell/convert any of its holdings it is *impossible* that the value of CommCurr would fall below its initial value of 1:1 vis-a-vis the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>If regular use persists, there will be constant demand for the currency and a certain float will begin to remain in circulation. In our example, let’s say the community reaches the point where 100,000 CommCurr is more or less always outstanding, in some form of transit circulating through, or being held by, the community. This would tend to increase the value of CommCurr some amount. But, instead of allowing the currency to appreciate, the Community could begin to draw down on some of the 1,000,000 of initial supply that it holds in its reserves. In fact, in this example, they’d need to convert 100,000 of that supply into USD just to keep the price pegged 1:1 with the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>So now we would have an exact measure of Community Contributed Value — in this case it’s 20% of $100,000 = $20,000. If the demand in the community created a persistent float of $1 million, the issuer could draw down their entire supply converting it into USD, and it would still be backed at its original amount, and still be convertible 1:1 with&nbsp;USD..</p> No Free Lunch (well, maybe a free appetizer) <p>Did the issuer just make $1 million? No. Remember they had to commit $800,000 of value in the first place to set this up. And, although that investment is never at risk (they can always just convert everything into the reserves at any time to recoup them), there is a certain upfront capital cost there. However, they did clearly make $200,000, which, in this case would be a measurable amount of Community Contributed Value that they captured. There are also some minimal network costs to set this up on the Verus network, which is paid to the miners and stakers, as block rewards, for mining the Verus blockchain, and powering all the community’s transactions. At current rates, it would amount to less than $200. Overall, the cost/risk/reward matrix is attractive.</p><p>It is important to remember that all of this is transparent and auditable, being on a public blockchain. Community members would be in instant possession of all relevant information about currency supplies, reserves, spending, conversion, etc. by the CommCurr creators.</p><p>Community members would have transparency on their spending too, which is unfortunate. However, as a fork of zcash, Verus does offer private transactions on its native currency, Verus, and so there would be methods for users (or preferably, their apps) to help protect the spending privacy of community members.</p> Governance <p>There are other blockchain primitives that Verus enables which enhance CommCurr as an attractive and low-risk method to create Community Contributed Value. First, the protocols allow for virtually unlimited flexibility with respect to the governance of who is in control of the initial holdings of CommCurr. Multiple signatures could be required, up to, for example, 13 of 25, to authorize any spending or conversion activity. This would allow for fairly sophisticated approval mechanisms and safeguards for communities that are implementing this type of experiment.</p> Moral Hazard — Escrow <p>Another blockchain primitive is the ability to provably and irrevocably lock digital wallets for an arbitrary period of time (up to 21 years). In this way, a community issuer could reduce concerns about the moral hazard of dumping their holdings and crushing the value of a growing CommCurr. They can choose to stagger escrows, making, say, 10% freely spendable now, and then unlocking 10% a year after that. One aspect to consider is that, if a lock is made irrevocable, it will build in capital cost risk for a community. Ie. if the experiment is a failure and there’s no adoption, they wouldn’t have access to their original capital until the unlock period&nbsp;passes.</p> Wait, There’s More — Enhancing the Community Currency through New Capabilities for a Digital Goods Economy that Directly and Tangibly Benefits the&nbsp;Currency <p>Possibly the most forward-thinking element of a Community Currency is the ability to build a real digital goods economy around it. The Verus protocols make this possible through the issuance of what are called SubIDs. SubIDs are multi-use friendly name “identities”. Community members can register these names by paying a set amount of CommCurr, for example, 10 CommCurr per registration. This increases the value of CommCurr because any amounts paid for the “identities” are burned, thus increasing the value of the currency for all holders thereof (including the original&nbsp;issuer).</p><p>Community members might seek to register identities for many&nbsp;reasons:</p>  to signal support for the community  to have a recognizable or branded community-oriented name to receive funds, eg. “member.CommCurr@”  to create a NFT or public profile attached to the name (“identities” are capable of being expressed as nfts, artwork, public profiles, etc.)  to be a ticket for an event or a discount code for purchases, or a membership in a&nbsp;club  To be attached to a physical item, like a community landmark, where it can represent a public profile or description, fundraiser, message board,&nbsp;etc.  <p>These are just some of the virtually unlimited examples of digital goods that could be created, all of which would require CommCurr to acquire, this creating a real demand for the currency.</p> Conclusions <p>These are new blockchain capabilities. They do not currently exist on Ethereum or other smart contract blockchains because the interplay of such different elements would seem to create overwhelming complexity, requiring the use of multiple inter-operating contracts to implement. Certainly, such comprehensive and flexible solutions could not be carried out in minutes through the use of a few simple commands.</p><p>Currently, all of these capabilities exist in the Verus protocols and are in use on testnet. A mainnet activation is imminent, and communities can soon start to experiment, at the smallest initial scales they desire. It’s important to note, however, that additional software development would be required to make some of these elements easy and safe to use for the broader community. As a FOSS project, Verus encourages communities to work together, and with the Verus developer community to create open source apps that leverage the protocols, so that all communities worldwide can benefit from the resulting development.</p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discuss and explore all Verus has to offer on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/community-currencies-a-case-study-to-explore-new-technical-possibilities-ede897433b55">Community Currencies: A Case Study to Explore New Technical Possibilities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We are at the beginning of a new frontier in biology and medicine unparalleled in human history. Scientific advances like the latest generation of CRISPR, new computational methods, entirely new cell and gene therapies, cell-free synthetic biology and breakthroughs we cannot even imagine today will unlock the applications and treatments of the future. At the same time new technology / tooling is changing the biology game along a few vectors: i) cost ii) ability to program, simulate and iterate and iii) entrepreneurial accessibility.</p><p>BlueYard’s strategy around biology is based on the premise that humankind’s ability to engineer biology will not only fundamentally transform how we diagnose, treat, and manage disease, but also reinvent how we produce new materials and the food required to support human life and sustain our planet. This includes biotechnology, therapeutics, advanced diagnostics, precision medicine and genomics, as well as synthetic biology, which has the ability to revolutionize the production of advanced materials and ingredients (i.e., alternative proteins, textiles, fertilizers, energy, flavors&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>As a <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/an-evolution-blueyards-v2-thesis-a-new-website-gm-new-york-84080f7b191d">thesis driven firm</a>, BlueYard views the biology companies, networks and protocols we invest in as key parts of a broader fabric of future systems for a more decentralized, sustainable and empowered future. We plan to continue to apply this core thesis in health, life sciences and synthetic biology (e.g. <a href="https://www.bit.bio/">Bit.Bio</a>, <a href="https://biofidelity.com/">Biofidelity</a>, <a href="https://www.chemify.io/">Chemify</a>, Clock Bio, <a href="https://www.meatable.com/">Meatable,</a> <a href="https://origin.bio/">Origin.bio</a>, <a href="https://www.rarebase.org/">Rarebase</a>, <a href="https://www.zafrens.com/">Zafrens</a>), but also beyond to areas such as breakthrough engineering efforts (e.g. <a href="https://marvelfusion.com/">Marvel Fusion</a>, <a href="https://seeqc.com/">Seeqc</a>, <a href="https://vsparticle.com/">VSParticle</a>, <a href="https://freedomfi.com/">FreedomFi</a>), crypto protocols (e.g. <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle</a>, <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a>, <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/forta-a-decentralized-solution-to-keep-the-open-economy-safe-285d4d4a01a4">Forta</a>) and new economic operating systems (e.g. <a href="https://centrifuge.io/">Centrifuge</a>, <a href="https://dance.co/">Dance</a>, <a href="https://pitch.com/">Pitch</a>,&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>We are excited to be opening a fellowship program within BlueYard dedicated to programmable biology. This is designed to be a 3–6 month program, as a 4 to 6 hour per week engagement, for emerging scientists seeking exposure to venture capital. At the core of BlueYard is the belief that venture capital is a product for entrepreneurs, and if you are inspired by working with an intellectually curious, small and value-driven team, we want to hear from you. We are looking for individuals who can stake a claim at the intersection of these multiple evolving fields in human health and biology and bring a holistic view to make sense of how nature inspired technologies can transform the fundamental well-being and longevity of every human being on our&nbsp;planet.</p> As a visiting fellow you&nbsp;will:   Help to identify the key computational biology and biological engineering platforms we should be thinking about as we continue to expand our strategy in the&nbsp;space  Work closely with the team in helping us find the best, and most entrepreneurial scientists in Europe, as well as evaluating potential investment opportunities  Support us in growing the entrepreneurial ecosystem across Europe, and build awareness of BlueYard in your research/academic hub  Work with the BlueYard team in migrating breakthrough science from the lab to a commercial entity  Have the opportunity to be immersed in the inner workings of a venture capital firm, and to take part in shaping the future of our fellowship program   Here’s what we’d like you to bring to the&nbsp;table:   A strong understanding of and passion for the natural sciences ((biology, chemistry, medicine, physics or similar), synthetic biology, and/or life sciences Self-(fire)starter — be able to run on your own, prioritize without much&nbsp;guidance  The ability to clearly articulate thoughts and opinions about markets, companies and technology, both in written and spoken&nbsp;form  Strong interpersonal skills — happy to work extensively within the team and with entrepreneurs  Native (or close to) English language skills both written and&nbsp;oral  The willingness to roll up your&nbsp;sleeves  <p>If you are interested in the position please send your CV to team@blueyard.com with the subject “Venture&nbsp;Fellow”</p>

All you need is some NYMs (enough for the transfer and fees), <a href="https://wallet.keplr.app/#/dashboard">Kepler</a> and <a href="https://metamask.io/download/">Metamask</a> browser extensions.</p><p>NYM native &lt;&gt; Gravity bridge &lt;&gt; NYM&nbsp;ERC-20:</p>  Go to <a href="https://spacestation.zone/">spacestation.zone</a> on your desktop or laptop&nbsp;browser  Select Nyx from the dropdown menu for Source and Gravity Bridge for Destination addresses.  <p>3. Assuming you already have a Kepler wallet with Nyx and Gravity Bridge chains added in there -&gt; Connect your Source and Destination addresses to their corresponding Nyx and Gravity addresses in your Kepler wallet. You will be prompted to log in to Kepler and approve the connections. Once done you will see your addresses showing up like&nbsp;below.</p><p>4. Next from the Select Token dropdown menu select&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Now we can transfer our NYMs from the Nyx chain to Gravity for further transferring them to the Ethereum chain. This requires having enough NYMs in your Kepler wallet for the transfer itself and extra for the transaction fees (if you don’t have NYMs in your Kepler wallet make sure to transfer some from your <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">NYM&nbsp;wallet</a>)</p><p>5. Type in the amount you want to transfer and make sure to leave some for transaction fees. Then click on Transfer to confirm. You will be prompted by your Kepler wallet to approve the fee for this transaction, select Average and click Approve. Your transfer will be queued up to be relayed on the Gravity&nbsp;bridge.</p><p>Once your NYMS are relayed onto the Gravity bridge and show up in your Kepler wallet, we can transfer them from Gravity to Ethereum using the same process but this time by connecting to Metamask. First make sure you have the NYM contract added to your Metamask address. To do that, go to <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x525A8F6F3Ba4752868cde25164382BfbaE3990e1">NYM token tracker on Etherscan</a> and under Profile Summary click on the More button and then select “Add Token to Metamask (Web3)”&nbsp;option.</p><p>6. Select Gravity Bridge chain from the dropdown menu for Source and Ethereum for Destination. Connect your Metamask to the Spacestation wallet and type in the amount you want to transfer.</p><p>Depending on how much you have in your wallet to pay for the bridging fee you can select the speed of your transaction. Once you confirm the transfer, you can check the status of the transaction on the Gravity side on <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/gravity-bridge">Mintscan</a> by searching for your Gravity address and scrolling down to transactions. If successful your NYMs will show up in your Metamask&nbsp;address.</p><p>Now to bridge NYM ERC20 asset to NYM native, follow the exact same process as above but in the reverse order. That is NYM ERC-20 &gt; Gravity bridge &gt; NYM&nbsp;native.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/spacestation-wallet-now-supports-nym-e9348af0c02a">Spacestation wallet now supports NYM!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Wednesday, May 25, 2022 – Lagos, Nigeria – AfrofutureDAO and Brave are excited to announce a partnership to amplify African creators to the global Web3 community.</p>
<p>Brave and AfrofutureDAO will iterate on a series of creator NFT pilots, with the aim of generating novel Web3 case studies that amplify African creators through Brave’s privacy-preserving ad platform with a large, crypto-friendly addressable user base, and native Web3 wallet. AfrofutureDAO was incubated as a part of <a href="https://afrofuture.medium.com/announcing-afrofuture-35ab4ab3c1c2">Seed Club’s 2nd cohort</a> and was instigated by Osinachi, Andrew Berkowitz, and Salim Amin.</p>
<p>The DAO provides NFT creation and distribution services for the emerging African NFT and metaverse economy. AfrofutureDAO aims to be an accelerant for African artists, cultural institutions, and creative industries to successfully enter into Web3. With partners like Seed Club and the Museum of Crypto Art, AfrofutureDAO aims to grow a Web3 distribution platform to help African voices to reach the global stage in Web3.</p>
<p>The partnership will kick off on May 30th when artists from the 3rd cohort of commissioned African creators will drop their NFTs. Brave will promote the drop via a series of digital activations, Sponsored Images, and push advertising on its ad platform. Brave has over 55 million monthly active users and over 1.5 million certified Creators.</p>
<p>“Africa has lost a lot of digital opportunities in the past. With Web 3.0, it’s time to make up for what was lost, and that’s what Afrofuture seeks to inspire,” said Osinachi, Core Instigator at AfrofutureDAO and Africa’s leading crypto artist. “The DAO is leading the way in positioning Africa for what it should gain through the blockchain.”</p>
<p>“Brave is excited to be partnering with AfrofutureDAO and using Web3 to drive awareness for creators in Africa. Web3 is a global movement, empowering people by fundamentally improving how value is exchanged on the Web,” said Luke Mulks, Vice President of Business Operations at Brave. “As a user-first platform that onboards millions onto Web3 and the attention economy with the Basic Attention Token (BAT), Brave looks forward to working closely with AfrofutureDAO on this drop and in future work where we can add value for people in their regions.”</p>
<p>To date, AfrofutureDAO has generated 36.45 ETH across 2 NFT auctions. The DAO organizes a flagship quarterly NFT drop week where they drop 5 history NFTs and 5 still photographs from African history. By increasing these drops, AfrofutureDAO is establishing a sustainable community-owned launchpad for African cultural media.</p>
<p>African artists can apply to join the Afrofuture creator commissioning program which runs in a cohort model. The DAO is currently a team of 8 core team members with 91 active token holders and are continuing to chart a path towards becoming a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization, powered by the Afrofuture token.</p>

 About AfrofutureDAO 
<p>AfrofutureDAO is a Community DAO, launched as a part of Seed Club’s 2nd cohort, on a mission to fully unlock the value of Africa’s history and creative industries in Web3. We do this through curated NFT drop weeks, bespoke metaverse events for African brands, and 1/1 commissioning of Africa’s top creators.</p>

 Your StarkWare Account’s Security now available on&nbsp;Web2 As the wave for self-custodiality gathers momentum, Web2 applications can now allow users to use their StarkWare identities as an authentication mechanism. About StarkWare: <p>StarkWare develops STARK-based solutions for the blockchain industry.</p><p>StarkEx, is a standalone permissioned scaling engine that already powers few of the biggest applications such as dYdX, Sorare, Immutable, DiversiFi and&nbsp;Celer.</p><p>StarkNet is a decentralized permissionless STARK-powered L2 ZK-Rollup over Ethereum, that supports general-computation based on the Cairo language.</p> What is the StarkWare Curve and why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>An account on any blockchain can be thought of as an identity that persists across applications on a blockchain. Ethereum has two account&nbsp;types:</p><p>Externally-owned accounts (EOAs) which can be controlled by anyone who holds the private&nbsp;keys</p><p>Contract — a smart contract deployed to the network, controlled by&nbsp;code.</p><p>All accounts in StarkNet are abstract accounts enabled by contracts.</p><p>Token Transfers in Abstract Accounts work as follows&nbsp;:</p><p>- If someone sends a token to your account, they interact with the token contract to change the recorded owner from their address to your&nbsp;address.</p><p>- The contract then performs a check that the identity that made the transfer is recorded as the current owner of the&nbsp;token.</p><p>With abstract accounts, the address is what matters and not the signature.</p><p>A StarkNet user will still have an address that can be shared publicly so that someone can send a token to that address. The user still has a wallet with private keys that are used to sign transactions. The difference is that the address will be a contract. The contract can contain any&nbsp;code.</p> An Account Design on StarkWare <p>- A&nbsp;owner</p><p>- Verification of ownership using a STARK signature, Ethereum Signature, or simply a key&nbsp;pair.</p><p>- The ECDSA Signature algorithm using the native StarkNet&nbsp;curve.</p><p>For higher efficiency, the Public key for StarkNet must be produced from the private key using a curve that is different from the Ethereum curve. This is where the STARK curve enters the&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Why Does the Ecosystem Need a Sign-in With StarkWare?</p><p>Almost everybody in crypto knows the importance of self-custodiality by now. To a large extent, Web3, led by behemoths such as StarkWare has managed to do what for long seemed unimaginable — shifting the dynamic of ownership from large entities to the end-user. When we say ownership, we mean ownership of your assets, your data, and even your identity. It is impossible to deny that traditional Web2 entities have done a fantastic job in making the user experience incredibly intuitive and consequently onboarding humanity onto the Web. However, it has also come at a cost — the cost of privacy and security.</p><p>Security hacks even among the biggest names in cybersecurity are increasingly and scaringly common. Of course, the ads one is exposed to on a daily basis on their device should be testimony to the fact that there is excessive tracking and monetization of the users’ activity. Today, the average user is fed-up with these compromises and has major trust issues. Do check our recent <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">announcement about the Auth Network</a> and its roadmap to address this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>When the Ethereum Foundation announced Sign-in With Ethereum(SIWE), it was only a matter of time until somebody extended SIWE to other&nbsp;chains.</p> Sign-in With StarkWare — You Own Your&nbsp;Identity <p>Right since its inception, the Web3Auth team has always been committed to making self-custodiality mainstream and after a series of announcements in this direction over the last few weeks, we are happy to share another milestone — Sign-In with StarkWare.</p> What is Sign-In with StarkWare and what does it&nbsp;solve? <p>Sign-in with StarkWare brings in the trust-free security of on-chain authentication to Web 2 which means that starting today, any user can log in to a Web2 application simply using their StarkWare account.</p> What Problem Does Sign-in With StarkWare Solve? <p>Additionally, Sign-In With StarkWare solves the following:</p> For Developers: <p>Ease of use: Our <a href="https://siwst.web3auth.io/">documentation</a> will show you, step by step, how to build a Log in with StarkWare flow and also clearly outline how to get the Login with StarkWare flow working, end-to-end.

<p>Brave Software, makers of the privacy-preserving Brave browser, and Guardian, makers of Guardian Firewall + VPN, have extended their partnership to integrate <a>Brave Firewall + VPN, powered by Guardian</a> into the Brave Android app.</p>
<p>This partnership enables the fastest, safest, most private full-device coverage on Android. This follows the Firewall + VPN for the <a>Brave iPhone and iPad</a> browser apps; Brave is helping even more users encrypt and protect their browsing data, across the two most widely used mobile platforms.</p>

 System-wide security for $99.99 per year 
<p>Starting with today’s 1.39 version, Brave users can easily purchase the service from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser">Play Store</a> and instantly bring full-device security to every app on their phone. The firewall and VPN service works system-wide, not only in Brave for Android, but also in any other app that users have on their Android device, protecting users from data, location, and email beacon tracking.</p>
<p>This premium feature delivers more functionality than standard or free VPNs, and gives users network-level protection over unwanted surveillance for $9.99 USD per month or $99.99 USD per year. The VPN subscription can be used on up to 5 Android devices, as long as each has the Brave browser installed.</p>
<p>“Brave is about helping users protect their data on their devices where it originates, and we’re thrilled once again to partner with Guardian to offer our Android users our Firewall + VPN solution, since this has been a popular request,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “Enabling our Android users to protect their devices at the network level is part of our mission to put users and their privacy first, particularly as more and more Android apps embed third party trackers that surveil those apps’ users.”</p>
<p>“The team at Guardian is very excited to work with Brave to deliver a system-wide Firewall + VPN experience on the Android platform, leveraging WireGuard technology to encrypt user connections, and our best-in-class custom firewall tech to efficiently block nasty app-based data and location trackers,” said Will Strafach, CEO at Guardian.</p>
 
    
    
    
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    
        
        
    
    
    
    
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    
        
        
    
 

 Enhanced security and privacy 
<p>Unlike many other browsers—where the VPN masks only the user’s IP address—Brave Firewall + VPN offers that address masking, as well as enhanced security and privacy by encrypting and protecting anything a user does while connected to the Internet. It also prevents unauthorized tracking, blocks ads, and encrypts all traffic from the device. Brave Firewall + VPN sends a user’s Android traffic through an encrypted VPN to Guardian’s servers, allowing them instantly to spot which apps are secretly broadcasting tracking data, and to block the offending activity while ensuring apps work as intended. It also allows users to select a local server to connect to, improving both performance and speed.</p>

 Unique authentication system 
<p>The unique Brave Firewall + VPN authentication system is designed specifically not to require use or retention of any user information. Instead, a pseudonymous digital receipt from the Play Store is used to enable VPN access to users, and randomized, rotated identifiers are used to connect to VPN servers. This brings VPN server access to paying subscribers in a manner that does not require Brave or Guardian to be aware of a user’s identity.</p>
<p>The Firewall + VPN for the Brave Android app will be actively rolling out in the Play Store to all geographies over the next several days, and is available for Android 8 devices and up. Availability of this feature is expected in the next several months for the Brave desktop browser, and Brave iOS users can purchase the service from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brave-web-browser/id1052879175?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">App Store</a>.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 
 

 About Brave 
<p>Brave Software’s fast, privacy-oriented browser, combined with its blockchain-based digital advertising platform, is reinventing the Web for users, publishers, and advertisers. Users get a private, speedier Web experience with much longer battery life, publishers increase their revenue share, and advertisers achieve better conversion. Users can opt into privacy-respecting ads that reward them with the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a frequent flyer-like token they can redeem or use to tip or contribute to publishers and other content creators. The Brave solution is a win-win for everyone who has a stake in the open Web and who is weary of giving up privacy and revenue to the ad-tech intermediaries. Brave currently has over 55 million monthly active users and over 1.5 million Verified Publishers. Brave Software was co-founded by Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla (Firefox), and Brian Bondy, formerly of Khan Academy and Mozilla.</p>

<p>Further cross-chain utility for Brave Wallet and BAT includes new partnerships with Ramp and Magic Eden</p>
<p>Brave’s goal is to make Web3 accessible to all. Our privacy-first browser—and browser-native crypto wallet—offer both an easy Web3 onramp for crypto novices, and a robust suite of Web3 tools for advanced users.</p>
<p>With Brave’s <a>1.39 desktop release</a>, we’re announcing our first steps towards full integration with the Solana ecosystem. By partnering with <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>, Brave enables users to explore Web3 with significantly lower transaction fees and <a href="https://analytics.solscan.io/public/dashboard/8d888828-baae-47b9-948b-d087e5de1411#theme=night">faster</a> processing times than the Ethereum network. In the coming months, this partnership will also enable seamless access to a thriving and growing ecosystem of <a>decentralized apps (DApps)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;With 1.39, Brave Wallet users can:</p>
 
 Buy, sell, and store both Solana (SOL) and fungible Solana tokens (SPL) in Brave Wallet 
 Buy SOL and other cryptocurrency with fiat via <a href="https://ramp.network/">Ramp</a> 
 
<p>And <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token (BAT)</a> holders can:</p>
 
 Use BAT on the Solana chain wrapped via Wormhole, and on chains compatible with <a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a> and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) 
 
<p>We also wanted to share a preview of our upcoming plans:</p>
 
 BAT holders will be able to buy and sell NFTs on Magic Eden, the largest community-first NFT-based web3 ecosystem 
 Brave Wallet will support DApps on Solana on desktop 
 

 Brave Wallet and BAT integrated with Solana 



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Brave’s deep integration with the Solana blockchain, <a>first announced in November of last year</a>, will make it easier for those new to crypto to onboard to Web3, and increase utility for more seasoned users. Solana has some of the lowest gas fees and fastest performance of any blockchain. By integrating with Solana, Brave (and Brave Wallet) is expanding multi-chain support and possibilities for all users.</p>
<p>Release 1.39 brings our first set of features within this integration, allowing Brave users to send, receive, and store Solana and <a href="https://spl.solana.com/token">Solana Program Library (SPL) tokens</a> directly in Brave Wallet. We’ve also <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">bridged BAT onto the Solana network, making it an SPL token</a> that users can leverage in the Solana ecosystem.</p>
<p>Brave will continue to deepen this integration in the near future, leveraging Solana as the default network for Brave Wallet and BAT, and further supporting the vibrant Solana community.</p>
<p>“Brave’s inclusion of Solana in the wallet is an important step on the path to onboarding a billion users to Web3,” said Anatoly Yakovenko, Co-Founder of Solana.</p>
<p>“As the leading Web3 browser, Brave is now providing integration with Solana’s blockchain so that users and developers can seamlessly transact on their fast, low-fee network,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “We’re also looking forward to DApp support in an upcoming release to harness Solana’s growing and thriving DApp ecosystem.”</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 Buy SOL with Ramp in the Brave Wallet 
<p>Today, Brave is announcing its integration with Ramp, offering Brave Wallet users a new option to buy cryptocurrency with fiat. Ramp offers users a fast, secure way to get crypto funds into self-custody—it’s also the first onramp partner in Brave Wallet that brings the ability to purchase crypto assets directly in the Solana network. This partnership introduces a streamlined process and affordable option for millions of Brave users to directly purchase assets from Brave Wallet for use in Solana’s thriving ecosystem.</p>
<p>Most other wallets require users to take actions across multiple platforms to complete a purchase: users have to buy crypto on an exchange, find (and double check) their wallet address, and then send the purchased crypto back to their wallet. The Brave Wallet / Ramp integration offers a way to directly buy crypto within Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>In addition to Ethereum and Solana, Ramp currently supports fiat to crypto purchases for EVM-compatible chains like <a href="https://www.avax.network/">Avalanche</a>, <a href="https://celo.org/">Celo</a>, <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a>, and <a href="https://www.bnbchain.world/en/smartChain">BNB Chain</a>. The Ramp integration also supports the ability to purchase BAT on Solana and Polygon, in addition to mainnet Ethereum.</p>
<p>“Like Brave, our mission is to serve the world with fast, convenient, and secure access to Web3. With the Ramp integration, Brave users will be able to spend more time doing what they love and less time on what was a painful process of converting their fiat currencies to crypto,” said Greg McEwan, Head of Marketing at Ramp.</p>

 Coming Soon: Use BAT to buy NFTs on Magic Eden 
<p><a>One of Brave’s 2022 goals for BAT growth</a> was to increase support for BAT / NFT utility within NFT marketplaces. Today, we’re pleased to announce our partnership with Magic Eden, the largest community-first NFT-based Web3 ecosystem. One of the key milestones in the partnership will be to enable BAT purchase support and provide BAT holders with the ability to purchase NFTs on Magic Eden’s marketplace in the coming weeks. In future releases, BAT holders will also be able to use BAT to purchase NFTs on Magic Eden through the Brave Wallet as well as other Solana DApp wallets like Phantom.</p>
<p>Magic Eden hosts the leading Solana NFT marketplace, which recently surpassed OpenSea in daily volume. With this coming integration, BAT—<a href="https://etherscan.io/tokens?sort=holders&amp;order=desc">already the 11th most distributed token on Ethereum</a>, with broad utility in other chains <a>and in real-world applications</a>—becomes even more powerful by integrating new cross-chain capabilities for BAT holders looking to purchase Solana-based NFTs on Magic Eden.</p>
<p>Sidney Zhang, Chief Technology Officer and Founder of Magic Eden, commented, “Magic Eden and Brave users are two of the most active and vibrant crypto communities in the world today. By enabling them to trade NFTs on Magic Eden with BAT, we are able to unlock new token utility for Brave’s crypto-native audience in Solana NFTs. The integration of a Solana dApp-enabled like Brave Wallet in our marketplace will further drive the ecosystem forward.”</p>

 Brave Wallet: Security and utility for all 
<p>From the start, we envisioned Brave Wallet as the secure, easy onramp to Web3, and a seamless browser wallet that removes the guesswork (and sometimes blind trust) behind installing risky crypto wallet extensions.</p>
<p>With our 1.39 release—and these deeper integrations with Solana, Ramp, and Magic Eden—we’re bringing even better performance, asset security, and multi-chain utility to Brave Wallet, along with industry-leading privacy features that put users in charge of their Web experience. Many more milestones will come when Solana DApp support becomes available in the Brave Wallet later this summer.</p>

The Open Meta DAO(™) is strong because of its community. Today we meet Michael MacLean and ask why an Open Metaverse is important.<p>Houses are a crucial component of the <a href="https://www.openmetadao.com/">Open Meta DAO</a>™, allowing free, in-depth conversations on a wealth of topics with the goal of creating an Open Metaverse that works for everyone.</p><p>The House of Human Ethics provides a space for the community to discuss how we can apply values as we build out the Open Metaverse. We caught up with Michael MacLean, a designer and member of the Open Meta DAO, to learn more about him and his vision for the future of Open&nbsp;Meta.</p><p>Tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you get involved with Open&nbsp;Meta?</p><p>While studying for my degree in fine art and design, I got really interested in immersive installations and public art, and how it intersects with urban planning. People who aren’t on the ground make decisions that make no sense for the community. I really wanted to focus on how we can do things in a better way. That’s how I’ve become this environmental designer working at the intersection of design and community.</p><p>When the pandemic hit, we couldn’t offer participation anymore — certainly not in the way that we used to. I was able to get a digital participation grant, but I didn’t have the game dev experience to make it truly immersive. I saw some adverts, did a deep dive to try and get some knowledge, and that’s how I discovered Open Meta’s Discord. I’m looking to bring my urban planning experience to the Metaverse.</p><p>What do you find interesting about the&nbsp;DAO?</p><p>Definitely the mosaic approach. I feel like that’s the joy of working like this. Everything needs to be a collaboration. If something doesn’t work out, we know for next time but removing the bureaucracy just makes it such a fun environment and something really different.</p><p>What’s your vision for the future of Open Meta, and the Open Metaverse in&nbsp;general?</p><p>Honestly, I have no idea! I’m most excited about participation and that’s really important to me for the future of this whole Web 3.0 thing. Because it’s such a collaboration, I don’t know what ideas are going to be the ones that find success in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>There’s a lot of learning that needs to happen and I’m excited to be a part of that. We can still decide what it looks&nbsp;like!</p><p>What makes you excited about Web&nbsp;3.0?</p><p>I love the sharing of knowledge — being able to learn from people and see why they make the decisions they do. Before this Web 3.0 world, that open-source approach was just unimaginable.</p><p>The open source element is really exciting. My history in youth work and my love of teaching and passing on knowledge makes my work in consulting hard. I love giving away knowledge and I want to do things because they’re good, but we have to&nbsp;charge.</p><p>In Web 2.0, people did what they did for the love of it. The Metaverse gives people the opportunity to do what they love and pass on the knowledge they have without having to sacrifice value. The exciting thing about Web 3.0 is that it can be open source and have value, all at the same time. We’ve created a space that adds&nbsp;value.</p><p>Do you have any concerns about the Open Metaverse?</p><p>I find the discourse so fascinating and I’m interested in how we can capture all of this learning. So much happens digitally and, at the moment, the information is easy to find. But how can we keep it that way? How do we record all of this information — physically and without violating privacy?</p><p>We need curators who are fair and ethical. There’s a difference between curating and gatekeeping and we need to find people who uplift and bring people in, while keeping everything high&nbsp;quality.</p><p>To learn more and to help us map and build the future of the Open Metaverse please join us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/openmeta">Discord</a> and follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenMetaDAO">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>In August, ECC shared its <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/should-zcash-switch-from-proof-of-work-to-proof-of-stake/">rationale</a> for moving Zcash from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. While most of ECC is focused on the upcoming deployment of Halo and the shielded-by-default ecosystem in the <a href="https://z.cash/support/schedule/">impending NU5 update</a>, a few of us have begun the initial research phase with a goal of producing a concrete transition proposal to the Zcash community.</p>



<p>This update describes the major areas of research and open questions we are investigating. In a subsequent post, we’ll dive deeper into the ongoing technical research and our preferences.</p>



 Research areas 



<p>ECC’s proof-of-stake research focuses on key areas that directly impact the safety, scalability, and ease of use for ZEC users. The following is a list of areas we are currently reviewing and our preferences within each area.</p>



 Research areas: 



  Shielded wallet UX &amp; security  Our focus is on maintaining existing shielded, mobile functionality.  We aim to enable shielded, mobile users to easily delegate ZEC to earn staking rewards.    Cross-chain interoperability  We prefer protocols with finality over dynamic availability to enable safer interoperability across blockchains.    Proof-of-stake security  We prefer protocols with finality over dynamic availability because we believe the economic guarantees of the former present better trade-offs for users.  We prefer minimal out-of-band costs to run block selection infrastructure to lower the cost for new validators to compete.    Issuance rate  We prefer an issuance rate strictly equal to or less than the current Zcash issuance rate, which maintains the 21M ZEC supply cap, while possibly having lower issuance in the nearer term.    On-chain governance  We prefer to enable users to easily express their preferences by coin weight in polls anyone can create.  We prefer to not enshrine coin-weighted polling to be binding on the protocol or governance layers, and instead to use this mechanism as an additional source of feedback for governance.    Reducing protocol complexity  We prefer to only support newer shielded-transfer capabilities on the target protocol, excluding t-addrs, Sprout, and Sapling transfer protocols.  We prefer to develop a regular and consistent retirement process to enable Zcash protocol to continually evolve without accruing excessive complexity.    



 Our approach: 



  We prefer to rely on a protocol that demonstrates real-world deployment success.  We prefer protocols with strong theoretical security foundations.  We prefer to make as few alterations to a protocol as possible to support Zcash.  We prefer to select a target protocol prior to developing a transition plan.  



 Research goals 



<p>Our research, like all ECC efforts, are guided by our <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/eccs-north-star-building-a-world-class-ux-for-zec/">North Star</a>: to deliver a world-class user experience for ZEC. This requires innovative wallets and user interfaces, ubiquitous commercial options for using ZEC, security and safety (encompassing everything from economic design to privacy to protocol and product security to regulatory clarity), continuous innovation to evolve with the world, and community alignment around core values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given that North Star, we have four high-level goals for proof-of-stake product research:</p>



  We aim to improve ZEC’s position as a leading private, global, permissionless cryptocurrency in the emerging Web3 paradigm, as well as extending its utility for the real-world economy.  We examine all design decisions with a lens of usability and product-market fit for existing or potential products that integrate ZEC.  If our proposal is to be adopted by the Zcash community, it must satisfy and motivate a substantial economic majority of current and potential future participants.  We aim to maintain ECC’s world-class standards for designing and deploying safe, private, resilient, permissionless protocol designs and implementations.  We aim to select the best “minimum viable” target protocol, based on the belief that future improvements can be made to the consensus protocol when necessary.  



 Next Steps 



<p>This research will ultimately produce a proposal that recommends Zcash move to a proof-of-stake protocol. This proposal could change the broader use case for the ZEC currency and place its underlying technologies at the forefront of Web3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To provide ZEC users with as much information as possible, we will be releasing a series of technical research blogs in the coming months. This will give community members a chance to provide feedback and ask questions on our approach, long before we begin developing a specific proposal.</p>



<p>By releasing our research prior to a proposal, we hope Zcash community members understand our vision for the ZEC currency, and why a change to proof-of-stake would benefit ZEC’s utility. We believe this change will create a better user experience, more utility, and more adoption for ZEC, and look forward to feedback from across the community.</p>

<p>People who hold native NYM tokens can stake those in the mixnet — contributing to privacy and earning a share of rewards by doing so. In fact, as a delegator, you play a key role in ensuring the network remains decentralised and provides good quality of&nbsp;service!</p><p>But how do you choose which mix node to delegate stake&nbsp;to?</p><p>In this post we go over the main parameters to look out for and where you can browse mix nodes so that you can start delegating.</p><p>When you delegate your NYM tokens, you are contributing to a mix node’s reputation, which increases its chances of being selected to the active set in mixnet for the next epoch. Only nodes in the active set get to mix traffic on the mixnet. This means that the higher a node’s reputation, the more “trusted” it is in the network, which means it mixes more traffic than nodes with lower reputation.</p><p>This benefits privacy overall, because it helps maintain a network with well-performing and honest nodes, but it also helps you because you will earn a share of a mix node’s rewards by doing&nbsp;so.</p> Step 1: check the mix node’s saturation <p>Make sure you check stake saturation before you delegate. For two&nbsp;reasons:</p>  You do not want to delegate to a node that has already reached 100% “saturation point”. This is the maximum stake (amount of bonded+delegated NYM tokens) a node can reach. Any added delegation beyond 100% saturation, will not yield more rewards to you or anyone else. To the contrary, they will begin to negatively affect the share of rewards to delegators of that node. So make sure to delegate your stakes to nodes which are not fully saturated, or better yet, spread your stake across multiple such&nbsp;nodes.  You want to check if the node has at least some level of stake, because delegating to low stake nodes, but especially low performing nodes will only yield minimum rewards. Also, mix nodes who put up a bigger bond themselves have more “skin in the game” and give slightly higher rewards. This is to incentivise node operators to run just one node instead of&nbsp;many.  <p>NOTE: the mixnet is very young and most mix nodes do not have much reputation yet!</p><p>So make sure you explore and support more mix nodes in this early stage. They will welcome it and likely be generous in sharing their rewards. Beyond stats such as reputation, trust is also important. If you know an active member of the community, support them and the work they are contributing to the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p><a href="https://t.me/NYMDELEGATION">Browse</a> the delegators channel to get to know more about the mix nodes you can delegate&nbsp;to.</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Join</a> our weekly community calls on&nbsp;Friday!</p><p><a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes/active">Nym mixnet explorer</a> (you can rank the mix nodes by total “Bond” which is the reputation)</p><p><a href="https://mixnet.explorers.guru/mixnodes">Node Guru mixnet explorer</a> (ranked by “total stake”, also referring to reputation)</p> Step 2: check the mix node’s performance <p>The next thing that you will want to check is the mix node’s performance: does it have good uptime? (ideally 100%); is it dropping packets? (ideally&nbsp;never).</p><p>The greater purpose of delegating NYM tokens is to ensure good Quality of Service, which is important, but the bonus is that well performing nodes are likely to receive better rewards and so also benefits your overall reward&nbsp;rate.</p><p>A node’s performance affects its likelihood of being selected to the active set, with a direct impact on profitability!</p><p>Check a mix node’s performance:</p><p><a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes/active">Nym mixnet explorer</a> (click on a node’s identity key to see performance stats)</p><p><a href="https://mixnet.explorers.guru/mixnodes">Node Guru mixnet&nbsp;explorer</a></p> Step 3: check the mix node’s profit margin&nbsp;(PM) <p>You will then want to look at the node’s profit margin. This is the percentage of rewards that a node operator will receive before sharing the rest among delegators in proportion to how much they have delegated.</p><p>Mix nodes with high profit margin means they are taking most for themselves and sharing very little with delegators.</p><p>Mix nodes with low profit margin means they are sharing most of the rewards with delegators.</p><p>But remember that profit margin is not the only thing that will determine how much you will receive! The mix nodes reputation and performance play a big role too, so you will have to balance your assessment across these three parameters.</p><p>Check a mix node’s profit&nbsp;margin:</p><p><a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes/active">Nym mixnet&nbsp;explorer</a></p><p><a href="https://mixnet.explorers.guru/mixnodes">Node Guru mixnet&nbsp;explorer</a></p> Other mix node parameters to&nbsp;consider <p>Some nodes also offer additional motivation for people to delegate to them. This could be their reliability, their reasons for being part of the Nym infrastructure and their ethos and ethics. Maybe they are donating their rewards to a good cause for&nbsp;example!</p><p><a href="https://t.me/NYMDELEGATION">Here</a> is where node operators are presenting themselves and giving a little more information about what they do and&nbsp;why.</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Join</a> our weekly community calls to #MeetTheMixnode!</p> Now that you have chosen some mix nodes, how do you delegate?   <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Download</a> the Nym wallet (or use&nbsp;CLI)  Select “Delegate”  Input Mixnode&nbsp;identity  Input how much you want to&nbsp;delegate  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZAVoCmYGNFQ">Watch</a> this video for more guidance.</p> How much can you expect in&nbsp;return? <p>Returns for delegators (APY) will vary depending on the parameters mentioned above, as well as systemic parameters, including the total supply of NYM available to stake in the network and stake saturation point.</p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-mixnet-apy-initial-simulations-for-first-quarter-139ac49d5348">Simulations have shown</a> that the early months could see APY of up to 45%, with it tailing off to an average of 7–8% as the supply and network&nbsp;grows.</p><p>More guidance and a calculator for APY is coming&nbsp;soon.</p><p>This is a blog post based on an academic paper and not an investment prospectus or financial advice. We use the term ‘APY’ in a loose generic sense, and are relying on hypothetical scenarios using experimental technology. Actual results using the technology will vary widely. It’s quite possible that this venture could result in loss of monetary funds for anyone who uses the software. Any participant in an actual network is expected to do their own research rather than relying on these simulation-based experiments.</p><p>Further reading:</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/whitepaper/">Nym whitepaper</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-cryptoecon-paper.pdf">Nym token economics</a></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/PcNGcTwlm0I">Claudia Diaz on Mixmining</a> (video)</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">Want to stake in Nym?

<p>by Dr. Anish Mohammed</p><p>The crypto ecosystem has seemingly found consensus, and it has the word “bear” written all over it.</p><p>Everyone pleads to have predicted <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/15/the-collapse-of-terra-was-devastating-but-there-is-still-hope-for-crypto/">Terra’s implosion</a>, while few can actually prove their claims. And yet, although no one can deny the systemic ripples of $UST’s demise, Bitcoin just closed its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-sees-seven-straight-weeks-111435940.html">7th week of losses</a> in a row. People were already calling a bear market; Luna’s death only helped amplify these voices.</p><p>In light of these events, it’s worth it to look at the bigger picture, leaving headlines aside for a minute to determine whether we’re heading deeper into the forest. No one can (yet) see the future, but there are several telltale signals to be found if you know where to look for bears.</p> It’s not all Terra’s fault, although it’s tempting to think so <p>Meteoric rises and dramatic falls are not unheard of in the crypto realm. You might even say they’re intrinsic to it.</p><p>It’s clear that Terra’s fall has <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/luna-investors-suicidal-after-cryptos-collapse/">taken its toll on countless investors</a>, but this should not be considered an isolated cause for the market’s troubles. Its demise is rather akin to adding gasoline to an already burning fire. It’s most likely, therefore, that our industry’s current state of fear and uncertainty is caused by three forces at play.</p> Professionalized trading and increasing speculation <p>The initial aura of amateurism surrounding crypto undoubtedly helped give it the initial charm it needed to break into the mainstream. Whereas Traditional Finance’s looked impossibly rigid, everything from dog-themed coins to saving the world from corporations seemed possible in crypto. If you’ve been around for long enough, you too have sensed this sentiment’s decline.</p><p>On the other hand, today we have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-takes-lead-in-crypto-investments-11645927004">more and better traders</a> than ever. These players also care exclusively about their P&amp;L lines rather than the ideologies supporting and surrounding their holdings. They HODL less and sport fancier, more complex trading strategies, such as two-legged positions.</p><p>Two-legged positions are essentially complex trading strategies. A “typical” strategy could be characterized as, e.g. (If Price = X, then Buy), whereas a two-legged strategy would then add a second move (such as selling if the first buy is over a 5% profit). Two-legged positions help traders secure their profits or exit positions as soon as a trend changes, but they require more active management and a short-term orientation.</p><p>With more professional short-term traders moving higher volumes and using fancier strategies, the upper volatility of the crypto markets gets severely restrained. However, in downturns, liquidations are fast to occur. Note that this is not pointing towards two-legged strategies being sole culprits of the market’s conditions, but using them as an example of sophisticated short-term trading resulting in less upper volatility than the HODLr mentality.</p> Whales dominating the game <p>If you and everyone that holds under $100k in their Ethereum wallets pooled their funds together, you’d barely collect over 5% of the available supply. (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.730122/full">Source</a>)</p><p>Remember that crypto’s professionalization made it lose a lot of its charm?</p><p>If you’ve been around for long enough in the crypto scene, you might remember memes such as “institutions are coming!!!” and seeing phrases such as “ETFs will take BTC to the moon” all over the place.</p><p>ETFs (of different types) came, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b">institutions did too</a>, and we’re theoretically closer to the proverbial moon than we were in 2013 or 2018. However, our industry didn’t quite spread to the degree a several trillion-dollar market cap at its highest would suggest.</p><p>While institutional adoption is undoubtedly necessary to propel our industry forward, one could also argue that there’s an increased concentration of wealth. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.730122/full">0.01% (6952) of all wallets control over 58% of Bitcoin’s existing supply</a>, with 1/3 of it being held by intermediaries. This is even worse for Ethereum, with the top 100 accounts (0.0002%!) holding over 35% of its supply.</p><p>The concentration of wealth in a few hands results in big market moves once these wallets decide to effect moves. And being human, whales are not exempt from making <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/third-largest-bitcoin-whale-sold-at-56k-and-bought-back-at-57k-a-day-later/">impulse trades</a>. If you recall that crypto is a heavily interwoven industry, it is highly likely for individual trades to have systemic repercussions.</p><p>If you’re curious about what whales have been doing through this market crash, this information can be easily interpreted by following a couple of headlines. While UST’s demise did seem to affect <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/the-crypto-whales-backed-terra-before-it-imploded/">quite a number of whales</a>, it’s safe to assume that the effects of widespread panic in the markets will not impact their intention to continue and accumulate on their positions. A quick Google search will reveal <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/16/crypto-funds-saw-years-highest-inflows-as-terra-crisis-crashed-markets/">(1)</a> <a href="https://blockworks.co/worlds-largest-crypto-exchange-traded-product-issuer-enters-us-market/">(2)</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/17/fortis-digital-ventures-closing-100-million-raise-for-new-crypto-fund/">(3)</a> that several crypto funds were started or acquired more crypto assets through the last week. It’s hard to imagine that, leaving aside day-to-day trading (after all, why would you buy higher when you can secure your way into a discount), the long-term perspective of high-wealth high-influence players might change.</p> Macroeconomic factors Given all the above, the increasing correlation between BTC and traditional assets increasing is no surprise.<p>Bitcoin was created in reaction to irresponsible monetary policy.</p><p>Since its inception, our industry has been contestatory and opposed the mainstream, centralized world of traditional finance. It’s no wonder then that crypto believers are often catastrophists and anticipate the next global economic crisis at every opportunity.</p><p>With global economic issues stemming from the aftermath of COVID, supply shocks due to the war in Ukraine, irresponsible monetary printing, interest rate hikes, etc., <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/01/11/global-recovery-economics-debt-commodity-inequality">even neutral analysts</a> point towards an upcoming recession. Markets have growth and decline cycles, and crypto is not immune to their changing tides. Some might even say that our industry can now suffer more from downturns than ever before, with its increased professionalism (weaker hands) and concentrated distributions (greater influence by individuals).</p><p>Our ecosystem has deep correlations built into its design. As it increasingly correlates with traditional finance, the appearance of it being a “hedge against inflation/bad times” disappears, leaving only volatility and a vision. To some, this might be good news, putting the spotlight on utility and innovation rather than economic gains. To others, this might be a turn-off, which paradoxically should make the first group happy, as it optimizes for more of their own.</p><p>One thing stands true through what seems like dark clouds on the horizon for the blockchain industry: Whether from the traditional or the Web3 world, we’re all in the same boat.</p> Conclusion <p>A common conclusion drawn all over crypto Twitter surrounding the possibility of a bear market is that funding will become less available. While this idea might be accurate and, teams should continue to optimize for true utility rather than hype and flashes, perhaps zooming out far more than we usually do is necessary to fully grasp the direction we’re moving in.</p><p>Bitcoin and the blockchain industry were invented to be the underdog’s pushback against poorly executed monetary policy. In times of unchanged policy, nation-states wedging war against each other, and financial adjustments in all spheres, it’s almost sad that as we all rush to the door, we may have just missed the ultimate irony. Or perhaps it’s just me that finds it interesting that, through the Terra collapse, the system’s answer has been to double down on its insistence that money should not be printed out of thin air without assets that support it.</p><p>In the end, traders or no traders, institutions or not, and macroeconomics aside, the answer to “where are we going” should always be to remember where we came from.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Recent discussions in the community have been centered around licensing for the Orchard payment protocol, which will be deployed in NU5. For those that might not be familiar with the Bootstrap Open Source License (<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/introducing-tgppl-a-radically-new-type-of-open-source-license/">BOSL</a>), ECC created this license with the goal of making open source more resistant to capture and more sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open-source projects have traditionally been vulnerable to two primary threats: underfunding, which threatens the sustainability of the project, and capture, in which others can turn the project to serve their interests instead of the public good, and in some cases, compete against the open-source project itself.</p>



<p>BOSL provides some protection against these threats but also adds complication. One downside is BOSL could create friction and uncertainty for new developers building in the Zcash ecosystem compared to familiar licenses.</p>



<p>When ECC <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-0-0/">announced</a> the release of zcashd 5.0.0, we indicated our intent to add two general exceptions to the BOSL license so that our partners and friendly forks could use the Orchard technology deploying in NU5 in a manner consistent with their current licensing choice. By partners in this case, we mean projects like wallets, exchanges, block explorers, messaging apps, and the like.</p>



<p>We worked with attorneys to develop the exception language and have talked with key partners who confirmed these exceptions meet their licensing needs. We spoke with our partners at NightHawk, ZecWallet, and Unstoppable who all felt the exception language met their needs. We also spoke with Jason McGee from Zcash Community Grants who indicated these exceptions should work for the projects they fund.</p>



<p>So, today we’re happy to report we have merged the full exception text into the Orchard Github <a href="https://github.com/zcash/orchard">repository</a> and updated the <a href="https://github.com/zcash/orchard/blob/main/COPYING">COPYING</a> file with the relevant text.</p>



<p>In summary, the exceptions apply to the following types of projects:</p>



  Projects that are designed to integrate with Zcash and provide additional functionality or utility to the Zcash network and users of the ZEC coin  Blockchains that descend from the Zcash blockchain and that are forked within 100 blocks of the current block height at the time of the code fork  



<p>Effectively Orchard’s license is now like the familiar and broadly acceptable LGPL for building products in the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



<p>We see this as an incremental improvement and will continue to look for licensing improvements that remove friction for new developers, partners and adopters, while protecting the investment of ZEC users.</p>



<p>The Orchard payment protocol, built on the Halo proving system, will activate on mainnet May 31 as part of <a href="https://z.cash/upgrade/nu5/">Network Upgrade 5</a> (NU5). NU5 is the largest upgrade in Zcash history, and we’re looking forward to its successful deployment and working with our partners and those interested in building on Zcash to further our mission.</p>



<p>Special thanks to Jack Gavigan of the Zcash Foundation, Zooko Wilcox of ECC, Alan Fairless, Bootstrap board member, and our partners for reviewing this post and providing valuable feedback.</p>

 The Privy Mindmap — Privy&nbsp;today  Part 1: building for privacy in&nbsp;web3 <p>We believe <a href="https://medium.com/privy-io/technical-decisions-are-moral-decisions-19d128b0a10e">building in the open is core to building better data infrastructure</a>. Accordingly, we are proud to present the Privy mindmap — this first part runs through how we are thinking about tradeoffs made in building Privy and the system today. For more on where we go from here, <a href="https://blog.privy.io/the-privy-mindmap-the-path-ahead-746b9647e87b">check out part&nbsp;2</a>.</p> Principles to build&nbsp;by <p>We are in a moloch trap when it comes to data ownership online: no one likes the system as it is, but there is no incentive for any single powerful actor to try and break out of it. The foundations of our data stack on the Web are fundamentally broken and enable systemic abuse of user privacy. New regulation seeking to improve data privacy online is leading to new forms of regulatory capture. It is de facto impossible for users to opt out of a datavore&nbsp;system.</p><p>The situation is no better for developers. There has never been a worst time to take on user data as a developer. It shouldn’t be so hard for developers to build great products whilst respecting their users’ privacy. This is why Privy&nbsp;exists.</p><p>Web3 presents a unique opportunity to break out of this coordination problem and present new paradigms for user privacy and identity on the&nbsp;web.</p>  Blockchains give us the opportunity to build a new stack built atop open standards and protocols, free of structural debt and incentivizing coordination across actors who benefit from a common identity&nbsp;layer.  While blockchains’ transparency makes them bad for privacy, they are easily auditable and promote interoperability by&nbsp;default.  Every user in web3 comes with their own PK-pair (their wallet) enabling us to ground data ownership with the end-user.  <p>Now, this is not to say that private, user-owned systems are inevitable in web3. There is a very real risk that web3 will go the way of web2 in spite of the structural opportunity at&nbsp;play.</p><p>Lack of good tooling has put developers in a bind when it comes to managing user data. As a developer in web3 today, you have two choices: eschew user data and build poorer UX or go back to the systems that have failed us the last 30 years over and dump user data in Postgres. We have a small window of time to reinvent the data stack before developers go back to what the system we know, and which has failed us on the&nbsp;Web.</p><p>The hard truth is there are no silver bullets in privacy, and privacy without usability is no privacy at all. There are tradeoffs in every decision you make — think of those GDPR consent banners that have forced users to take on a second-class experience in exchange for their&nbsp;privacy.</p>Welcome to France — would you like a second rate experience?<p>Developers today are faced with a tradeoff when it comes to user data: convenience vs privacy. This tradeoff will improve as new primitives are unlocked (like productizable homomorphic encryption, or generalizable, efficient zero-knowledge proofs). Recognizing that privacy choices exist on a spectrum, we are building Privy to help you thread the needle of building delightful products and protecting your users. We do this with developer productivity in mind: Privy allows you to get started fast, so you can ship safer products&nbsp;faster.</p><p>We recognize the tension between convenience and decentralization given the current state of infrastructure. Our job is to stake out nuanced positions and build opinionated software so developers have a way forward. This is why Privy runs infrastructure for its users today. We believe we can continually improve upon the status quo, until defaults have been upended. As with all nuanced issues, it is a question of tradeoffs.</p><p>With that, let’s get into the weeds of Privy: the product today, and where we go from&nbsp;here.</p> Aligning on&nbsp;vision <p>Data sovereignty breaks down when interoperability is enforced at the cost of privacy. We believe your users should not have to choose between data silos and control over who sees their most personal information. We aim to empower them by striking a pragmatic balance that enables you to build great products without putting users at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Why start with any standard short of full data sovereignty?</p><p>The last 30 years have shown that, as users, we choose convenience over privacy online — in order for a self-sovereign identity system to be widely adopted by end users, it must be adopted by developers first. This is why our first order of business at Privy is to make it easy for developers to take on user data safely in web3 so they can protect and empower their&nbsp;users.</p><p>Our goal is to build simple, usable software with clean abstractions to unblock and delight devs. We do this by building tooling that just works™, the protocol comes&nbsp;later.</p><p>And so today, Privy’s trust model today is “trust but verify.” Under this initial model, the developer/org retains control over user data but uses Privy to handle that data securely and transparently. As a developer, you never have to have access to user data if you don’t want to, and Privy makes it easy for your users to verify how their data is used. Infrastructure is Privy-run for convenience and security.</p> How Privy works&nbsp;today <p>Today, we provide top-of-class privacy solutions, based on well-worn cryptography. At a high-level, Privy takes care of key management and encryption, permissions and storage for&nbsp;you.</p><p>As a developer, you integrate Privy into your front-end in order to take on user data and have it bypass your backend (in fact you no longer need a backend to take on user data). The base interaction is&nbsp;simple:</p>  User enters information into their&nbsp;browser  That data is encrypted in the browser&nbsp;directly  The ciphertext is sent to&nbsp;Privy  <p>At a later time, if you or the user needs data, you can call it back from Privy where it’ll be decrypted client-side. All of this is done through two simple&nbsp;calls:</p> // encrypt and store<br>privy.put()  // retrieve and decrypt<br>privy.get() <p>Privy generates new keys for every piece of user data and runs Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect those keys. Data is stored in the cloud and permissions are set by the developer and upheld by Privy’s&nbsp;API.</p>A view of the Privy console where you can set permissions for&nbsp;data.<p>All data is encrypted end-to-end and Privy never sees it. We rely on cryptography and infrastructure best practices to help developers better protect their users. Our infrastructure and encryption solutions are all accessed via open-source libraries.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>Now as we pointed out, this is just the beginning. Privy is working across two main axes: more user control and less platform&nbsp;trust.</p>  control is about who makes decisions as pertains to user data (e.g. the developer or the&nbsp;user),  trust is about how these decisions are enforced — i.e. what agency does the underlying platform have in enforcing the controller’s decisions, more concretely “can the infrastructure be subpoenaed or co-opted?”  <p>Rather than having to replicate their data with every website they go to, users should have full control in deciding what data to give to what services and when to revoke it. This is where we are going, with Privy helping users control such personal data&nbsp;vaults.</p>Mockups of the Privy control center, from which you control your data flows as a&nbsp;user<p>If you’re as excited about this future as we are, reach out!

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>We’re almost ready to debut Advanced Staking, an essential piece of our ambitious process to roll out Multi-Asset Shielded Pools (MASPs). Advanced Staking will also contribute to helping $ZKP holders earn a passive income on their tokens as we roll out more features and list our token in more crypto exchanges. </p><p>Before that, however, a critical step needs to be completed first: Testing.</p><p>As we prepare to push Advanced Staking into Mainnet, the Panther development team wants you to get involved with testing it, earning rewards for it. For this, we’re rolling out the Beta for our incentivized testnet program, Panther Zafari.</p><p>From May 19th until the 26th, Advanced Staking testers will be the first users to test the protocol on the Mumbai Polygon Testnet, interact directly with the Panther team to provide feedback. And to make this process all the more enticing, we’ve attached 100,000 $ZKP in rewards to it!</p> What’s unique about Advanced Staking? <p>Advanced Staking is an intermediate step towards Panther’s v1 (or Panther Core), which includes a MASP solution. As in any crypto staking program, users will need to deposit their tokens into a non-custodial smart contract.</p><p>Users of Advanced Staking will generate $zZKP rewards that will contribute to the privacy set of the protocol’s first MASP upon Panther Core’s launch. By generating $zZKP, they will become the first users of the protocol once it launches, creating a seamless transition into Panther’s next phase.</p><p>Deploying Advanced Staking also allows the Panther team to roll out features used within MASPs (zk SNARK-enabled private asset pools) that eventually enable key protocol functionalities in a setting similar to real-life conditions. All the rewards from Advanced Staking will be calculated in a MASP, and redeemable at the end of the staking period.</p><p>Users can unstake their staked assets in Advanced Staking after thirty days of staking them.</p><p>In summary, rewards from Advanced Staking can be classified into two groups:</p><p>a. $zZKP in a MASP. This reward is calculated similarly to Classic Staking, but created as a transaction in the MASP. You will be able to redeem $zZKP for ZKP tokens using the Withdraw option at the end of the Advanced Staking period.</p><p>b. PRPs (Panther Reward Points). This additional reward, aimed toward incentivizing Advanced Staking, will also be created in the Shielded Pool as a calculation based on the number of $zZKP for a given user. Users will be able to convert PRPs to $zZKP(or $ZKP) using the Reward Converter when the core protocol (Panther Core V1) launches.</p> How will testing work? <p>Thanks to Panther Zafari’s Beta, anyone can provide feedback of any kind to the Panther team. You can participate in our rewards program to report:</p>  UI errors.  Incorrect flows.  Incorrect or No Error messages.  Screen freezes.  Screes not appearing.  MetaMask errors.  Logic or functionality errors.  Smart contract bugs.  <p>The technical team will assess each issue reported and classify each report, distributing rewards accordingly on Polygon. These will be calculated based on the following parameters:</p>  Proof of testing through the creation of $zZKP and PRPs.  Number of test cycles run.  Number of relevant feedback points provided.  Number of relevant, existing bugs/issues reported.   Here’s how to participate <p>To take part in the program, you should:</p>  Claim 50 test ZKP tokens via our faucet. (NOTE: the faucet is not live yet; Panther will provide a link to it on May 20th. In this period of time, if you want to start testing, you can use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_gKebzZ8VDLzbtR1q2W1cYX3P3p9L-BBey2YnPi2a8/edit#gid=870276217">an unclaimed account from this document</a>, just make sure you properly log in that you’re utilizing it to be eligible for rewards). These test tokens will help you take the actions you require within the Mumbai Testnet and hold no value outside of it.  Claim free $MATIC to pay for gas fees for the Mumbai Testnet via <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/">Polygon’s faucet</a>  Navigate to our<a href="https://test.staking.pantherprotocol.io/"> dApp</a>.  Stake ZKP tokens in the Staking Tab. Verify that this updates the Balance card. Note that the period for staking ends on May 22nd.  Unstake ZKP tokens:  <p>i. Withdraw only your principal amount (the digital assets you originally contributed).</p><p>ii. Verify that you’re only able to do this after our lock date (May 23rd).</p><p>6. Review and check that your Balance card showcases:</p><p>i. The correct staked amount.</p><p>ii. An updated amount when tokens are unstaked.</p><p>7. Check your $zZKP and PRP balance on your Dashboard screen:</p><p>i. Withdraw/redeem your $zZKP rewards. You should only be allowed to do this after the Withdraw Start date (May 24th/25th).</p><p>ii. After withdrawing, verify that you no longer have withstanding $zZKP and that you do have withstanding PRPs.</p><p>8. Validate that the Balance card on the Staking page updates.</p><p>If you find a bug:</p>  Fill out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftCbVmbosspDfFDLMwL5qfDyq4O7bRcijicZKPXLBhISUTGA/viewform">bug report form</a>,  If your report is relevant, you’ll get a notification from the Panther team. You’ll be able to track a reported bug and the solutions in the works in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-163IUDaHRQ5E1Bafxk4Nw5bLwAiGzXQ2kTh4h1Sf4/edit#gid=0">feedback sheet</a>,  You’ll receive your rewards from the Panther team in your wallet should the bug report be relevant.

 TokenMint will make tokenization streamlined and accessible to everyone. 
<p>TokenMint is a platform that allows anyone to easily and quickly create a token with custom tokenomics. No programming knowledge is needed for creating a token using TokenMint. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Important Note: TokenMint is currently in Alpha version with limited functionalities, but our team is working hard on delivering a wider range of features and making the platform more secure, more flexible, and even easier to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	 </p> NOTE: Only use Test ZEN (TZEN) and Test Zenny (TZNY) on the testnet environment. Do not send ZEN to testnet&nbsp; (Testnet Cobalt wallet or Testnet Sphere wallet). Sending ZEN from mainnet to a testnet address can result in a loss of funds.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p>
 Token Generator 
<p>TokenMint’s token generator is one of the three key tools of the TokenMint platform:</p>
 
 <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">Token Generator</a> 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt-by-horizen/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt Wallet</a> 
 <a href="https://explorer-testnet.tokenmint.global/">Block explorer</a> 
 
<p> The token generator is a web app that allows an easy way for anyone to create their own limited or unlimited token. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Tokenmint_graphic_MAY22_ZBF_style.jpg"></a></p>     
 

 
         
     &nbsp; 
 How to Use Token Generator to Create a Token 
<p>To begin the process of creating a token, you MUST:</p>
 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt-by-horizen/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">install the latest version of Cobalt wallet</a> or you will not be able to use the token generator 
 <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/tutorial-sending-tzen-to-cobalt/">have TZEN in your Cobalt Wallet</a> or you will not be able to connect your wallet to the TokenMint website.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The TokenMint token generator is very easy to use.&nbsp; Simply head to the <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">TokenMint website</a> and follow these easy steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 1. Launch the token generator from the <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">TokenMint website</a> by clicking either “Live on Testnet” or the “Launch Your Token” button</p>     
 

 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 

 
         
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 2. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt-by-horizen/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Download the latest Cobalt Wallet</a> and connect your Cobalt wallet. </p>
<p>You must install the latest Cobalt wallet, other wise the token generator won’t connect.&nbsp;</p>     
 

 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 

 
         
    <p>If you have previously installed a Cobalt wallet, make sure you remove it from your web browser. To access your existing wallet previously created in your old Cobalt wallet, you can import it using the wallet seed phrase of your existing wallet. This will allow you to access the funds you stored in your existing wallet. If you need help with installing and using the Cobalt wallet, please follow<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide/"> this guide</a>. </p>
<p>You must have sufficient Test ZEN in your Cobalt wallet to pay for network fees. If you need help with getting some free Test ZEN to your Cobalt wallet, please follow <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/tutorial-sending-tzen-to-cobalt/">this guide</a>.</p>
<p>STEP 3. Once your wallet is connected, click the “Create a token” box and simply follow the steps shown on the app to create your token.</p>     
 

 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 

 
         
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 4. After you create your token, you will be able to see your token in your Cobalt wallet and the <a href="https://testnet-explorer.tokenmint.global">TokenMint block explorer</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>By Peter Snyder, Sr. Director of Privacy</p>
<p>Update (June 2, 2022): <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacycg/2022Jun/0003.html">First Party Sets has been removed as a work item from the W3C’s Privacy Community Group (PrivacyCG)</a>. Because of privacy concerns like those described in this blog post (among other concerns), a majority of the browser vendors in PrivacyCG did not see a way First-Party Sets could be standardized and implemented in a privacy-respecting way. We’re grateful to the Chairs and members of PrivacyCG who also recognized that First-Party Sets would harm privacy on the Web. We’re excited to continue working with PrivacyCG on new, upcoming proposals that will actually improve privacy.</p>
<p>Begin original post:</p>
<p>Google is proposing a feature called “First-Party Sets,” which would have browsers reduce privacy barriers between sites. This is both alarming and harmful. The Web is slowly, after much time (and harm), converging on the “site” as the privacy boundary for the Web. First-Party Sets would undo this boundary, just as browsers, researchers, and privacy activists are delivering on this progress.</p>
<p>First-Party Sets would allow multiple sites to declare themselves as effectively the same site; the browser would allow these sites to communicate with each other (including tracking users) as if they were the same site. The privacy harm from this is obvious: it would allow companies to automatically track you across sites, and without proper notification or consent.</p>
<p>If First-Party Sets becomes widely adopted in Google Chrome, it will become harder for user-respecting browsers to protect their users’ privacy. Chrome’s market dominance means that, over time, other browsers will likely have to implement more and more of First-Party Sets to maintain compatibility with the Web. Brave urges anyone with an interest in Web privacy to oppose Google’s proposal.</p>

 What is First-Party Sets (and why you should care) 
<p>First-Party Sets constitute a radical change in how privacy is handled on the Web. First-Party Sets will allow more sites to track more of your behavior on the Web, and make it more difficult for users to predict how their information will be shared.</p>
<p>Today, most browsers use—or plan to use—the site as the privacy boundary on the Web. This emerging consensus is the collective result of years of work from academics, engineers, and privacy activists. Effectively, a site (and trackers on that site) should not be able to learn what you do on other sites. Enforcing boundaries between sites gives users better control over who can learn about their interests and behaviors. Such predictable, easily-understood privacy boundaries are a necessary (if incomplete) piece of building a privacy-protecting Web.</p>
<p>First-Party Sets would break this site-as-boundary policy—it would allow companies to weaken privacy protections between the sites they operate. Companies could declare all sites they control to be in the same First-Party Set. Browsers would then read these declarations and drop privacy protections between sites in the same set, allowing a user to be reidentified and tracked from site to site.</p>
<p>For example, Meta might declare that facebook.com,  instagram.com, and whatsapp.com are in the same First-Party Set, and thus be able to link user behaviors across all three sites. This would be in spite of the fact that many users intentionally maintain different and unlinked profiles across all three services.</p>
<p>Similarly, Google could enable tracking across many of its properties, both those popularly associated with its parent company, Alphabet (such as google.com, googlemail.com, and youtube.com), and less commonly known sites that users may have no idea are associated with Google (such as blogger.com, crashlytics.com, and admob.com). First-Party Sets would allow one site to track you across all of these sites, even when you haven’t logged into them or created a profile with them.</p>
<p>Worse still, users would have no say in this decision: the sites would decide their own privacy boundaries, in a way that’s opaque to users and ignores their needs and concerns.</p>
<p>In short, First-Party Sets would shift Web privacy from something users can control to something websites control. Users wouldn’t even have a chance to make decisions about their privacy until after the harm is already done.</p>

 First-Party Sets intentionally misleads users 
<p>At heart, Web users need to know with whom they’re interacting so they can make informed privacy decisions. This is already a difficult problem; First-Party Sets would make it effectively impossible to have informed consent. The individual site is the main, atomic entity we expect users to understand and make decisions around.</p>
<p>The importance of the trustworthiness of the site is reflected in browsers’ UI—all major browsers give the origin site special treatment in the address bar or “omnibox”. It’s also reflected in the general Web security advice that users broadly understand as best-practice (for example, users understand they should protect themselves from being phished by checking they’re really on the site they think they are).</p>
<p>Anything that weakens or obscures the only information users have to base privacy and security decisions on should be unacceptable. First-Party Sets intentionally and unambiguously introduces this confusion.</p>

 Another reason to steer clear of Google’s Privacy Sandbox 
<p>Cynically, Google is promoting First-Party Sets as a privacy feature. They’re proposing the feature for standardization in <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/privacycg">PrivacyCG</a>, the <a href="https://w3.org/">W3C</a> group focused on designing new features to improve privacy. This is despite the fact that First-Party Sets would weaken privacy protections already in many current browsers (including Brave), and the privacy protections planned by others.</p>
<p>Google argues that First-Party Sets will improve privacy because it would allow Google to finally block third-party cookies. This is Google measuring itself by its own yardstick. Other browsers have blocked third-party cookies for years, and they’ve done so in a way that doesn’t require the kind of user-confusion at the root of First-Party Sets.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that First-Party Sets isn’t a privacy feature; the main goal of “First Party Sets” is to ensure companies can continue to identify and track people across sites in exactly the way that blocking third-party cookies is intended to prevent.</p>
<p>First-Party Sets is yet another example of Google cynically claiming to improve user privacy, when in fact pushing proposals that serve Google first, sites second, and users a distant third (if at all). First-Party Sets is one of many such user-harming Privacy Sandbox proposals, some of which are alarmingly already shipping in Chrome: <a>Topics API broadcasts your personal interests to websites</a>. <a>Web Bundles will make it more difficult to control the content you load and see</a>. <a>FLEDGE both further promotes centralization on the Web, and would have users do data and battery draining work on behalf of advertisers</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Privacy Sandbox is full of Trojan horses, promising a “finally” private Web in Chrome, but guaranteed to limit progress on Web privacy just as privacy is gaining some long-overdue momentum. Web users, activists, and advocates should push back against Google, by choosing actually privacy-preserving browsers like Brave and by getting involved in <a href="https://github.com/privacycg/first-party-sets/issues/88">standards discussions</a>.</p>

<p>3–2–1-go for Private DeFi on Ethereum!</p><p>The countdown to Aztec Connect’s mainnet launch has officially begun.</p><p>Ethereum users are about to access the full spectrum of Ethereum DeFi applications with Aztec’s ironclad privacy guarantees, starting with our launch integrations: liquid stake ETH on Lido and get fixed yields on Element with full privacy protection.</p> ⏱ wen&nbsp;launch? <p>June 9th, 2022. 3 weeks and 1&nbsp;day.</p><p>Yes, 6/9. We’re doing it for the&nbsp;culture.</p><p>We have a full calendar of events planned leading up to launch — treat this as a handy guide to the content we’re releasing to educate you on Aztec Connect before it goes&nbsp;live.</p> 🔎 Internal and External Cryptography Audit <p>4 weeks to&nbsp;launch!</p><p>The Aztec Connect architecture is an extension of the cryptography systems underlying the original zk.money functionality used for private payments.</p><p>To support payments, we developed two custom circuits:</p>  The Join-Split Circuit: supports private transfers  The Account Circuit: supports private account abstraction  <p>Aztec Connect adds two circuits that work in conjunction with one&nbsp;another:</p>  The DeFi Deposit and Withdrawal Circuits: two circuits that together support depositing assets to L1 and returning them to Aztec’s zkRollup.  <p>We’ve already completed a 4-month-long code freeze and internal audit examining the core cryptographic improvements to Aztec’s&nbsp;rollup.</p><p>It consisted of our 8-person cryptography team making every attempt to break our code, cryptographic assumptions, and core building blocks. In addition to an internal audit, we’ve had an external fuzzing audit executed by Sentnl, and we’re doubling down on open-source development and raising our Bug Bounty limits, to be announced shortly.</p><p>Upcoming blog: Bug Bounty Announcement.</p> 📜 Third-Party Core Contract, and Bridge Interface Audits <p>3 weeks to launch (📍you are&nbsp;here!)</p><p>We received comments on and patched minor vulnerabilities from an official third-party smart contract audit by Solidified.</p><p>Further, we’ve test-deployed mainnet contracts and are doing on-chain testing before the final&nbsp;release.</p><p>We have high confidence in the security of the Aztec rollup contracts on Ethereum but this is advanced, complex tech, and we urge all users to proceed with&nbsp;caution.</p><p>Upcoming blog: Aztec’s Audit and Security Approach and publication of Solidified audit.</p> 🏃System Account Migration <p>2 weeks to&nbsp;launch!</p><p>When Aztec Connect launches, we will hard-fork the network, leading to the creation of a new state-tree. However, rather than starting with zero state, Aztec will retain existing encrypted accounts and aliases previously registered. This means existing users of zk.money will keep their&nbsp;aliases!</p><p>Note that for security reasons, funds will not be moved as part of the hard-fork. Users who want to use Aztec Connect–with its new cryptography and functionality–will have to withdraw and re-deposit funds.</p><p>In conjunction with starting a new state tree, we are deprecating the ability to create new accounts on the “old” zk.money. We will continue to support zk.money, backstopping daily rollups for one year from the launch of Aztec Connect — until June 9th,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Upcoming blog: zk.money Migration Guide</p> 🕸️ Mainnet Deployment of Core Contracts and&nbsp;Bridges <p>1 week to&nbsp;launch!</p><p>Mainnet testing and the community’s eyes on code will give us confidence in the security of the Aztec rollup contracts and as a result, Aztec Connect’s Core Contracts will be re-deployed to&nbsp;Mainnet.</p><p>In this week-before-launch period, the contracts are live but we will not make the front-end public for users to submit transactions to Aztec’s rollup provider.</p><p>Our privacy-focused DeFi front-end zk.money will then enter final usability and bug testing, with a production beta deployment (“soft-launch”) for internal core team members and select community members targeted soon thereafter.</p><p>Bridge contracts — interfaces between our core mainnet contracts and Ethereum DeFi protocols — are deployed&nbsp;next.</p> 🚀 zk.money Production Deployment <p>t-minus 0!</p><p>Finally, if all goes well, we will remove the beta and zk.money will be deployed in production!</p><p>Upcoming blog: Aztec Connect launch announcement!</p> 🍾 Aztec&nbsp;Connect <p>We couldn’t have done this without you, our community, our investors, and the collective Aztec ecosystem. Aztec Connect is a powerful demonstration of what’s possible with Aztec&nbsp;Network.</p><p>If private payments with two zk circuits was a 1/100 product, Aztec Connect is a 10x leap ahead to 10/100 with just one additional circuit.</p><p>But the true 100/100 comes with arbitrary smart contracts in a natively private execution environment.</p><p>We can’t wait to unveil Aztec Connect to you, the next major step toward fulfilling our long-term mission.</p> 🏗 Build with Aztec&nbsp;Connect <p>Are you a developer who wants to bring privacy to your favorite DeFi protocol? If you build it, we’ll fund&nbsp;it.</p><p>Aztec Grants Program: <a href="https://airtable.com/shrvglCZ24jaH73oe">https://airtable.com/shrvglCZ24jaH73oe</a></p><p>Connect Starter: <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-starter">https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-starter</a>.</p><p>Help make privacy a no-brainer.</p> 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Join the Aztec Community <p>We’re always on the lookout for talented engineers and applied cryptographers.</p><p>If joining our mission to bring scalable privacy to Ethereum excites you — check out our <a href="https://angel.co/company/aztec-network/jobs">open&nbsp;roles</a>.</p><p>Know someone?

Jon Nayar isn’t just helping to construct an innovative and compliant DAO for Open Meta. He’s also actively engaged in driving discussions in the House of&nbsp;Policy.<p>For the week’s spotlight, we’re visiting the House of Policy, which was created to discuss important concepts like IP, data privacy, NFTs, and financial market&nbsp;laws.</p><p>We were joined by Jon Nayar, the Head of Strategy and General Counsel for Crucible and a founding director of the Open Meta Association, to learn more about him, what attracted him to the Open Meta DAO™, and his interest in the&nbsp;house.</p><p>Tell us a little bit about your background. How did you get involved with Open&nbsp;Meta?</p><p>I started off working in corporate advisory in the city at Price Waterhouse and then moved into media and corporate law. Working in law exposed me to a huge variety of businesses ranging from representing creative talent and producers in music, film, TV, fashion and theatre to working in-house at Sony Pictures and other technology companies leading corporate M&amp;A deals and setting up businesses around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>It was the experience in negotiating deals from both sides of the table that then lead me to open my own consultancy advising talent and startups on strategy and fundraising. Through that I met Ryan Gill who introduced me to the nascent technologies of Web 3 and their potential to decentralise the internet and “level the playing field” and in 2021 we launched Open&nbsp;Meta.</p><p>Why does the House of Policy interest&nbsp;you?</p><p>As a community I think the <a href="https://www.openmetadao.com/">Open Meta DAO</a> provides an amazing opportunity to educate and influence policy makers and the broader community around Web 3 technologies and the positive opportunities that these technologies could bring to society. The House of Policy provides a focus for those in our community who want to get involved and potentially have a role in helping to influence the regulatory framework that will support a truly Open Meta-verse</p><p>What Open Meta DAO can do is provide a funnel for the discourse. Out of that can come papers and thoughts around what policy looks like. Do regulations that apply to Web 2.0, also apply to a new paradigm? How do we protect the individual? You get a set of terms and conditions, and people just click ‘accept.’ You upload to Instagram, and you don’t own that content anymore! The exciting thing to me about Web 3.0 and Open Meta is that you have the right, as a creative, to not sign everything across. You can monetize your own creativity and not give it all&nbsp;away.</p><p>Do you see a lot of potential in the Open Metaverse and Web 3.0 more generally?</p><p>People don’t realize the potential value of what they’ve created. In Web 2.0, the opportunities weren’t really there to monetize, but in Web 3.0, there’s the opportunity to create something, own it, license it out, and create a revenue stream from it. There’s a way to not have these gatekeepers and rent takers be the ones that own it and monetize it for their own shareholders. That’s where the opportunity lies, but we’re at a point where we either create this future or it just becomes what Web 2.0&nbsp;did.</p><blockquote>There’s a potential to determine what we want; we can build the software and the regulations to support a place where creatives own what they do and create an income stream from it, or we can flip back to the Web 2.0 version where it’s about&nbsp;profits.</blockquote><p>There’s probably a happy medium somewhere, but we need to determine where that&nbsp;is.</p><p>What kind of people have you met in the community? Is it mainly people with a background in&nbsp;tech?</p><p>There isn’t really a consistency of people in this space. There are a lot of different backgrounds and ways that they got here. It’s not always people from software development or gaming backgrounds. My experience is that it’s been such an interesting collection of people. One thing I’ve found quite consistent is, especially with those more advanced in their careers, there’s a real sense of curiosity. That’s what has brought them here. Age doesn’t seem to matter. Open Meta is bringing everyone in from 16 to 60. That’s what fascinates me. We’re all pioneers going, “How can we help model this and bring it to fruition in a good way? In a way that’s open, decentralized, and respects the individual and their creative&nbsp;output?”</p><p>Do you think a big reason for the enthusiasm for Web 3.0 and Open Meta comes from people having seen the failures of Web&nbsp;2.0?</p><p>I do. We used to see big companies taking a lot from creatives and leaving them burned out, as those people relied on their distribution networks. Now we have an opportunity to let people participate on the upside. How many opportunities do we have in life to influence this? I think this might be my last one, especially as a member of a collective rather than a shareholder. We don’t know exactly how the DAO is going to work. Companies have been around for centuries because they work. They help focus resources and they usually put out a result. The challenge for DAOs is how to do that without a company structure. Creatives need to be supported and people need to feel like they’re a part of something. That’s where DAOs can be really interesting. The community that Open Meta is creating, is participating on the upside, but things need to be ironed out. But that’s what I find really exciting! We’re working with a framework of regulations that haven’t dealt with organizations like this. DAOs are&nbsp;amazing.</p><p>Governments have seemed receptive to opening up to Crypto and maybe the Open Metaverse. Is this something that excites you or gives you some trepidation?</p><p>I think it’s great. By doing it, they’re going to understand it. I don’t see it as a disaster. Everyone is scared the government is going to try and take over the space, but they can’t learn without being involved. I don’t see it as a bad thing. There are no territorial boundaries. It might bring more credibility and help build the community. There are two sides to everything and it’s good to learn more about both. If they’re open to it, we can help influence them in terms of&nbsp;policy.</p><p>A lot of people seem concerned about the idea of big corporations being involved. Do you share that&nbsp;fear?</p><p>The underlying constant in my career has been collaboration. The community of Open Meta might not just be individuals, but big corporations too! Maybe we can influence the way they work. Maybe what will come out of Open Meta will be something that we never expected. I am an absolute optimist. You open up the discourse and see where it goes — maybe you’ll find mutually beneficial solutions, or perhaps different perspectives. Not everything has to be closed or open. There’s a middle ground. Maybe you want some of the capital from these companies pumped into the space, whether that’s through grants or something else.</p><p>I don’t believe that these companies are inherently evil or against an Open Metaverse.</p><p>When I see fear, I want to go in and find out why, because fear is something that drives people in terrible directions. It drives people away from their authenticity and their potential in life. Let’s prod this thing; maybe it doesn’t bite! If you have that sense of curiosity about fear, you’re released from your limitations. These big corporations aren’t agile. They can’t turn around quickly, and are pulled down by shareholder expectations. So, maybe they’ll want to outsource their exploration of the Open Metaverse to us? There are so many ways to skin a cat; you’ve just got to put this fear aside and things open up. Opportunities arise.</p><p>Interested in policy or the issues that will drive the Open Metaverse?

 KYVE, the Web3 Data Lake Solution, Turns to Cosmos to Launch Scalable and Streamlined Layer 1&nbsp;Solution <p>A few years ago, Cosmos brought forward its own game-changing Standard Development Kit (<a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/">SDK</a>), providing Web3 builders with a new, modular framework allowing for quick and easy blockchain development.</p><p>Since then, hundreds of different blockchains have benefited from the SDK framework and quickly built projects with success and ease. Being one of the simplest, most secure, and most flexible app-building frameworks in the industry, Cosmos SDK was the natural choice for our team at&nbsp;KYVE.</p><p>As a result of facing limitations of scalability and flexibility with our previous EVM-based chain, our team evaluated multiple options to support the KYVE Web3 data lake solution and found that Cosmos provided all that we were looking for and more. More specifically, it provided us with a non-EVM, scalable solution that made it easier to handle high-frequency transactions, faster, more streamlined block times, and the KYVE Network’s very own block&nbsp;space.</p><p>With this in mind, KYVE is excited to announce that we recently joined the Cosmos Ecosystem and have migrated most of our blockchain protocol from an EVM-based chain to Cosmos SDK-based chain!</p><p>Before we dive into this new development, let’s take a step back and look at what exactly the KYVE Network does and why we needed this&nbsp;change.</p> A closer look at&nbsp;KYVE <p><a href="https://www.kyve.network/">KYVE</a> is a Web3 data lake solution allowing projects to easily standardize, validate and permanently store data, such as raw block data, transactions, application-specific data, financial data, and more. Not only is the project important for RPC and node runners, but KYVE also allows anyone to have clearer insights about the on-chain data, aiding projects’ overall data scalability.</p><p>Our protocol does so thanks to its Layer 1 chain powered by decentralized archivers and validators taking blockchain data, validating and bringing it to a unified standard, then storing it permanently on Arweave for anyone to easily access, ensuring the scalability, immutability, and availability of data over&nbsp;time.</p><p>With the ever-growing amount of unorganized and unreliable data in today’s world, KYVE’s solution makes the process of storing and accessing important data more streamlined for growing projects.</p><p>Through the use of data pools and protocol nodes containing extendable logic, KYVE has already integrated its protocol into many established blockchains, including Bitcoin, Avalanche, Solana, and more, despite being on testnet. As our project grows more and more each day and is on track to launch mainnet later this year, we began to face major limitations with the original EVM solution, which required additional research into other infrastructure options.</p><p>The key issue being EVM is not scalable for applications with high transaction frequency like&nbsp;KYVE.</p><p>In times of high network usage, gas prices always increase. This is because all applications share the same block space on EVM. Only a certain number of transactions are allowed per block, so if one wants their transaction to be prioritized, they have to pay more gas for&nbsp;it.</p><p>In broad terms, users are willing to pay higher gas fees for transactions they consider “valuable.” For instance, a trade executed on Uniswap with a $10,000 USD profit is probably ok paying $100 in gas. For less “valuable” transactions such as Governance and Community votes on KYVE, however, fees this high are not economical.</p><p>Because of the volume of engagement, KYVE needed a solution that does not need to share block space with other applications. Many of the EVM solutions we were looking at were just not decentralized to the point we needed them to be. That is until we started looking into the Cosmos Ecosystem and the Cosmos&nbsp;SDK.</p> Venturing into the&nbsp;Cosmos <p>We made the decision to switch to a Cosmos SDK-based chain not only because it fits our scalability, transaction volume, and independent block space requirements, but also because the Cosmos application building toolkit makes it easy to scaffold chains, create blocks, carry out transactions and carry out governance. It enables KYVE to have faster, more streamlined block times and we no longer have to worry about sharing block&nbsp;space.</p><p>Typically, switching from one network to another is quite a Herculean task. However, switching to Cosmos was a smooth process! Taking our team less than a week to get the base chain up and running. How did we go about&nbsp;it?</p><p>We first initiated the process of switching with the Go programming language, which we found quite easy to implement. And with the aid of Ignite CLI, a platform used to build, launch and maintain crypto applications on a sovereign blockchain, we were able to scaffold a chain quickly, just needing to add our custom logic. Overall, the team was able to have a PoC chain up and running in just a few days, and it was quite simple to transfer the existing Solidity logic onto the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>We personally believe that transferring logic from Solidity to Cosmos SDK is the easiest way to get started in the ecosystem. This is because it involves very similar mentalities. Instead of having functions that your users interact with, they instead send transactions with different types and inputs. From our users’ perspectives, there isn’t a massive difference, other than faster speeds and lower&nbsp;costs.</p><p>“After carefully looking through many networks and app chain solutions, we found Cosmos (with the help of the Ignite CLI), to be the easiest to get started with,” said John Letey, co-founder of KYVE. “In less than a week, the tech team had ported most of our Solidity logic to a Cosmos SDK&nbsp;chain!”</p>KYVE’S architecture Building Towards the Future of Web3&nbsp;Data <p>KYVE’s migration to a Cosmos SDK-based chain has unlocked new potential for KYVE’s scalability and developments for the future of data management. It has also allowed our team to properly prepare its newly launched incentivized testnet, <a href="https://www.kyve.network/korellia">Mission Korellia</a>, as well as gear up for our upcoming mainnet launch in Q3/4 of this&nbsp;year.</p><p>“Thanks to the switch to Cosmos, we are able to play out KYVE’s full potential. Worrying about scalability has now become one of the minor challenges in development,” said Fabian Riewe, co-founder of&nbsp;KYVE.</p><p>In the months to come, KYVE has exciting milestones to hit, and will also continue to bring on new partnerships and exciting blockchain integrations, spreading its data solution to support as many projects as possible. Be sure to join our community to stay up to date on all that is yet to&nbsp;come.</p> More about&nbsp;KYVE <p>KYVE’s network is powered by decentralized archivers and validators funded by $KYVE tokens and aims to operate as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) in the near&nbsp;future.</p><p>This past year KYVE has gained major support, currently backed by top VCs, including Hypersphere Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Mechanism Capital, CMS Holdings, and blockchains such as Arweave, Avalanche, Solana, Interchain, and&nbsp;NEAR.</p><p>KYVE can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/KYVEnetwork">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://discord.gg/E73KZwaa4S">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/kyvenet">Telegram</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/kyve-the-web3-data-lake-solution-turns-to-cosmos-to-launch-scalable-and-streamlined-layer-1-16a2f4794f86">KYVE, the Web3 Data Lake Solution, Turns to Cosmos to Launch Scalable and Streamlined Layer 1…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It is with sadness that we announce that Hudson Jameson has decided to step down as a member of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee. Hudson has been a member of the committee since it was first constituted in late 2020, and he will be sorely missed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As ZCG committee member Jason McGee <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staggered-elections-for-zcg-committee/41571?u=winfred">announced last week</a>, Hudson’s departure presents an opportunity to begin staggering committee members’ terms, by holding an election at the end of June to select Hudson’s replacement. The new committee member will serve a one-year term, commencing on July 1st, and the remaining four members’ terms will expire on December 31st.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zcash Community Grants Committee is elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), a panel of community members established by the Zcash Foundation (ZF) as a means of soliciting advisory input from the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The timeline for nominations and the election itself will be announced shortly.&nbsp; Before the election, however, we want to share our plans for expanding the ZCAP.</p>
<p>The ZCAP was originally formed in 2018 as a community governance panel. It was expanded in 2019, 2020, in June 2021, and most recently in December 2021. Since its inception, ZF has solicited the ZCAP’s advisory input on the appointment of the Zcash Foundation board of directors, and on questions ranging from <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/cdc15aa6-6f75-11e8-b5e0-0e48ec97cebb/view">whether Zcash should move to an ASIC-resistant consensus algorithm</a> to what the <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/5dd57b92-01ed-11ec-a0a8-ae3066fac55d/view">short- and long-term priorities for Zcash should be</a>. The ZCAP also played a key role in the governance process that resulted in<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014"> ZIP 1014</a>, which established the Dev Fund and the Zcash Community Grants program.</p>
<p>The Zcash Foundation is committed to making the ZCAP more independent and representative of the Zcash community. Over time, we have expanded the eligibility criteria for ZCAP membership, <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/ideas-for-expanding-the-community-advisory-panel/39354">including criteria that were suggested by members of the Zcash community</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ideal criteria for ZCAP membership are objective and Sybil resistant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Objective criteria are ones that do not involve a qualitative judgment, and are therefore immune to intrinsic bias. For example, “past and present Zcash Community Grants committee members” is an objective criterion because a person either is (or has been) elected to the Zcash Community Grants committee, or they have not – there is no judgment involved. This specific criterion also has the advantage that ZCG committee members are elected by the community, not appointed by ZF, which bolsters the ZCAP’s independence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast, “is knowledgeable about Zcash” would be a subjective criterion, as it would require a qualitative judgment call, which risks the introduction of bias on the part of the person or organization responsible for exercising that judgment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sybil resistance is the quality of being resistant to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Sybil attacks</a>, where a single person can exert disproportionate influence by, for example, voting multiple times. Again, past or present membership of the ZCG committee is a criterion that is highly Sybil resistant because the risk that a person might successfully create one or more pseudonymous identities and get elected to multiple ZCG committee seats is very low, and is further reduced by the fact that ZF KYCs ZCG committee members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast “is a ZEC holder” is a more problematic criterion because it would be possible for a single person who holds any amount of ZEC to distribute it across multiple wallets, and create multiple pseudonymous personae in order to vote multiple times. Creating a threshold (e.g. a minimum of 10 ZEC) doesn’t entirely solve the problem – a person who holds 100 ZEC could, in theory, vote ten times. While KYCing ZEC holders would, in theory, resolve the issue, this would introduce extra cost and bureaucracy, and, given that members of the Zcash community value their privacy, it seems unlikely that many ZEC holders would be comfortable surrendering their privacy by undergoing a KYC process.</p>
<p>We believe that another objective of ZCAP expansion should be to reduce the influence of persons associated with the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and ZF. In the most recent vote, nearly 25% of the voters were employees, board members or otherwise closely associated with ECC or ZF. One of our goals is to continually reduce that percentage, thus making ZCAP more independent of both ECC and ZF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, for the upcoming ZCAP expansion, we are introducing new eligibility criteria that will make ZCAP more independent and representative of the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are inviting the following community members to volunteer to serve on the ZCAP:</p>
 
 Grant recipients who have successfully completed more than 50% of their grant (as measured by the USD value of grant milestones that have been completed and paid out) 
 Zcash Community Grants Committee members (past and present) 
 Zcash Ambassadors from the ZCG Ambassadors Program 
 Community contributors who have:
 
 made a meaningful contribution to one of the Zcash node projects on Github (<a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash">zcashd</a> and Z<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra">ebra</a>), 
 authored or co-authored a <a href="https://zips.z.cash/">ZIP</a> (including ZIPs 1001-1013), or 
 led development of a significant Zcash software application, library, tool or similar. 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All individuals or organizations who meet any of the above criteria are encouraged to volunteer to serve on ZCAP by completing&nbsp; <a href="https://forms.gle/2JzcY1gYStrDnVKd7">this form</a>. In addition, the ZF team will be proactively reaching out to individuals and organizations that meet these criteria, to encourage them to join ZCAP.&nbsp;</p>
 New ZCAP Eligibility Criteria: 
<p>We are also inviting active <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/">Zcash Community forum</a> members who meet at least one of the below criteria to self-elect to join ZCAP:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Active members of the forum that joined before March 2021. 
 Zcash Community Forums members who have recently visited the forum for 100 consecutive days and earned the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/badges/46/aficionado">“Aficionado” badge</a>. 
 Zcash Community Forums members who have earned the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/badges/3/regular">“Regular” badge</a> by being a regular part of the Zcash community over a period of months.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forum members who meet the criteria listed above should fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/T3C5QPFeyagLMA2N8">this form.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that, due to concerns regarding the ongoing Sybil resistance of the first criterion (active members of the forum that joined before a specific date), we plan to retire this criterion after the upcoming election, in favour of forum badge-based eligibility. We invite feedback from the community on this decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in past expansions, existing ZCAP members may invite a new member to join ZCAP. Members who qualify will receive an email in the coming days with instructions on how to invite a new ZCAP member.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deadline to volunteer to join ZCAP or to nominate a new member is 09:00 UTC on Monday June 6, 2022.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that there should be two more criteria for ZCAP membership:</p>
 
 organizations and individuals who have made a meaningful contribution to the success of Zcash, and 
 organizations and individuals whose membership of ZCAP would make it more independent and representative of the Zcash community 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, neither of these criteria are objective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, we propose that ZF and ECC work together to establish a protocol to make it possible to use these two criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, we propose that:</p>
 
 We invite nominations from the Zcash community (via the forum) for organizations and individuals who may meet these criteria. Additionally, ZF or ECC may accept nominations via other channels they deem appropriate, and post them to the forum (so that the community can provide feedback).&nbsp; 
 The deadline for nominations shall be 09:00 UTC on Monday June 6, 2022. 
 After this deadline, ZF and ECC shall review the nominations, and indicate to one another whether they agree with or object to each nomination.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 If both organizations agree with the nomination, the nominee will be added to ZCAP.&nbsp; 
 If both organizations object to the nomination, the nominee will be rejected. 
 If one organization agrees with the nomination, and the other organization objects, the decision will be escalated to a vote of the ZF and Bootstrap Project’s board members (with votes weighted appropriately – e.g. each ZF board member’s vote counts as 1, while each ECC board member’s vote counts as 1.2).&nbsp; 
 In the event of a tied vote, the ZF and Bootstrap Project’s boards may jointly select (using the weighted voting mechanism described above) an independent arbiter to decide whether the nominee should be added to ZCAP.&nbsp; 
 If the boards cannot agree on an independent arbiter, the question of whether the nominee should be added to ZCAP will be added to the next ZCAP poll.&nbsp; 
 
<p>We also propose that a similar protocol be used to remove ZCAP members whose interests are not aligned with the Zcash community’s, or whose membership of ZCAP is otherwise inimical to its purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, we propose that:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Either ZF or ECC may raise the question of whether an existing member of ZCAP should be removed.&nbsp; 
 If both organizations agree to the removal, the member will be removed.&nbsp; 
 If both organizations object to the removal, the member will remain on ZCAP.&nbsp; 
 If the organizations disagree, the matter will be escalated as described above (i.e. first to the ZF and Bootstrap boards, then to an independent arbiter or to ZCAP itself).&nbsp; 
 
<p>We believe that this approach will unlock significant improvements in terms of making ZCAP more independent and representative of the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following this election, we plan to move to an ongoing ZCAP expansion process, with a cut-off deadline in advance of each ZCAP poll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also adjusting the “use it or lose it” policy, as we feel that the previous policy of dropping members if they miss a single vote has resulted in some perverse effects. Going forward, ZCAP members who fail to vote in three consecutive ZCAP polls will be removed from ZCAP unless they have reasonable grounds for failing to vote. However, this policy will not apply to ZCAP members who would automatically be immediately eligible to rejoin ZCAP (e.g. contributors who have made a meaningful contribution to zcashd or Zebra).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our goal with these changes is to make progress but we readily acknowledge that we’re a long way from perfection. We will continue to evolve and improve how ZCAP members are selected, and we invite the Zcash community to <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/ideas-for-expanding-the-community-advisory-panel/39354">continue providing suggestions on how to expand the ZCAP</a>.</p>

 Table of&nbsp;Contents   Introduction  Reflections on&nbsp;Terra  Basics  Supply Absorption Assumption  Asset Backing Duality Assumption  Open Liability Issuance Assumption  Silk Evolved  Silk Changes  Value Accrual&nbsp;Impact  Next Steps  Conclusion   Introduction <p>Greetings community,</p><p>The vision for a truly global decentralized privacy-preserving stablecoin pegged to a basket of global currencies and commodities has been at the heart of Shade Protocol’s mission since the inception of Silk— uniting community members and developers around the world to make this dream a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>In this blog post, we will describe the rationale behind changes in Silk’s stability model in lieu of certain algorithmic stablecoins breaking, and what you can expect moving forward from Shade Protocol.</p> Reflections on&nbsp;Terra <p>May 2022 saw the unwinding and depeg of Terra $UST, an algorithmic stablecoin (backed by Luna) pegged to the US dollar. There was over 18,000,000,000 UST in circulation prior to the economic break of&nbsp;UST.</p><p>Shade Protocol had concerns about the intrinsic backing of the UST model as early as September of 2021. Despite these concerns, the design of the Silk stablecoin was on track to inherit similar assumptions that the Terra UST model&nbsp;held.</p>Original Silk whitepaper concerned about Terra’s algo&nbsp;model<p>With the recent crash of Terra UST and Luna, core contributors re-evaluated risks of the existing Silk model. In order to progress towards the safe launch of Silk, Shade Protocol is forced to challenge all of the assumptions inherited from Terra. The three key assumptions that Shade Protocol inherited from Terra were as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Supply-Absorption  Asset Backing&nbsp;Duality  Open Liability Issuance   Basics <p>Before challenging these carry-over assumptions from the Terra model, we must first backtrack to core finance concepts: assets &amp; liabilities.</p><p>Within the context of stablecoins, every single stablecoin is a liability (promise of $1 worth of redemption). In order to issue a liability, there must be assets backing the system to properly account for redemption of liabilities at large. A simple ratio encapsulates this stability:</p><blockquote>Assets / Liabilities = Degree Of Stability</blockquote><p>The assets within the Terra model backing the 18B $UST was the collective market capitalization of Luna (used to handle redemptions from UST to Luna), ~$1.5B worth of Bitcoin held in reserve, as well as the depth of DEX liquidity available for the sale (redemption) from 1 UST to $1 worth of assets other than&nbsp;Luna.</p><p>Luna maintained price disparities of UST through an extremely large arbitrage community that had deep enough pockets to profitably arbitrage price disparities between the minting contracts on Terra (UST ← →LUNA) to any DEX or CEX where there was a price disparity diverging from the target peg of $1 UST. If demand for UST slowed down (trading below peg) then the supply of Luna would expand to absorb the decrease in demand for&nbsp;UST.</p>(FIGURE A) — Decrease supply of UST to restore&nbsp;peg(FIGURE B) — Price of Luna decreases (via supply expansion) to absorb the burning of UST →mint Luna (redemption) that pulls UST out of circulation to bring UST back to target $1&nbsp;peg Supply-Absorption Assumption <p>The supply-absorption model (Figure A &amp; B) invented by Terra worked extremely well for ~1.5 years: proving that the supply absorption model is effective during periods of time where volatility tied to demand for UST fell within acceptable ranges of standard deviation.</p><p>However, the recent unravelling of UST showed Shade Protocol that the supply absorption method used by Terra systemically struggled to handle a sudden and drastic shift in the demand for&nbsp;UST.</p><p>What sequence played&nbsp;out?</p>  Entity accrues massive UST&nbsp;position  Entity sells off UST on a DEX for a different stable  Users see UST is trading under-peg due to sudden massive sell-off of&nbsp;UST  A subset of risk averse UST holders begin to sell their&nbsp;UST  A subset of risk averse Luna holders sell their Luna because they are aware that the supply of Luna is about to expand (decreasing price of Luna due to supply expansion in order to restore UST to&nbsp;peg)  Luna marketcap begins to drop — the key detail here is that markets were front-running the supply absorption mechanism, meaning the stability mechanism was unable to absorb the volatility because Luna holders were selling off their Luna at such a rapid pace in comparison to the supply-absorption mechanism’s ability to propagate (arb) all of the price disparities that were existing on CEXs and multiple non-Terra DEXs. The more Luna market capitalization to draw upon, the easier it is for the supply absorption method to bring UST back to parity. But because markets were aware of the supply expansion mechanism required to bring UST backed to parity, users were selling off their Luna before the market capitalization at current prices could absorb the decrease in UST demand — drastically decreasing the supply-absorption’s ability to use its self-reflexive asset backing (which takes the form of Luna’s collective market capitalization) to bring stability back to the&nbsp;system.  The next subset of risk averse UST holders see UST has still not restored its peg in a timely manner (because the supply-absorption is getting outpaced by sell pressure from both UST &amp; Luna) and thus they begin to sell their&nbsp;UST.  Rinse/repeat steps&nbsp;5-7  <p>Prior to the breakdown of UST, Shade Protocol assumed that the supply-absorption method was agile enough to handle massive contractionary events and shifts in demand. This was the same assumption that Terra also held. Shade Protocol now holds the following evolved assumption:</p> The supply-absorption method works extremely well on average, but is fragile in the face of sharp decreases in demand that outpace depth of liquidity &amp; stability arbitrage.  Asset Backing Duality Assumption <p>An even more fundamental assumption Shade Protocol inherited from Terra was the concept that a single volatile asset can be the primary redemption mechanism for a stablecoin without any other assets involved, or without any overcollateralization.</p><p>Without any other assets capable of stepping in to help defend the peg, a sharp decline in both UST &amp; Luna begins a death spiral that is difficult to reverse due to the duality of the relationship between both the liabilities (UST) and the assets backing the liabilities (Luna). Shade Protocol now holds the following evolved assumption:</p> There needs to be multiple uncorrelated assets involved with backing algorithmic stablecoins.  Open Liability Issuance Assumption <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agl-abtGSTs">Economic Theory: Terra Depeg &amp; Silk Model&nbsp;Change</a><p>While the supply-absorption &amp; asset backing duality assumptions were both important components of Shade Protocol, the open liability issuance assumption was the most systemic problem that Shade Protocol was on the verge of inheriting from the Terra algorithmic model.</p><p>The open liability issuance assumption is as follows: it is safe for any entity at any time to issue a liability (mint a stablecoin) that the protocol will have to account for (via redemption or sale) in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The attack vector that emerges from the open liability issuance assumption is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Luna is trading at&nbsp;$30  User purchases $30 worth of Luna (Assets = $30, Liabilities =&nbsp;$0)  Price of Luna increase to $100 (Assets = $100, Liabilities =&nbsp;$0)  User burns $100 of Luna for 100 UST (Assets = $100, Liabilities =&nbsp;$100)  Price of Luna decreases to $30 (Assets = $30, Liabilities =&nbsp;$100)  <p>Because users are able to issue liabilities (mint UST) at any time in Terra, the protocol is given bad debt whenever the asset (Luna) backing the liabilities decreases from a point in time since the issuance of a liability. Shade Protocol now holds the following evolved assumption:</p> It is dangerous for any entity, other than the protocol, to have the ability to issue a liability in the form of a stablecoin that the protocol will have to account for via redemption or sale in the&nbsp;future.  Silk Evolved OLD Silk model from early 2021. Green section = overcollateralized. Orange = algorithmic.<p>Listed above is an ancient model of Silk from early 2021. Shade Protocol originally had plans to support overcollateralized minting of Silk after the initial launch of the algorithmic components (Silk ← →SHD). However, a lot has changed with stablecoins since early 2021. Due to the Terra UST crash, consumer support and trust of algorithmic stablecoins are (rightfully) at an all time&nbsp;low.</p><p>After a distinct period of deliberation &amp; analysis, the following conclusion was arrived at for next&nbsp;steps:</p><blockquote>Shade Protocol core developers and economists are planning to launch Silk as an overcollateralized stablecoin built with modularity that could allow for integration of future stability, issuance, and redemption mechanisms.</blockquote><p>Currently, new Silk simulation and modeling software are actively being developed in order for Shade Protocol contributors to have a better understanding of how Silk can continue to evolve its stability, issuance, and redemption mechanisms in light of how Shade Protocol is moving away from the flawed Terra model assumptions. Despite the conviction to continue to iterate on stablecoin models, Shade Protocol core contributors are aiming to launch Silk with a stability model that is proven to be safe (DAI, MIM) while also giving Silk the flexibility to modularly evolve overtime after exhaustive research and simulations.</p><p>Fortunately for Shade Protocol, the Shade Lend team has been developing the overcollateralized version of the Silk model since January 2022. Over five months of work has already put into development for the overcollateralized model of Silk. As such, the builders are optimistic about the timeline of Silk’s&nbsp;launch.</p><a href="https://youtu.be/uEwA6PA4hII?t=1285">Silk Lend Team Update on Overcollateralized Model</a> Silk Changes <p>What has not changed about Silk is the following:</p>  Privacy-preserving  Auditable  Perpetual hedge against global volatility  Pegged to a basket of global currencies &amp; commodities (~$1.05)  Decentralized  Fast  Smart contract compatible  Cross-chain  <p>What is planned to change for Silk is the following:</p>  Overcollateralized  Modular   Value Accrual&nbsp;Impact <p>With an adjustment in stablecoin model inevitably comes a switch in value accrual for SHD tokenholders. While a change to the overcollateralized model gives up a degree of profitability in return for stability, there are still fundamental revenue streams in the form of interest accrued and liquidations tied to this new model. The following is an updated list of revenue streams that are in development for Shade Protocol:</p>  Silk transaction fees  Interest fees  Liquidation fees  10 years of SHD staking&nbsp;rewards  Shade Treasury L1 staking&nbsp;rewards  Shade Treasury LP participation rewards  stkd-SCRT liquid staking derivative fee stream (Launched)  stkd-SHD liquid staking derivative fee&nbsp;stream  Protocol arbitrage  More to be announced June&nbsp;7th   Next Steps <p>To reflect what has changed about Silk, here is a list of action items you can look forward to from Shade Protocol:</p>  Updated Silk Whitepaper  Updated Shade Protocol Whitepaper  Economic Simulations &amp;&nbsp;Models  Silk Launch&nbsp;Timeline  Developer Updates  Audit Updates   Conclusion <a href="https://shadeprotocol.io/">https://shadeprotocol.io/</a><p><a href="https://shadeprotocol.io/">Shade Protocol</a> is an ambitious array of application-layer products focused on a simple end user experience that involves the incorporation of privacy by default. These interconnected privacy-preserving DeFi products built on Secret Network will change DeFi as we know it — empowering the next generation of value creation and exchange. Shade Protocol is launching Silk: a privacy-preserving collateralized, reflexive stablecoin built on Secret&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Without privacy, DeFi is incomplete. Traditional financial markets offer a degree of privacy for users, and as a result offer up greater protections in some capacity than existing DeFi markets. Shade Protocol will be the world’s first truly cohesive decentralized and privacy-preserving financial applications — ushering in a golden era for Web3. Shade Protocol will always push for privacy by default, privacy as an expectation, and privacy as the key to unlocking the full value of a decentralized future.</p><blockquote>But we can’t do this without community.

<p>Over the last 10 months, ECC published a series of blog posts on our work exploring Zcash Shielded Assets (ZSAs), including <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-exploring-zcash-shielded-assets/">our plans</a> to perform an economic analysis of various fee mechanisms that could be employed alongside ZSAs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout last summer and into the fall, we worked with the <a href="https://economics.gmu.edu/about-the-department/experimental-economics">Computational Experimental Economics Lab</a> (CEELab) at George Mason University (GMU), under the direction of Professor Kevin McCabe, to study and evaluate potential mechanisms. The final report will be published at a later date, but we’re pleased to present a <a href="https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/A-Study-of-Decentralized-Markets-on-the-Zcash-Blockchain.pdf">draft copy</a> today.</p>



<p>We view ZEC as the engine of sustainable growth for our mission, and believe some mechanisms are consistent with that sustainability. We will be supportive of any implementation of ZSAs that includes a fee structure that serves this goal. Sustainability, and economics in general, will become even more critical as we explore a move to proof of stake and see how ZSAs fit into the future of the Zcash protocol.</p>



 Fundamental Zcash economics 



<p>Before getting into the specifics of the GMU project, let’s take a look at current Zcash economics. They’re pretty straightforward and inherited largely from Bitcoin, but it’s good to review the basics when considering making any sort of change that could have a potential economic impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ZEC-holders make Zcash more resistant to capture by paying for core support functions like mining, software maintenance and security, innovation, marketing, regulatory and government relations, customer support, business development, and education. They pay for those functions with issuance through the form of block rewards. In 2022, at an average coin price of $150, that amount will total over $197 million, with 80% going to miners and 20% to the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/dev-fund-poll-shows-consensus/">Zcash Development Fund</a>.</p>



<p>In terms of issuance, we began 2022 with approximately 11.8M ZEC in circulation. During the year, 1.3 million ZEC will be issued representing an approximate 11.1% inflation rate. As Zcash is currently on the same emission curve as Bitcoin, this issuance will continue until a total supply of 21 million ZEC is reached.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the supply cap, and since more ZEC will be in circulation each year, the inflation rate naturally decreases. For example, for 2023 and 2024, inflation will be 10.0% and 9.1%, respectively, and in 2025 after the next halvening, it will be 4.2%. Note that these are projected inflation rates and may be modified as we evaluate the economic security requirements for a move to a proof-of-stake protocol.</p>



 Token economics 



<p>So, what are token economics all about? Token economics can be understood as a subset of economics that studies the economic institutions, policies, and ethics of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services that have been tokenized. [“<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-the/9781492072973/ch01.html">What Is the Token Economy</a>?”, Shermin Voshmgir, O’Reilly Media 2019]</p>



<p>Essentially token economics are where economics meets game theory, such that all participants are working for the greater good of the economy while simultaneously benefiting themselves. It’s the alignment of incentives with economic best interest that causes economies to scale and endure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In game theory, a token economy is considered an infinite game, meaning the game exists for the sole purpose of continuing the game by creating a virtuous circle of utilization and value creation. If that sounds familiar, it’s because that simple principle is at the heart of the Zcash Development Fund — a virtuous circle of value creation.</p>



<p>What type of problems do we have to think about then, when adding additional assets to the Zcash blockchain? Primarily two things: the Free Rider problem and the Top Heavy problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Free Rider problem arises when an additional asset reaps all the benefits of a network, but doesn’t contribute to its core support functions. In the case of Zcash, this would be an asset that gets the same benefits as ZEC but doesn’t incur the core support function cost described above. This creates an unfair system where ZEC holders are supporting other assets on the Zcash blockchain without any additional benefit.</p>



<p>The Top Heavy problem arises when an additional asset becomes more valuable than the native asset. For example, while conceptually different, <a href="http://www.ofnumbers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Will-colored-coin-extensibility-throw-a-wrench-into-the-automated-information-security-costs-of-Bitcoin.pdf">Colored Coins</a> from the early days of&nbsp; Bitcoin had this sort of economic problem. In order to stay secure, the native ZEC token must accrue value to ensure the security of the Zcash chain, because a 51% attack becomes feasible if the value of the additional assets becomes great enough to warrant the hashpower purchase.</p>



 Fee mechanisms 



<p>Fee mechanisms specify the price that must be paid to participate in an activity consistent with the underlying economics of the system. The most commonly known fee mechanism is the transaction fee mechanism used in Ethereum, which has undergone a tremendous amount of study and development, most recently with the deployment of <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md">EIP-1559</a>.&nbsp;The fee mechanism in Ethereum historically used a first-price auction, meaning that the user included a fee (or bid) amount with their transaction and competed against others to get their transaction included in an upcoming block. With EIP-1559, this model changed to a fixed-price sale mechanism. The protocol sets the transaction fee and the user can choose to pay it or not.</p>



 Ethereum and Zcash contrasted 



<p>Fundamentally, Zcash and Ethereum are different blockchains; they have vastly different value propositions, and somewhat different security requirements (and therefore different token economics). Ethereum provides a programmable blockchain with state stored using distributed ledger technology. Zcash is a digital currency with strong privacy features. Fees in Ethereum pay for execution of smart contracts on the blockchain through use of “gas”, which is the unit of measurement for the computational effort required to execute operations on the Ethereum network. Since each Ethereum transaction requires computational resources to execute, each transaction requires a “gas fee” of a sufficient amount to pay for the requested computation. ZSAs, on the other hand, will not be programmable assets. The primary use case for ZSAs is to allow users to privately hold and transfer alternate assets, so fees based on computation complexity are not possible. We therefore feel a fee mechanism specific to the Zcash value proposition and consistent with the costs ZEC holders pay for core support services is an economic necessity if adding additional assets to the Zcash blockchain.</p>



 Process overview 



<p>A full description of the process followed by GMU, including the setup and execution of their simulations, as well as a description of the mechanisms we submitted and their analysis can be found in the draft copy of the GMU report. In short, the process involved setting up a base economic model of Zcash as it stands today and then evaluating different mechanisms against that model.&nbsp;</p>



 Fundamental design constraints 



<p>As we began the mechanism design phase, we developed a set of constraints that, in part, shaped the mechanisms we submitted. We felt an ideal mechanism would be constrained by the following criteria:</p>



  Must support the mission long term and sustain the Zcash Development Fund  Should not give an unfair advantage to something that would be an alternative to ZEC  Should not rely on transaction fees as an economic lever, since we’re committed to low transaction fees  Should avoid revealing more information due to the choice of fee than is already revealed by transaction metadata  Can depend on scalability, but not programmability  Can require proof of stake if the economics of the underlying protocol have a potential positive impact on the mechanism design  Should not alter Zcash’s BTC-like monetary policy with supply remaining capped at 21 million  



 Mechanism evaluation 



<p>We had several working sessions with GMU reviewing the mechanisms, and they evaluated those mechanisms using the following criteria:</p>



  Does the mechanism impose costs on ZSA holders that are fair and consistent with those imposed upon current ZEC holders for core support services?&nbsp;  Does the mechanism extend Zcash property rights on ZECs to ZSAs?  Does the mechanism reduce the security concerns that emerge as a consequence of adding ZSA support to the blockchain?&nbsp;  Does the mechanism provide a means to cover additional protocol costs and Zcash core support services?  How does the mechanism incentivize user trust in the blockchain and, subsequently, the transactions they make?  How does the mechanism incentivize miner behavior?&nbsp;  



 Conclusion 



<p>We enjoyed working with Dr. McCabe and his team at CEELab on this study. We were very impressed with how quickly they came up to speed on Zcash and their understanding of Zcash economics. Our goal was to identify potential fee mechanisms that were consistent with the sustainability and privacy properties of Zcash, and that had an overall positive impact on current economics. As stated above, we believe some proposed mechanisms did meet this goal. However, we would be supportive of any secure mechanism that has a positive impact on Zcash economics and supports our mission. The importance of economics cannot be overstated, and they will certainly become increasingly important as we contemplate a move to proof of stake.</p>



<p>Special thanks to Nate Wilcox for authoring all the proposed fee mechanisms!</p>

The Open Meta DAO™ held its first formal AMA and the topic was the Emergence Protocol and SDK. The <a href="https://www.openmetadao.com/">Open Meta</a> community had a chance to hear first-hand from the developers.<p>On May 11, Open Meta hosted an AMA on all things Emergence. Emergence is a protocol, offered to the community by Open Meta, which gives developers plug-and-play wallet, persona and contract integration in game&nbsp;engines.</p><p>Open Meta wants to provide a digital gaming environment that offers interoperability, privacy, and abundance — and Emergence is allowing us to do just that. It has recently been released for private beta testing, which will give us valuable feedback as we continue our development.</p> The Role of Emergence <p>“Whether you’re established as a Web 2.0 developer, or you’re someone who is brand new in Web 3.0 and just wants to build from that, we’ve simplified the technology. All the stuff under the hood — the wallet authentication, the connecting and integration of blockchains, the smart contract development, the inventory service to query the blockchain based on what’s in the wallet — these are the building blocks and blueprints that we’re focused on. It’s extremely complex, so Emergence is meant to simplify that and do the heavy lifting for you so you can move natively into all this.” — Ryan</p><p>“We’re ensuring you can build on top of things that have already been built. You can create new applications and new use cases for existing, previously centralized applications. We’re talking really long term here.” — Agustin</p><p>“What’s been driving us has been a focus on utility and bringing that to Emergence SDK. That means bringing metadata. What we’ve been looking at first has been the avatar. From profile pictures to collections of 3D avatars. We’re not building our own avatars; we’re focusing on building the bridge between the different game worlds. Trying to bridge and make sure people get that utility.” — Aleissia</p> The Challenges of Creating Emergence <p>“We wanted to make this technology possible without worrying about ‘will it work on this chain?’ With all the research we’ve done, we’ve found out that the community is growing as a network and as a set of developers and tools that are being built every day. Another thing we found out is that it’s being built for the web, so what happens when we bring this technology to&nbsp;games?</p><p>We’ve seen tools that attempt to bring these things to Unity or Unreal, but they solve specific issues. They’re not concerned about usability. We want to give possibilities to game developers so they can connect to their&nbsp;players.</p><p>We’re working to help developers write things on-chain and off-chain while keeping an identity. You’re going to be able to have an avatar system that can be used on all compatible systems. These are complex aspects of game development but we’re solving them, so you don’t have to write code all over again.” — Agustin</p><p>“A major challenge has been [thinking about] how we start showing that this is a functional 3D avatar that can be brought into any game world? Another one is that there are no standards in creating these avatars. The team has been really focused on the smart contracts on what these avatars do and can represent.” — Aleissia</p><p>The team shared the process involved in bringing functional avatars into game engines and making them interoperable across NFT collections. For a deeper dive, <a href="https://medium.com/@ops_25520/developing-fully-interoperable-nft-avatars-with-emergence-560e072d17b8">check out this post</a>, or watch the&nbsp;video!</p><p>“Most collections don’t have a standardized approach. It can be hard to get your hands on the models, even when you own the NFT. Often, they’re not game ready because they’re not rigged — or they’re rigged in an incorrect way. We’ve come up with a standard where we can collect models, run them through a toolchain, and create models that we can use in games. We’ve made the value of the tokens go up as they actually have utility.” — Chris</p> The Differences Between an Avatar and a&nbsp;Persona <p>“A persona is more than just your identity, your avatar, and how that looks. It’s about what you actually do in these game spaces. This could be any kind of data that you decide you want to be stored with your avatar. It can be performance-related, actions you’ve done, or inventory that is tied to the avatar. There’s a huge opportunity around this.” — Aleissia</p><p>“A good way to think of personas from our perspective is the next step after a profile picture. Other than people making money from them, why are people so excited by them? Because you identify with them in some way. This is the first step of how this asset class has made its way into your identity. The utility that’s promised from the next stage of PFPs is the persona.” — Ryan</p> The Importance of Emergence for the&nbsp;DAO <p>“Everything I’ve ever done has been driven by values. A lot of the decisions we’ve made have been unique ones. We didn’t just build tech, put a paywall up, and set up an enterprise business. The reason this is a movement, not a company, is because this is a shared vision of a whole generation. This is something our team has been thinking about for a long time and something in the zeitgeist we’re all finding alignment on.” — Ryan</p><p>“Open sourcing something as a protocol, making it public so good people can build upon it, and enabling composability and a toolset — these are important choices we made. This was going to start as a product but it’s now just one part of a protocol that will bridge the divide between engines and the web, as well as giving people a way to coordinate. It’s going to become yours as much as it is ours.” — Ryan</p><p>“We’ve been putting just as much energy into the game engine technology as we have into the decentralized governance and the things that hold accountability for millions of identities. Instead of housing that in a for-profit, closed company, I’ve chosen to do it in an open-sourced way so the community can get some skin in the game, influence, contribute, and own it. That’s what our values are.” — Ryan</p> The Future of Emergence and Open&nbsp;Meta <p>“We’re really focused on the DAO, so as we get these tools into the hands of our community, they’ll influence what’s going to be next. We’re focused on developing what everyone here wants! After the avatars, a big next step is going to be our inventory service. We want to provide utility to any kind of object within the game. Users can have utility that updates more frequently.” — Aleissia</p><p>“By working more closely with game engines and the community, we can really become the bridge we want to be for the community and developers.” — Aleissia</p><p>“We’re at a threshold right now where we’re going to move into the next stage of things. We hold the key to that. We’ve built the tech, we have a great team, and we have the community behind us. Now we’ve developed a strong base, we’re going to ramp up and give more opportunities to the community.” — Ryan</p><p>[When asked about collaborating with large Web 2.0 corporations like Meta] — “I don’t think we need validation from big corporations. We’re more punk than corporate, and more fun. Expecting the validation to come as proof of our success might be part of the problem. We really have to create a new exit for ourselves. I’m not going to change what we’re saying and what we’re building, just to work with them. But if they want to truly adopt those standards to be part of us, I’m not opposed to it.” — Ryan</p><p>[When asked about how people can access private beta testing] — “If you contact Vincent and get your emails over to us, that’s one way to do it. We’re aiming to have an open beta by summer.” — Aleissia</p><p>To learn more and to help us map and build the future of the Open Metaverse please join us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/openmeta">Discord</a> and follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenMetaDAO">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Want to put your BLANK to work? We hear you. Here's a recap of our ongoing liquidity program. Providing liquidity does not only offer an attractive return but helps others by ensuring sufficient liquidity for purchasing or selling tokens.&nbsp;Win-win.</p><p>You can provide liquidity on either Uniswap or QuickSwap decentralized exchanges. On QuickSwap, we just bolstered our Liquidity Program by adding 90k BLANK tokens for 3 months. Meanwhile, Uniswap rewards are updated each&nbsp;month.</p> Liquidity Program&nbsp;Details  Expiration <p>We plan to carry out the Liquidity Program until we launch native BLANK&nbsp;staking.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>Whenever an Ethereum block is minted (which happens every 10 to 15 seconds or so), BLANK tokens will be given out to those who provide liquidity. There is no minimum or maximum amount of LP tokens required. Every participant is rewarded proportionally, based on their percentage contribution to liquidity pool.</p><p>You can add or remove liquidity freely as the system will track the liquidity pool at all times. Every time there is a change of distribution in the pool, we will readjust the reward proportions for that&nbsp;period.</p> Expected returns <p>In the beginning, when fewer people participate and each liquidity provider has a large percentage of the pool, the rewards are higher. As the pool size increases, rewards will decrease since each liquidity provider will have a smaller percentage of LP ownership. Those no longer satisfied with their return will leave, increasing the reward for those who&nbsp;stay.</p><p>This process will continue until an equilibrium is reached and the market determines the optimal return for providing liquidity.</p><p>At the time of writing, you can earn as much as 42% annual return on your tokens by providing liquidity to Uniswap pool. If more participants join, the return will decrease as you will hold a smaller percentage of LP ownership. If participants leave, the opposite will&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Keen to start? Here's&nbsp;how.</p> Provide liquidity on QuickSwap   Connect to <a href="https://quickswap.exchange/#/add/0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174/0xf4C83080E80AE530d6f8180572cBbf1Ac9D5d435">QuickSwap</a> (we recommend using BlockWallet).

BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating friction and making privacy accessible for everyone.</p><p>BlockWallet protects you and ensures privacy by default. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain apps, BlockWallet routes all node requests through Privacy Proxies, which masks the IP address and other metadata, that can be used to identify and track you on a blockchain. You can also use the Privacy Pools feature, powered by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zk-snarks">zk-SNARKs</a> technology, to deposit and mix funds in a smart contract. This allows transferring funds without links to your history and identity on the blockchain, effectively rendering them untraceable. BlockWallet offers integrated Flash-Bot Protection, shielding you from sandwich attacks when you trade on DEXes. Meanwhile, the Phishing Protection feature combats phishing scams by generating unique artwork on all sensitive pages.</p><p>BlockWallet is not a compromise. It’s privacy-first, but it still packs all features you would expect from a wallet. With full Web 3.0 support, the wallet allows you to connect to any&nbsp;dApp.</p><p>Become a part of the BlockWallet community today:</p><p><a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Homepage</a> | <a href="https://blockwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetBlockWallet">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/blockwallet">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/69gvNKatdb">Discord</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EKVZ2xWXEH">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://hello@blockwallet.io/">E-mail</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet/provide-liquidity-and-earn-blank-on-uniswap-and-quickswap-21d54f9f2494">Provide Liquidity and Earn BLANK on Uniswap and QuickSwap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet">BlockWallet</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Nym mixnet APY — initial simulations for the first three&nbsp;months <p>The Nym mixnet is a global decentralized network that provides a privacy layer for digital communications for any application. The network is composed of mix nodes that earn rewards for providing privacy. Those rewards are then distributed between mix nodes (for operating the infrastructure) and delegators (people who have delegated stake to that&nbsp;node).</p><p>Anyone holding native NYM tokens can stake into the Nym network by delegating tokens to mix nodes and earn a share of mix node rewards. In fact, this helps secure the network and ensure high quality of&nbsp;service!</p><p>So as a NYM token holder, can simulations provide a guess on what APY you could expect from delegating to a mix node in the Nym&nbsp;network?</p><p>In a recent academic <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-cryptoecon-paper.pdf">paper</a> and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-science-and-simulations-behind-nym-token-economics-d0b89d9f8189">blogpost</a> we described results for simulations with a full supply of NYM tokens in circulation. But in the real world, the staking supply will be considerably smaller until August when it begins to increase quarterly. This impacts the APY making it much higher in the first quarter while total stake supply is low, with it tailing off as quarterly vesting&nbsp;happens.</p><p>This is a blog post based on an academic paper and not an investment prospectus or financial advice. We use the term ‘APY’ in a loose generic sense, and are relying on hypothetical scenarios using experimental technology. Actual results using the technology will vary widely. It’s quite possible that this venture could result in loss of monetary funds for anyone who uses the software. Any participant in an actual network is expected to do their own research rather than relying on these simulation-based experiments.</p> Results <p>The initial simulations for the first quarter show a median result of up to 45% annualized returns (about 3%-4% each month) for delegators to mix nodes with 90%-100% stake saturation. (Note that anything above that does not increase reward rates). The median returns for mix node operators can be significantly higher.</p><p>The max annualized returns are above 50% (for highest reputation, meaning fully saturated nodes). At the lower end of the reputation scale, calculations show an up to 10–20% APY for delegations to mix nodes with stake saturation around&nbsp;20%.</p> How were these calculated <p>For those of you who want to understand the mechanics behind these simulations, here is a little more background.</p><p>Returns on delegations depend on total amount of rewards available (monthly emission of 2% of mixmining pool) and the supply available for staking (98.5M until August), as well as individual mix node parameters such as stake saturation. Here are the parameters and assumptions that returned the simulation-based results&nbsp;above:</p>  The total staking supply for the first quarter will be approximately 98.5M (this is the total including the CoinList sale plus the rewards distributed to testnet participants).  The reward set of mix nodes is 720, of which 600 are active, and there are 1440 bonded nodes with different compositions of bonded and delegated stake. All nodes have monthly costs of $40, take a profit margin of 10%, and are assumed to have perfect performance.  10% of the available staking supply (about 9.8M) is bonded to mix nodes and an additional 50% (49M) is delegated. The remaining 40% is assumed to not be&nbsp;staked.  The APY considers stakeholders that delegate their stake to high-reputation nodes (defined as having at least 90% saturation), and it’s computed as the median APY of all high-reputation nodes.  Delegate returns and APY are calculated after operator costs and 10% in profit fees have been deducted by the node operator.  Actual returns depend on the node parameters — read more delegating <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-delegated-staking-reputation-rewards-and-community-selection-bf0f346f7301">here</a> and on mixmining <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">here</a>.  <p><a href="https://mixnet.explorers.guru/mixnodes">Find a mix node</a> to delegate to.

<p>ZAKA is now ProofSpace. Come meet our new brand, and dive into our platform.</p> What is ProofSpace? <p>We believe privacy-preserving identity workflows should be simple and affordable for businesses to integrate.</p><blockquote>ProofSpace is an identity network wrapped with an advanced no-code platform for verifiable credentials.</blockquote><p>Delivered as SaaS or on-prem, our customers can build, validate and scale decentralised identity workflows and ecosystems without writing any&nbsp;code.</p><p>We take care of tricky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign ID (SSI)</a> tech, so our customers can focus on what they do&nbsp;best.</p> Where did ProofSpace come&nbsp;from? <p>We’ve been deep in dev and validation mode for the last three years: quietly blazing trails in SSI by implementing our platform in healthcare, education and international development.</p><p>While the pandemic has been tough for us, as it has been for a lot of start-ups, there are a few areas where we have been thriving:</p>  We’ve pushed our tech and products forward in a phenomenal way.  We’ve won a seat at the table of global leadership fora — WHO, WEF,&nbsp;etc.  We’ve learned A LOT about the value we bring — read on to find out&nbsp;:)  <blockquote>Market Insight: The Value of Reusable&nbsp;Identity</blockquote><blockquote>The market for reusable identity will expand 8x to $266.5bn by 2026 (Liminal 2022). Value in this market will be driven by “identity ecosystems”, where mutual trust enables identity credentials to be reused across a network, and for more than just on-boarding. This will bring down the incremental costs of digital trust, improve security, improve user experience and allow greater “freedom of movement” for users across the internet.</blockquote><blockquote>“Credentials” are defined broadly, including thinks like name, qualifications, booking references, account log-ins, crypto tokens and other&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><p>As demand for reusable identity grows in tandem with expectations of privacy, affordability and usability, models that are centralised or have big technical barriers to adoption are becoming unattractive.</p><p>ProofSpace is our response to five success criteria which stem from this market context: privacy, affordability, ease of validation, ease of scaling and network effects. Our no-code editors make it easy for engineering OR operations teams to build, validate and scale decentralised identity workflows and ecosystems. And portability of credentials in our identity network means each new user, service, ecosystem and blockchain adds network&nbsp;value.</p> OK, so why the name ProofSpace? <p>“Proof” indicates the functional value of verifiable credentials and our ability to help businesses quickly build, validate and scale-up.</p><p>“Space” is a nod to our no-code tools, the creativity with which those tools can be used and the potential for network effects on our platform.</p> Who do you serve and what problems do you solve for&nbsp;them? <p>We serve tech, product and operations teams in businesses that want to make better use of reusable identity for their customers, staff or assets. Web 3.0 is a big growth area for ProofSpace. We’re already working with Cardano and plan to expand to other blockchain platforms this year. We also have anchor customers in e-Government and education, which goes to show the versatility of the platform.</p><blockquote>Market Insight: Four Challenges in the Reusable Identity&nbsp;Market</blockquote><blockquote>1. Privacy concerns make centralised models unattractive for web 3.0 and increasingly web 2.0 as&nbsp;well.</blockquote><blockquote>2. Decentralised models require teams to build on complex SDKs for simple workflows.</blockquote><blockquote>3. SDK integrators need to agree on governance configurations, such as credential schemas, to ensure credential interoperability.</blockquote><blockquote>4. Utility of credentials is constrained by wallet functionality and interoperability between blockchains, i.e. users face a proliferation of simple wallets with single-use credentials.</blockquote><p>In our web dashboard, available as SaaS or on-prem, tech or operations teams can use our no-code schema, credential and interaction editors for configuring and deploying multi-network decentralised identity solutions to end users, who use a free mobile&nbsp;App.</p> What does all this mean for reusable ID and&nbsp;SSI? <p>We’re bound to say this, but we believe ProofSpace is what the decentralised identity market has been missing. We eliminate the barriers to entry for SSI and disintegrate the long-term incremental costs of digital&nbsp;trust.</p><p>We also give people a way to build a portfolio of personal credentials that are useful across the internet, allowing them the same, if not more, privacy that they have in the physical&nbsp;world.</p> Where do you see ProofSpace in&nbsp;5-years? <p>We see ProofSpace becoming a B2C digital marketplace, powered by user-held identity credentials. In practice this will be an accumulation of blockchains, ecosystems and services across which interactions and transactions are powered by interoperable verifiable credentials and smart contracts.</p>ProofSpace Identity&nbsp;Network Where can I learn more about ProofSpace? <p>Visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.proofspace.id/">website</a>.</p><p>Sign up to an upcoming <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/proofspace-weekly-discovery-webinar-tickets-321651025877">discovery webinar</a>, every Tuesday at 4pm&nbsp;UTC.</p><p>Check out the articles and videos in our <a href="https://proofspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PSM/overview">knowledge base</a>.</p><p>Learn-by-doing, just <a href="https://platform.proofspace.id/customer-frontend/">sign up</a> for&nbsp;free!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/proofspace/introducing-proofspace-30f947770167">Introducing, ProofSpace!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/proofspace">ProofSpace</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>We’re glad to announce that the bug preventing users from unstaking on the Ethereum Mainnet has been fixed. Users of Classic Staking on this network are now able to unstake their $ZKP and claim their staking rewards.</p> What happened? <p>The recent completion of Panther’s Classic Staking program on the Ethereum Mainnet was followed by the discovery of an unfortunate bug where the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf463713521af5ce31ad18f6914f3706493f10e5">RewardPool</a> contract throws an exception at the time of unstaking tokens, making it impossible for users to unstake them.</p><p>3,555,000 $ZKP that were supposed to be staking rewards were irretrievably locked in the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x347a58878d04951588741d4d16d54b742c7f60fc">RewardMaster</a> contract because of this bug. The situation denied all $ZKP stakers on Ethereum Mainnet the opportunity to access their rewards. As such, the Panther development team proposed a fix to ensure that users could receive their earned rewards as initially approved by the DAO.</p><p>Consequently, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?utm_campaign=DAO%20Proposals&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_6oKXiKdt66LEu10k1uxp5gW3DNFbcAzAFPYPQ1RIiYmgXtK4t6qnimq9ybdybTUxg8kiX#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x2bf595137b5fe3f0fdea29dcb85ab0a0be6fffbc3ea3b7cd9aecb966ab8aa887">PIP-5</a> was issued with the Panther team’s solution and passed with 99.98% of votes. And the unstaking bug was fixed.</p> Then Came the Snapshot Bug <p>Just as we saw the proposal close with a favorable outcome and got ready to trigger its automatic execution, we discovered that the “Execute proposal” button on Snapshot.org was gone.</p>The “Execute proposal” button. Or, at least, the place where it ought to be.<p>This happened due to a bug in the Snapshot platform’s UI.</p><p>In Snapshot, a set of data defines every transaction of each proposal, which is then represented as a hash. Anyone can see this transaction data for proposals.</p><p>Due to this bug, the hash that the Snapshot.org UI generated was incorrect. This made it impossible for smart contracts to “recognize” transactions, making the UI unable to submit them. Direct interaction with the smart contract was then required to execute the proposal.</p><p>There were two actions that we needed to take to solve this:</p>  Get in touch with the Snapshot.org team to help them solve this bug as soon as possible.  <p>This involved our Senior Software Architect, Adam Spiers, collaborating with the Snapshot.org team. Adam provided support and expertise throughout <a href="https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot/issues/2328">the entire bug fix</a>, which is being solved as you read this.</p><p>2. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e">Sticking to our decentralization principles</a>, have a non-team member who staked on Classic Staking execute the proposal manually.</p><p>If we couldn’t follow a purely decentralized approach by asking Snapshot.org to trigger the proposal, we could have an anonymous community member execute the proposal. The Panther team supported this person along the way and verified it was implemented to the letter afterward, using the code embedded in the proposal.</p><p>In the end, the outcome was satisfactory — the bug fixes were applied correctly, and now stakers of $ZKP on Ethereum Mainnet will be able to withdraw their assets and their rewards seamlessly.</p> Advanced Staking is on the way! <p>This bug fix made a dent in our projected timeline for Advanced Staking development and release. With the bug fixed, the Panther team can now focus on getting back to speed with the projected roadmap.</p><p>If you still have your $ZKP staked in Classic Staking on either Ethereum or Polygon networks, remember that you’ll have to unstake to take part in Advanced Staking.</p> Conclusion <p>The unstaking bug was unfortunate, and the problem was exacerbated by the Snapshot.org bug that we found.</p><p>Regardless, the Panther team has worked hard to rectify all the issues, and now it’s time to move on to the testing and launch of Advanced Staking!</p><p>Stay tuned for more news to come and how you can get involved and rewarded for helping us test.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

The Emergence team has developed a proof of concept for making avatars from multiple NFT collections interoperable in the Open Metaverse. The result gives a hint of the types of experiences players will have and how they will express their identity through&nbsp;NFTs.<p>In a global first, the Emergence development team has created a working prototype for seamlessly importing avatars from multiple NFT collections into a game&nbsp;engine.</p><p>The achievement helps to demonstrate that an automated solution is possible for a challenging problem: how to get avatars from multiple NFT collections, often developed with different standards for avatar skeletal and rigging systems, to be brought seamlessly into game engines like Unreal and&nbsp;Unity.</p><p>For future players in the Open Metaverse, this demonstrates that it will be possible to easily use and switch between avatars from different NFT collections.</p><p>Attending a concert in the Open Metaverse? Show off your latest avatar NFT. And when you switch avatars, you’re also switching to the on-chain data to which that collection is associated.</p><p>But maybe it’s better to show you what we mean! Check out this video of the prototype:</p> Great for Users, Incredible for Developers <p>Right now, making avatars from different NFT collections interoperable is a long, manual process. Many developers have declined to even work on it because it’s a challenge to ensure that the animations and physics of the avatars’ activities work appropriately across game spaces while also storing the information on-chain.</p><p>Emergence is changing this by creating a protocol upon which tools, pipelines, and standards can be used to automate the process of bringing any 3D avatar NFT into any game world. Think of it as an ‘out-of-the-box’ toolkit to make Open Metaverse worlds compatible with different avatars. In the future, switching on-chain personas from different NFT collections will be as easy as changing a digital&nbsp;skin.</p><p>As mentioned in our previous <a href="https://medium.com/@ops_25520/the-emergence-protocol-the-role-of-game-engines-in-the-open-metaverse-e9f6fecbfed">article</a>, Emergence gives developers plug-and-play sovereignty and security tools for building an Open Metaverse. This includes the necessary tools to ensure users can pick avatars from many different NFT collections. Developers will be able to easily make their projects ‘avatar-ready,’ and users will have a much better experience with the NFT avatars of their&nbsp;choice.</p><p>The goal is to work through the more difficult challenges now, so other developers can focus on the most important goal: creating an Open Metaverse that everyone can&nbsp;enjoy.</p> The Technical Challenge MetaMike from the Open Meta Discord community <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/itsmetamike_nft-metaverse-opensea-activity-6922524402232291329-7FMk/?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app">outlined</a> the steps he had to take for just one NFT avatar to become game&nbsp;ready.<p>If you’re not sure what you’re looking at in the above image, don’t worry. The developers are the ones in the coding trenches making sure that you have a fantastic front-facing experience. But the above list is an indication of the difficulty that is faced when building the Open Metaverse the right&nbsp;way.</p><p>That image showcases 20 steps, 4+ file types, 5+ programs, lots of back and forth, and massive amounts of coffee for just one NFT avatar to become game&nbsp;ready.</p><p>For reference, there are currently an estimated 80,000+ NFT collections on Ethereum alone. There isn’t enough coffee in the world to make going through this manual process feasible every single&nbsp;time.</p><p>The Emergence team set out to test whether their collective experience in managing tools and pipelines for AAA game development could apply to this “web3 challenge”.</p><p>The use case seemed clear enough: NFT Collectors will increasingly buy into collections that include 3D models of the characters/personas. They will want to use these PFPs/avatars in the Open Metaverse, developers will want to make this possible, and no one will want to manage this process manually!</p><p>Now, if you come from a game development background you’ll know that this is no easy feat. An avatar is more than just a 3D object: it’s a fully rigged virtual being. And it needs to adapt to the physics and constraints of systems that can range from a high resolution world run on a desktop to an AR, VR or mobile&nbsp;device.</p> The Emergence Protocol <p>The Open Metaverse roadmap is based on the principle that our wallets, personas, avatars, and inventories should be portable. Avatar interoperability is an innovative and technically difficult solution that is a key part of this vision. Achieving it won’t be easy, but Emergence is solving tough problems that will have major benefits for both end users and developers.</p><p>Emergence provides simple-to-use functionality to connect to Web 3.0 technologies and create the infrastructure for the Open Metaverse. It acts as an in-game overlay, a mobile application, a browser extension, and even works with VR/AR, providing an ever-present interface to manage portable digital identities, secure credentials, fiat and crypto payments, digital property, and more. It is a key utility of the Open Meta DAO and will allow members to develop prototypes with leading-edge tools and automate laborious processes.</p><p>Open Meta DAO is a governance model and community using Emergence to develop a robust infrastructure for an Open Metaverse. That means Open Source, Open Community, Open Collaboration, and Open Doors. By paving the way now, we can make sure that this becomes the road most traveled by developers and users alike, as we build the Open Metaverse together.</p>Our digital future should comprise fully rendered, three-dimensional, customizable extensions of ourselves that work across platforms and unite&nbsp;people. Roadmap for the Open Metaverse <p>We are now seeing huge strides being taken towards building the Open Metaverse, a platform that will serve as the key inflection point that thrusts us into an immersive digital future. A major component of this new paradigm will be the avatars that serve as digital extensions of ourselves.</p><p>NFT Avatars will be how we interface with the Open Metaverse, interact with people, seize opportunities, and feel the thrill of truly novel experiences.</p><p>The impact of the Open Metaverse experience will be dampened if the only way to engage is with proprietary, cartoonish profile pictures (PFPs) that can’t cross platforms. Imagine an Open Metaverse that requires you to continuously log out and back in, change platforms and avatars, and play by different rules in a series of digital siloes. It sounds far too rooted in the limitations of Web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>The Open Metaverse needs interoperable on-chain avatars. Our digital future should comprise fully rendered, three-dimensional, customizable extensions of ourselves that work across platforms and unite people. If we need or want to change our avatars for different situations, we should be able to seamlessly switch while maintaining privacy and keeping the necessary information on the blockchain. We’re not just talking about NFT “swaps,” but multiple decentralized 3D Avatar collections that run in any world within the Open Metaverse.</p><p>The Emergence Protocol aims to help make it easy to achieve this interoperability for developers, while providing delight for the people who will travel in the Open Metaverse.</p><p>As a key utility of the Open Meta DAO, Emergence is the product of a development team inspired by and working in collaboration with the Open Meta community.</p><p>To learn more and to help us map and build the future of the Open Metaverse please join us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/openmeta">Discord</a> and follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenMetaDAO">Twitter</a>.</p>

 Staking in the Cosmos Network — Making the Ecosystem More&nbsp;Secure <p>Cosmos has grown into one of the largest blockchain ecosystems today, with more than $100 billion of digital assets under management. The market capitalization of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains like Cosmos chains is important, as the more assets staked on-chain, the more secure the network. Higher market cap chains are less vulnerable to threats such as 51% attacks and provide greater security and assurance to their communities.</p><p>You can help to play an active role in keeping the Cosmos network secure by staking your assets on-chain. In return for lending security to the network, you’ll receive incentives in the form of staking rewards. In this article, we’ll take a look at the benefits and risks of staking and what to keep in mind when selecting a validator. We’ll also examine the main staking solutions available (as well as some alternatives) in the Cosmos network&nbsp;today.</p> What Is&nbsp;Staking? <p>Staking is the process of committing your tokens for a period of time to secure the chain and earn rewards, giving you a chance to help grow the network and make your assets work for you at the same time. With staking, the blockchain uses your tokens to help secure the network and sign transactions in return for staking rewards. Staking is possible on PoS blockchains like Cosmos chains, that use validators to verify transactions according to their portion of tokens staked in the blockchain (their “stake”).</p><p>With staking, you are never required to relinquish control of your funds to a centralized authority. Your tokens never actually leave your wallet and you have custody over them the whole time. With no lengthy waiting time, rewards are paid out daily (sometimes even multiple times a day) and, while staking involves a small lockup period, it’s usually no more than 7–28 days, depending on the blockchain and token in question. It’s possible to stake your tokens using a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance or Kraken. However, taking custody of your own crypto means that you have to trust a third&nbsp;party.</p> Choosing a Validator <p>When you stake your tokens, you need to choose a validator to stake them with. This is called delegating your tokens. In this scenario, you become a delegator. Validators on PoS blockchains verify transactions to make sure that they are accurate and valid and then add them to the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Before choosing a validator, you should consider several factors, including validator uptime, activity history, the amount of commission that the validator takes from your rewards, the unbonding time, and the validator’s reputation. Be sure to look into the validator’s history to make sure they don’t have a reputation for misbehaving. If the validator has consistent downtime or double signs any transactions, they will be punished by the network in a process called “slashing.”</p><p>When a validator is slashed, some of their tokens are burned as a penalty, resulting in a loss of funds and missed rewards for both the delegator and the validator; for Cosmos chains, those penalties go from 0.01% for a validator being down for more than 10,000 blocks (liveness slash) to 5% for a validator committing a double sign event on the blockchain.</p><p>That’s why it’s essential to select a validator with a good track record who is actively involved in growing the network and who has a shared alignment in its success. You can find information about validators from several resources. Checking <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators">Mintscan.io</a> is a good place to start and will show you how active validators are in participating in governance, what their commissions and uptime are, etc. Many individual staking solutions mentioned later on also offer descriptions and information about their network validators.</p><p>Also, consider delegating your staked tokens to more than one validator, and keep in mind that if you choose a validator outside of the top 10 in a network, you will reduce the chances of any individual validator owning more than 50% of the market&nbsp;share.</p><p>Helping to keep the network decentralized is in your control. It may be tempting to choose a centralized exchange as you recognize the name, but this is not in the best interest of the network in terms of security and decentralization. Centralized exchanges often ignore votes which makes it difficult for proposals to reach quorum. They also don’t develop or contribute to the network beyond their own needs. Therefore, you should make a careful assessment before deciding to stake with centralized exchanges for the sake of decentralization.</p><p>Choosing a validator with 0% commission may also seem like a good idea in order to maximize your returns. But keep in mind that running a validator is a lot of work and comes at a cost to the operator. The commission rate is a contribution to the validator that is used to help cover the expenses of running it. Choosing zero commission may not promote a sustainable network; whereas supporting validators through commission will.</p><p>It can take a significant amount of time to understand the differences between validators and how they contribute to the ecosystem. But it’s worth putting in the work and doing some research to ensure that your delegations are helping to empower the validators that are actually contributing to the ecosystem.</p> The Benefits of&nbsp;Staking <p>Once you decide to support a crypto project, if you simply hold your tokens, they will sit idle in your wallet. If you decide to stake your tokens, on the other hand, you will help to secure the network and support the ecosystem rather than keeping your assets on an exchange. By adding “stake” to the blockchain, you help to make it more resistant to attacks and strengthen its ability to process transactions.</p><p>As mentioned, you’ll also have the chance to earn staking rewards. The rewards vary depending on the token in question and the validator commission. You can claim your rewards on a daily basis or even several times a day. This gives you a way of securing your tokens, as well as securing the network. And, unlike keeping your tokens on a centralized exchange where you have no control over your private keys, when you state your tokens with the blockchain, your tokens never actually leave your wallet so you are in control at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>Since your tokens are locked up for a period of time, you also avoid the risk of panic selling in adverse market conditions. You may also be eligible to receive new tokens from various airdrops as an additional reward for helping secure the blockchain.</p> The Risks of&nbsp;Staking <p>Staking is not entirely risk-free, so it’s important to understand what risks are involved and the best way to minimize them. Crypto assets are volatile and one main factor to keep in mind is market risk. If the price of the token goes down, you will have to absorb a loss in income despite receiving rewards. You also won’t be able to sell right away because of the lockup period. This may be a blessing in disguise depending on your tolerance to volatility!</p><p>Another risk associated with staking is the validator you choose, as detailed above. If your validator misbehaves, part of your stake may be slashed (up to 5% in most networks). There is also always a risk of external threats such as 51% attacks. 51% attacks are uncommon in established blockchains like the Cosmos Hub that are secured by billions of dollars of digital assets making the cost of an attack prohibitive. However, emerging blockchains in the bootstrapping stage are more vulnerable to attack. As a rule of thumb, the higher the staking rewards, the higher the potential risk.</p> Staking in the Cosmos&nbsp;Network <p>If you are interested in supporting the growth of a blockchain ecosystem and want to earn rewards, there are several solutions in the Cosmos network that allow you to stake your tokens. We’ll take a look at the most widely used noncustodial products that let you keep control of your&nbsp;tokens.</p> The Difference Between Wallets and Dashboards <p>Before diving into the solutions available to you, a quick note on the difference between wallets and dashboards, and how you will need to use them together in order to stake your&nbsp;tokens.</p> Wallets <p>Crypto wallets keep your private keys (the passwords that allow you to access your cryptocurrencies) safe and accessible, allowing you to take custody of your own assets. There are many different types of crypto wallets from mobile apps and web-based wallets to hardware wallets and paper&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Software wallets are unique to blockchain ecosystems (i.e. Cosmos or Ethereum), whereas hardware wallets usually support cryptocurrencies from multiple blockchain ecosystems (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cosmos). The main types of wallets are web-based wallets, such as Keplr or MetaMask, that work as a browser extension, desktop wallets, such as Atomic Wallet or Cosmostation, that are used on your computer and connect to a hardware wallet, and mobile wallets, such as Keplr or Exodus, that allow you to store crypto, send/receive transactions, and even import an existing wallet into the app by scanning a QR&nbsp;code.</p><p>Hardware wallets like Ledger allow you to keep your assets offline in cold storage and connect with an application (a dashboard) like Emeris or Keplr to transact. While your staking tokens always remain in your wallet, without connecting to a dashboard, you would not actually be able to stake your tokens. So, let’s take a look at how dashboards work.</p> Dashboards <p>Dashboards (or interfaces) connect to your wallet, whether software or hardware, and allow you to stake your tokens. Regardless of the wallet you use, you will be required to “sign” all transactions with your wallet to make sure that you actually want to take an action. The easiest way to stake your tokens quickly is by using a browser extension like Keplr. You will simply need to open up the dashboard, connect your wallet, decide what tokens you want to stake to which validator, and sign the transaction.</p><p>Thanks to the dashboard, you can see your token balances, pending rewards, the validators you stake with, and more, depending on the solution you use. We’ll be providing links to step-by-step guides and abundant resources throughout the article, so keep on&nbsp;reading!</p><p>The main staking solutions available to you in the Cosmos network, like Cosmostaion and Keplr, fall into both the dashboard and wallet categories, while others, like Emeris and OmniFlix, simply offer dashboard functionality. It should be noted that staking solutions are constantly evolving, so we’ll provide an update on new features later on in the&nbsp;year.</p> Cosmostation <p>Cosmostation is a wallet and dashboard solution, providing a mobile wallet for convenient staking straight from your phone as well as a web wallet that allows you to connect and sign transactions from your hardware wallet. As a long-standing contributor to the Cosmos ecosystem, Cosmostation has earned a solid reputation for providing outstanding end-user support through products like Cosmos explorer <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos">Mintscan</a>, and both its app and web wallets. Cosmostation also supports more than 30 networks, providing users with many&nbsp;choices.</p><p>Cosmostation also operates an enterprise-level validator node on many networks, providing reassurance when it comes to selecting a reliable validator. Using Cosmostation, you have everything you need to stake from within one place. Interacting with the web or mobile wallet is fairly intuitive and Cosmostation supports a wide range of IBC-enabled tokens. Cosmostation also has plenty of <a href="https://www.cosmostation.io/files/cosmostation_guide_web_en.pdf">support guides</a> and resources to help if you get&nbsp;stuck.</p><p>If you want to select different validators, you can see their history, activity, and uptime straight from inside the validator section on Mintscan. You also have the convenience of fiat to crypto transactions through integrations like Moonpay. Coming up on the roadmap later this year, Cosmostation will be launching a browser extension for additional convenience. To get started staking via your mobile wallet, download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wannabit.io.cosmostaion">Cosmostation for Android</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wannabit.io.cosmostaion">iOS&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Keplr <p>Keplr has quickly become the go-to wallet for the Cosmos ecosystem and staking using the Keplr wallet and dashboard is very straightforward. Keplr offers a mobile wallet app for iOS and Android as well as a browser extension similar to Metamask which is the easiest way to start staking safely. In addition to the browser extension, Keplr provides a simple dashboard to see your available tokens, staking balances, and rewards across the 20+ chains that it currently natively supports. Cosmos chains can also integrate the <a href="https://wallet.keplr.app/#/dashboard">staking dashboard</a> to allow users to stake tokens within their own ecosystems.</p><p>Keplr’s browser extension allows for the simple signing of staking transactions that is easier and more convenient than plugging in a hardware wallet. Along with Cosmostation, Keplr supports one of the largest numbers of networks. Coming up on the roadmap in 2022, Keplr has several improvements to the interface planned to make the user experience even more fluid. One example of this is the validator section.</p><p>Choosing the right validators is vital and newcomers to Cosmos may not know which ones to select, so Keplr wants to help validators that are highly active to gain a significant amount of voting power. The team plans to do this by revamping the validator page and providing useful descriptions that recognize validator contributions in the staking dashboard. There will also be a way for validators to communicate with delegators to encourage greater interaction. Abundant resources for <a href="https://keplr.crunch.help/">staking on Keplr can be found&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Emeris <p>You can also stake 28 Cosmos ecosystem tokens using the Emeris dashboard. With an emphasis on simplicity, Emeris offers one of the cleanest and most user-friendly experiences around, providing easy visualization with a clear overview of staking balances and staking rewards for each chain, as well as a concentrated aggregate of all balances on the main portfolio page.</p><p>Emeris is currently in its beta version. The team will be adding more features in the run-up to its public launch, including version 2 of Emeris staking. Staking V2 comes complete with an auto-compound feature that takes staking rewards and auto-compounds them on compatible chains, removing the need to manually claim and restake periodically and maximizing rewards generation.</p><p>To stake using Emeris, you’ll need to download and connect the Keplr wallet. At public launch later this year, Emeris will provide users with a browser extension and mobile wallet for additional convenience. To try out staking with Emeris, <a href="https://app.emeris.com/welcome?utm_source=cosmos_blog&amp;utm_medium=staking_content">open the app here</a>. You can also check out a <a href="https://support.emeris.com/en/articles/5999925-staking-on-emeris-step-by-step-tutorial?utm_source=cosmos_blog&amp;utm_medium=staking_content">step-by-step staking guide</a> and find further resources here.</p> Other Staking Solutions Available  Atomic Wallet <p>Another solution for staking is Atomic Wallet, the first non-custodial wallet using cross-chain atomic swap technology. Supporting all the major blockchain ecosystems and over 300 tokens, Atomic Wallet is widely used in the crypto industry and has amassed more than 3 million users so far. Fiat to crypto transactions are available and you have a variety of token swaps instantly available.</p><p>Like Cosmostation, Atomic Wallet is available as a mobile wallet and a desktop wallet that connects with your hardware device. There is no browser extension currently. Staking using Atomic Wallet is very simple and being able to manage multiple chain tokens from one place provides a high level of convenience. APR rates are slightly lower with Atomic Wallet at 10% APR on ATOM and this solution currently only supports the Cosmos Hub (ATOM), no other Cosmos tokens yet. For more information about staking with <a href="https://atomicwallet.io/cosmos-atom-staking">Atomic Wallet please visit this&nbsp;link</a>.</p> OmniFlix inSync <p>OmniFlix is a long-term contributor to the Cosmos network, working with various Cosmos SDK-based projects since 2018, demonstrating a working prototype at <a href="https://v1.cosmos.network/goz">Game of Zones</a>, and launching the FlixNet-x series of testnets in 2021. OmniFlix builds multiple tools to facilitate the growth of the ecosystem, including several interfaces for various Cosmos SDK-based chains. Dedicated to providing blockchains with a way of enabling interactions with their communities, OmniFlix’s inSync staking interface has been integrated by a growing number of Cosmos chains, currently, 9, including <a href="https://juno.omniflix.co/">Juno</a>, Fetch, LikeCoin, <a href="https://cheqd.omniflix.co/">Cheqd</a>, <a href="https://chihuahua.omniflix.co/">Chihuahua</a>, <a href="https://comdex.omniflix.co/">Comdex, </a>and has been forked by Rizon, Celestia, and Stargaze, with more integrations on the&nbsp;horizon.</p><p>The OmniFlix inSync staking interface offers an easy, clean, and intuitive experience that is dedicated to staking and makes delegating tokens as simple as possible. OmniFlix inSync allows people to interact with new and up-and-coming chains, support their growth, and earn rewards from&nbsp;staking.</p><p>As an open-source tool, OmniFlix inSync won the Agoric testnet challenge in June 2021 and rolled out its first staking interface with Juno upon its mainnet launch. Plans for the year ahead include building infrastructure for NFT creators and communities that bring together delegators, validators, and other stakeholders, and help continue to grow the Cosmos ecosystem. Here’s a quick preview of what’s coming up for OmniFlix&nbsp;inSync.</p><p>To stake using the OmniFlix interface, you’ll need to download the Keplr wallet and stake directly with the chain in question.</p> BitSong <p>BitSong has also recently launched the <a href="https://wallet.bitsong.io/#/authentication/login">BitSong Multichain Wallet</a>, a simple, no-frills interface that Cosmos chains can integrate to easily interact with their communities. From inside the dashboard, users can stake their tokens, delegate, undelegate, redelegate, vote on proposals, send tokens, or, in the case of BitSong, bridge BTSG from ERC-20 to bitsong-mainnet. So far, the BitSong wallet supports seven Cosmos chains, including BitSong, Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Juno, LikeCoin, Chihuahua, and Stargaze, with more integrations in the pipeline.</p><p>Currently in its first version, users must connect the interface with the Keplr browser extension. Coming up on the roadmap, is the BitSong Chrome extension and the BitSong app for Ledger, providing simpler and faster access to the ecosystem. The BitSong team is also working on a feature enabling token holders to open governance proposals from within the wallet and the ability to view on-chain statistics. The Wallet is open-source and is available in <a href="https://github.com/bitsongofficial/wallet-dapp">this Github repository</a>. For more information, hop on over to the <a href="https://bitsongofficial.medium.com/cosmos-multichain-wallet-by-bitsong-is-live-938a2dfc148e">BitSong blog&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Please note that this list is not meant to be exhaustive. There are more than <a href="https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/wallets/">30 different wallets</a> available for you to choose from for staking your tokens. We hope to have provided a good starting point for your staking journey, highlighting the most commonly used solutions as well as some emerging and alternative options.</p> Final Thoughts <p>With multiple solutions available, depending on your personal preferences, staking in the Cosmos network is simple and accessible to all.

<p>Gross margins–which are essentially a company’s revenue from products and services minus the costs to deliver those products and services to customers–are one of the most important financial metrics for any startup and growing business. And yet, figuring out what goes into the “cost” for delivering products and services is not as simple as it may sound, particularly for high-growth software businesses that might use emerging business models or be leveraging new technology.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode from June 2020, a16z general partners Martin Casado, David George, and Sarah Wang talk all things gross margins, from early to late stage. Why do gross margins matter? When do they matter during a company’s growth? And how do you use them to plan for the future? The conversation ranges from the nuances of and strategy for calculating margins with things like cloud costs, freemium users, or implementation costs, to the impact margins can have on valuations.</p>

<p>We write this sentence at the bottom of <a href="https://privy.io">our website</a> and all the emails we send out to our&nbsp;users.</p><p>Behind every technical decision we make as engineers, we are working to shape the world, to make it more as we think it already is, or ought to be. Obviously <a href="https://www.deceptive.design/">dark patterns abound</a>, but beyond so blatantly engineering behavior, we project a worldview into everything we build. By making a “confirm” button blue and a “cancel” button white, we push our users to confirm. By ordering recommended tips in descending order on PoS terminals, with the largest tips on the left and the smallest on the right, we are pushing customers to tip&nbsp;more.</p><p>So why do we, at Privy, write these words out so frequently?</p><p>History is strewn with smart, well-meaning engineers unknowingly opening Pandoran boxes. Ethan Zuckerman, the creator of the pop-up ad, acknowledges <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/">“I’m sorry, our intentions were&nbsp;good.”</a></p><p>So we spell out these words as a reminder to ourselves that with every line of code we write, we stand to bring about new paradigms. With every default we implement, we are shaping the internet we want to live in. We say these words not out of a sense of superiority or to drape ourselves in morality. On the contrary, it is a reminder that the systems we build matter, our mistakes have consequences, and we would do well not to forget&nbsp;it.</p><p>Acknowledging the moral reach of our work will not save us from making mistakes, or more complex yet, tradeoffs. Great technology, especially as pertains to privacy and identity, is far too morally valent for that to be possible. Recognizing this does nothing to absolve us of the responsibility we bear for the systems we build, but it does create a forum in which we can recognize mistakes and work to correct&nbsp;them.</p><p>In building Privy, we choose to throw our hat in the ring to build better data systems on the web and help empower users to reclaim ownership over their online identity (which is to say their identity in this day and age). Building in the open and acknowledging our mistakes gives us the tools to recognize them, mitigate them, and correct them over time, in conversation with developers and users the Web-over.</p><p>Web3 is sowing the seeds of new data paradigms on the web. In the coming weeks, we will start opening up our client libraries, documentation and system. We can’t wait to show you what we’ve been up&nbsp;to!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/technical-decisions-are-moral-decisions-19d128b0a10e">Technical decisions are moral decisions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Decentralization is a lot more than a word you can use to signal that you exist in the crypto realm. It represents a set of ideals and beliefs, a conviction towards a way of doing things.</p><p>It’s no accident that <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin</a>, which pioneered blockchains as we now know them, also adheres to the ideals of decentralization. In fact, it was the conviction in these ideals that sparked Bitcoin. Each design element of the Bitcoin blockchain is defined by a core belief, such as that:</p>  <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-american-dream-is-dying-bitcoin-saves-it">Monetary policy</a> is more effective when separated from the control of large entities and left to a set of mathematical rules.  Everyone should have an equal chance, at least in principle, to contribute to the network.  Every contribution should be judged by the same standards and rewarded in proportion to its size.  The majority’s rule should always be upheld.  Anyone should be <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/history-bitcoin-hard-forks/">free to fork the network</a> with their own set of rules if they don’t want to abide by the majority.  No one person or entity could take control of the network as long as there are others interested in participating.  <p>As you can see, the crypto ecosystem was founded upon the ideals of decentralization: the belief that planning and decision-making are better distributed than upheld by a central authority. As unique social and even political technologies, blockchains continue to be how these ideas are brought into making a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/22/bitcoins-censorship-resistance-was-a-step-change-in-history/">change in the “real” world</a>.</p> How far decentralization has come The size of the cryptocurrency industry now rivals some of the largest sectors.<p>It’d be an understatement to say that a lot has happened in the blockchain world since Bitcoin came along.</p><p>The crypto community has achieved truly incredible acts of decentralization. We managed to make the value of Bitcoin surpass the market capitalization of companies such as Visa and Mastercard. We set up <a href="https://underscore.vc/blog/the-future-is-dao-a-primer-on-daos-and-their-explosive-growth/">decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)</a> that manage assets, hire employees, collaborate with each other, and set themselves to achieve major goals, such as <a href="https://www.constitutiondao.com/">purchasing the U.S. Constitution</a>. And through DeFi, we have managed to re-create and improve upon every aspect of Traditional Finance.</p><p>Whatever your take is on how or why we got here, the world seems to be increasingly turning into fully decentralized solutions as the next step of information technologies. We are now moving into a world in which the ways we process data are not bounded by centralized technologies.</p> And yet, being decentralized in 2022 is still tricky <p>We now have systems and networks that allow us to deploy decentralized solutions, but this is not without its challenges. Some issues immediately become apparent when attempting to build products for the decentralized world. In particular, there three areas to have in mind when doing this are:</p> Competitive asymmetries <p>As we’ve mentioned, the blockchain ecosystem has evolved to unprecedented levels. Nowadays, decentralized, organic approaches do not allow projects to compete in many of our industry’s categories.</p><p>Some of the most “basic” <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/Todays-blockchain-use-cases-and-industry-applications">use cases of blockchains</a> (like decentralized computation, representing scarce assets, stablecoin minting, and value storage) are already successfully executed by existing protocols. Incumbent protocols, which enjoy powerful network effects in and out of themselves, can only be challenged by heavily-funded mega initiatives. This happens largely because developing in the blockchain scene is seriously time-consuming and expensive.</p><p>Perhaps ironically, competing in the existing scene involves facing incumbent protocols (some of which had many years to grow organically with low pressure and helped advance the industry tremendously) at the same time as more centralized, quickly-iterating entities. This phenomenon makes it difficult for newer projects to be as decentralized as possible from the get-go, as this eliminates their competitive advantages on both fronts. In other words, more centralized approaches are largely favored <a href="https://www.alixpartners.com/media/14446/ap_centralization_versus_decentralization_apr_2016.pdf">in the shorter term</a>.</p> Governance concerns <p>In an ideal world, blockchain-based products would not only be useful and competitive but also fully decentralized. To meet this expectation, protocols and dApps would have to be owned by their community and run permissionlessly on the blockchain.</p><p>If <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp">succeeding as a startup is already hard</a>, facing the extra burden of adopting a decentralized framework doesn’t make it easier. Aiming for community governance involves its own set of challenges, such as distributing voting power in a fair way, weighting these votes, limiting possibilities to collude, devising systems for proposals, etc.</p><p>As mentioned above, building with decentralization as the most immediate priority hampers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_design">rapid iteration</a>, the ability to fix mistakes swiftly, and <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/254833">leadership</a>, all essential to achieving a successful product. Waiting for the community to react to and direct the development needs simply does not bring Silicon Valley-level efficiency at the early stages of a project. As such, many projects instead opt for <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/">progressive decentralization</a>, which is outlined in a16z’s framework below:</p>A simplified outlook on progressive decentralization. Compliance <p>Then, of course, there’s the issue of sticking to regulations that weren’t thought out for decentralized incentives, enforced by jurisdictions that often fail to see the mismatch between their laws and the evolution of times.</p><p>Take as an example this quote from our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/twitter-spaces-ama-with-oliver-gale-ceo-recap-14-april-2022-978457e2d91b">April 14th AMA</a>, in which our CEO, Oliver Gale, addressed the real-world complexities of executing a seemingly permissionless transaction on-chain for a blockchain protocol:</p><p>“For example, the SEC is trying to push an amendment to legislation that increases the definition of what Market Making is, from being limited to order book creation, to something that encompasses what AMMs do. In Gibraltar, the legislation is so broad that it covers arrangements or steps to facilitate it (liquidity). That’s such a broad definition that it more or less says “if you take any steps to facilitate or provide liquidity directly, you fall under the Act. You need a license.”</p><p>And again, in the spirit of transparency, the Gibraltar regulator has given us the thumbs up to continue doing what we were doing and what we have done in Gibraltar, but they have thus far been unwilling to give us a license as a <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/glossary/u-z/">Virtual Asset Service Provider</a>. And so we are exploring a different corporate structure, i.e. re-domiciling our development studio. It might look like “Why can’t you send a transaction on MetaMask to the address on Uniswap?” But there’s a lot of complexities behind that. And if you want to do things right, sometimes you have to do them slowly.”</p><p>Although the mechanisms to execute transactions and create things that are decentralized by nature exist, those building in the space can rarely just pursue them. For example, even Ethereum had to jump through <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/11/sale-of-the-century-the-inside-story-of-ethereums-2014-premine/">significant regulatory hurdles</a> to conduct an ICO that allowed them to raise funds.</p><p>Building in the blockchain space requires significant funding to pay for developers,<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/twitter-spaces-ama-with-oliver-gale-ceo-recap-31st-march-2022-a53e617ab73a#38a7"> audits</a>, marketing and more. Whether acquired through private or public means, these funds have to be obtained in a compliant way, which then make the human beings behind the fundraising efforts responsible for their use. Once again, this stacks the odds against decentralization, leaving it to teams to figure out creative ways to stay decentralized… or make the decision not to.</p> Getting creative to stay decentralized <p>We’re writing this article (hopefully the first of many like it) precisely because Panther considers itself a protocol willing to go to any length to be and stay decentralized. We are sharing our approach in hopes others derive inspiration from it.</p><p>The process of pursuing decentralization involves several factors. One of them is carefully designing your roadmap in hopes no trade-offs can compromise its ultimate goal. The steps in a roadmap have to be an aid in every field that we’ve mentioned above. They have to:</p>  Be compliance-friendly.  Retain your competitive edge (making decentralization a strength rather than a weakness).  Put power in the hands of the community.  <p>Panther has utilized two tools that have allowed it to stay fully decentralized and in the hands of its community. One of them, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/launchdao/">LaunchDAO</a>, is a private voting primitive that helped the Panther DAO launch the protocol. The other, <a href="https://reality.eth.link/">Reality.eth</a>, is a third-party oracle dApp for user-defined questions.</p><p>Let’s quickly look at the first before we dive deeper into the second.</p> LaunchDAO History being made: The Panther community voted to launch the protocol in a fully decentralized manner in this Snapshot proposal. LaunchDAO made it possible for everyone that participated in voting to do so privately.<p>LaunchDAO is the prototype of a generalized, private voting protocol. It can be used in far-reaching applications ranging from on-chain community governance matters to fair democratic elections that privately verify user identities. These use cases require each action in the voting process to be conducted in a fraud-proof manner. Coincidently, this was achieved by LaunchDAO <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364">for the first time ever</a> to launch the Panther protocol.</p><p>LaunchDAO represented the first time in crypto history a fully verified user base has been able to vote on the future existence or non-existence of a protocol. The Panther protocol was deployed and launched privately and trustlessly by the LaunchDAO, a decision made privately by the Panther protocol KYC’d <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-panther-protocol-public-sale-has-successfully-closed-in-under-90-minutes-fae4f83f6734">Private and Public Sale</a> participants.</p><p>This act accomplished everything we mentioned above. It lifted any jurisdiction- or actor-specific liability for protocol launches off of the development team, gave Panther a competitive advantage by successfully debuting Panther ZK Reveals, and put the project in the community’s hands.</p> Reality.eth <p>Reality.eth is an unsung hero of Panther’s decentralized governance.</p><p>Built by <a href="https://socialminds.jp/">Social Minds Information Systems</a>, it is a crowd-sourced oracle dApp for user-defined questions. This means, in practical terms, that whenever Panther puts out a DAO proposal, Reality.eth verifies the outcome of the vote. If this outcome is positive, the transactions embedded within the proposal can be executed permissionlessly by anyone via the <a href="https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started">Zodiac Reality module</a>. Reality.eth achieves this (with the help of the Panther team) through a clever system that crowdsources answers on-chain.</p> How Reality.eth works Example of a question in Reality.eth.<p>Through a system of bounties and bonded deposits, Reality.eth allows anyone to set up a question and tie funds to its answer. The answer to the question can be binary (yes/no), a timestamp, one option out of a list, or multiple options. An arbitrator, who can be an individual, DAO, or company that will settle disputes for a fee, is appointed. For additional decentralization, the arbitrator can be a decentralized on-chain system such as <a href="https://kleros.io/">Kleros</a>.</p><p>The question asked can then be answered and verified by anyone who wishes to claim the funds tied to it. In Panther’s case, this question is: “Did the Panther DAO approve proposal X on Snapshot at (ADDRESS)”? Should the question receive an initial answer (which has to be accompanied by a bond), it may either go uncontested (which awards the answerer the askers’ tied funds) or contested (which starts a bidding war, as each new contester has to introduce progressively higher bonds).</p><p>Because of the way Reality.eth is game-theoretically modeled, the system resolves after a given number of attempts, after which either the bid war stops or the arbitrator is called in. The owner of the answer selected by the arbitrator receives the entire amount in bonds from all submitted answers, thus permanently settling the question.</p><p>After finally settled and closed, a question and its answer remain on the blockchain as verified decentralized information accessible by any smart contract on the same network. Since this information is considered to be true, it can be used by the <a href="https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-module-reality">Zodiac Reality Module</a> — developed by <a href="https://gnosis.io/">Gnosis</a> — to execute the transactions tied to the proposal.</p><p>Like in our example, one of the most exciting uses for Reality.eth’s system is to verify a voting outcome. Thanks to the Zodiac Reality Module, deployment can be automated for changes to be instantly implemented should a given proposal pass.</p><p>Panther has been using Reality.eth and the Zodiac Reality Module to implement DAO proposals since <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/governance/proposal-2-polygon-bridging/acceptance-criteria">Panther DAO Proposal #2</a>. This process makes crafting proposals a lot more difficult since they have to be meticulously created to work as intended from the very first deployment. Panther accepts this trade-off to favor decentralization.</p><p>As of writing, Reality.eth can work on the Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, among other Layer-1s, as well as the Optimism and Arbitrum rollups.</p> Benefits of using Reality.eth <p>Utilizing a “truth source” such as Reality.eth helps ensure that the Panther DAO’s decisions get automatically implemented. This gives users the possibility to have full certainty of what will happen after a voting outcome, as opposed to “traditional” politics. After a traditional election or referendum, there are often still many factors that could influence the exact implementation of the decided changes (including, e.g., politicians not sticking to their word).</p><p>Reality.eth also checks all of the three boxes we’ve defined above for Panther:</p>  It leaves the outcome and therefore governance in the hands of the DAO.  It is fully compliant, as anyone can see on-chain that the proposals to the Panther DAO are only merged after a vote by $ZKP holders. This leaves the Panther developer team up to creating technology to support the protocol while trusting the community’s best judgment to either implement or reject their suggestions.  It allows users to verify their trust in the protocol and is therefore decentralized. As opposed to blindly trusting developers, the Panther community and DAO can publicly see who the Panther team’s arbitrator is, raise questions about their qualifications, analyze the code in every proposal, and contest Reality.eth calls if they feel the need.  <p>This system makes Panther more transparent, decentralized, team-agnostic, and validates the governance use case of $ZKP, strengthening the protocol. It also puts Panther among a small group of projects with truly decentralized governance, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3978815">a rarity in the blockchain scene</a> that will become more prescient as the importance of decentralization gets recognized.</p> Decentralization as an ethos and a process <p>In the future, Panther will continue to work towards further decentralizing its procedures. This includes refining its governance by implementing:</p>  On-chain voting. Panther’s governance is currently conducted 100% off-chain, primarily because of fees.  <a href="https://wtfisqf.com/">Quadratic voting</a> or time-based vote weighting.  More sophisticated platforms for the community to discuss and author proposals in a structured fashion.  <p><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/governance/dao#current-status">As previously covered in our documentation</a>, the initial setup approved by LaunchDAO involves Panther keeping a multi-sig key to quickly make changes to the protocol in emergency cases. This mechanism can be relinquished as soon as $ZKP staking is widespread enough to guarantee economic security against malicious attacks.</p><p>Putting aside specific tactics and approaches, we can finish this article with an ultimate takeaway: Presented with an opportunity to further decentralize in a lean, sustainable manner, Panther will more often than not err on the side of minimizing its team’s influence. Panther is first and foremost a DAO, and as such, our #1 job is to figure out the delicate balance between <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b">compliance</a>, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364">decentralization</a>, and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9">competitive edge</a>.</p><p>We look forward to presenting you with Part 2 of this series sometime soon!

 Sign-in with Solana — Use Your Solana Account for Web2 &amp;&nbsp;Web3  Users will now be able to control their digital identity with their Solana accounts instead of relying on traditional/custodial profiles.  The Importance of Building a Self-Custodial Future <p>In crypto, there is a saying that goes ”Not your keys, not your crypto’’ exemplifying the importance of non-custodiality — the need to shift the dynamic of ownership from entities to the end-user. The principle also extends beyond just the crypto you hold to your very identity itself. While traditional Web2 entities have done a tremendous job in making the user experience incredibly intuitive but that has also come at a cost — the cost of privacy and centralization.</p><p>There is excessive monetization of the users’ activity and their residing information on the web. Security compromises even among the biggest names in cybersecurity are increasingly common. As the average user is becoming more and more aware of these tradeoffs, the voice to safeguard their identity is growing louder by the day. We at Web3Auth firmly believe that self-custodiality is the future and we want to lead the way in making it happen. Do check our recent <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">announcement about the Auth Network</a> for our roadmap towards&nbsp;this.</p> Sign-in With Solana — You Own Your&nbsp;Identity <p>Web3 has to a large extent cracked the code for the user privacy problem. The power of public and private keys, enabled by crypto technologies, allows users to own their username, and profile data, and use their accounts across different applications. This is the fundamental on which Web3Auth was built — to leverage the power of threshold cryptography to shift the dynamic of power from entities to individuals.</p> What does Sign-in With Solana&nbsp;Solve? <p>For the User: Sign-in with Solana allows any Web2 application to authenticate users with their Web3 identities thereby bringing the security and privacy of Web3 authentication to&nbsp;Web2.</p><p>Today, there are multiple blockchain platforms and thus naturally, there arises a need to have a standard specification for authentication with Web3 identities. This led to the birth of <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md">CAIP-74</a> which allows for creating a chain-agnostic Object Capability (CACAO), based on a signing message as an IPLD object. Sign-in with Solana endeavors to maintain compatibility with CAIP-74, thereby adhering to a chain agnostic standard.</p><p>For the Developer: Do <a href="https://www.docs.web3auth.io">check our documentation</a> for a step by step guide on how to build a Sign-in with Solana flow and how to navigate the authentication logic. You can find a clear end-to-end flow in our docs <a href="http://siws.web3auth.io">here</a>. Moreover, Web3Auth offers a dedicated suite of authentication tools for all Solana Developers. This includes support for OAuth and native biometric login using our <a href="https://www.docs.web3auth.io">plug and play SDK</a> and also the state of the art <a href="https://docs.tor.us/solana-wallet/what-is-wallet">Torus Solana Wallet</a> which has a range of exclusive features.</p> Coming Soon… <p>We are pleased to see how rapidly the entire Web3 ecosystem is developing with the launch of new protocols and dApps every day. We will continue to lead the way in servicing authentication needs for the ecosystem whilst upholding the self-custodial principles of blockchain technology.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/sign-in-with-solana-use-your-solana-account-for-web2-web3-d94def27485b">Sign-in with Solana — Use Your Solana Account for Web2 &amp; Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This blogpost delves into the simulations that were run and reported on in the <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-cryptoecon-paper.pdf">Reward Sharing for Mixnets</a> paper by Claudia Diaz, Harry Halpin and Aggelos Kiayias (which also contains a game theoretical analysis of the reward scheme including proofs of the scheme’s equilibrium properties). The simulator has been <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/rewardsharing-simulator">released and is open source</a> for anyone to check the results and try out their own simulations. The simulations were run to test the reward sharing scheme of Nym in two non-equilibrium scenarios.</p><p>An <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-economic-highlights-90d8be1b1ab">earlier blogpost </a>explained the main features of Nym token economics under ideal conditions — in its equilibrium state. Equilibrium means that all the available NYM supply is staked on a sufficient number of nodes to serve demand (the current configuration is set to 720 nodes in the reward set), such that these nodes have maximum reputation and are selected for rewards in every epoch. The mixnet is constantly pulled towards the equilibrium by the incentives: the more stakeholders collectively act to maximize their own rewards, the more the mixnet approaches the equilibrium with the desired network features.</p><p>But as we all know, the real world is a little more complicated: there will be a lot more nodes registered than 720 and thus not all nodes will be selected for rewards in every epoch. Also, some stakeholders may not allocate their stake optimally, others may even fail to stake at all, meaning that only part of the available NYM supply is staked on nodes and not all nodes have maximum reputation.</p><p>What does this look like in terms of rewards and how does the system behave under less ideal conditions? These simulations give some insight into the distribution of rewards to nodes in two plausible non-equilibrium scenarios.</p><p>These are hypothetical scenarios that were simulated in order to test the properties of the scheme. For those who want to calculate mix node or delegator APY, there will be more news on important updates to the reward sharing scheme and how to calculate real world APY — coming&nbsp;soon.</p><p>NOTE: The paper does not say anything about the real world profitability of an individual node as that will depend on the overall distribution of stake among nodes as well as individual node parameters including performance and reputation. To be clear, this is from an academic paper and not an investment prospectus or financial advice. We use the term ‘APY’ in a loose generic sense based on ‘Return on Stake’, and are relying on hypothetical scenarios using experimental technology. Actual results using the technology will vary widely. It’s quite possible that this venture could result in loss of monetary funds for anyone who uses the software.</p> How were simulations run? <p>A custom <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/rewardsharing-simulator">Mixnet Token Economic Simulator</a> of the Nym reward scheme was implemented in Python. The simulator was built to run different deployment scenarios, illustrating how the reward scheme works and assessing the impact of different bonding and delegation choices.</p><p>This same simulator was used to obtain the results reported in this blogpost and in the <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-cryptoecon-paper.pdf">Nym Reward Sharing for Mixnets</a> paper. It has been <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/rewardsharing-simulator">open sourced</a>, enabling everyone to reproduce these results as well as to run simulations considering any other scenarios of interest, and obtain estimations of APY for mix nodes and delegators with different system and node configurations. We will shortly be releasing an interface and video guide for the simulator to make it even easier to simulate rewards and study the economic performance under different circumstances.</p><p>The rest of this blogpost reports simulation results on reward distributions in two scenarios: no user fees (due to mixnet being free of charge or low adoption rates) high user fees (due to rapid adoption by paying&nbsp;users).</p> Node parameters and stake distribution <p>Before running the simulations, certain network parameters and node compositions were assumed. This is necessary in order to obtain concrete results. In a nutshell, the main assumptions when running these simulations were&nbsp;that:</p>  There are 1440 nodes registered in the network. Of these, 720 nodes are selected to the reward set each epoch, of which half (360) are selected to be active and the other half to be in&nbsp;standby.  All nodes have a flat monthly cost set to $200, a profit margin of 10%, and perfect (100%) performance.  The assumed overall level of staking is 75% of the available NYM supply. Of this, 15% of stake is bonded to nodes by the operators, while the other 60% is delegated to nodes by stakeholders, with bond and delegated quantities varying per&nbsp;node.  <p>The simulations considered mix nodes with a diverse combination of bond and stake making out their reputation in order to reveal the effects of these different node compositions on rewards. Some node operators might start off with a lot of NYM of their own that they can bond, while others might only have the minimum (currently 100NYM) and have to make up for low bond with delegated stake in order to have a good reputation.</p><p>The biased distributions of bond and total stake over mix nodes in the simulations looked like&nbsp;this:</p><p>In the x axis of the figures you can see the 1440 nodes, ordered by decreasing bond (left figure) and by decreasing overall reputation (right figure). The y axis represents the amount of bond (left figure) and total stake (right figure) of each&nbsp;node.</p><p>As you can see in the left figure, the distribution of bonds is very skewed (similar to a Pareto distribution), with a few dozen nodes having saturated bonds (of about one million NYM), a couple more hundred nodes having high bond values of tens or hundreds of thousands of NYM, and more than half the nodes having much smaller bonds of around one thousand or a few thousand&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>The right figure shows the assumed distribution of reputation (green line), which accounts for both the bond (blue lines) and the delegated stake (gap from the blue line to the green). As you can see, some nodes with small or medium bonds have high reputation thanks to delegation, while other nodes (notably from node 1100 until 1440) have minimal bonds and no delegation, adding up to minimal reputation. The vertical dotted line at 720 marks the number of rewarded nodes, showing that there are more than 720 nodes with non-negligible reputation, and thus that only some of them are selected for rewards in each&nbsp;epoch.</p> Two simulation scenarios <p>Two main deployment scenarios were simulated and reported in the scientific paper:</p>  The first simulation ran a scenario where mixnet usage is free of charge and all the available rewards come only from the mixmining pool. This scenario provides a lower bound on the reward distributions to nodes and delegates in conditions with low to moderate&nbsp;usage.  The second simulation ran a scenario where network demand grows very significantly over time, triggering the need to scale the mixnet beyond its initial size (i.e., rewarding more than 720 mix nodes) to serve all the demand. In this case income from usage fees is added to the mixmining rewards to fund the growth of the network. This scenario studies network scalability and the rewards of nodes and their delegates in conditions of high&nbsp;demand.  <p>The paper provides a detailed list of parameter values used in the simulations and a justification of the choices that were made for these illustrative examples. You can use the open source simulator to experiment with parameter values and assumptions, and obtain reward distributions for other scenarios.</p> Scenario 1: rewards from mixmining pool only (free mixnet&nbsp;usage) <p>The first scenario focuses on a “bootstrapping” scenario where demand is low to moderate, usage fees are not yet turned on and all the rewards come from the mixmining reserve. The distribution of bond and reputation over mix nodes is as just described. The simulated scenario assumes nodes have a monthly operational cost of $200 and that $1 corresponds to 1&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>The simulator results show that the annualized rewards given to mix nodes in this scenario range from zero to almost 100’000 NYM of earnings per year, depending on the mix node reputation and performance. To better understand the impact of node reputation on rewards, each mix node can be represented by a dot with coordinates defined by the node’s reputation and its received&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This is shown in the figure below, where each blue dot represents a simulation result for one mix node, taking into account its reputation (x axis) and received rewards (y&nbsp;axis):</p><p>As you can see, mix nodes that have maximum reputation (saturation 1.0) receive the most rewards, amounting to between 65’000 and close to 100’000 NYM per year. Nodes with lower reputation levels receive lower rewards. In this example, a node with total stake (reputation) at half the saturation level (0.5, corresponding to about half a million NYM) receives between 20’000 and 30’000 NYM per year. At the low reputation extreme, nodes with stake saturation levels below 0.1 receive very small rewards, due to both being selected rarely for rewards and also to being rewarded at a low rate when selected.</p><p>The rewards received by the mix node are shared among the operator and its delegates, depending on the node’s operational cost, the profit margin, and the stake brought in by each stakeholder. These simulations consider that all nodes have a monthly cost of $200 ($2400 annual) and that they all take a profit margin of 10% of delegate&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Considering this configuration, the figure below shows the annualized profit received by mix node operators relative to their bond size (excluding delegated stake), where the maximum bond (1.0 in the x axis) corresponds to the stake saturation point of one million NYM. Note that the profit is considered after refunding declared node costs and that a negative profit (below the red line) means that node costs are not fully covered by&nbsp;rewards:</p><p>As expected, operators with larger bonds invest more stake in the system and thus make more rewards — provided that their mix node has adequate performance. Variation in operator rewards at the high end of bond saturation (near 1.0) mirrors the variation in overall rewards for high-reputation nodes shown in the previous figure, and it is mainly due to the effects of sampling to the active set: nodes that are lucky to be sampled as active more times receive more rewards in the simulation run compared to nodes that are unlucky and sampled less frequently in the simulation run.</p><p>Variation caused by mix node reputation does however have a significant impact on nodes with small bonds (left side of the figure, near 0.0). As shown in the figure, top earners in this category (nodes with small bond but high reputation) make up to 10’000 NYM in net profits (after costs) per year, while other nodes (small bond and no delegation) take losses of more than 2000 NYM (blue area under the red line). Nodes that take losses are those that have little or no delegation, and thus their reputation is minimal, which means that they rarely are selected for rewards while still having costs of $2400 (converted as 2400 NYM in this scenario) per year for keeping the node operational.</p><p>The rest of the mix node rewards are shared among delegators proportionally to their delegated stake. The figure above represents the APY of a node’s delegators relative to the node’s reputation. Each blue dot represents the simulation result for one node. The x coordinate of the dot is given by the node’s stake saturation (reputation) level and the y coordinate provides the APY (Annual Percentage Yield without compounding effects) received by the node’s delegators. A value of 0.07 for the APY of a node means that a stakeholder who delegates 100 NYM to the node receives 7 NYM in rewards over the course of a&nbsp;year.</p><p>Any node that receives fewer rewards than its operational cost does not distribute any rewards to delegators, as all the received rewards are required to cover as much as possible of the node costs and thus retained by the operator. The figure shows that with the assumptions in the simulated scenario, nodes below 20% of stake saturation (0.2 in the x axis) do not distribute rewards to delegators due to this&nbsp;effect.</p><p>Once mix nodes cover operational costs, they start sharing rewards with their delegators. As shown in the figure, the higher a node’s reputation, the better the APY that it can offer to delegators. This encourages stakeholders to concentrate their support around a target number of mix nodes (to be precise, the number of rewarded nodes, initialized as 720) that aggregate high reputation. In the simulated scenario, fully saturated nodes (with a saturated reputation of 1.0) are able to offer an APY of between 5% and 7% to their delegates, even after taking 10% of the delegate profits as a fee (profit&nbsp;margin).</p><p>Remember there is a stake saturation point after which node operators and delegators no longer benefit from increasing stake of a node. This incentivizes delegators to delegate across an ideal number of nodes for servicing demand, and operates as a soft cap against centralization.</p> Scenario 2: rewards from paid service (user growth and network&nbsp;scaling) <p>The second scenario examined in the <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-cryptoecon-paper.pdf">paper</a> simulates rapid growth in user demand that triggers scaling of the mixnet, such that after five years the mixnet has almost tripled in size, from 720 to more than 2000 mix nodes rewarded per epoch. In this scenario, after five years the user fees generated by the service amount to two thirds of the 13 million NYM available monthly rewards, with the remaining third of the monthly reward budget (around 4 million) coming from the mixmining pool.</p><p>The figure below shows the mix node rewards distributed in the fifth year of the simulated scenario, considering 2000 rewarded mix nodes per epoch out of 4000 registered mix node candidates in the network. Compared to the node rewards at bootstrapping shown in the first figure, the rewards per node remain remarkably stable over time even with mixnet&nbsp;scaling.</p><p>The same is true for mix node operator rewards, as shown in the figure below, which also remain remarkably stable despite changes in network scale. Compared to operator rewards in the first scenario, the higher density of blue dots in the medium and higher bond saturation values is due to two effects: first, this scenario has more mix nodes (and thus more samples overall); and second, the stake saturation point is lower due to the increased number of rewarded nodes, meaning that the same amount of bonded tokens results in a higher saturation for the node in this scenario compared to the first one, and thus there are more nodes with higher saturation.</p><p>The main difference between the two scenarios becomes evident when studying the APY of delegators. The results in the fifth year of the simulated scenario are shown in the figure below. In this case, high reputation nodes provide an APY to their delegators between 9% and&nbsp;20%.</p><p>The increase in APY is due to the increase in available rewards, as the network receives income from usage fees that are available as rewards in addition to the mixmining reserve (in this scenario the combined available rewards are around 13 million NYM per month in the fifth year of simulation). As the overall available rewards increase compared to the previous scenario while the amount of stake on the overall network remains the same, this naturally leads to higher rewards per staked&nbsp;token.</p><p>Also note that the extra income funds the network growth by rewarding more nodes. Increasing the number of rewarded nodes has the effect of reducing the stake saturation point, meaning that fewer tokens are needed to reach a certain reputation, and thus nodes are more easily rewarded at high rates. This is a consequence of network scaling and an additional contributing factor to high APY in high user demand conditions.</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-cryptoecon-paper.pdf">Nym Reward Sharing for Mixnets</a>&nbsp;paper</p><p><a href="https://github.com/nymtech/rewardsharing-simulator">Mixnet Token Economic Simulator</a></p><p><a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/overview">Nym mixnet&nbsp;explorer</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Nym wallet</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">Node help&nbsp;chat</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-science-and-simulations-behind-nym-token-economics-d0b89d9f8189">The science and simulations behind Nym token economics</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A whole lot of ecosystem players at the event were pleasantly surprised to discover Web3Auth’s Key Management Infrastructure (and also our funky&nbsp;swags)</p><p>About the Paris Blockchain Week ‘2022 (13th-14th April)</p><p>Paris Blockchain Week is one of the biggest Blockchain conferences &amp; Digital Assets events in Europe. Held in the City of Lights over two days, the event is graced every year by some of the most influential leaders and players in the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>This year, some of the speakers included CZ&nbsp;, the founder of Binance, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse&nbsp;, Raj Gokal, the co-founder of Solana and a galaxy of other speakers that also included our co-founder Zhen&nbsp;Yong.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/PBWSummit/status/1514555660951826436">@PBWSummit</a></p></blockquote><p>Web3Auth debuts at the Paris Blockchain Week Summit(PBWS)</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth/status/1514193425595256839">@web3auth</a></p></blockquote><p>The event marked Web3Auth’s first participation at the PBWS and the team including co-founder and CEO were present at the event showcasing the state of the art private key management infrastructure. The event was preceded by the announcement of the Auth Network a day prior. You can read the full announcement <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">here</a>.</p><p>And the Coolest Swag Award Goes&nbsp;to…</p><p>The team came up with an unusual way to demonstrate how its unique self-custodial key management infrastructure works — at the end of which the visitor received one of our cool swags which turned out to be a hit at the&nbsp;event</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptowifey1/status/1514536080523075593">@cryptowifey1</a></p></blockquote><p>If you are curious to know what this was all about, meet us at our next event to experience it yourself.</p><p>And Then Everyone Partied….</p><p>At the end of the first day, a special party was hosted at Pigalle’s iconic Elysée Montmartre. Not surprisingly, the members of the community got to see a completely different side of each other from what they had seen earlier from the event. The Web3Auth team got together with other members for a memorable night in Paris as everyone geared for day two of the&nbsp;event.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/pbwsummit/status/1514356636793593857">@pbwsummit</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/pbwsummit/status/1514347479780712457">@pbwsummit</a></p></blockquote><p>Day 2: We hosted a Pizza&nbsp;Party!</p><p>On the second day, we got a bunch of fresh hot pizzas from across the street and hosted a Pizza Party at our booth and as you would expect, we saw quite a crowd at the booth who may have come over for a slice or two but ended up learning a thing or two about our unique onboarding solution for dApps and&nbsp;wallets.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/pbwsummit/status/1514585465722134532">@pbwsummit</a></p></blockquote><p>Conclusion<br>A wide range of ecosystem players from DeFi, Gaming, Security, Infrastructure were present at the event and while some were aware and had already integrated our pluggable SDK with their dApp/wallet, a whole lot of players were acquainted with our Private Key Management infrastructure for the first time. And all of this happened over Pizza and cool&nbsp;swags!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-at-the-paris-blockchain-week-2022-2a26345c9c06">Web3Auth at the Paris Blockchain Week 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

    <p>This guide will demonstrate how to make a Forward Transfer from the Horizen main blockchain to a sidechain network on Horizen. The tools used in this guide are:</p>
 
 Sphere wallet (Testnet) – the wallet app of the Horizen main blockchain network [<a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sphere_by_Horizen_Testnet/releases/tag/desktop-v1.3.0-beta-testnet">Download</a>] 
 Cobalt wallet (Testnet) – the wallet app of TokenMint, a sidechain network on Horizen [<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt-by-horizen/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Download</a>] 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/tokenmint-alpha-1-testnet-launch/">Cobalt</a> is a web extension wallet that is one of the three key components of TokenMint, Horizen’s tokenization platform. Cobalt is currently in Alpha phase 1 and is live on public testnet. In this testnet phase, Cobalt is able to send and receive testnet tokens created on TokenMint. All transactions require a small gas fee paid in Test ZEN (TZEN). Therefore, users of Cobalt wallet must have enough TZEN in their wallet to afford the gas fee in order to make a transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following steps show you how to send TZEN to your Cobalt wallet on testnet. Before doing this, make sure you have already downloaded the Cobalt wallet and have a Cobalt wallet address. If not, here is the <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide/">Cobalt guide</a> that explains how to complete these steps.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download the new Testnet Sphere wallet</p>
<p>At this time, the best way to send TZEN to Cobalt is using the new testnet Sphere wallet. So first, you will need to download the new testnet Sphere wallet: [<a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sphere_by_Horizen_Testnet/releases/tag/desktop-v1.3.0-beta-testnet">Download new testnet Sphere</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Install Sphere (Testnet) and create a wallet&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sphere-Testnet-Mainscreen.jpg"></a><br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: Get free TZEN&nbsp;</p>
 
 Go to the <a href="https://heap.horizen.io">HEAP</a> homepage and find the TZEN faucet under the title “Launch A Blockchain”.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Skip 1,2,3 and claim some free TZEN from box 4 by entering your Sphere wallet address</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/HEAP-TZEN-CLAIM.jpg"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4: Enable Sidechain Function in Sphere (Testnet)&nbsp;</p>
 
 Go to the address where you have your TZEN. 
 Click the “Send” button on the top right corner. 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sphere-Testnet-Send.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Toggle the “Sidechain Transaction” bar to enable the sidechain function. 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sphere-Testnet-SidechainTransactionButton.jpg"></a></p>
 
 In the “Select A Sidechain” dropdown, select the TokenMint sidechain ID 312d210a…23f32eb4&nbsp;(Right now, that’s the only sidechain ID on the list). Get some TZNY airdrop to your Cobalt wallet, so you can spend the TZEN to make some transactions on <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/tokenmint-alpha-1-testnet-launch/">TokenMint</a>! 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sphere-Testnet-SelectSidechain.jpg"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 5: Send TZEN to Cobalt wallet</p>
 
 Enter your Cobalt wallet address in the “Send to” bar. This must be your Cobalt wallet address. The transaction will not work for your real ZEN address or any other crypto wallet addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Enter the amount that you want to send and click “Confirm.” 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23017"></a></p>
 
 You should see your transaction was successful. You can click the “Activity” button to view your transaction history.&nbsp;

<p>Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, just bought Twitter. Therein lies the problem. Centralized control. A hierarchy of ownership. The immeasurable, unregulated power one man has. And most alarmingly, the illusion, the paradox of ‘free speech’, is not possible in&nbsp;Web2.</p><p>In a US$44 billion deal last week, Musk bought Twitter. He first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/24/elon-musk-twitter-offer-timeline/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMVJqQ58OwWuGc-AX3csk1Fvqv207PqRVqhTaaUvbBukSZMWCWTvdWCImBr8cmdCXyC9JJxha04ex7P0_UhSWwhHyD_xQum8HGNHCkhbPevjRRmvbE32kOYa1YoSLfY7wmdM9FylwwV1UUy_sxr8W6qpdGpDiihjyIjlCQ8ZHWzs">purchased a 9.2% stake</a> in the giant social media platform, followed by a bid to buy Twitter. On April 25, 2022, the board of directors approved his&nbsp;offer.</p><p>Musk plans to take Twitter private, with the vision of an ‘open source’ algorithm, an ‘inclusive arena for free expression.’ And in doing so, will make sweeping (subjective) changes to the content moderation policy and the business model. The most interesting of his plans is to “authenticate all real&nbsp;humans.”</p><p>These changes will affect more than just Twitter. It impacts public discourse, well beyond the 280-character limit. This will reshape society as we know&nbsp;it.</p> Why is this an&nbsp;issue? <p>For a myriad of reasons. Musk could read or alter anyone’s DMs. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-jet-tracking-teen-backup-plans-twitter-account-worries-2022-4">He could ban anyone</a>, like @ElonJet, a teenager who tracks Musk’s private jet. Musk also previously used his power to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/03/elon-musk-blogger-tesla-motors-model-x">cancel a blogger’s Tesla order</a>, after a negative letter went viral. He’s got a track record of being petty and unpredictable.</p><p>Motives aside, the fact Musk was able to wake up one day and buy Twitter is an issue in itself. Billionaires buying up media platforms is nothing new. Bezos did it with the Washington Post. When we live under the arbitrary power of a few, we’re not&nbsp;free.</p><p>In centralized systems, anyone can simply force his or her will on the world, by throwing enough money at it. The rich get exponentially richer and society splinters.</p><p>Decentralized systems rebalance control back towards the individual. People are starting to see this, particularly Twitter users. The relative “freedom” of Twitter against censorship during the Arab Spring was pivotal to this movement.</p><p>We asked gm.xyz co-founder <a href="https://gm.xyz/u/fonz.eth">Michael McGuiness</a> on his thoughts on alternatives to Twitter, he&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>“We should be looking for Twitter alternatives because Twitter’s data monopoly gives a handful of tech executives in Silicon Valley exorbitant control over the public discourse and increases the barrier to entry for creating new social media products. Twitter also doesn’t share the value it captures via ad revenue with the users on the platform who create that value, which we believe is fundamentally wrong.”</blockquote><p>The reality is, Twitter can’t truly be trusted. This also goes for Web2. Centralized ownership contradicts Web3 ideals. Especially with a powerful billionaire owning it, under the guise of ‘protecting democracy’.</p><p>In light of the buy-out, hundreds of thousands of Twitter users deactivated their accounts. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/27/twitter-fluctuations-follower-counts-after-musk-deal-organic/">huge fluctuations in user follower counts</a> also indicate a material shift in sentiment on what will and won’t be okay on the new&nbsp;Twitter.</p><p>In parallel, the decentralized Twitter-alternative, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, gained nearly 30,000 new users on the day of the acquisition. There is no one server, company or person running it or making money off it. In other words, no Musk, or the likes&nbsp;thereof!</p><p>But this is about more than Twitter. It’s a sign of the changing times. A shifting of the power disparity, where people are abandoning these platforms in search of a different way of connecting, communicating, and cultivating relationships online.</p><p>In any place there’s centralized ownership, users lose out. Users should own their data, control it, and be rewarded for it. Not corporations. Or billionaire owners. This is more than a vision for the future. It’s happening now.</p> The movement has begun. Viable Twitter alternatives. <p>Decentralized social media platforms celebrate and honor self-sovereign identity. In Web3, individuals own their social media posts and can easily move between platforms.</p><p>There are plenty of teams now building social alternatives, of which Web3 provides an opportunity to innovate on the tech and business models. Some are working directly at the protocol level, whilst others working on the full social stack. Here are some of the front runners we’ve identified:</p>  <a href="https://gm.xyz/about">gm.xyz</a> with a progressive plan towards decentralization, aims to make creating and managing a DAO or crypto-asset community simple — as quick as launching a sub-reddit.  <a href="https://www.deso.org/">DeSo</a> is a layer-1 blockchain custom-built to scale decentralized social applications to one billion&nbsp;users.  <a href="https://lens.dev/">Lens Protocol</a> is an open social graph, and any application can be built on top of it. It gives users full control of their profiles, with all content as an NFT, in the&nbsp;wallet.  <a href="https://mirror.xyz/">Mirror</a> is a publishing platform that allows writers to share and fund their work. It’s a decentralized, user-owned, crypto-based network.  <a href="https://www.myriad.social/">Myriad</a> is making it possible for users to own and monetize their Web3 content. Those who hold $MYRIA can contribute to the platform’s future, via its DAO. Myriad users can import and sell content, as well as tip creators.  <a href="https://www.minds.com/">Minds</a> promises users a platform to speak freely, while protecting privacy and earning crypto rewards. The network has over six million&nbsp;users.  <a href="https://ethereum.world">AKASHA</a> is a framework that offers a way for communities to craft their own decentralized social networks.  <a href="https://blueskyweb.org">Bluesky</a> while not live yet, Bluesky has been incubated out of Twitter and Jack Dorsey. It has a mandate to create a Web3 Twitter alternative — giving users more choice, creators more control, and developers more&nbsp;freedom.  <a href="https://cyberconnect.me/">CyberConnect</a> is a decentralized social graph protocol that serves Web3 social networks and the metaverse. It currently supports Ethereum and Solana wallets, their mission is to return ownership and utility of social graph data back to&nbsp;users.  <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> is the most similar to Twitter, and as previously mentioned, is a decentralized social media platform. Messages have a 500-character limit. Anyone can create their own and run their own server on Mastodon, called ‘instances.’ Users can freely join and communicate within any community.  <a href="https://counter.social/index.html">Counter Social</a> like Mastodon, Counter Social posts are 500 characters, with no ads, no fake news, no bots or trolls. It’s a platform committed to fighting foreign forces, infiltrating through social&nbsp;media.  <p>In these Twitter alternatives, it’s evident communities that used to be one platform are now entering their own echo chambers, based on interests.</p><p>We’re still somewhere between Web2 and Web3 — where one no longer serves us (and likely never did), yet what’s to come isn’t fully formed. In other words, the best is yet to&nbsp;come.</p> What’s missing? Data ownership &amp; portability. <p>It’s hard to replicate Web2’s features and functionality with full Web3 principles. Product market fit, decentralized data and governance are all necessary components to get&nbsp;there.</p><p>Web3 must support sharing of structured data to unlock interoperability between platforms. This new technology stack must leverage public key cryptography to protect all messages and provide signed proofs of where communication originated. This ensures trust, privacy and security in any future interoperable social&nbsp;network.</p><p>Data ownership is essential to enabling user control and data portability. It’s essential that users can exit a platform, retain their data and take it with them to the next platform.</p><p>Imagine if users could simply login to a Twitter alternative and all their tweets and DM’s came with them. A user’s data may be created in one application but then be made available across others — if they so choose. This is the true definition of Web3 data portability. Without this, we end up with another iteration of siloed data, captive to proprietary platform interests.</p><p>Not only that, but data ownership enables users to benefit from their tweets, avoid censorship or exit a social network entirely. The ability to exit, or opt out from a social network is a form of freedom of expression in itself. Is a platform truly open if this isn’t an&nbsp;option?</p> Verida: The private data network for&nbsp;Web3 <p>While the next era of social media platforms are still on their way, the technology to make decentralization possible is&nbsp;here.</p><p>The Verida network ensures data interoperability exists from the very beginning. <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/concepts/schemas">Data schemas</a> are first-level primitives to enable this interoperability across all applications built on the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>Verida provides the Web3 infrastructure that makes a decentralized Twitter a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>We provide developers with the tools and infrastructure for building fast Web3 apps that leverage <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/client-sdk/data">private and public data</a>, while enabling new tokenized business models that everyone can benefit&nbsp;from.</p><p>We will shortly enable tools for end users to pull their data from centralized platforms, like Twitter, and help them onboard to new Web3 alternatives. Please reach out if you’re interested in trialling this capability.</p><p>This enables users to provide consent for Twitter alternatives to easily access, remix, and help users make the most of their tweets. As well as the ability to easily pull tweets, DMs and other data from Twitter to a user’s own private&nbsp;Vault.</p><p><a href="https://developers.verida.io/">Developers</a>, build your Twitter alternative on a truly decentralized free and open Web3. With Verida, you can recreate any Web2 app in Web3 that is fast, secure, supports private user data and interoperability with major public blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://www.verida.io/user-vault">Users</a>, reclaim the data that’s rightfully yours. Own it, control it, and get rewarded for it. Not the corporate overlords, big tech, or the Elon’s of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Now is the time to define, design and dream a new kind of internet, we can all truly benefit from.

 TokenMint will make tokenization streamlined and accessible to the masses. 
<p>TokenMint is a platform that allows anyone to easily and quickly create a token with custom tokenomics. No programming knowledge is needed for creating a token using TokenMint.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://"></a>Important Note: TokenMint is currently in Alpha phase 1 stage with limited functionalities, but our team is working hard on delivering a wider range of features and making the platform more secure, more flexible, and even easier to use.&nbsp; Meanwhile, we have a couple tools of TokenMint already available for you to play with! <br><br>NOTE: Do not send ZEN to your Cobalt Address. Sending ZEN to Cobalt on testnet can result in a loss of funds.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 Cobalt Wallet 
<p>Cobalt is a web extension wallet that is one of the three key components of TokenMint:</p>
 
 Token generator (<a href="https://tokenmint.global">Live on public testnet</a>)&nbsp; 
 Cobalt wallet (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt-by-horizen/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Live on public testnet</a>) 
 Block explorer (<a href="https://explorer-testnet.tokenmint.global/">Live on public testnet</a>) 
 
<p>In this Alpha phase 1 release, Cobalt is able to send and receive testnet tokens created on TokenMint. In the upcoming phase 2 release of TokenMint, we will release our token generator, and Cobalt will be able to mint new tokens, and manage and transact tokens created on TokenMint.&nbsp;</p>

	  Cobalt is now live on public testnet and we are calling out to everyone to download and test it. We will airdrop Test ZENNY (TZNY) to anyone who would like to test Cobalt. Airdrop entry ends on May 9th at 11:59pm EST.&nbsp; Testers will also be able to earn a special “Test Pilot” badge on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord</a> for access to exclusive testing activities and earn extra rewards!  
 <br>How to Get the TZNY Airdrop 
<p>First 3 rounds of airdrops ended. We will announce more opportunities to claim free TZNY soon.</p>

 Custodial vs Non-Custodial Solutions 
<p>One of the usability difficulties with cryptocurrency is that owners are responsible for safely maintaining their private keys. The bottom line is that if you store your assets in a Bitcoin or Ethereum account and you forget your private key (or seed phrase) for that account, then you have lost your assets.  <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-55658942">Millions</a>, probably <a href="https://www.coolwallet.io/bitcoin-lost-private-key-horror-stories/">billions</a> and <a href="https://decrypt.co/37171/lost-bitcoin-3-7-million-bitcoin-are-probably-gone-forever">billions</a> of dollars of assets have been lost in this way.</p>

<p>One way to avoid this situation is not to hold your key yourself, but rely on a professional intermediary like Binance or Coinbase to hold it for you. This is called a custodial solution, since the intermediary has custody of your assets. However, this is not very secure either.  </p>

<p>A famous crypto exchange called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox">Mt. Gox</a> incurred the loss or theft of hundreds of thousands of their clients’ Bitcoins, and ceased operation. Modern exchanges like Binance and Coinbase probably have better defences in place and are more resistant to hacker attacks, but they may be vulnerable to other kinds of issues, such as <a href="https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2022/02/us-department-of-justice-aided-by-cryptocurrency-exchanges/">government seizures</a>.</p>

<p>Most people therefore want to retain custody of their cryptocurrency assets, and therefore have to worry about the security of their private key. As the saying goes, “<a href="https://medium.com/stakefish/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-fad3d43c2713">Not your keys? Not your coins</a>.”  Security of your private keys boils down to two requirements: no-one besides you can access your keys; and you really can access them when you need them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these two requirements are pulling in opposite directions. If you make it really hard for an adversary to access your keys (taking perhaps highly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2021/10/15/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-whatever/?sh=3bf1339c4c1f">elaborate precautions</a>), then it becomes harder for you to access them too.</p>
 Social Recovery  
<p><a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html">Social recovery wallets</a> are a very elegant proposal to address the problem that you may lose access to your keys, made by Vitalik Buterin. It allows you to nominate friends that can help you recover your assets if you lose your private key.  The idea is that instead of storing your assets in an account for which you hold the private key, you create a smart contract account to store the assets.  You will still have an account with a private key, but instead of holding the assets directly, that account has the right to access the assets on your smart contract account.  If you lose your private key, you can create a new account with a new private key, and with the help of your friends you can register the new account on your smart contract to access your assets.</p>
 Let’s see this as an example.  
<p>Alice has some crypto assets, so she creates a smart contract C that holds them, and she creates an account A for which she has the private key. The contract C is configured to allow the holder of A to access the assets.  Alice has friends Xavier, Yvonne, and Zandra, who respectively own and have the private keys for accounts X, Y and Z.  Alice enables her friends as helpers, which she can use in the event that she loses her private key. </p>

<p>The logic of the smart contract C is thus as follows:</p> 
   There is a variable in the smart contract, called owner. The account in this variable can access the funds.   
   The holders of accounts X, Y and Z can jointly set the owner to any other account. 
 
<p>Initially, the owner is set to A. Thus, Alice as the holder of account A can access the funds. If Alice loses the private key for A, she can create a new account B, and ask X, Y and Z to update the smart contract so that the new owner is B. In this way, she recovers access to her funds.</p>

<p>Of course, this example is probably simpler than it should be.  Xavier, Yvonne and Zandra might not be available when Alice wants them, or they may have forgotten their own keys. So Alice could arrange the logic using a threshold system: she could nominate five friends, and stipulate that any three of the five are required in order to update the owner variable. Another issue is that Alice may want to protect against the possibility that her friends could conspire to change the owner to an address of their choice, so that they can steal her money. The logic of the social recovery contract can be designed to mitigate this risk too. Smart contracts allow arbitrary conditions to be specified, so Alice can create whatever access rules she likes.</p>

 Do social recovery wallets solve the problem of losing access to your crypto keys?  
<p>Not quite. </p>

 What happens if one of Alice’s friends loses their keys?  
<p>That problem is somewhat mitigated by the threshold solution; Alice can ask her other friends. </p>

 But suppose several of Alice’s friends have lost their keys, and there is no longer a threshold number of them that can help her?  
<p>Well, perhaps the friends have also used social recovery wallets, and when Alice appeals to them, they can in turn appeal to their friends. This might work, provided the network of friends is wide enough, and there are not too many short cycles in the “friends graph”.  But the solution is fundamentally limited. </p>

<p>Imagine a world in which everyone has lost their keys. Then no social recovery can take place.</p>

<p>Social recovery wallets help spread the risk of key loss, but they cannot mitigate it completely, because a core principle of smart contracts is that private-key accounts are the only accounts that can initiate transactions.  So the ability to recover private keys is essential, and social recovery wallets can’t substitute for that.</p>

 The Solution: PAD Recovery 
<p>PAD Recovery is a system that addresses the problem of key loss. Similar to the social recovery wallet concept, it allows a user Alice to nominate friends who can help in a situation where the user has lost their key or seed phrase. Unlike social recovery wallets, the idea is that Alice can recover the lost secret directly. </p>

<p>PAD Recovery works by encrypting the private key or seed phrase using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem">threshold-based cryptography</a>, so that a given number of the user’s friends can jointly decrypt a secret which in turn enables the user to decrypt their key.  Like social wallets, Alice has to be careful to choose friends that won’t abuse her trust, by conspiring against her.  As in social recovery wallets, she can mitigate this risk by avoiding telling them who else is in her nominated group of friends. But PAD Recovery has an interesting take on another way to deal with this risk.</p>

<p>PAD Recovery is based on <a href="https://www.pad.tech/post/what-is-pad">PAD</a>, which stands for <a href="https://www.pad.tech/post/what-is-pad">Privacy-Preserving Accountable Decryption</a>.</p>
<p>PAD is a way in which decryption operations can be forced to be recorded on a ledger, making them transparent, or accountable. This means that it’s impossible to get a decryption without recording the decryption event on the blockchain, and thus alerting relevant parties. </p>

<p>In the case of PAD Recovery, Alice can be notified whenever decryptions of her seed phrase or private key are made. PAD can be configured so there is a time-delay between decryption requests and the decryption taking place. So Alice can ensure that she gets notified whenever her friends try to decrypt her key, and if this was not being done on her request, she can take action to prevent it.</p>

<p>Thus, PAD Recovery is complementary to social recovery wallets. Both of them are useful to ensure that your private keys will be available when you need them. </p>

In the meantime, new testnet features are on the horizon that will enable more powerful decentralized usecases.</p>  Simplified and improved ID privacy by adding “source of funds” address to registration, enabling a specific ID or z-address to be used for the funds to prepare and register an identity.  Advanced sub-ID registration for decentralized identities with new business models, semi-centralized identities for voting and other purposes, and centralized identities that can be issued and sold via centralized currencies.  Decentralized fractional currencies can issue identities, depending on their parameters, and the person getting such an ID pays the blockchain identity import fee in native currency as well as the specified fee in the currency issuing the ID. The issuing currency fee is burned, benefitting all holders of the issuing currency by reducing supply by the fee amount and leaving the same reserves, raising conversion rates. Centralized currencies, whether fractional, token, or even native, issue identities and the fees are paid to the controlling ID of the currency, not&nbsp;burned.  New “requires permission” and “referral required” issuance is supported. If this is specified as an option in an ID issuing currency definition, which may still be a decentralized issuer, the identity registration transaction must be counter-signed by either the ID of the issuing currency (“requires permission”) or a valid referrer (“referral required”) which either is the issuing currency ID or an unrevoked ID with the same parent as the new identity. The identity registration command and API will enforce this and create transactions that must be signed in this&nbsp;manner.  Separate pricing, referral namespaces, and referral levels for all identity namespaces are supported (ie. only *.fanclub@ can refer for name.fanclub@).  Pricing of sub-IDs for a fractional currency can be either in the currency itself or denominated in any of its reserves (eg. USD, VRSC, EUR, etc.) to enable compatibility with ID-based rights licensing or royalty streams priced in any currency.  Gateway registration for centralized or decentralized non-name controller gateways (the ETH bridge, for example) that allow issuance of, for example, mike.veth@, priced in USD, and paid in Bridge.VETH.  Creation of “mapped currencies” using the gateway registered IDs, such as BAT.vETH mapped to Ethereum BAT, for example. Normal sub-IDs cannot create currencies, but this is enabled for gateways that are not name controllers to provide them with services that would be harder for them to write than use from&nbsp;Verus.

Why are game engines so important to the future of the Metaverse? And how does Emergence, a key utility of Open Meta™, allow the Open Metaverse?<p>We have seen unbelievable technological leaps and bounds in just 80 years. Now, as we stand on the cusp of Web 3.0 and the Open Metaverse, there’s no telling what life and technology will look like in a year, let alone another&nbsp;80.</p><p>One thing we do know? Game engines will play an increasingly important role. As more and more of our experiences are immersive, we’ll need tools to develop&nbsp;them.</p><p>It’s not that game engines are new. Video games, computers, and Internet technologies have evolved at a breathtaking pace since the first digital computer was developed in 1942. The game Spacewar! was shared amongst programmer circles in the 1960s, starting a cascade that would lead to console wars, id Software’s DOOM! game engine in 1993, and incredible worldwide gaming phenomena like World of Warcraft and Fortnite. When Tim Berners-Lee unveiled the World Wide Web in 1990, nobody could have envisioned that web-connected smartphones would live in millions of pockets within 30&nbsp;years.</p><p>But game engines aren’t just for games&nbsp;anymore.</p> The Leap From Web 2.0 to Web&nbsp;3.0 <p>Creative minds build on the accomplishments of their predecessors — they don’t reinvent the wheel every day. If somebody had had to rediscover metallurgy every time they wanted to make something, we would never have made it out of the Stone&nbsp;Age.</p><p>The same goes for technological development, especially video games. Our species has become adept at combining previous advancements with modern findings and forward-thinking to create new products and processes.</p><p>Our current version of the Internet, Web 2.0, was initially built by web developers, but then co-opted by corporate interests. It brought a lot of positive change and connected people on a global level, but it also came with a lot of&nbsp;baggage.</p><p>Web 3.0 and the Open Metaverse are the next stages of the technological revolution. Instead of being centralized and built by the same corporate gatekeepers that developed Web 2.0, this new paradigm promises an immersive digital experience created by game developers. But this doesn’t mean it’s just another video game to play for fun. It is so much&nbsp;more.</p> What Exactly Is The Open Metaverse? <p>It feels like the term “Metaverse” is currently being used by every major corporation and tech person in the world, but this has led to a misunderstanding of what it is — and what it can be. The Open Metaverse is not just an immersive VR video game with blockchain mechanics shoehorned in, neither is it a movement to attach crypto Play-to-Earn ideas to video games you already know and&nbsp;love.</p><p>Instead of thinking of the Open Metaverse as a video game, think of it as a digital Gamespace. You’re not just playing; you’re adding a digital layer to your physical existence. The Open Metaverse extends your day-to-day life into a new gamified frontier, where you can chase professional and financial opportunities, experience love and heartbreak, freely express yourself, own your digital life and, ultimately, craft your own&nbsp;story.</p> Developing the Open Metaverse <p>The next generation of developers is looking beyond the lines of code, building an Open Metaverse that provides an interoperable, secure, open, and community-driven digital future designed for everyone. They realized that they could drop these new features into toolboxes for use by others, thereby freeing up creative minds for more out-of-the-box thinking. This led to the idea of the game engine: a software framework that contains all the necessary libraries, support programs, and tools that are needed to create digital assets and the physics of their interactions.</p><p>But while game engines do provide a way to accelerate the growth of Web 3.0 and the Open Metaverse, the main issue is that they are still rooted within Web 2.0. Most of them are publicly traded companies with proprietary offerings, which means profit is the primary motive. They don’t see an Open Metaverse as something that serves their interests as for-profit companies.</p> Driving the Future With Unity and&nbsp;Unreal <p>Game engines have become the prime movers for layering the digital on top of the physical, allowing for the creation of digital twins of physical objects and providing a sandbox for testing and exploration. They started as game development frameworks but have expanded to so much more, in such a short space of&nbsp;time.</p><p>The undisputed market leaders for game engines are Unity and Unreal. These two juggernauts came onto the scene in the late 90s and early 2000s, furiously evolving and expanding into uses across multiple industries. Since their debuts, these two game engines have grown to account for over 70% of the top 1000 mobile games, attracting millions of developers and making up over 60% of the game engine&nbsp;market.</p><p>Both engines are now being used for digital rendering in industries like film, automotive, architecture, civil engineering, and more. The ability to easily create digital twins of physical items, test scenarios with hyper-realistic physics, and create models of products and ideas for presentations has made these the tools of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>But there are problems with interoperability and proprietary uses. Unity is a for-profit company that doesn’t have other sources of revenue to help offset licensing of its engine. Epic, the creator of Unreal, has massive revenue streams coming in from Fortnite, but interoperability is limited and it is prohibitively expensive to port a game from Unreal to another&nbsp;engine.</p><p>These game engines have amazing potential, but they are still lacking the ingredients we need to construct an Open Metaverse future.</p> Bringing Game Engines to Web 3.0 With Emergence SDK <p>The Emergence Software Development Kit (SDK) is the missing piece of the puzzle that will cut across the different game engines and bring interoperable security and sovereignty to&nbsp;users.</p><p>The Emergence Agent Interface offers a game-style user interface that will be available in Unity- and Unreal-based programs. The Agent’s functionality is backed by your Personal Stack — a decentralized service architecture allowing for pluggable services and secure storage, completely under your control. The Personal Stack manages content storage for NFTs, digital assets, Universal Feed posts and products, and hosting for marketplaces or other&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Emergence is developed as an open source protocol and offered to the community by the Open Meta DAO: a non-profit, decentralized, and community-driven engine pushing for an Open Metaverse and digital self-sovereignty. The DAO’s framework of community Houses and open governance will ensure the Open Metaverse is constructed by the community, for the community, avoiding the pitfalls of Web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Developers will be able to use the plug-and-play tools of Unity and Unreal to build the assets and physics of the new virtual worlds. Meanwhile, Emergence will give developers plug-and-play sovereignty and security tools, as well as ensuring the voices of the Open Metaverse community are&nbsp;heard.</p><p>Web 3.0 and the Open Metaverse are the next steps in our digital evolution, but they have to be done right. We can’t afford to over-compromise and make a Web 2.5 that ostracizes future generations by adding more elaborate pay schemes to popular game space experiences.</p><p>Emergence and the <a href="https://www.openmetadao.com/">Open Meta DAO</a> will provide the tools needed to construct a digital Game Space that offers privacy, interoperability, and abundance.</p><p>These are the vital components that will allow us to realize the words of Richard Buckminster Fuller and become ‘architects of the future, not its victims.’</p><p>Join a community that is passionate about the Open Metaverse.

<p>By Kian Paimani, Parity Technologies</p> Bags-List: One Step User Friendlier. <p>Something that has happened during the last months and deserves a shoutout is both <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps">Polkadot.js apps</a>, and the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-plus-extension/">Polkadot.js plus extension</a> supporting bags-list 🎉!</p><p>In both interfaces, nominators can ensure that they are:</p>  Placed in the best possible bag given their staked DOTs.  Places in the best place inside the bag to which they belong. This is particularly important for those who are near the minimum active nominator threshold.<br>  <p>See the new <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nominator#bags-list">wiki page</a> related to bags-list on the Polkadot wiki for more details on this!</p> Nomination Pools update: Wiki page out, Deployed to Westend. <p>Nomination pools have been the main topic for the last few months, and are becoming one stop closer to mainnet production! As of this writing, the 9.20 release of Polkadot has been finalized, in which the corresponding Westend runtime contains the new nomination pools pallet. Get some <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-DOT#getting-westies">Westies (WND)</a> and start experimenting with nomination pools!</p><p>Similarly, Polkadot.js Apps now has support for the pools as a new tab, and a new page about nomination pools has been created in the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">Polkadot Wiki</a>. For other apps, explorers, builders and UIs who want to support nomination pools, you can join the “<a href="https://matrix.to/#/!pXhsIqCSnUniflVQbq:matrix.parity.io?via=matrix.parity.io&amp;via=matrix.org">Nomination Pools UI Support</a>” matrix chat to connect to other builders and ask your questions form us!</p><p>We invite everyone who tries out the pools to report any potential bugs to us either via the <a href="https://www.parity.io/bug-bounty/">parity bug-bounty email</a>, or directly to <a href="mailto:kian@parity.io">kian@parity.io</a>.</p> Nomination Pools: Why Bother? <p>This is a small note about why nomination pools are important for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.</p><p>First, looking from the perspective of an intending-nominator, joining a pool has two main benefits:</p>  The limits to receive rewards in the pools will be significantly lower than the limits to receive rewards as a nominator. For example, to be a nominator in Polkadot now, one needs 10 DOTs to nominate, and around 120 DOTs to actively receive rewards. We suspect pools to be deployed such that anyone with as low as 1 DOT can receive rewards.  You will have more control over your staking rewards: This may or may not be relevant, but one fundamental difference between the pool members and nominators is that nominators receive their rewards automatically by validators, whereas pool members decide themselves when to receive their rewards.  <p>Next, looking at the validators, the existence of pools is a great opportunity for validators (or a group of validators) to open pools, and attract more staking input into their validators of choice. In essence, the inflow of DOTs into the staking system will inevitably increase with the deployment of nomination pools, and there is an incentive for validators to make sure this inflow is directed toward their validators. This can be particularly interesting to waiting validators.</p> Notable Contributions <p>The main code contribution of this month to the staking world has been <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/10694">the main staking-pools PR</a>, along all of its sub-PRs being merged. The most notable of these is the ability of partial unbonding, which has been <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11212">added</a> now.</p><p>Moreover, <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11002">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11221">changes</a> were made and merged into the details of the signed submission in the election provider pallet, improving the UX of the staking-miner application. More details and updates in the staking-miner coming in the following months!</p><p>Thinking about contributing? Look for issues in the Substrate repo with the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AZ1-mentor">mentor tag</a>, or the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/projects/10">NPoS and Elections project</a>. All successful contributions will get an on-chain tip initiated by the staking team.</p><p>Also, if you are interested in contributing long-term, there’s a “<a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/parity/jobs/5064110003">Staking / PoS Engineer</a>” position available at Parity Technologies, targeting exactly those who will contribute to the staking system.</p> By The Numbers <p>Confused by the meaning of all these terms? What is “intention”? What is “electing/electable”? Then checkout the <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-february-2022/">February update</a>, in which we explained the new staking terminology.</p><p>Polkadot</p><p>Nominators</p><p>Stake</p><p>Count</p><br><p>Minimum</p><p>Current</p><p>Max</p><p>intention</p><p>10 DOT</p><p>26233</p><p>50000</p><p>electing</p><p>125 DOT</p><p>21654</p><p>22500</p><p>active</p><p>124.1 DOT</p><p>20878</p><p>22500</p><p>Validators</p><p>Stake</p><p>Count</p><br><p>Minimum</p><p>Current</p><p>Max</p><p>intention</p><p>0 DOT</p><p>1028</p><p>1200</p><p>electable</p><p>0 DOT</p><p>1028</p><p>1200</p><p>active</p><p>1.89 MDOT</p><p>297</p><p>297</p><p>Kusama</p><p>Nominators</p><p>Stake</p><p>Count</p><br><p>Minimum</p><p>Current</p><p>Max</p><p>intention</p><p>100 mKSM</p><p>7372</p><p>20000</p><p>electing</p><p>0 KSM</p><p>6612</p><p>12500</p><p>active</p><p>673 pKSM</p><p>6612</p><p>12500</p><p>Validators</p><p>Stake</p><p>Count</p><br><p>Minimum</p><p>Current</p><p>Max</p><p>intention</p><p>0</p><p>2036</p><p>4000</p><p>electable</p><p>0</p><p>2036</p><p>4000</p><p>active</p><p>4.39 kKSM</p><p>1000</p><p>1000</p>

    <p>Each Monday, the Horizen team has a public team call to ensure that our community stays up to date on the latest project insights and updates. <br><br></p>
 June 27 2022 Updates 
<p>Engineering / Product Updates</p>
<p></p>
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global">TokenMint</a> 
<p>Horizen’s TokenMint platform V1 (MVP) is made up of a&nbsp; tokenization sidechain, a web <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">wallet-Cobalt,</a> a <a href="https://explorer-testnet.tokenmint.global/">block explorer</a>, and a token generator to support the economy of your projects, without the need for setup or coding.</p>
<p>Mainnet release is currently in progress. Final rounds of testing performed, bug fix cycle is in progress. Mainnet activities are ongoing, security improvements introduced and safe storage recovery is in testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>V2 of the TokenMint Platform (NFT) adds D-POS and the possibility of minting NFTs. The development of the basic support for NTFs is near completion</p>
<p>The EVM Sidechain (EVM M1), which is The Ethereum Virtual Machine sidechain to bootstrap our DeFi has a target completion date of Q3 and we are currently on track. Currently started integration activities with MetaMask, also developing the methods used by Ethereum compatible wallets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen team is also working on our sidechain monitoring system, which is a simple reference design to check the status of a list of sidechains and nodes. The project is currently being deployed on testnet. The next steps for this project are to deploy and use it to monitor our tokenization platform in testnet.&nbsp;</p>
 <a href="https://www.horizen.io/zendoo">Zendoo</a> 
<p>Last week we finished reviewing the design document about the management of those sidechains whose use case doesn’t require the seizing functionality. The approach we are going to follow is the one focused on the variable epoch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some sidechains where the mainchain backward transfer request is not required, where we don’t bind the sidechain to answer the request, so with these sidechains we can relax the concept of seizing. The question is how to implement it in an efficient way. After we perform this analysis, the best approach to proceed with is to make a variable epoch length sidechain. &nbsp; This will allow for example for a sidechain to submit a certificate with a higher or lower rate based on backward transfer requests happening on the sidechain side. This is possible since we don’t have the requirement of posting the certificate and answering mainchain backward requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore on Zendoo, while exploring the code for changes related to the non-seizing sidechain, we also found a potential area of improvement that is related to shielded transactions. Additional checks have to be performed, but it seems we may be able to introduce an optimization for the PHGR transactions.</p>
 SDK 
<p>In regards to Blaze we are bringing on the developments related to the next version of Blaze. As part of this we are working on multiple things – forger transactions filtering strategy which has been changed, sorting by fee rate instead of fee, everything has been completed and merged. Regarding improvements to the mem pool where the maximum size limit was added without automatic cleanup strategy per fee rate, is currently under review. Other improvements related to the login system are also under review.&nbsp;</p>
 EVM sidechain &nbsp; 
<p>Metamask now works with the sidechain EVM RPC server. Stake withdrawal request and EOA message processor are completed, which are pretty important for EVM sidechain implementation. We added the chain ID support for the transaction so you are able to specify the chain identifier in the transaction which is another important feature added. EVM execution processor – the implementation has been completed and is currently under review. This is another core part of the EVM sidechain, because it allows the possibility to execute/invoke the EVM, smart contract, specific implementation for staking or withdrawing. Last point is the RPC server wallet related endpoints implementation is currently in process.&nbsp;</p>
 The Proving System 
<p>During the last couple of weeks we went on with analysis on various processes and we are deeply analyzing the VM memory management identities, this is part of the SDK EVM strategy. </p>
<p>BD/Operations Updates</p>
<p>We have very good news for our community today. Wintermute, one of the largest market makers, launched their electronic OTC desk called Node, it supports 250+ assets and ZEN is one of them already, with zero fee execution. Node is accessible by US based customers, including in NY state. Need to be an accredited investor or hold over $250K in assets or earn over 100K British Pounds per year. Wintermute node doesn’t have a minimum order size, we are really happy for this new integration and it lowers the barriers of entry for ZEN, big thanks to our partners at Wintermute for supporting us. </p>
<p>Leadership Updates</p>
<p><a href="http://zencon.events"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://zencon.events">ZenCon0</a> – plans have been finalized. We will be hosting our first Horizen ecosystem summit, which we learnt a lot from Zcash’s first event years ago. The location will be in Milan, Italy, Horizen Labs will be hosting a big event there to meet the team. The dates are September 11-13 for public events. The <a href="https://zencon.events">ZenCon0 website</a> has additional information. We will have a limited number of tickets, so we are going to keep it fairly small for this first iteration. We want you to have an inside peek at the team, how we do business, see some presentations, work with us for a few days, and more information coming!</p>
<p>TokenMint – we are on track for the middle of July release here on mainnet, the delay is due to some security enhancements and other changes. We will also launch with a meme coin, not a utility coin, or official coin launch, but it will be a fun token. NFT functionality will be coming next on <a href="https://tokenmint.global">TokenMint</a>, we are working on trustless sales and other functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to check out Rob’s speech from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cGfULIwRg">Consensus</a> – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cGfULIwRg">the blockchain trilemma and the unique way that Horizen is solving the process</a>. </p>
<p>Horizen Labs hosted an event at NYC.NFT and Zain was also on a panel at the event. </p>
<p>We are doing a lot simultaneously, but in the meantime we are tracking towards that TokenMint mainchain launch, which we are really excited about. </p>
<p>Q &amp; A Section</p>
<p>Q:&nbsp; Following the general surprise move DYDX moving to Cosmos. Are you seeing any potential shifts to architecture like Horizen given the similarities with Cosmos?</p>
<p>A: Not yet, we are not seeing that, but we are racing to catch up with other protocols and once we become a more well known sidechain platform, with some interesting tokenomics, it will be expected for Horizen to be a solid destination for people who want to do that, so we think the market is still wide open. When you’re dealing with a down market you have more time to build and push products out there. We’ve been thinking about what we can do with tokenomics, incentives and getting more people to launch their chains with us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Does Test Zenny holder have some priority for ZenCon0 tickets?</p>
<p>A: It is an Invitation only summit and festival, it is open to anyone in the community who is interested in taking part in this event. There will be a form for people to submit a request to attend for free. We won’t be charging for the ticket, but there is a review process and you will need to submit a form through the event website. More information to come on this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: When more info on Zenny token mainnet launch?</p>
<p>A: We are going to be kicking off with the meme token. Rob’s thought for Zenny is that it has deep meaningful utility in our ecosystem. We’ve been putting in more effort on this, the meme token is going to be different, more fun at the launch, additional details to come. </p>

 Our latest partnership with Themis brings another integration for BlockWallet users. <p><a href="https://themis.exchange/">Themis</a> is a permissionless protocol that enables liquidity providers to collateralize their LP and borrow stablecoins to hedge, speculate or leverage to earn higher yields. Themis also enables users to create anonymous lending between pools of funds and mortgagers of&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>When using lending/borrowing protocols, you might garner unwanted attention by moving large funds from the protocol to your wallet. To stay protected, you can utilize BlockWallet’s Privacy Pools to deposit and mix funds in a smart contract. This removes the link between the protocol and your wallet, making it near impossible to perform a targeted&nbsp;attack.</p> Unlocking liquidity for the Metaverse &amp;&nbsp;GameFi <p>As the Metaverse becomes increasingly prevalent in the crypto universe, Themis is at the center of creating liquidity for booming Metaverse and GameFi economies.</p><p>Themis lets you leverage Uniswap v3 LP positions to borrow stablecoins and blue-chip assets so your initial capital remains in the Uniswap pool generating yield while unlocking its liquidity for greater capital efficiency. Since Uniswap v3 positions are NFTs, they’ve built the capacity to sign in to the protocol with NFTs as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Themis has also launched a utility-driven NFT campaign that rewards users who lend/borrow with NFTs that come with perks like a higher LTV ratio. And in the future, they’ll support using other NFTs as collateral for loans and truly become The Bank of the Metaverse!</p> About Themis <p>With <a href="https://themis.exchange/">Themis</a>, you’ll be able to receive a loan using your NFTs from Uniswap v3 as collateral — something no other protocol currently offers.</p><p>This way your liquidity will remain in the pool generating yield while unlocking additional value to use however you wish — the ultimate money&nbsp;lego!</p><p>In addition to collateralizing your NFTs, Themis allows you to lend, farm, and even bid on liquidated positions in a Dutch Auction. Themis’ collateralized NFTs will offer much more utility than simply Uniswap v3 in the near future, but stay tuned as we’ll dig into that&nbsp;soon!</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a privacy-first non-custodial browser extension wallet where you can store, send or receive crypto and interact with your favorite blockchain apps privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy poses real security risks. BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating friction and making privacy accessible for everyone.</p><p>BlockWallet protects you and ensures privacy by default. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain apps, BlockWallet routes all node requests through Privacy Proxies, which masks the IP address and other metadata, that can be used to identify and track you on a blockchain. You can also use the Privacy Pools feature, powered by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zk-snarks">zk-SNARKs</a> technology, to deposit and mix funds in a smart contract. This allows transferring funds without links to your history and identity on the blockchain, effectively rendering them untraceable. BlockWallet offers integrated Flash-Bot Protection, shielding you from sandwich attacks when you trade on DEXes. Meanwhile, the Phishing Protection feature combats phishing scams by generating unique artwork on all sensitive pages.</p><p>BlockWallet is not a compromise. It’s privacy-first, but it still packs all features you would expect from a wallet. With full Web 3.0 support, the wallet allows you to connect to any&nbsp;dApp.</p><p>Become a part of the BlockWallet community today:</p><p><a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Homepage</a> | <a href="https://blockwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetBlockWallet">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/blockwallet">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/69gvNKatdb">Discord</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EKVZ2xWXEH">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://hello@blockwallet.io/">E-mail</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet/blockwallet-partners-with-themis-348507a1470e">BlockWallet Partners With Themis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet">BlockWallet</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><br>Yes, address reuse is bad for your privacy. It's the easiest way to lose privacy when transacting with Bitcoin. Until a bitcoin user understands this, their privacy remains out of their control while jeopardizing the privacy of others transacting with them.</p><p>A bitcoin address can be likened to a digital "invoice" used to accept payment on the blockchain. It acts as an intended destination for payment on the blockchain. An address is generated from a wallet in the form of a string of 26-35 characters and is shared with the party who intends to pay you in bitcoin. Any funds sent to an address are under the control of its originating bitcoin wallet.</p><p>Address reuse is when a user uses one address for more than one transaction. But what makes address reuse so bad for privacy? What risks does it extend to other users transacting with you?</p><p>To bring the matter to light it's useful to understand what happens under the hood when we reuse an address.</p><p>Many users are now getting familiar with the fact that bitcoin transactions are stored on a public ledger which acts like an open receipt book containing all inbound and outbound transactions from all addresses. Anyone can view transactions associated with an address even without sophisticated tools, for example <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer">here</a>. However, the only information a viewer can get is the bitcoin transacted into and out of an address. </p><p>When you pay or receive bitcoin, the address(es) associated with the transaction can be viewed. However, due to the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin addresses, this is not enough information to reveal the real-world identity of a user. </p><p>Despite the anonymity offered, bitcoin addresses only act as an alias involved in a transaction on the blockchain. It takes a single transaction to reveal enough information about the identity of the user and every transaction associated with an address opens a door to traceability. With each transaction, more information about the user is revealed and available for possible real-world identification.</p><p>Users transacting with addresses belonging to users whose privacy has been compromised risk losing their privacy through association. One address reuse is enough to give away your privacy even years after it’s long-forgotten because the blockchain is immutable. Once on the blockchain, forever on the blockchain.</p><p>Address reuse is intentional when a user only uses one address to receive and store unspent coins. Such cases may be due to habit, the need to maintain trust, or availability. An example of such address reuse happens on exchanges and donation addresses. As bitcoin users, we may also intentionally send bitcoin to the same address to others resulting in address reuse. This type of address reuse is the most rampant affecting <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoin-address-re-use-statistics/">half of all bitcoin users</a>.</p><p>For some use cases, address reuse may happen when a user owns a single address wallet or paper wallet. Single address wallets are meant to offer convenience and ease to the users by generating a single address that is meant to receive and store their unspent change. In the case where a user prefers privacy, they are better suited to using Deterministic Address Pool Wallets that generate new addresses for new transactions. Paper wallets, on the other hand, may always require the user to be physically present to make a transaction.</p><p>Addresses are designed to receive bitcoin and are supposed to be disposable with every use. When the address is reused, the owner's balance user is open on the ledger. As a business or individual using bitcoin to receive payments, the amount of revenue or balance may always be known if it is tied to one address. Unless your money matters are meant to be public, reusing an address will always make sure your balances are open for everyone to see.</p><p>With a discovered identity associated with an address, the user faces the risk of censorship. For example, an address observed donating funds to an activist may be blacklisted from exchanges, and addresses sending funds to the activist may risk being targeted as adversaries in dictatorial states.</p><p>Address reuse facilitates surveillance. If you transact with one address, it is easy to generate a relationship graph of who you transact with, where your money goes and who you receive it from. Every single piece of your financial information will be ushering you into the arms of many surveilling organizations that are always analyzing and tracking transactions on the public ledger. Despite the distance between conspiracy and fact about the level of surveillance on bitcoin, it’s important to understand that present technology is potent in allowing full deanonymization of bitcoin transactions. &nbsp;A little more effort is required by a user to be free from such surveillance but changing addresses does enough to keep your transactions hard to trace.</p><p>With all the apparent risks that address reuse poses to privacy, transacting with a new address for every transaction is about care, that the amount of privacy you have is transmissible to every user you transact with. It’s not necessary to understand the intricacies of bitcoin to use the technology safely. &nbsp;Picking a good wallet that allows you to generate fresh addresses for every new transaction is good enough. Bitcoin allows us the generation of new addresses whenever we need them. This feature was meant to preserve anonymity. All coins sent to every address generated are always under our control meaning we can transact with as many addresses as we need. The convenience of reusing addresses has the price of privacy.<br></p>

<p>In this re-run from September 2018, Benedict Evans and Steven Sinofsky talk all about Tesla — and more broadly, the nature of disruption overall. How disruptive is Tesla really, and&nbsp;what exactly are they disrupting — from the dashboard to car makers to vendors to energy source to autonomy overall?</p><p>The tech industry is littered with leading innovators... who nonetheless failed to be the dominant leader in the end. So the question should be, is this new thing fundamentally difficult for the incumbent to do, and how does it relate to market dominance? Which of these things are important in order for Tesla to be the new BMW or the new GM? Looking back at other examples historically (Microsoft, GM's Saturn Brand, and of course the iPhone), what kind of disruption matters most for market dominance? And what is the long view of how software is eating transportation?</p>

<p>Today, we are excited to announce that we are launching the first big feature update for the xx messenger — Account Backup.</p>



<p>Upon updating your messenger, within settings you will now be able to select your own cloud service provider to backup your account. This will allow you to set a recovery password and store an encrypted backup of your account on that provider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This backup contains your username and your contacts. It currently does not backup chats, group chats, or requests. Once a backup is restored, your contacts will be prompted to reopen the app in order to restore connections.</p>



<p>This backup system is unique in that it allows you to select your own cloud service provider in order to execute the backup.&nbsp; We currently support Google Drive, Apple iCloud, and DropBox. We plan to add more providers in future updates, including allowing you to select your own personal SFTP server.</p>



<p>As you have probably seen from the teasers we have been releasing, the next step for the xx messenger is an upgrade of the UX and how the app flows in general.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you haven’t had a chance to check out these recent teaser videos you can find them all on our YouTube channel <a href="https://youtube.com/c/xxnetwork">here</a>. Just click on the “Videos” tab to see videos in order of most recent release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, we love to hear community feedback so if you have any questions, comments, or just plain old encouragement for the hard working developers, I know they would like to hear from you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feel free to drop comments in our <a href="https://discord.gg/Y8pCkbK">Discord</a> #xx-messenger channel, or our friendly neighborhood <a href="https://t.me/xxnetwork">Telegram</a> channel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks everyone. Onwards and Upwards!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The xx messenger is a quantum secure, untraceable messaging platform that enables people around the world to communicate privately and securely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can learn more about the xx messenger <a href="https://xx.network/messenger/">here</a> and find the app and updates on&nbsp; Google Play and the Apple App Store now. Or get the source code yourself from the xx network website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Owning and managing user data has turned from an asset to a liability for most applications and services. This is especially true for web3 projects where, even if encrypted, sensitive user data should never be stored on-chain, as this makes the assumption that the chain’s contents will never be decrypted at any time in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>As a general rule, blockchains excel at transparency, enforcing provable claims, partially due to the architectural decision that they store all of their state as publicly accessible, immutable data. Also, most chains are not suited for direct data storage (and frequent retrieval) and accommodating large user data volumes would lead to chain bloat with consequences on speed and cost. Hence the following conundrum.</p><p>As many web3 developers have chosen to simply not store contextual user data in reaction to these constraints, the user experience of web3 applications suffers. Without user data, developers are flying blind, forced to build for wallets rather than people, with no real insight into the users behind the usage that can be seen on-chain. Also, for many reasons (governance, community, access, compliance, etc.) many web3 projects are increasingly requesting and storing sensitive user data off-chain — using legacy web2 services and home-grown databases, creating unnecessary vulnerabilities for web3 projects and their&nbsp;users.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a>, which provides powerful APIs and encrypted storage that close the gap between users’ on-chain activity and their off-chain data, empowering developers to build delightful user experiences without putting users’ data at risk. Privy is the web3 connected sensitive data vault for projects / applications, and the data is encrypted so neither the developers nor Privy ever see it.&nbsp;.</p><p>With a few extremely simple API calls, such as `privy.put()` and `privy.get()`, developers can encrypt user data directly from the front-end, and privately associate data to on-chain addresses. This enables developers to,&nbsp;e.g.:</p>  Text or email users without handling their personal information directly,  Take on financial and compliance data without storing it on their&nbsp;stack,  Surface a unified UI across a user’s various wallets across chains without doxxing&nbsp;them.  <p>Our Thesis</p><p>Whereas “user data as a liability” is increasingly an established problem in web2 / SaaS, web3’s data infrastructure and ethos around privacy created a much more urgent need to find a robust solution that integrates natively into web3 where required. This should also unlock new user experiences, making web3 more accessible and competitive.</p><p>However, this is just the beginning. As web3 matures, there will be an opportunity to reinvent the data paradigms that have failed the internet over the last 30 years and give users back control over their data online. The next generation of data tooling should keep users in the loop and in control of their data across the web. That is why we are excited to back <a href="https://twitter.com/henri_stern">Henri</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/asta_li">Asta</a> given their unique and rare capabilities straddling very hard web3 and computer science &amp; software engineering challenges.

Whether you like it or not, you can’t miss crypto (we like it&nbsp;:D).</p><p>However, even as the space stands to reshape much of the Internet, finance and our culture, this broader adoption of crypto puts developers building in web3 in a challenging position. More users means more data. More data, more problems.</p><p>Personal data today comes with regulatory overhead, breaches and deep misalignment with users — and most developers don’t want to get near it. Yet, without user data, we are flying blind, forced to build for wallets rather than people, with no real insight into our users behind the usage we see on-chain.</p><p>And the seams show. The lack of user data in web3 has resulted in terrible user experiences for those accustomed to the modern web. Things like the inability to get an email when you’re about to get liquidated, or the need to keep signing in and out of dapps to see activity across wallets. You shouldn’t have to mine your users’ data or put your users at risk to ship great products.</p><p>Developers are busy enough trying to ship brilliant products without having to think through reinventing the data stack. We need better tooling to manage user data privately in&nbsp;web3.</p><p>Enter Privy.</p><p>Privy builds simple, powerful APIs to manage user data so you can integrate user data into your product easily. Privy helps you bridge the gap between users’ on-chain activity and their off-chain data so you can build delightful experiences without putting your users or product at risk.

    <p>We’ve wrapped up 2022. In Q1, we added six new integrations and pairs and welcomed 15 new team members. Our community continued to grow, with a 3.8% follower increase on Twitter and a 12.4% post engagement increase. We also saw significant growth on our website.</p>
<p>In Q1, we launched the Horizen Tokenization platform on the testnet and rolled out ZEN 3.1.0. We made significant progress on our zkAudit, SDK, and EVM compatibility prototype.</p>
<p>Further, we forged several new partnerships in Q1 and gained extensive exposure in the media.&nbsp;</p>
 Q1 Highlights 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ZBF_2022-Q1-review-numbers_APR22.jpg"></a></p>
 Community Growth and Updates 
<p>The community has always been central to what we do here at Horizen. In Q1, we saw continued growth and engagement from our community across all channels, with total audience growth of 3.4% and a 9.9% engagement increase across all platforms. Our Twitter following had the largest following increase with 3.8% new followers and a 12.4% post engagement increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also saw an increase in traffic to the Horizen Academy. Overall organic traffic grew by 28%, which helped educate our decision on updating the information on our educational platform. So this quarter, we redoubled our efforts to create new, informative content for our Academy to better serve our growing community of users. The new Academy will include more crypto general education content and refresh the Horizen-focused articles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also welcomed several new members to the ambassador program. As Q3 progresses, we look forward to welcoming more members to the program and finding new ways our ambassadors can contribute to our project!</p>
 Our Technology 
<p>We made progress on our technology front in Q1. Our tokenization platform is nearing launch. Our platform will also come with the release of our web wallet! We look forward to sharing more information with everyone as we come closer to the release. We also made significant progress on our zkAudit, SDK, and EVM compatibility prototype.</p>
<p>With Celsius implementing zkAudit in 2021, we are furthering the development of the protocol to streamline audits for companies of all sizes. We’ve also enabled SDK compatibility with a new proving system design and development.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zen-3-1-0/">ZEN 3.1.0</a>. This release modified the custom field serialization in sidechain creation transactions and more.&nbsp;</p>
 Our Partnerships 
<p>This quarter, we forged several new partnerships that will help us expand our reach and grow our community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kriptomat.io is a fiat onramp and multi-coin exchange. By providing ZEN-fiat pairs, we make it easier for users to purchase Horizen with fiat currency. Bifinity is another fiat onramp/PoS provider that will help us reach new users. Voyager is the largest retail crypto application, and we are excited to make it easier to use ZEN as a means of payment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also partnered with Binance Liquid Swap to add ZEN:USDT and ZEN:BNB liquidity pools, and with Okcoin and Bitget to provide USD and USDT spot pairs, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ZBF_2022-Q1-review-exchanges_APR22.jpg"></a></p>
 Horizen Node Growth 
<p>Horizen Q1 node network grew +2% from 2021 (yearly average) for secure nodes and +17% for super nodes.</p>

<p>In this week’s community spotlight, we’re joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/frankazuuring">Frank Zuuring</a>, a web developer and Web 3.0 enthusiast, to hear about why <a href="https://www.openmetadao.com/">Open Meta</a> is so important to him. Frank has been involved in discussions around Terms and Conditions, which focuses on creating universal terms of use that make Web 3.0 work for everyone. We also spoke about his vision for the future of the Open Meta&nbsp;DAO™.</p><p>Tell us a little about yourself and how you got involved in Open&nbsp;Meta.</p><p>I’ve been developing online full time since around 2007. My move into the digital space came about through my board game company. I was hiring different people to do all this stuff for the game and I wanted to learn how to do it myself and update things quickly and easily. That’s when I started learning, so after the company wrapped up in around 2007, I continued building websites for other&nbsp;people.</p><p>I came to Open Meta because I’m passionate about the bigger issues that we’re all facing and trying to create awareness. My game, Antarctica: Global Warming, was based around climate change. Now, as a parent of two children, I’m noticing problems in technology and the way things are developed and structured.</p><p>I watched The Social Dilemma on Netflix to understand what happens on these big platforms. Hearing the people who developed them say that they wouldn’t let their own children on them sparked my interest in finding potential solutions.</p><p>I started doing a lot of research, trying to understand different forms of deliberative democracy and looking at options such a sortition from Ancient Greece, and made some interesting connections between deliberative democracy and the problems we’re seeing online. We’re at a stage with technology where more people can get involved in the conversation to start making some changes, instead of just a few people in closed rooms making decisions for all of&nbsp;us.</p> While I was considering this and wondering “what kind of world are my kids going to inherit?” <p>While I was considering this and wondering “what kind of world are my kids going to inherit?” I came across Open Meta and became very interested in getting involved. This recent turn towards looking at Terms and Privacy — and maybe even a constitution of some sorts — is something that’s very important. I can’t do it alone; it needs to be talked about and we need to get plenty of people involved.</p><p>Do you see the DAO as something that has the power to democratize both the Metaverse and the world more generally?</p><p>I would definitely say there’s potential there. What interests me with Open Meta and the DAO is that it’s a starting point for the gathering of people with similar interests and concerns, as opposed to something that has just been built for the sake of hype or money. One of the curses of Web 3.0 is that it’s such a hyped topic that there’s lots of money being spent and that’s all you hear about. But there’s a group with a bigger vision, looking to make things in a better way than in Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, which you don’t get to hear about. Open Meta is one of the only places talking about opportunities like&nbsp;that.</p><p>I’ve been listening to a lot of the history of Web 1.0 and people in that space saw the opportunity to make the world more open. We would have the opportunity to be better as a society and a civilization because we’re all connected, and information would be freely available. However, we’ve seen a lot of walled gardens and a lot of money being made by a select few. The fear I have is that if we just look at one company to build all of this, we’ll end up back at Web 2.0. I want to make sure that doesn’t&nbsp;happen.</p><p>You’ve spoken a little bit about your fears for Web 3.0, but what are your aspirations for it and what it could&nbsp;be?</p><p>Equal opportunity is a huge driver. Having a discussion about what that looks like is why we’re here! Essentially, I’d like to see an easily accessible workplace for everyone, no matter where you are. That’s going to foster a culture that works better for us all, not just a few individuals.</p><p>Privacy and Terms are important to you. What do you see the applications being? People immediately associate it with child protection, but does it have applications outside of&nbsp;that?</p><p>One thing I’ve seen raised a lot is that people will own their data in the Metaverse. We’ll be in control of our own data. How will that work? That’s a really important element that needs to be brought into Terms. How are we going to make the data accessible and structured? There’s a common saying, that if you’re not paying for the product, it’s because you are the product. In Web 2.0, we know about some data being collected — but not all of it. I love the technology and how it helps us access information, but the people who are using it need to understand what owning their own data means. We need to guide companies on how that will work. When we have this understanding, people will be able to see and comprehend terms and say either “yes” or “no,” but with full understanding. As it stands, it’s still very murky in terms of what companies want from&nbsp;us.</p><p>By approaching these problems in a democratic way and discussing them, I’m hopeful we can make an environment that everyone benefits&nbsp;from.</p><p>Join <a href="https://twitter.com/frankazuuring">Frank</a> and others who are passionate about the Open Metaverse.

<p>The Inter-blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) is one of the world’s largest and most important interoperability protocols. As of today, IBC has connected more than 40 chains and, in the last 30 days, processed more than 12M unique transactions. This makes IBC by far the largest interoperability protocol by almost any&nbsp;measure.</p><p>One thing you might have missed about IBC, however, is that it also plays an essential role for enterprise.</p><p>With <a href="https://medium.com/@datachain/datachain-receives-a-grant-from-interchain-foundation-to-enable-interoperability-with-ethereum-7c9add7cef55">funding from Interchain Foundation</a>, Datachain has contributed to the Cosmos/IBC community with the goal of increasing the number of blockchains communicating with IBC. The focus of Datachain has been mainly on implementing <a href="https://ibcprotocol.org/lightClients/">IBC modules for various chains</a> such as Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Besu (Enterprise Ethereum) and&nbsp;Corda.</p><p>We believe that IBC is the best option to achieve interoperability between heterogeneous blockchains. Not only have enterprise partners such as <a href="https://medium.com/@datachain/datachain-and-ntt-data-successfully-verified-a-bridge-between-ethereum-and-hyperledger-fabric-using-56a96480e8a4">NTT Data</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@datachain/datachain-and-jcb-start-demonstration-experiment-to-build-a-digital-currency-exchange-platform-dd542c9e3bf6">JCB</a> implemented IBC, but also governments like <a href="https://medium.com/@bianjie/recap-how-irita-hub-interchain-services-run-on-the-bsn-a6b68b99ed8f">BSN</a> (Chinese government blockchain platform) and <a href="https://www.usdfconsortium.com/_files/ugd/823398_e30d0257e55240b98ee50642d7fc5141.pdf">USDF</a> (United States banks-backed stable coin) have either adopted or are considering adopting&nbsp;IBC.</p><p>This article will explain why IBC is important in the enterprise space for everyone interested in blockchain interoperability.</p> Interoperability Requirements in the Enterprise <p>There are a number of baseline requirements for enterprise interoperability:</p>  The ability to connect multiple heterogeneous blockchains and apply it to various use&nbsp;cases  Trustless interoperability  Use proven technology and avoid vendor&nbsp;lock-in   The ability to connect multiple heterogeneous blockchains and apply it to various use&nbsp;cases. <p>Because digital assets and digital currencies exist on multiple blockchains, it is necessary for enterprise users to connect all (or many) of them to unlock and maximize all use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Over the past few years, enterprise companies have built, or have started building blockchain-based services, and the platforms they use are different for each project. For example, Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Besu, and Corda are commonly used in the enterprise space.</p><p>Moreover, some use cases require connecting enterprise blockchains to public blockchains such as Tendermint. For example, <a href="https://medium.com/@datachain/datachain-and-jcb-start-demonstration-experiment-to-build-a-digital-currency-exchange-platform-dd542c9e3bf6">JCB has tested</a> PvP (Payment versus Payment) settlements between Hyperledger Fabric and Tendermint chains using IBC, to demonstrate exchanges between digital currencies on each blockchain.</p><p>Since combining all enterprise and public blockchains into a single chain is unrealistic, it is necessary to connect these various chains to expand the utility of blockchain technology.</p> Trustless Interoperability <p>Some projects set up intermediaries that help achieve interoperability, but this runs contrary to the primary paradigm of blockchain — decentralization and the removal of gatekeeping third parties. Ideally, when an enterprise blockchain connects to a public blockchain, it is best practice to avoid putting an additional trust layer between&nbsp;them.</p><p>Additionally, intermediaries require transaction fees which increases costs and can become cost prohibitive due to the high-security standards required (equivalent to that of large financial systems).</p><p>Therefore, achieving trustless interoperability is also essential.</p> Use proven technology and avoid vendor&nbsp;lock-in. <p>Enterprise companies looking to future-proof their tech, generally prefer proven technology and try to avoid vendor lock-in. This maintains flexibility and builds interoperability into their systems for the long-term. Therefore, it is preferable that applications open-source software in production.</p> Why IBC in Enterprise? <p>Circling back to the main theme of “why is IBC so important to the enterprise space?” Simply put, IBC meets all interoperability requirements for enterprise use cases of blockchains. But, how does IBC meet those requirements and why does it have an essential role in enterprises?</p><p>IBC is / provides:</p>  Trustless  Support for Heterogeneous Blockchain  Customizable On The Application Layer  Proven Technology   1. Trustless <p><a href="https://interchain-io.medium.com/welcome-to-the-ibc-gang-lets-talk-f469883e0ffe">IBC connects blockchains trustlessly</a>. With IBC, relayers pass packets between blockchains and, because each blockchain (not relayers) validates the other blockchain’s status via a light client, there is no need to trust the relayers. In other words: no additional trust layer is required.</p>Source: <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_A_Framework_for_Blockchain_Interoperability_2020.pdf">Inclusive Deployment of Blockchain for Supply Chains: Part 6 — A Framework for Blockchain Interoperability — World Economics Forum</a><p>* According to the report by the World Economic Forum, this architecture is referred to as the “Relay”&nbsp;method.</p><p>In the Relay method, IBC has advantages in its unique specification by establishing a direct channel between modules on both ledgers, thus preventing communication between unrelated modules. It also has a mechanism to avoid further communication using the channel when the light client detects misbehavior.</p> 2. Support for Heterogeneous Blockchains <p>Some people say IBC is only for Cosmos blockchains, but this is not true. Any blockchain with flexibility in smart contract features can communicate using IBC. And, developers in the Cosmos/IBC ecosystem have implemented <a href="https://ibcprotocol.org/lightClients/">IBC modules for a number of blockchains</a> to connect with&nbsp;IBC.</p><p><a href="https://ibcprotocol.org/lightClients/">https://ibcprotocol.org/lightClients/</a></p>Source: <a href="https://www.blockdata.tech/blog/general/81-of-the-top-100-public-companies-are-using-blockchain-technology">81 of the Top 100 Public Companies are using blockchain technology — BLOCKDATA</a><p>In the enterprise space, according to the research by <a href="https://www.blockdata.tech/blog/general/81-of-the-top-100-public-companies-are-using-blockchain-technology">BLOCKDATA</a>, the most frequently used blockchain platform is Hyperledger Fabric. However, there are a variety of blockchains used by enterprise companies as described in the graphic above. Therefore, any interoperability protocol to connect those blockchains must be blockchain agnostic.</p><p>Datachain has implemented IBC modules for Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, Corda, Hyperledger Besu, and Hyperledger Iroha as a project called YUI (a Hyperledger Labs project). For more information about YUI, visit: <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/yui-docs">https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/yui-docs</a></p> 3. Customizable on the Application Layer <p>IBC is a protocol for the transport, authentication, and ordering of data packets between chains. It is not a single-use protocol designed for specific cases (e.g. atomic&nbsp;swaps).</p><p>Application developers can, therefore, build a multitude of cross-chain applications such as cross-chain token transfers and multi-chain smart contract applications. IBC manages communication so developers can focus on building applications.</p> 4. Proven Technology Source: <a href="https://mapofzones.com/?testnet=false&amp;period=720&amp;tableOrderBy=totalIbcTxs&amp;tableOrderSort=desc">Map of&nbsp;Zones</a><p>According to the <a href="https://mapofzones.com/?testnet=false&amp;period=720&amp;tableOrderBy=ibcVolume&amp;tableOrderSort=desc">Map of Zones</a>, the number of blockchains (zones) connected via IBC is over 40 (as of this writing), and IBC has supported over 12 million transfers in the past 30 days. There is no other interoperability protocol in the world that approaches this level of transaction volume.</p><p>Connecting multiple blockchains in a trustless way is not easy, but IBC has proven it’s possible. This fact has attracted enterprise companies to adopt IBC to their&nbsp;systems.</p> Conclusion <p>In conclusion, the IBC protocol is beneficial not only to public chains but also for the enterprise use case because IBC meets all requirements of blockchain interoperability.</p><p>On top of that, since there is a strong need for interconnection between enterprise blockchains and public chains, IBC usage in enterprise space will promote IBC transactions in public&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Datachain is committed to building an interconnected world of public and enterprise blockchains — the Interchain, powered by the IBC Protocol. Our work on the YUI project continues and we look forward to collaborating with the ICF and Core Teams to drive adoption and scale communication throughout the Ecosystem.

 Earlier this month in Ireland, Dogpatch and FCAT hosted Future Horizons, a new TED Talk style event designed to ignite emerging ideas and propel Fidelity into the future. The <a href="http://www.verus.io/">Verus Protocol</a> was selected as 1 of 7 finalists invited to present at the event after Fidelity and Dogpatch conducted a deep analysis of over 200 disruptors from every corner of Europe under the themes ‘Future Money &amp; Assets’, ‘Web3’, ‘Post-Pandemic Impacts’ and ‘Zero Interfaces’. Michael Toutonghi receives the Inspiration Award<p>Michael Toutonghi, the lead developer of the Verus Protocol, presented an overview of the Verus Protocol and how it creates an opportunity for people to collaborate worldwide in ways that haven’t been possible before. He outlined the founding purpose of The Verus Protocol and how it’s designed to enable a truly decentralized, people-powered protocol that can be used by any person, community, organization, or government to power their economy as part of a much larger worldwide network of economies.</p>Michael Toutonghi presents the Verus&nbsp;Protocol<p>The growing <a href="https://discord.com/invite/VRKMP2S">Verus community</a> was excited to have Fidelity and Dogpatch recognize the innovation of these efforts, which have been fully functional on the Verus testnet and are being prepared by contributors across the community for our imminent mainnet&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>The Verus Protocol, currently testing and preparing its Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) upgrade for mainnet release, emerged as the only community-driven, public infrastructure protocol to appear in the final seven finalists for the Future Horizons event. The Verus PBaaS upgrade will extend the Verus mainnet protocol, which currently features the first and only core primitive of a revocable, recoverable and provable yet private identity and peer to peer marketplace technology adding a decentralized, multi-chain, multi-currency protocol for launching currencies, independent and connected blockchains, and performing fully decentralized, on chain exchanges of currencies, IDs, legal contracts, and&nbsp;more.</p>Michael Toutonghi presents the Verus&nbsp;Protocol History of The Verus&nbsp;Protocol <p>The Verus Protocol went live on its mainnet, which is a public, decentralized blockchain,<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/announcing-formation-of-the-verus-coin-foundation-with-a-vision-of-public-blockchains-as-a-service-fb5470143fff"> in 2018</a> with a vision of Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) powering scalable, autochains and applications through staking and mining, as outlined in the <a href="http://veruscoin.io/downloads/papers/VerusVision.pdf">Verus Vision paper</a>. The Protocol launched with no ICO, no preallocation of funds, and no development fee, or middlemen built into the protocol. The worldwide community built the Verus Protocol to offer both transparent and zero knowledge privacy, and as an improvement to the Bitcoin consensus algorithm, a more ecologically efficient consensus protocol. Verus was the first and is still the only blockchain protocol with self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable, and interoperable addresses and privacy enhanced identities built into the&nbsp;core.</p><p>Any individual, project, organization or community needing an easy to use, reliable, decentralized, rent-free currency or fundraising platform, voting network, automated accounting system, self-sovereign, revocable/recoverable identity, or governance model can connect to the Verus Internet of Value and get started without programming. Solutions that used to take weeks or longer to design and code with programmers can now be done by domain experts, better, faster and more securely than&nbsp;before.</p><p>With the Verus’s Protocol, challenges of today can be naturally solved by scaling-out as needed, whether requirements call for centralized corporate, open government, or fully decentralized applications. In addition to this new solution, disruptive even among modern blockchains, the open, community-driven model enables Verus to be the first and only credibly neutral, rent-free, decentralized financial network.</p> Consensus 2022 <p>The Verus Protocol will be on <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-showcases-scalable-decentralized-currency-launch-and-anti-mev-defi-technology-for-ethereum-96c165e94c1">display in booth 242 at the upcoming Consensus 2022</a> that takes place in Austin, Texas June 9 — June 12.

<p>Zcon3 is headed to Vegas! The Zcash Foundation is excited to announce that Zcon3 will be held in-person, at the&nbsp;Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, from August 7-9. Zcon3 will also have a virtual component, so that community&nbsp;members who are unable to attend in-person, can still be an active part of the event.</p>
<p>The theme for this year’s Zcon event is, “Code Alone Doesn’t Cut It.” We want to highlight the quality of not only&nbsp;the development, research, and technology of Zcash, but also the vibrant community and ecosystem that is being&nbsp;built around the Zcash protocol. Innovation requires adoption in order to fulLll the promise of Zcash, and at the&nbsp;Zcash Foundation, we believe that it’s time for the Zcash community to think beyond code and bring our message&nbsp;of “privacy for the public good” directly to the people.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to welcoming the Zcash community to connect, learn, and share your knowledge and&nbsp;insights with fellow Zcash enthusiasts and other privacy-focused individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>How do I attend Zcon3 in person?</p>
<p>ZF reviews all attendance request forms to ensure that Zcon3 will be a productive and inclusive event with&nbsp;opportunities for all attendees to learn and connect with each other. Don’t worry, no fancy credentials are&nbsp;required!</p>
<p>Scholarship, payment, and accommodation group rate information is shared only once an individual’s registration&nbsp;has been reviewed and accepted by ZF. In order to attend Zcon3 in person:</p>
<p>1. Complete this Zcon3 <a href="https://zcashgrants.org/submit/222793/zcon3-attendance-request-form">Attendance Request Form.</a></p>
<p>2. ZF will review your response and get back to you with scholarship, payment, and room reservation&nbsp;information within 10 working days of your submission.</p>
<p>What is the timeline for registration and what are the costs?</p>
 
 Early bird registration ends on Monday, May 30 09:00 UTC. $500 USD per ticket (with an availability of&nbsp;scholarships). Tickets can be purchased with credit cards, Paypal or shielded ZEC. 
 Regular registration ends once all 175 tickets are claimed. $600 USD per ticket. 
 
<p>Participation is limited to 175 attendees and we anticipate tickets will go fast so register today!</p>
<p>When will the Zcon3 program be available?</p>
<p>We expect to start announcing speakers by early June. The recap of last year’s virtual conference can give you&nbsp;an idea of the types of presentation subjects and speakers to expect.</p>
<p>What does the ticket price cover?</p>
<p>Your ticket price covers:</p>
 
 Entry into all Zcon3 sessions 
 Breakfast and lunch from August 7-9 
 A Welcome Reception and Dinner on August 7th 
 A cocktail reception on August 8th 
 
<p>Attendees are responsible for booking bights and accommodation at the Palms (discounted group rates are</p>
<p>available).</p>
<p>What is the criteria for receiving a scholarship?</p>
<p>Demonstrated need, unique lived and educational experience, and participation in the Zcash community will all&nbsp;be considered when evaluating scholarship requests. Scholarships of up to $1,500 USD are available for those&nbsp;that meet the criteria and go through our KYC process.</p>
<p>How will ZF assist attendees who require a visa to attend Zcon3?</p>
<p>ZF will provide attendees with a visa letter and supporting documentation so appropriate visas can be secured.&nbsp;Attendees are responsible for scheduling B1 visa interviews at their local US embassy or consulate (we&nbsp;recommend scheduling interview for June or early July).</p>
<p>What should I bring?</p>
<p>Some things to consider when packing to attend Zcon3:</p>
 
 August in Las Vegas can be VERY hot! You’ll be comfortable within the hotel and meeting spaces but caution 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 should be taken when exploring outside of the venue. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Las Vegas is at a high altitude which can cause dehydration and other issues if you’re not used to the&nbsp;elevation. Stay hydrated! 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Many venues, including several we’ll be utilizing, require “business casual” attire. As per the hotel:&nbsp;The Hotel nightlife venues have evening dress codes. Fashionable attire is required in these venues, and the&nbsp;following items are not allowed: shorts, tank tops, baseball caps, bathing suit attire, open toe shoes for&nbsp;men, hats, sweatpants, inappropriate logo attire, and excessively torn attire. The dress code is in place to ensure the&nbsp;enjoyment of all guests. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 There is no dress code for the Zcon3 sessions but we ask that attendees refrain from wearing any clothing&nbsp;that could be considered inappropriate or ofensive to other attendees. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Discord will be used to engage with other in-person and virtual attendees and to ask questions during&nbsp;sessions. A laptop is recommended to fully participate in all sessions. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I participate in Zcon3 if I’m unable to attend in person?</p>
<p>ZF is committed to providing the Zcash community with opportunities to participate in Zcon3 whether you are&nbsp;attending the event in person or remotely. Many sessions will be live-streamed, some will be posted online with a&nbsp;delay. Discord will continue to be a hub for discussion and submitting questions for each session, and there will&nbsp;be multiple Twitter Spaces and other forms of engagement and communication via social media.</p>
<p>What actions will ZF take to ensure Zcon3 attendees are comfortable and safe?</p>
<p>In order to fully control the environment for Zcon3 we decided to secure all of the meeting and breakout rooms&nbsp;within the Palms meeting space. By securing the entire meeting room wing we will be able to restrict access to&nbsp;non-Zcon3 individuals, utilize flexible spaces for presentations and ad-hoc meetings, provide “creative” spaces for&nbsp;broadcasting Twitter Spaces and other media engagement, co-working spaces, and we’ll be able to spread out to&nbsp;give attendees plenty of space. There is no smoking in the meeting space area or hotel (only on the casino boor)&nbsp;and the venue recently upgraded its air purification systems.</p>
<p>Why did ZF choose Las Vegas as the host city for Zcon3?</p>
<p>Las Vegas is accessible, accepting of diversity, generally affordable for air travel, and the city has become adept at&nbsp;operating safely at full capacity as the pandemic continues to affect group environments. Las Vegas will provide&nbsp;every Zcon3 attendee with opportunities that will add further value to attending Zcon3 in person.</p>
<p>Why did ZF choose the Palms as the host venue for Zcon3?</p>
<p>The Palms Casino Resort is perfectly suited to host Zcon3. The property underwent a $620 million renovation in&nbsp;2019 and then closed in March 2020 due to the pandemic. As a result of this closure, the property feels brand&nbsp;new and Zcon3 will be one of the first events to be held in the refreshed space. From the hotel rooms to the&nbsp;casino boor to the incredible restaurants and clubs featured at the property, this will be a Zcon3 to remember.</p>
<p>Interesting fact: Palms Casino Resort is the only Native American owned casino in Las Vegas, with the San&nbsp;Manuel Band of Mission Indians having purchased the property in 2021.</p>
<p>Why did ZF choose these dates for Zcon3?</p>
<p>To add further value to attending Zcon3 in person, we decided to hold the event prior to DEF CON (August 11-14&nbsp;at Caesars Forum) so that Zcon3 attendees can attend that conference as well.</p>
