<p>Traditional KYC and AML regulations have often forced companies to comply, without having the right tools to do so. Simply storing users’ personal information led to the creation of security honeypots which haven’t gone unnoticed by hackers. Web3 solutions like Privado ID aim to cryptographically prove certain traits from a user’s personal data, without disclosing it to the enquirer. This is usually made possible through zero knowledge proofs which allow users to store their personal data on their own device and only exchange verifiable credentials with trusted issuers.

<p>Thank you to all the candidates who ran for election. Thank you also to Ambimorph and Michael “Brunchtime” Harms (who decided not to run for re-election) for their service as members of the ZCG Committee. </p>



<p>On the question of ZCG Committee member compensation, the results are as follows: </p>



 
 $1,725 per month + 10 ZEC per month – 64 votes 



 20 ZEC per month with a USD cap of $2,000 – 45 votes 



 $1,725 per month (status quo) – 44 votes

 $1,775 per month – 20 votes

<p>2024 proved to be a year of remarkable growth and innovation for PIVX. Building upon a foundation of strong community support and consistent development, PIVX expanded its reach, enhanced user experience, and solidified its position as a leader in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency space.</p> Major Highlights in a&nbsp;Jiffy   Celebrated 8 Years: PIVX marked its 8th anniversary, showcasing a strong and enduring community.  Expanded Reach: Secured numerous exchange listings, including Poloniex and Gate.io (with the first-ever Turkish Lira trading&nbsp;pair).  Core Wallet Upgrade: The PIVX Core wallet was updated to v5.6.1, introducing lock shield notes and improved GUI, among&nbsp;others.  Masternode Growth: Network strength surged with nearly 300 new <a href="https://pivx.org/masternodes">masternodes</a> joining, reaching a total of 1985 by year’s&nbsp;end.  Privacy Enhanced: <a href="https://cards.pivxla.bz/">PIVCards</a> became fully shielded, offering enhanced privacy for&nbsp;users.  Innovation Unleashed: Introduced <a href="https://pivx.promo/">PIVX Rewards</a> and <a href="https://pivxla.bz/oracle/">Labs Oracle</a>, expanding the PIVX ecosystem.  Wallet Revamp: <a href="https://app.mypivxwallet.org/">My PIVX Wallet</a> (MPW)v2.1 delivered 30x faster Shield synchronization, full shield activity support, and a refined user interface.   Now the Year in&nbsp;Detail  Q1: Setting the Stage for a Successful Year <p>The year commenced with a flurry of activity. PIVX secured listings on exchanges like ChangeNOW, Gate.io (complete with the first-ever Turkish Lira trading pair), StealthEX, and Atani Exchange, significantly increasing its accessibility for global users. These early listings laid the groundwork for a year of significant expansion.</p><p>To further engage with the broader community, PIVX hosted an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session with a host from GameStation and Hans Koning, a retired DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) specialist. This interactive session provided valuable insights into PIVX and fostered connections within the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>Another important milestone was the first anniversary of the Privacy Roundtable. While not directly related to PIVX development, this group plays a crucial role in advocating for user privacy and fostering dialogue on privacy-focused solutions in the blockchain world.</p><p>Other noteworthy milestones in the quarter include PIVX becoming a collateral option on Coin Rabbit and the launch of PIVX Rewards, a faucet platform for earning PIV. Meanwhile, in February, the Core Wallet v5.6.1 update introduced upgraded GUI features, the ability to generate proposal addresses directly when creating proposals, CoinControl for selecting inputs for master nodes, and the option to lock shield&nbsp;notes.</p> Q2: Enhancing User Experience and&nbsp;Privacy <p>PIVX prioritized user experience throughout the second quarter. PIVCards, the platform for purchasing gift cards with PIVX, received a significant speed boost, enabling users to spend their coins effortlessly. My PIVX Wallet underwent a series of major upgrades, including the introduction of a decentralized Light SHIELD Protocol, enhanced compatibility, and a user-friendly interface.</p><p>A pivotal moment arrived with the successful integration of SHIELD into PIVCards. This milestone, coupled with the ongoing development and refinement of SHIELD technology, solidified PIVX’s commitment to user privacy and security.</p><p>There were also a few listings in Q2. PIVX became an automated markets maker (AMM) on CoinEx in April, Armour Solutions began accepting PIV for masternode hosting in May, and two exchanges (Bitcointry and SimpleSwap) listed PIVX in&nbsp;June.</p> Q3: Expanding Global Reach and Technological Advancements <p>The third quarter witnessed a significant expansion of PIVX’s global reach. The project secured listings on numerous exchanges, including MEXC, KoinBX, Swapter, Bitstorage, XeggeX, BitMart, Changelly, Hellex, and NOW Wallet. These listings not only increased accessibility but also provided users with greater flexibility in trading and interacting with&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>Innovation continued to drive progress. PIVCards became fully SHIELDED in July. The introduction of PIVX Labs Oracle, a dedicated price tracker app, provided valuable market insights to the community in September. In the same month, the <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/introducing-pivx-toolbox-v3-laymans-changelog-by-pivx-core-member-palmtree-039e500227a0">PIVX Toolbox</a> received its third iteration. Some notable changes were improved UI/UX, PIVX address detection, and exchange addresses support.</p> Q4: A Quarter of Significant Milestones <p>The final quarter of 2024 was marked by several significant milestones.</p>  Futures Trading on WEEX: PIVX entered the futures market with its listing on WEEX, providing traders with new opportunities and risk management tools.  First Indonesian Exchange Listing: <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-expands-reach-listed-on-indonesian-exchange-triv-1c091fe2f995">Triv</a> became the first Indonesian exchange to list&nbsp;PIVX.  Poloniex Listing: The highly anticipated listing on Poloniex, a renowned cryptocurrency exchange, will significantly enhance PIVX’s visibility and credibility within the crypto community in the beginning of January. (The listing was previously announced, but trading will resume in January.)<br>My PIVX Wallet v2.1: This major release brought a 30x faster Shield synchronization, full Shield Activity support, and a redesigned user interface, significantly enhancing the user experience. It also featured lightning-fast sync. The median shield sync time reportedly dropped from 10 to 15 minutes to less than a&nbsp;minute.  <p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

Furthermore, Celestia’s modular approach to blockchain architecture and their recent commitment to gigabyte blocks of data availability marked the beginning of commoditization for rollups.

<p>PIVX is a decentralized blockchain project that prioritizes financial privacy and security. It utilizes a unique combination of features, including proof-of-stake, masternodes, and zk-SNARKs, to enhance transaction speed, user anonymity, and transaction privacy.</p><p>Speaking of masternodes, PIVX operates a decentralized governance model that allows the community to shape the project’s future. As a decentralized open-source project, masternodes are one of the core pillars of the PIVX ecosystem. They bolster network security by validating blocks and transactions across a distributed network of&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>In this “Ethical Voting Series,” we will explore the role of masternode owners in PIVX governance.</p> What is a Masternode? <p>A masternode is a specialized type of node that performs added functions within a blockchain network. These extra functions vary from one blockchain to another but generally revolve around improved performance and security, as well as governance participation.</p><p>PIVX masternodes perform two broad functions — they secure the network by providing additional nodes to validate blocks and transactions and they facilitate decentralized governance by casting their votes on submitted proposals. The latter enables second-layer innovations.</p><p>In addition to the right to participate in on-chain governance, PIVX masternodes are incentivized for their contributions to the network. Under the current block reward structure, 4 PIV goes to stakers, masternode operators are rewarded with 6 PIV, and 10 PIV goes to the DAO Treasury for budget and development.</p><p>Here’s a quick checklist if you intend to directly host a PIVX masternode:</p>  10,000 PIV collateral  24/7 server&nbsp;uptime  Dedicated IP   Governance in&nbsp;PIVX <p>PIVX stands out from many blockchain projects by placing decentralized governance at its core. Unlike systems where governance is an afterthought or primarily controlled by the core team, PIVX mandates that every penny allocated from the treasury must undergo a community-wide vote. This crucial step ensures that Masternode operators, as key stakeholders, have a direct say in how the treasury fund is utilized.</p><p>Each cycle, a substantial sum of 432,000 PIV is allocated to the treasury. Community members, including core developers, can submit proposals for funding. These proposals can encompass a wide range of initiatives, from critical protocol upgrades and innovative development projects to vital community outreach programs.</p><p>Masternode owners are entrusted with the weighty responsibility of evaluating each proposal meticulously. They must consider its potential impact on the entire PIVX ecosystem, ensuring that the treasury fund is utilized ethically and effectively to advance the long-term goals of the&nbsp;project.</p><p>For a proposal to pass, it must receive a net positive vote of at least&nbsp;10%.</p> What’s Expected of&nbsp;You <p>Whether you like it or not, ethical voting in the PIVX ecosystem is paramount to the project’s long-term success. Masternode owners must carefully consider the implications of each proposal before casting their votes. It is crucial to prioritize the overall health and sustainability of the PIVX ecosystem, ensuring that all decisions are made in the best interests of the community as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>I want to define ethical voting as putting the interest and sustainability of the project ahead of your personal interests. You have the right as a masternode holder to vote against a proposal if you believe it does not serve the community’s interests.</p><p>It is also important to engage in open discussions with other community members, and carefully analyze the potential risks and rewards associated with each proposal. By exercising your voting rights responsibly and ethically, you can contribute significantly to the growth and development of&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>Today, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/1bc219f8-bd89-11ef-8c2d-2e5436e7697a/view">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), which will run until December 31st. The purpose of this poll is twofold:&nbsp;</p>



 
 to elect three members of the Zcash Community Grants committee,&nbsp;and  



 to decide whether ZCG committee members’ compensation should be increased. 
 



<p></p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>Members of the <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) committee are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel, and serve a one year term. Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year. Last month, <a href="https://zfnd.org/opening-nominations-for-the-zcg-committee-dec-2024/">we invited candidates</a> to express their interest in serving on the committee.</p>



<p>Five candidates are standing for three seats on the committee. Here is the list of candidates, with links to their candidacy announcements on the Zcash community forum:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/49663">Artkor</a> 



 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/49664">Tokidoki</a> 



 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/49670">Jason McGee</a> 



 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/49673">Zerodartz</a> 



 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/49710">Kworks</a> 



 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/49714">Chidi</a> 



 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/49715">Ambimorph</a> 
 



<p></p>



<p>On Tuesday, the candidates took part in a Community Call, during which they introduced themselves and answered questions from the Zcash community. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/ODW01XSGOXA?si=xUJqLJzF5o4wi9o-">a recording of the call on Youtube</a>.</p>



<p>Good luck to all the candidates, and thank you for volunteering to serve on the ZCG committee!</p>



 ZCG Committee Members’ Compensation 



<p>ZCG committee members currently receive a stipend of $1,725 per calendar month. The current committee is requesting that this be changed to $1,725 + 10 ZEC per month. During a&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/2025-zcg-compensation/49767">forum discussion about this request</a>, several community members made other suggestions.</p>



<p>The following options are presented in this poll:</p>



 
 $1,725 per month (status quo) 



 $1,725 per month + 10 ZEC per month 



 $2,275 per month 



 $1,775 per month 



 20 ZEC per month with a USD cap of $2,000 
 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-GbVFA1csIgPbvHOR-1ruOlh7YdA-CHvMtd6R8iSdY">ZCAP members</a> should check their mailbox for instructions on how to vote. In the past, Helios emails have sometimes been flagged as spam, so if you can’t find the instructions please check your Spam folder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2025.</p>

Launched in 2023, the platform allows you to effortlessly buy gift cards for Amazon, Steam, Netflix, and countless other brands, all powered by the privacy of&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use PIVCards and spend your PIV&nbsp;coins.</p>  Step 1: Visit the official PIVCards <a href="https://cards.pivxla.bz/">website</a>. Unlike other gift cards platforms that may require you to create an account, there is no need to sign-up or use your email on PIVCards. The process is completely private, meaning you can make your purchase with SHIELDed PIV. Furthermore, payments are sent to a shielded&nbsp;address.    Step 2: Select your region and search for your preferred gift card. There are thousands of gift cards to choose from. For this example, I chose a 50-pound Airbnb gift card in the United&nbsp;Kingdom.    Step 3: The next step is to input a refund address. Your PIV coins will be returned to this address if there are any issues with the purchase or if you change your mind before the transaction is completed.  <p>Note: You can set your web browser to remember your refund address to avoid repeating this step every time you use the platform.</p>  Step 4: Proceed to checkout by depositing the equivalent amount of PIV (£50 pound worth in this case) into the given address. You can opt for the <a href="https://app.mypivxwallet.org/">MyPIVXWallet</a> one-click checkout or transfer the funds from any PIVX wallet. Failure to complete the process within 30 minutes will lead to a cancellation.  Step 5: Once the transaction is confirmed on the PIVX blockchain, the funds will be credited to your PIVCards account and the gift card code will be released. Easy Pizzi,&nbsp;right?  <p>PIVX.

<p>The status quo for developers choosing an ecosystem for their blockchain usually revolves around trade-offs: do they go for Ethereum’s network effect, liquidity and decentralisation, or sacrifice some features in favour of a higher throughput. Monad aims to combine the best of both worlds, while not being limited by excessive hardware requirements. Monad built an EVM-compatible L1 from the ground up, completely rethinking execution and consensus, in order to achieve the infamous 10,000 TPS. This extreme scalability is made possible through Monad’s optimistic parallel execution which is asynchronous from consensus. The latter has also been optimized in order to achieve single-slot finality. Monad’s proprietary database architecture allows for states to be stored on SSDs instead of RAM, which ensures that consumer-grade hardware can run a Monad node, further increasing decentralisation.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Keone’s background  TradFi vs. DeFi and how Monad was founded  EVM’s network effect vs. other VMs  How Monad aims to improve EVM’s performance  MonadDB  MonadBFT - New consensus mechanism  Asynchronous execution  MEV and proposer-builder separation (PBS)  Monad’s throughput  Further scaling and limitations  Alternatives &amp; trade-offs  DevEx  Community &amp; ecosystem development  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/keoneHD">Keone Hon on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/monad_xyz">Monad on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

 Nym token buyback concluding ahead of NymVPN&nbsp;launch <p>Nym is now coming to the end of its <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-buyback-33e3ec88c4dc">NYM token buyback</a> which began last month. A perpetual buy-back mechanism is being put in its place for the NymVPN product launch in January&nbsp;2025.</p><p>The buyback of 1M USD in NYM tokens period has boosted Nym’s token treasury by just over 10M NYM tokens purchased at a historically low price-point. This now provides substantial resources to Nym’s Delegations Program to support operators just ahead of the commercial launch. Here’s everything you need to know about the motivations and effects of the&nbsp;buyback.</p> Why a Nym token&nbsp;buyback? <p>Nym’s token buyback serves a targeted purpose: to bootstrap the Nym treasury and improve network performance in the lead up to the launch of NymVPN. NymVPN is much <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/more-than-a-vpn">more than a VPN</a>: it’s built on a token-incentivized and decentralized network capable of fighting against even AI-powered surveillance. And the NYM token is at the heart of&nbsp;it.</p><p>The Nym network is built on a novel form of tokenomics: operators routing user traffic are rewarded in NYM tokens for their work. The goal is that as usage of the app increases with users looking for genuine privacy online, operators will benefit from increasingly advantageous rewards. Optimizing network performance and incentives ahead of commercial launch is thus crucial to the success of the&nbsp;project.</p> Perpetual buyback mechanism <p>Nym’s token buyback over the last month has also served to test what will become a perpetual buyback mechanism with the launch of paid subscriptions for NymVPN. Every subscription to the app — whether in fiat or crypto — will automatically trigger a token buy-order and be converted to NYM tokens. This mechanism is the basis of generating anonymous access credentials called <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">zk-nyms</a>. With zk-nyms, all user payments for the NymVPN service will be unlinkable to a user’s usage of the Nym network. This solves a huge privacy problem plaguing centralized VPN services.</p><p>Curious about how the NYM token is the center of a novel experiment in tokenomics in which the token is linked to the real usage of a product? Check out Nym’s deepdives on the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-token-flow-powering-the-worlds-most-private-network-48c15db379c5">NYM token flow</a> and its <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-value-of-nym-the-spice-powering-the-worlds-most-private-network-10b0055dfe70">function as a utility&nbsp;token</a>.</p> Boosting the Nym treasury and Delegations Program <p>The NYM buyback has boosted Nym’s token treasury at a time, prior to the launch of NymVPN, when the token price has been highly favorable. In the lead up to paying customers, the primary goal of this is to make sure Nym’s token reserves are ample to support the network of independent operators in servicing the&nbsp;network.</p><p>30M NYM has already been used to double the budget of the official Nym <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-delegations-program-c5ecf320ed12">Delegations Program</a> to a total 70M NYM. The Delegations Program helps bootstrap top quality Nym nodes with stake.

			 WXX (BEP20) Crowd Sale with Reward Incentive Program 		 
				 
				 
				 
							 Objective 
<p>Starting Monday, December 16th(1pm PDT/8pm UTC), to encourage early participation in the launch of the WXX (BEP20) token<br>(contract address: <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x0109d6994093539245Aa820B9c98405b0648f0B4">https://bscscan.com/token/0x0109d6994093539245Aa820B9c98405b0648f0B4</a>) on the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">CrowdSwap Website</a>, xx Labs Ltd is creating an xx rewards program that will reward participants that purchase WXX(BEP20) in the “Crowd Sale” pool on crowdswap.org.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the sales pool will only be used to create&nbsp; liquidity pools, first on CrowdSwap and then later on Pancake Swap.</p>
<p>At the end of the “Crowd Sale” campaign (February 14th, 2025), participants will receive their purchased WXX (BEP20) tokens. If the pool sells out before the deadline, tokens may be released earlier but this will be at the&nbsp;discretion&nbsp;of xx Labs. To receive Incentive Rewards, participants must hold their WXX tokens for a minimum of 28 days in their wallets after the purchase date. The holding time is considered to begin from the time of purchase, not the end of the program. So, for example, if a participant purchased on the first day of the crowdsale, they will have easily met the holding requirement of 28 days, while on the other hand if a purchase is made 1 day prior to the end of the crowdsale, although they will receive their purchased WXX (BEP20) upon conclusion of the sale, they will be required to hold their purchased WXX (BEP20) for 28 additional days from the time of their purchase in order to be eligible for the bonus rewards program.</p>
<p>When the sale concludes, participants will be able to connect multichain wallets, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet etc, which they used to purchase WXX (BEP20), through a secure web-based app that the xx Foundation will produce. Using this app, participants can submit their native XX addresses and verify their purchased WXX(BEP20) balances by signing a message in the webapp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verified participants will receive Incentive Award XX coins directly in their registered native XX accounts.</p>
<p>The sales pool will consist of 2,000,000 WXX (BEP20). The reward incentive program will allocate 1 million XX coins for the rewards distribution pool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: To ensure compliance, the program is not available to U.S.-based participants.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Detailed Program Terms 		 
				 
				 
				 
							 1. Purchase WXX (BEP20) Tokens via CrowdSwap “Crowd Sale” web application.   Platform Access: Users will access the Crowd Sale via (<a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity</a>), where they will see the WXX(BEP20) Crowd Sale opportunity. Any major cryptocurrencies may be used to purchase WXX via Crowdswap’s built in swapping mechanism. Proceeds will convert to USDT via the Crowdswap platform.  Native XX Account Address Submission: Before users can receive any of the XX incentive rewards they will also be required to submit their XX account address (non-exchange) or create a new one if they don’t already have one. This will be done via a web application being created by the development team.&nbsp;  <p>Note: Access link to the verification web app is TBA prior to the end of the crowdsale (Feb 14th 2025).</p> 2. Web-based Wallet Verification<br> Once available, participants will use the verification web app in this way:   Connection: Users will connect their wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) to the web app. It will detect and confirm the account used to purchase WXX (BEP20) on CrowdSwap.  Verification: Participants will sign a message from their wallet, allowing the platform to verify their WXX balance on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and how long it was held. This signed message verifies eligibility without relying on a centralized tracking system.  Incentive&nbsp; Reward Eligibility: Verified balances will determine the user’s eligibility for a reward of XX coins into their native xx account, based on a tiered reward system linked to their WXX purchase amounts.   3. Incentive Award Holding Period Requirement   Holding Period: Participants must hold their purchased WXX (BEP20) tokens in their account for 28 days to qualify for the incentive reward.  Verification: The 28-day holding period will be confirmed via a signed wallet message, ensuring manual or automated verification of the balance.   4. Reward Pool Distribution   Total Reward Pool: 1 million native XX tokens will be allocated for the reward incentive.  Dynamic Tiered Reward Structure:  Base Incentive Award: 5%  Incremental Incentive Award: Increases by 0.1% per 1,000 WXX purchased, capped at 20% for purchases of 150,000 WXX or more.  Example:  1,000 WXX: 5.10% Incentive Award  5,000 WXX: 5.50% Incentive Award  50,000 WXX: 10.00% Incentive Award  150,000 WXX or more: 20% Incentive Award (capped)       5. Volume-Based Multiplier Incentive   Full Purchase Incentive Award: If the 2 million WXX pool is fully sold, all participants will receive an additional 1.4x multiplier on their original Incentive Award.  Example After Multiplier:  5,000 WXX Purchase: Original Incentive Award of 5.50%, increased to 7.7% with the multiplier.  50,000 WXX Purchase: Original Incentive Award of 10%, increased to 14% with the multiplier.     6. Lockup and Vesting Period for Incentive Awards   Initial Lockup: All rewards will be subject to a 9-month lockup period, during which the coins cannot be transferred or sold.  Vesting Options for Additional Incentive Awards:  Participants can also choose from three linear vesting periods to commence once the initial 9 month lock expires:  3-month vesting: Additional 5% Incentive Award  6-month vesting: Additional 10% Incentive Award  12-month vesting: Additional 20% Incentive Award    Example: A participant with an initial 5,000 XX Incentive Award choosing a 12-month vesting period will receive an additional 1,000 XX coins spread over the vesting period.     7. Automatic Reward Distribution   Post Verification: After the 28-day holding period and verification via the web app, eligible participants will receive their XX coin Incentive Awards directly into their native XX accounts. Reward distribution will occur randomly within 1–2 weeks, adding an additional layer of privacy and preventing predictability in token transfers.   8. Privacy Protection via xx Network   Privacy Measures: All user interactions with the web app—including wallet connections and message signatures—will be routed through the xx network using xxRPC. This ensures that personal metadata remains private and secure.  						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Legal Disclaimer 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Participants should be aware that the xx rewards may be subject to taxation, depending on local regulations. The xx Foundation recommends that participants consult a tax advisor to understand any tax obligations associated with receiving XX coins. This program does not constitute investment advice, nor does it guarantee any specific return or profit.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Excluded Participants 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>To comply with applicable securities regulations and international law, participation in the program will not be open to all. Access to the program webpage and web app will be restricted for users located in the United States, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, United States Minor Outlying Islands, Virgin Islands, North Korea, Cuba, and Iran.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Summary of Participant Steps
 		 
				 
				 
				 
							 
 Purchase WXX on CrowdSwap: Participants acquire WXX (BEP20) tokens through the CrowdSwap “Crowd Sale” pool. 
 Hold Tokens for 28 Days: WXX tokens must remain in the participant’s account for 28 days, once received, to qualify for incentive rewards. 
 Connect Wallet and Submit Native XX Account Address: Participants connect to the web app, submit their native XX account address, and sign a message to verify their WXX balance. 
 Choose Vesting Period: After the 9-month lockup, participants will select a vesting schedule to receive additional Incentive Awards. 
 Receive Rewards: Verified XX coin Incentive Awards are distributed automatically to participants’ native XX accounts after the program concludes.

<p>In early November 2023, hundreds of developers from around the world filed into an auditorium in the heart of downtown San Francisco. It was OpenAI’s inaugural DevDay, an event where—à la WWDC—the company would preview its latest technology and discuss the future of AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the keynote address, Romain Huet, head of developer experience at OpenAI, took the stage to introduce the company’s latest tool: a voice-enabled intelligent assistant. To pull back the curtain on the assistant’s underlying function calls, Huet pulled up his terminal log.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The terminal, an interface for using text commands to interact directly with a computer, is a 50-year-old staple of software engineering, beloved for its precision and efficiency while simultaneously hated for its extreme user-unfriendliness. Most people recognize the terminal from movies: a bare-bones user interface with a black screen and green text where hackers frantically type in commands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the terminal that Huet displayed before the DevDay audience looked markedly different. It featured an IDE-like experience for editing commands, one-click sharing of terminal outputs with teammates, and an interface that allows users to interact with the terminal in natural language for coding and troubleshooting. As Huet demonstrated the inner workings of OpenAI’s new product, the terminal on display looked different from a traditional terminal because it was different: The command line interface powering OpenAI’s assistant was a terminal called Warp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warp, founded by Zach Lloyd in June 2020, is a terminal reimagined for the modern developer. Today, as engineers race to build AI products, the terminal is proving essential due to its ability to navigate large volumes of data, automate batch processing and quickly execute scripts. Warp’s terminal checks these boxes while introducing new AI-based features that promote usability, collaboration and productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notion, however, that Warp would be embraced by developers at OpenAI, among other companies including Atlassian, Cisco, Netflix and Salesforce, was never a given. A mere two years ago, the idea of reinventing something as sacrosanct in software engineering as the terminal flew in the face of accepted wisdom.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>In the summer of 2021, a post appeared on Hacker News titled “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27834649">Warp: Fast, Rust-based terminal</a>.” It announced the beta launch of the app and invited developers to sign up and try it.&nbsp; Within minutes, the post began racking up comments—some intrigued, others skeptical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Criticisms boiled down to concerns over trust and security. Traditional computer terminals don’t require logins; if users entered passwords into Warp, would the company sell their data for profit? Would they make themselves liable to potential data breaches? There was also the ideological argument: Why should they pay for something new when its original version was free? And there was a sense of pride among those who understood the terminal’s eccentricities (and had memorized its arcane commands). To them, part of the appeal of the terminal was its difficulty of use; becoming skilled at using it was a rite of passage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of CEOs run away from this sort of experience because it’s unpleasant to have people telling you your idea is dumb,” says Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia. “One thing about Zach is that he’s a CEO who believes enough in the value of what he’s building that he is comfortable being yelled at on the internet.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lloyd’s own experience had also taught him that skeptics of technology innovations aren’t always right. At Google, he’d been tasked with reimagining a software staple almost as foundational as the terminal—the spreadsheet—over fierce protests from Excel purists. The resulting product, Google Sheets, is now used by <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/google-workspace-stats">about a billion</a> people per month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The internet could yell as much as it pleased. Lloyd wasn’t deterred.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Lloyd’s interest in computer science began in college. He was drawn to software’s ability to make convoluted tasks faster and pulled his first all-nighter building a program that could find every word on a Boggle board. But Lloyd frequently encountered software for developers that was difficult to use, whether it had a steep learning curve or a nonintuitive design. “It drove me nuts,” he says. “It was like trying to get the shrink wrap off of the puzzle box before you can solve it. I wanted to actually solve the puzzle, not spend all my time trying to open the box.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite his interest in coding, following college graduation Lloyd let his curiosity guide him, testing the waters of a range of disciplines. He worked at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, earned a master’s in philosophy, and even did a year of law school at Yale. “It took me longer than most people to figure out what I wanted to spend my life doing,” Lloyd says, “but I think there was value in being exposed to different fields and different ways of thinking.” It was in law school that Lloyd realized he missed building technology. He had an urge to create tools that were useful for people, and so he returned to engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2007, Lloyd was hired by Google to work on one of its newest products: Google Sheets. “I used to tell my friends I was working on Sheets, and none of them had heard of it,” Lloyd says. “When I would explain it, they would say, ‘Oh, Google has an Excel.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The general opinion was that Excel—a decades-old, tried-and-true program—was irreplaceable. Why would anyone switch to a new spreadsheet software? But Excel had its shortcomings. The app was local, meaning if users wanted to collaborate on a spreadsheet, they had to export their work, email it to a teammate to edit, and hope that in the back-and-forth, versions weren’t lost and work wasn’t duplicated. Lloyd’s team saw an opportunity. What if they could offer a familiar experience but in the cloud, allowing for seamless, real-time collaboration?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This undertaking came with immense technical challenges: recreating an on-prem program in the cloud, building real-time collaborative functions, and engineering the product in such a way that people could easily transfer their spreadsheets from Excel to Google Sheets and immediately continue their work. “We were trying to push forward innovation on document editing but had this everlasting tension where people have all these existing Microsoft Office files that we had to support,” Lloyd says, “and so transforming this technology in a way that would actually benefit people and not slow them down was very hard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his time at Google, Lloyd says he grew both as an engineer and a leader, learning to manage a team that grew in the following years from five people to more than 100. By the time Lloyd left in 2014, Sheets had hundreds of millions of users. “Everyone I knew, every start-up, was using Google Sheets,” he says. “By then, no one was referring to the product as Google’s version of Excel. People knew it as Google Sheets.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was perhaps the most valuable insight Lloyd took from his time at Google: Some products are built as solutions to urgent, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/pmf-framework/">“hair-on-fire”</a> problems. Others are built because someone is willing to question the status quo and decide it isn’t good enough. Some supposed “hard facts” are merely “hard problems” waiting to be solved. The experience of upending an accepted status quo was enticing, and Lloyd would go on to look for other supposed “hard facts” to turn on their heads.</p>
 







 
<p>In 2016, Lloyd cofounded a startup called SelfMade, which helps businesses succeed on social media. Leading his own company offered Lloyd a new set of lessons. At Google, he had been in a structured work setting, where there was always another rung of the ladder to climb and a clear path to get there. At a startup, there was no safety net and no definitive next step. Lloyd was happy to discover that he thrived in this strategic, competitive environment. But over time, something began to gnaw at him, a growing feeling that SelfMade wasn’t the right company for him. In 2019, he stepped down as its CTO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lloyd spent the next few months reflecting on his experience at SelfMade, working to understand why it hadn’t been the right fit for him as a founder. “This might sound obvious, but I realized it’s really important to me to be working on a problem that I care deeply about,” Lloyd says. “SelfMade helped people with social media, and I don’t really use social media. It was a tech-enabled company, but the product was people’s labor. Building software is what I loved to do, so I wanted to work at a company where the software was the product.”</p>



<p>As Lloyd considered what he should do next, he thought back to the ethos that drove the development of Google Sheets: How do you build software that challenges a hard fact and makes peoples’ lives easier? More personal to Lloyd, how could you make developers’ lives easier? He considered the foundational tools of software development. And then it dawned on him that there was one that had never been improved: the terminal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the average user relies on graphic user interfaces (GUIs) to communicate with computers, the terminal, which employs a command line interface (CLI), is an integral part of developers’ workflows and often the most efficient path to building software. While GUIs are great for certain tasks, there’s a class of developer tasks that are much better done in the command line. “A command line is more flexible than a GUI,” says Lloyd. “It allows developers to automate their own work. Most of the internet is actually just running command line apps. They are also the easiest to write—you just need to take text in and output text, no need to design anything with pixels.” Not only is working in the terminal faster, it is more memory efficient and offers higher precision and control over an operating system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet this critical tool, essentially unchanged since it first shipped in 1969, is also notoriously cumbersome. Engineers must be versed in the terminal’s library of complicated, esoteric commands and must use them precisely; one wrong character could brick your computer. What’s more, those working in the terminal can only access projects locally, making the development process a solo undertaking with little room for collaboration. “The terminal is truly archaic,”&nbsp; Lloyd says. “I thought, What if I could take this old school basic interface of just text in and text out and really improve it?” This was the genesis of Warp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Lloyd’s takeaways from his time at SelfMade was the necessity of prioritizing product-market fit over growth. SelfMade had dedicated resources to expansion before it had a high level of user engagement and retention. Lloyd knew that with Warp, he would need to take incremental, intentional steps to build his business and make sure he had created something users would find invaluable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lloyd’s first step was convincing his former colleague at Google, Shikhiu Ing, to come on board as a founding designer. They put together a prototype of Warp, which Lloyd knew would be critical in communicating his vision. “It’s just night and day when someone can actually see how your product will work. Once we showed it to people, they got it. That was huge for us.” Having Ing on board was also the social proof Lloyd needed that Warp was a good idea. “Once you get one smart person to sign on, it becomes marginally easier to get the next, and the next.” They hired two more talented engineers willing to take a risk on Warp, Michelle Lim and Aloke Desai, and got to work building the product.</p>



<p>It took six months, working tirelessly through the pandemic, for them to create a version of Warp they were happy with. Similar to Google Sheets taking on the incumbent Excel, Lloyd and his team had to balance the new with the familiar. “The real technical challenge with Warp was trying to innovate while making sure that the terminal that we’re building actually still works with people’s existing scripts and muscle memory,” Lloyd says. “We could have built something where we totally reimagined it and no one would have ever used it because none of their existing stuff worked.” At one point, struggling to match the terminal’s performance speed, the team decided to scrap Warp’s system entirely and rewrite it from scratch in Rust, a lower-level programming language popular with infrastructure engineers. The switch, while tedious, ensured Warp would offer terminal users the speed they were accustomed to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for new elements, in Warp developers now have a modern IDE inside the familiar terminal. Warp allows teammates to share terminal commands and notebooks directly in their product by syncing them to the cloud. Warp also allows teammates to collaborate on the same terminal session in real time—similar to the multiplayer experience in Google Docs or Figma—so they can fight fires or debug issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lloyd’s next step was determining if there was an audience for Warp. Would the developer community even want it? To find out, in July of 2021, he published the article announcing the beta launch of Warp to Hacker News.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Lloyd describes the critical feedback within the stream of comments on the Hacker News post as “painful—but it wasn’t going to kill the company.” As it turned out, those who were intrigued by the app far outnumbered the skeptics. Less than 24 hours after posting on Hacker News, over 10,000 developers had signed up to try it.</p>



<p>Over the next year, Warp iterated its product in beta with small groups of users. Lloyd solicited feedback, made adjustments, and in April 2022, the application—originally for MacOS—became available to the public. Within days, its user base grew to tens of thousands. In 2023, the company introduced Warp AI, an LLM-powered sidebar where users can ask questions if they need help remembering a command, fixing an error or tackling the next step in their workflow. In February 2024, Warp was officially released for Linux.</p>



<p>Lloyd’s hunch back in 2020, on the cusp of the LLM era, that an updated terminal would prove useful for developers, couldn’t have been more prescient. “Large language models are essentially command-line interfaces,” Lloyd told <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90907013/warp-terminal-command-line">FastCompany</a>, “and the terminal, the thing that we’re working on, is kind of the ideal way to interface with them.” As AI changes how code is written and software is consumed, the terminal is the most direct way to interface with AI—not just via chat but as a way of asking AI to do tasks for you. It’s a natural interface for launching AI agents (hence Warp’s June 2024 release of “Agent Mode,” which allows users to ask AI to directly accomplish tasks in the terminal).</p>



<p>Today, Warp has grown its user base to hundreds of thousands of developers. The company now has paying customers, both individuals and enterprises—proof of Lloyd’s vision that people will pay for AI development tools, even those that have traditionally been free utilities, when it helps ship better software more efficiently. His strategy is to strengthen Warp’s collaborative and intelligence features so that developers increasingly want to use Warp as a team—a tactic similar to Dropbox, Slack and Figma. “Monetization comes from companies wanting to pay to have their developers be more efficient and productive and working better together,” Lloyd says. “So our user growth is from the bottom up, but the revenue is like a B2B, enterprise or small team revenue model based on collaboration, intelligence and features that are for companies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lloyd’s long term goal is for Warp to help developers with a wider set of workflows, all available in one integrated app. Users will be able to log in to Warp and access not just a better terminal but improved versions of a range of tools, from code editing to DevOps and developer environment management. “Any place a developer is spending their time on a keyboard, Warp will be there,” Lloyd says.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with the frenzy that follows the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. For instance, the price of Bitcoin hit a new all-time high in February 2021 after news broke that Tesla had purchased $1.5 billion worth of the digital asset. But beyond these headline-grabbing moves, how often do we see real-world applications such as major companies using crypto for deals or&nbsp;payroll?</p><p>According to Avidan Abitbol, crypto’s promise of transparency, a key selling point, paradoxically creates barriers to institutional adoption. Speaking to Cointelegraph, the project director for the Data Ownership Protocol (DOP) privacy solution asserted that transparency has become a double-edged sword for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>He highlighted the security and competitive risks associated with blockchain transparency. He warned that public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, make institutions vulnerable to theft, scams, and strategic disadvantage.</p><p>“Institutions want to hide payments, workflow, daily work, who they pay, and when. If you have Bitcoin or Ethereum balances, those things are very relevant to other&nbsp;people.”</p><p>Abitol goes on to argue that transparency can fuel market volatility, as traders may capitalize on the visibility of large institutional holdings or transactions to manipulate asset prices. I agree with this argument to a large extent because the crypto market has consistently reacted to news linked to institutional players (buy the rumour and sell the&nbsp;news).</p> Privacy is the&nbsp;Key <p>Privacy is essential to safeguarding sensitive institutional operations. The lack of robust privacy features on public blockchains impacts industries beyond finance, such as healthcare, where patient confidentiality is paramount.</p><p>Innovative blockchain solutions already exist to solve this challenge. <a href="https://pivx.org/">PIVX</a>, a leading blockchain offering advanced privacy features, allows users to conduct confidential transactions. By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques like Zero-Knowledge Proofs, PIVX enables users to maintain their privacy while participating in the blockchain ecosystem. This level of privacy is crucial for institutions, as it allows them to conduct sensitive financial operations without compromising security or regulatory compliance.</p><p>Another solution in this regard is Chainlink’s suite of privacy-enhancing tools, including the Blockchain Privacy Manager and CCIP Private Transactions. These features enable institutions to conduct confidential transactions on public blockchains. ANZ Bank, for instance, has already leveraged Chainlink’s privacy solutions to facilitate secure tokenized asset settlements.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

 Zk-nym infrastructure in place, and apps are live across all platforms <p>Nym promised a complete version of NymVPN by the end of 2024. And we are pleased to announce: the latest stable version of NymVPN v2024.12 will be released today, 12 December, for all major platforms, including Android and&nbsp;Windows.</p><p>The release enables zero-knowledge accounts, based on zk-nym anonymous credentials, across all apps to ensure that when users pay for a NymVPN, their personal information can never be linked to their usage of the app. Unlike any other VPN provider, this cutting-edge zero-knowledge technology prevents Nym Technologies from snitching on its&nbsp;users.</p><p>The next step is to turn payments on for users. However, NymVPN will still be <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">free for anyone to use</a> until early next year! So don’t miss your chance to get free zero-knowledge credentials for the world’s most anonymous network before commercial launch.</p><p>The release of the NymVPN app comes just in time for the winding down of the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-buyback-33e3ec88c4dc">NYM token buyback</a>. Over the past month, the company has been buying back NYM tokens, taking advantage of a historically low price point. This was a trial of what will become a continuous buyback mechanism once the NymVPN app requires subscription payments in January. This payment functionality will be demoed for institutions like venture capital firms next week and then the larger community for wider testing. Thus, over the next month we can expect the testing to continue to cause NYM token purchases using the algorithms designed during the&nbsp;buyback.</p><p>NymVPN v2024.12 also includes improved performance and security following the implementation of better state-based error-handling in November. Expect better and more stable connections, especially when switching between&nbsp;modes.</p><p>NymVPN will continue to be rigorously tested over the holidays to stabilize the app for commercial launch in January 2025. While beta payments are going live in the coming days, remember that NymVPN remains free to use. So <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">sign up today</a> to get one month free and help Nym test the world’s most anonymous network.</p> Compatibility <p>NymVPN v2024.11 is currently released&nbsp;for:</p>  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/macos">MacOS</a>  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/linux">Linux</a>  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/ios">iOS</a> (available in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nymvpn-fast-secure-vpn/id6471254143">Apple&nbsp;Store</a>)  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/android">Android</a> (available in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nymtech.nymvpn&amp;hl=en">Play Store</a>, and F-Droid coming&nbsp;soon)  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/windows">Windows</a> (beta)   New NymVPN&nbsp;apps  Android <p>The Android mobile app is now available in Google Play and will be available in F-droid in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> Windows <p>The Fast Mode with WireGuard has been successfully enabled on the Windows app which can now be used in beta. Note that this is the first Windows release, so expect bugs and help the dev team by <a href="https://support.nymvpn.com/hc/en-us/categories/24316023997713-Troubleshooting">reporting them&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Zk-nyms <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">Zk-nyms (zero-knowledge access credentials)</a> are the foundation of anonymous access with NymVPN: they ensure that you can access the Nym network with full anonymity, even from Nym itself! The infrastructure for zk-nyms is now in place and will begin issuance next week with the launch of beta payments.*</p><p>* For users still using an old ticketbook / credential, zk-nyms may not be active until a new credential is&nbsp;issued.</p> Account sign-up / sign-in&nbsp;flow <p>After the November release, there is a streamlined system for signing up for NymVPN and logging into the app from multiple&nbsp;devices.</p>  Create account on the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">nymvpn.com</a> with a recovery&nbsp;phrase  You will receive a free single month subscription of zk-nyms “ticket book” fair usage allowance (30 days/250gb) * on&nbsp;sign-up  Use your recovery phrase to log into NymVPN on MacOS, Linux, mobile Android, or iOS (Windows coming next&nbsp;month)  You can then add (up to 10) additional devices by logging in with the same recovery&nbsp;phrase  <p>* Note that fair usage is now enforced from the centralized API based on the anonymous credential. Users can view their account plan fair usage&nbsp;summary.</p> DNS and ipv6&nbsp;leaks <p>Currently, all leaks while connected with NymVPN are fixed. The Nym dev team is continuing its work in plugging all leaks that occur prior to connecting with the NymVPN app. Nym remains committed to not releasing a full commercial version of the app until all these risks are fully addressed.</p> Crunch <p>The Nym network is also undergoing a major update to prepare the way for Nym tokenomics in which the value of the token is linked to the real usage of the NymVPN app. Payments for NymVPN subscriptions will trigger NYM buy orders, anonymizing the access of users while also creating a flywheel effect for the NYM&nbsp;token.</p><p>With crunch, operators will be able to choose the mode in which their node functions (as a gateway or mix node). There is also the inclusion of a new Network Monitor and mechanisms to remove outdated nodes to improve network performance.</p> Next stops: Beta payments and commercial launch  Beta payments &amp; zk-nym&nbsp;issuance <p>The payment flow is in its final testing phase and will be made live early next week. Beta payments will include debit and credit cards (through Stripe), NYM, and BTC. These payments will be linked with zk-nym issuance on new credentials.</p><p>Note: The payment system is for beta testing purposes to trial the payment flow before commercial launch. NymVPN remains free to use for everyone.</p> Commercial launch <p>The commercial launch of NymVPN is scheduled for January 2025. The reason why the Nym team decided to hold the launch in 2025 is to maximize the marketing opportunities after the holiday season. This will ensure that the app gets into the hands of as many users as possible.</p> Conclusion <p>A full, stable, and leak-free NymVPN app for general use is just the beginning. In 2025 the app will be launched to market. This will be the beginning of Nym’s <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-token-flow-powering-the-worlds-most-private-network-48c15db379c5">novel experiment in tokenomics</a> in which the value of the token is linked to the concrete use of the NymVPN&nbsp;app.</p><p>And for app users, expect a lot of exciting upgrades as NymVPN comes into its own: kill switch and autoconnect features to prevent all leaks at the source, censorship resistance technology to permit access to blocked content, and post-quantum cryptography to protect your data against the AI and quantum computers of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>2025 will be a big&nbsp;year!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-app-live-with-zero-knowledge-accounts-1aeb044dbadf">NymVPN app live with zero-knowledge accounts</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Polynomials are quintessential in machine learning for establishing relationships between outputs and inputs. However, there is also a field in cryptography which could not be made possible without polynomials - zero-knowledge technology. In zero-knowledge proof systems, computations are often represented as arithmetic circuits, and these circuits are translated into polynomials. This process is crucial for generating proofs that can demonstrate the correctness of computations without revealing the underlying data. The involved complexity explains the massive adoption hurdle for zk rollups compared to optimistic ones. Succinct aims to simplify the use of zero-knowledge proofs by providing a zkVM (SP1) that allows code written in languages like Rust to be proven in a privacy-preserving way. By doing so, it aims to lower the barrier to implementing zk-rollups and increase their adoption.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Uma’s background and her interest in zero knowledge tech  How Succinct’s story began  ZK light clients  ZK circuits  SP1 and the RISC-V instruction set  The prover network  Use cases  ZK rollups and commoditizing ZKPs  Incentivizing provers  Succinct’s business model  Supported blockchain applications  Bottlenecks in ZK adoption  Succinct metrics  SP1’s competitive advantage and future roadmap  The real world impact of verifiability  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/pumatheuma">Uma Roy on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/SuccinctLabs">Succinct on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Short for Private Instant Verified Transaction, PIVX is a leading blockchain project that prioritizes user privacy, security, and decentralized governance. Unlike many mainstream cryptocurrencies, the project offers users a powerful alternative that emphasizes individual financial sovereignty.</p><p>To clear your doubts, privacy is not akin to malicious or anti-government. PIVX is open-source, licensed under MIT, and is committed to complying with global AML/CFT standards, including FATF regulations.</p><p>While I wouldn’t want to bore you with a long history of PIVX, here’s a compressed timeline of the project’s development.</p><p>· Launched on January 30th, 2016 under the name Darknet&nbsp;(DNET)</p><p>· Transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) after 259200&nbsp;blocks</p><p>· Rebranded to PIVX on January 1,&nbsp;2017</p><p>· Operates a robust decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), governed by masternode holders</p><p>· Became the first PoS network to enable transaction anonymity in October&nbsp;2017</p><p>· Delivered SHIELD, a fully customized integration of zk-SNARKs, in&nbsp;2020</p><p>· Multiple exchange listings and vendor integrations since inception</p> Getting Started with&nbsp;PIVX  1. Where to Store&nbsp;PIVX <p>You will need a wallet to store your PIV coins irrespective of how you choose to participate in the PIVX ecosystem. From the PIVX Core wallet to the much lighter <a href="https://app.mypivxwallet.org/">MyPIVXWallet</a> (MPW), third-party web wallets such as Komodo, Arctic, and NOW Wallet, there are a plethora of options to choose&nbsp;from.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, larger funds should be stored in cold storage such as the PIVX Core wallet or Ledger, while smaller amounts can be left on centralized exchanges for trading or the MPW for staking and masternoding.</p> 2. How to Get&nbsp;PIVX <p>You can purchase PIV using fiat or other cryptocurrencies on exchanges that support it. Alternatively, you can acquire the coins through peer-to-peer trading platforms.</p><p>The cryptocurrency is listed on popular CEX such as Binance, MEXC, Gate.io, BitMart, XT.COM, and several&nbsp;others.</p><p>Another interesting way to obtain PIV coins is by participating in the ecosystem. The PIVX marketing team routinely hosts giveaways on social&nbsp;media.</p> 3. Staking Your PIV&nbsp;Coins <p>Staking is one of the ways to participate in the PIVX ecosystem. Stakers secure the network and build the blockchain by creating the blocks and submitting them to the network. The interesting thing about staking PIV is that users can earn staking rewards while keeping their funds securely locked in offline cold&nbsp;storage.</p><p>Once a node has fully synchronized with the PIVX network and holds a minimum of 1 PIVX, it becomes eligible to participate in staking and contribute to network security. At the time this article was written, the estimated annual ROI was 13%. Check out this <a href="https://pivx.org/cold-staking">guide</a> to learn more about staking your PIV&nbsp;coins.</p> 4. Your Voice Matters, Become a Masternode Operator <p>Masternodes, and by extension, decentralized governance, is one of the cornerstones of PIVX. Masternodes provide layer 2 services such as instant send and additional security for the network. <a href="https://docs.pivx.org/masternodes/masternodes">Hosting</a> a PIVX masternode requires a 10,000 collateral, with an estimated ROI of around 15% per&nbsp;annum.</p><p>In addition to PIV rewards, masternodes are given voting rights to participate in governance.</p><p>PIVX’s decentralized governance system allows the community to propose and vote on projects, with masternodes playing a key role in decision-making. The treasury provides a monthly budget of 432,000 PIV for community-driven projects. Proposals that garner sufficient support from masternode holders are funded from this treasury.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.1.0">Zebra 2.1.0</a>. This release includes some necessary updates post-NU6 activation.</p>



<p>We are now verifying that V5 transactions in the mempool have the correct consensus branch ID before returning a transaction ID, which would indicate a successful insertion in the mempool, even though they would be eventually rejected by the block consensus checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, Zebra also now returns an error when trying to submit transactions that would eventually fail some consensus checks (e.g. double spends) but would also return a transaction ID indicating success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The release also bumps Zebra’s initial minimum protocol version such that this release of Zebra will always reject connections with peers advertising a network protocol version below 170,120 on Mainnet and 170,110 on Testnet. Prior to this change, these connections would have been accepted until Zebra’s chain state reaches the NU6 activation height. While this is standard procedure in Zebra after a Zcash network upgrade, this change to the minimum protocol version is classified as a breaking change in Zebra.</p>



<p>In addition, the <code>getblock</code> RPC method has been updated to return some additional information such as the block height (even if you provide a block hash) and other fields as supported by the <code>getblockheader</code> RPC call.</p>



<p>You can see a full copy of the included changes in the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.1.0">v2.1.0 Release Notes</a> on GitHub.</p>

       AI in 2025: Building Blocks Firmly in Place        
Published December 9, 2024


 
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 


 
	 
        2024 was AI’s primordial soup year. In 2025, AI’s foundations are solidifying.         
Published December 9, 2024


 
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 


 
	 
  



 
<p>Last January, we compared ChatGPT to AI’s “Big Bang” and predicted that 2024 would be AI’s “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-in-2024/">primordial soup</a>” year. The AI ecosystem was abounding with new ideas and potential energy. It was a ripe moment for new entrepreneurs. “There is much potential in the air, and yet it is still amorphous,” we wrote at the time. “Vision is required to convert it into something real, tangible and, ultimately, impactful.”</p>



<p>Today, the AI ecosystem has hardened. There are now five “finalists” in the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/steel-servers-and-power/">race for biggest model</a>. Nvidia’s highly anticipated Blackwell chip is shipping <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-will-reportedly-start-blackwell-server-deliveries-in-early-december-the-first-servers-will-go-to-microsoft">this month</a>. Data centers, many of which were planned in early 2024, are entering full-on <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-data-center-buildout/">build mode</a>. TSMC is building new fab capacity and Broadcom is working on custom AI chips: the entire <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-ai-supply-chain-tug-of-war/">supply chain</a> has shifted into high gear. In every industry from healthcare to law to insurance, new AI initiatives are kicking off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If 2024 was the primordial soup year for AI, the building blocks are now firmly in place. AI’s potential is now congealing into something real and tangible—embodied by physical data centers that are rising up all across America from Salem, PA to Round Rock, TX to Mount Pleasant, WI. If 2024 was about new ideas abounding, 2025 will be about sifting through those ideas to see which really work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below, we offer three predictions for the year ahead:</p>



 1. LLM providers have evolved distinct superpowers—this should lead to incremental differentiation and a contested pecking order in 2025 



<p>In 2024, the big model race was all about reaching parity with GPT-4. Five companies achieved this objective (or got close enough) and thus became “finalists:” Microsoft/OpenAI, Amazon/Anthropic, Google, Meta and xAI. Others dropped out of the race, most notably, Inflection, Adept and Character.</p>



<p>To get to GPT-4 quality, these companies ran roughly the same playbook: Collect as much data as possible, train on as many GPUs as possible and refine the pre-training/post-training architecture to maximize performance. With talent moving fluidly across organizations in 2024, few trade secrets remain.</p>



<p>As each player prepares for the next round of LLM scaling—which will likely involve another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/01/zuckerberg-says-meta-will-need-10x-more-computing-power-to-train-llama-4-than-llama-3/">10x increase</a> in compute scale—the labs are evolving differentiated superpowers. They have “chosen their weapons,” so to speak, for the battle ahead. In 2025, these distinct strategies should lead to disparate outcomes, with some players pulling ahead and others falling behind.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Google – Vertical Integration: Google’s advantage going into 2025 is vertical integration. Google is the only player with its own first-class chips: TPUs have a chance to give NVDA GPUs a run for their money in 2025. Google also builds its own data centers, trains its own models and has a very strong internal research team. Unlike Microsoft and Amazon, which have partnered with OpenAI and Anthropic, respectively, Google is going for the prize by owning every part of the value chain. 
 



 
 OpenAI – Brand: We’ve seen a handful of surveys on unaided awareness of ChatGPT vs. Claude vs. Gemini, and it’s not close. OpenAI has the strongest brand in AI, bar none. This has resulted in the strongest revenue engine among the big AI players, with OpenAI reportedly north of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html">$3.6B</a> in revenue. If success in AI ends up hinging on consumer mindshare and enterprise distribution, OpenAI may continue to widen the gap between itself and rivals.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Anthropic – Talent: 2024 saw a big exodus of research talent from OpenAI, paired with inflows to Anthropic. With Jon Schulman, Durk Kingma and Jan Leike all leaving OpenAI for Anthropic in 2024, Anthropic has been gaining mindshare with research talent. The company also made some big executive hires, adding Instagram co-founder Mike Kreiger as Chief Product Officer. With GPT-3 inventor Dario Amodei at the helm, Anthropic has carved out its position as a favored destination for AI scientists.&nbsp; 
 



 
 xAI – Data Center Construction: We wrote in our piece on “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/steel-servers-and-power/">Steel, Servers, and Power</a>” about the importance of data center construction to the next phase of the AI race. With xAI bringing on their 100k GPU Colossus cluster <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/09/27/2024/elon-musks-new-memphis-data-center-hits-an-ai-milestone-with-nvidia-chips">in record time</a>, the company is now the pace setter for data center scaling. The next milestone for xAI and its rivals will be a 200k cluster and then a 300k cluster. If it ends up being true that “scale is all you need,” xAI is well-positioned to continue its rapid ascent.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Meta – Open Source: Meta, which already has strong distribution advantages through Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook, has chosen to go all-in on open source. Meta is the only big player in the pack taking this approach. Meta’s Llama models have ardent fans and the closed-source vs. open-source debate continues to rage on. If frontier advancements start to slow down, Meta will be well-positioned to leverage its open-source models for rapid dissemination of these capabilities. 
 



<p>In the big model race, rigorous execution lies ahead. The competitive landscape and posture of each of the players has solidified. In 2025, we will see which of these strategies prove prescient—and which prove ill-fated.</p>



 2. AI Search is emerging as a killer app—in 2025, it will proliferate 



<p>Ever since ChatGPT came out, we’ve all been on the hunt for AI’s killer use case. What persistent new user behaviors will stand the test of time?</p>



<p>In 2024, many different applications were tested from AI girlfriends to AI rental assistants to voice agents and AI accountants.</p>



<p>One use case that we think will proliferate in 2025 is AI as a search engine. Perplexity has been on a tear since its launch, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/technology/perplexity-search-ai-google.html">reaching 10M monthly active users</a>. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Search in October, an expansion of its existing search-like capabilities. The Wall Street Journal ran a piece recently headlined “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/googling-is-for-old-people-thats-a-problem-for-google-5188a6ed">Googling is for Old People</a>.” Ironically, this challenge to Google comes just as the company is mired in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24302415/doj-google-search-antitrust-remedies-chrome-android">anti-trust litigation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI search is a powerful re-invention of a technology that rapidly became the internet’s killer app. Internet search is a navigational technology based on indexing the web. AI search is an informational technology based on LLMs that can read and semantically understand knowledge. For white collar workers, this will be a huge boon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI search may fragment what is currently a monolithic market. It’s possible to imagine a world where every profession has its own specialized AI search engine—analysts and investors now default to Perplexity, lawyers will use platforms like Harvey, and doctors will use solutions like OpenEvidence. Along these lines, one can think of Midjourney as search over the “pixelverse,” Github Copilot as search over the “codeverse,” and Glean as search over the “documentverse.” Unlike in traditional search, AI search can go much deeper semantically, and is therefore an order of magnitude more powerful, resulting in significant incremental productivity gains.</p>



<p>The text response as a product surface area is deeper than first meets the eye. Not all text responses are created equal. We think LLMs allow for real product differentiation across multiple dimensions, and that founders will build unique product experiences around these capabilities, targeted at specific customer audiences:</p>



 
 Intent Extraction: Tightly matching the response to the user’s intent becomes easier with domain specialization. For example, a doctor and patient asking the same question will want to see different types of responses. 



 Proprietary Data: Unique datasets like case law for lawyers, financial data for analysts or weather data for insurance underwriters will be important in white collar domains. Getting the answer right is table stakes in a business context.&nbsp; 



 Formatting: How results are presented to the user, for example how verbose or concise the response is, use of bullets, use of multi-modal content, reference to sources. Accountants tend to digest information differently than journalists, for example.&nbsp; 



 Interface Design: Code search needs to live in the IDE. Accounting policy search needs to live in your accounting SaaS platform. Semantic search benefits from context around the user’s existing workflow and data. Different domains will require different interfaces. 
 



<p>New domain-specific AI search engines will map themselves as tightly as possible onto the “theory of mind” of their target personas. Doctors, lawyers and accountants don’t think alike. As we become experts in a given domain, our patterns for extracting knowledge and making decisions begin to diverge. Doctors confront medical literature, lawyers confront case law, investors confront earnings reports. The way we dissect, analyze and make decisions on this knowledge is different in each domain.</p>



<p>There is likely to be a bifurcation between consumer and enterprise. In our capacity as consumers, we all have roughly the same needs, hence the smashing product-market fit of ChatGPT. However, in our capacity as professionals, we have different needs. It is fairly straightforward to imagine that every knowledge worker will have at least two AI search engines they use daily—one for work and one for everything else.</p>



 3. ROI will remain problematic and CapEx will begin to stabilize in 2025 



<p>We’ve written about <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/">AI’s $200B question</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">AI’s $600B question</a>, which explore the tremendous capital expenditure coming out of the Big Tech companies, and the lack of commensurate end-user revenue to derive a payback for these cash outlays.</p>



<p>Going into 2024, the Big Tech companies were nervous about AI being a threat to their oligopoly in the cloud business. As we wrote in the “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/">Game Theory of AI CapEx</a>,” these companies felt they had no choice but to spend aggressively to ensure their continued dominance in an AI future. If they didn’t spend, others would, and they’d fall behind.</p>



<p>Entering 2025, the picture has changed dramatically. Big Tech companies have their arms locked firmly around the AI revolution. Not only do they control the vast majority of the data centers that power AI, but they own significant equity stakes in the big model companies, and they are among the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/06/ai-craze-getting-funded-by-tech-giants-distorting-traditional-vcs.html">largest backers</a> of new AI startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Big Tech feeling more confident, we think 2025 will be a stabilization year for AI CapEx. If 2024 was a scramble to sign deals for land and power, 2025 will be an execution year. Shovels are in the ground, and these companies will be focused on completing their new projects on-time and on-budget. They will then need to sell this installed capacity to customers and work with enterprises to help them achieve success with their new AI capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After roughly doubling CapEx levels since pre-ChatGPT, we may see some normalization in 2025. The latest CapEx figures released in Q3 suggest that the trendline is already starting to stabilize inside of Microsoft and Google. Amazon and Meta are still ramping, but may reach steady state in early 2025. (While Meta looks flat in the chart below, the company has issued guidance for increased CapEx in Q4).</p>



Source: Earnings transcripts, public filings



<p>Oligopolistic dynamics are likely to set-in as well. Each of the Big Tech companies follows their rivals closely. If it looks like the industry is on a glide path to a “new normal,” that may be welcome news for all. It would provide further support for a new equilibrium in 2025 vs. continued ratcheting of spend.</p>



<p>As new data center capacity comes online in 2025, AI compute prices should continue their epic decline. This is great news for startups and should incentivize net-new innovation. As we’ve pointed out in the past, startups are primarily consumers of compute vs. producers of compute, and so they benefit from overbuilding. The Big Tech companies are effectively creating a subsidy that will accrue to the entire AI ecosystem.</p>



<p>Many comparisons have been made between the Clouds and the railroad oligopoly of the Gilded Age. If data centers are indeed the rails of the digital economy, then the new AI rails will be securely in place by the end of 2025. The question remains what freight will ride on those rails, and how we can leverage this new technology to create value for customers and end-users.</p>



<p>Here’s to a year of leveraging AI’s building blocks to create incredible new capabilities that will change people’s lives.</p>

<p>On October 31, Kraken <a href="https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/support-for-monero-xmr-in-europe?ref=hackernoon.com">delisted</a> Monero (XMR) from its European Economic Area (EEA) market, joining the growing list of exchanges that have brought down the hammer on coins that allow users to transact anonymously.</p><p>A perfect storm of regulatory pressure has battered privacy coins in 2024. Nearly 60 delistings, a record since 2021, have swept across centralized exchanges. Monero and Dash have been particularly hard-hit, with delistings skyrocketing sixfold and nearly twentyfold, respectively.</p><p>Given the stringent stance of regulators, one is left to ponder the future of privacy coins. Will there be more clampdowns or will they enjoy increased patronage amid a growing concern for financial privacy?</p> What Are Privacy&nbsp;Coins? <p>Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies designed to obfuscate transaction details. Like a magic cloak that hides your financial transactions from prying eyes, they make it extremely difficult to trace the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction.</p><p>Think of it this way: when you use a regular cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, everyone can see your transactions on a public ledger. It’s like your financial life is an open book. But with privacy coins, your transactions are shrouded in mystery. It becomes much harder for anyone to track your spending&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Fun fact: Bitcoin may seem anonymous, but it’s more like a pseudonym. By delving into the blockchain, it’s often possible to unmask the identities behind public&nbsp;keys.</p> Brief History of Privacy&nbsp;Coins <p>One of the earliest pioneers in this space was Bytecoin, which introduced ring signatures to mask the origin of transactions in 2012. However, concerns about its initial distribution and lack of transparency hindered its adoption.</p><p>Monero, a fork of Bytecoin, built upon these foundations and introduced further privacy enhancements, including stealth addresses and Ring Confidential Transactions in 2014. These innovations made it significantly more difficult to track the flow of funds, propelling Monero to the forefront of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.</p><p>ZCash, another major player, introduced zk-SNARKs, a powerful cryptographic technique that allows users to prove the validity of a transaction without revealing any specific details. While this offered strong privacy, it required significant computational resources and a trusted setup&nbsp;process.</p><p>Other projects, such as Dash, PIVX, Verge, and NavCoin, also emerged, each with its unique approach to privacy. Dash, for example, introduced optional privacy features like CoinJoin, while PIVX focused on a combination of privacy and masternode governance.</p> The Regulatory Tightrope <p>Regulators have long eyed privacy coins with suspicion. For years, they’ve been tightening the noose around these anonymous cryptocurrencies. Japan led the charge in 2018 with a blanket ban, followed by Australia and South Korea in 2020. The UAE’s strict crypto rules and the EU’s MiCA regulation further proved&nbsp;hostile.</p><p>Major exchanges have felt the heat. Kraken delisted XMR for European users in 2024, while Binance pulled the plug entirely. OKX and Huobi also succumbed to regulatory pressure, delisting privacy tokens in 2024 and 2022, respectively.</p><p>These regulatory crackdowns have cast a long shadow over the future of privacy coins. As governments worldwide tighten their grip on cryptocurrencies, privacy-focused coins will face an uphill battle. The recent delistings on top exchanges highlight the challenges these coins may&nbsp;face.</p><p>While we may see more clampdowns in more jurisdictions, I believe a sizeable portion of the market will be transferred to decentralized exchanges. Proponents of the privacy ethos will likely look for ways to bypass these hurdles even in restricted jurisdictions. A decentralized approach, driven by a strong community, could help privacy coins thrive in a hostile regulatory environment. By fostering community-led development and promoting decentralized exchanges, privacy coins may be able to circumvent traditional regulatory hurdles.</p><p>I also envisage that privacy coin developers will adapt by exploring innovative solutions. This could involve developing new privacy-enhancing technologies or focusing on specific use cases that align with regulatory frameworks. There are already a few solutions in this regard. For instance, PIVX allows for both SHIELDED and transparent transactions, offering users optional&nbsp;privacy.</p> Give the Dog a Bad Name and Hang&nbsp;Him <p>In one of my <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/money-laundering-facts-fiat-vs-crypto-810a4ad29771">previous articles</a>, I separated facts from myths regarding the use of cryptocurrencies as a tool for money laundering. “Traditional fiat currencies have been the primary vehicle for money laundering for centuries,” not cryptos. However, critics often raise dust over crypto’s potential use in money laundering, difficulties in implementing KYC and AML regulations, and concerns about tax evasion. While these concerns are valid, the upsides of the tech are often downplayed.</p><p>Privacy coins are not just about hiding transactions. They represent a broader movement towards financial sovereignty, protection from economic surveillance, resistance to censorship, and providing financial tools for unbanked populations.</p> Conclusion <p>Privacy coins stand at a critical juncture. They represent not just a technological innovation, but a philosophical stance on financial freedom and individual privacy. As digital surveillance becomes more pervasive, these cryptocurrencies offer a potential counterbalance, ensuring that individuals maintain control over their financial information.</p><p>In general, the future of privacy coins will be shaped by a delicate balance between technological innovation, regulatory adaptation, and societal acceptance.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>What happens when artificial intelligence starts weighing in on our moral decisions? Matt Prewitt is joined by Meaning Alignment Institute co-founder Joe Edelman to explore this thought-provoking territory in examining how AI is already shaping our daily experiences and values through social media algorithms. They explore the tools developed to help individuals negotiate their values and the implications of AI in moral reasoning – venturing into compelling questions about human-AI symbiosis, the nature of meaningful experiences, and whether machines can truly understand what matters to us. For anyone intrigued by the future of human consciousness and decision-making in an AI-integrated world, this discussion opens up fascinating possibilities – and potential pitfalls – we may not have considered.</p><p>Links &amp; References:&nbsp;</p><p>References:</p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchSurfing">CouchSurfing - Wikipedia</a> | <a href="http://couchsurfing.org">CouchSurfing.org | Website</a>  <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_how_a_handful_of_tech_companies_control_billions_of_minds_every_day?subtitle=en">Tristan Harris: How a handful of tech companies control billions of minds every day | TED Talk</a>  <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology | Website</a>  <a href="https://www.meaningalignment.org/">MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE | Website</a>  <a href="https://replika.com/">Replika - AI Girlfriend/Boyfriend</a>  <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/will-ai-improve-exponentially-at-value-judgments/">Will AI Improve Exponentially At Value Judgments? - by Matt Prewitt | RadicalxChange</a>  <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/">Moral Realism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Theologica">Summa Theologica - Wikipedia</a>  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2023/05/16/when-generative-ai-refuses-to-answer-questions-ai-ethics-and-ai-law-get-deeply-worried/">When Generative AI Refuses To Answer Questions, AI Ethics And AI Law Get Deeply Worried</a> | AI Refusals  <a href="https://time.com/7012865/amanda-askell/">Amanda Askell: The 100 Most Influential People in AI 2024 | TIME</a> | Amanda Askells' work at Anthropic  <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/taylor.htm">Overcoming Epistemology by Charles Taylor</a>  <a href="https://catholicstand.com/god-beauty-symmetry-science/">God, Beauty, and Symmetry in Science - Catholic Stand</a> | Thomas Aquinas on symmetry  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek">Friedrich Hayek - Wikipedia</a> | “Hayekian”  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky - Wikipedia</a> | “AI policy people, especially in this kind Yudkowskyian scene”  <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/lieder_resource.pdf">Resource-rational analysis: Understanding human cognition as the optimal use of limited computational resources</a> | Resource rational (cognitive science term)  <p>Papers &amp; posts mentioned</p>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10636">[2404.10636] What are human values, and how do we align AI to them? | Paper by Oliver Klingefjord, Ryan Lowe, Joe Edelman</a>  <a href="https://meaningalignment.substack.com/p/model-integrity">Model Integrity - by Joe Edelman and Oliver Klingefjord | Meaning Alignment Institute Substack</a>  <p>Bios:</p><p>Joe Edelman is a philosopher, sociologist, and entrepreneur whose work spans from theoretical philosophy to practical applications in technology and governance.

<p>Fellow Panthers,&nbsp;</p><p>November marked another milestone-filled month for Panther, with significant progress across key areas. Panther completed internal testing for Stage 9 of its testnet and made significant progress in advancing the Canary network, bringing Panther closer to providing infrastructure for real-world transactions. The team also made impactful contributions at DevCon and in the media, showcasing Panther’s innovations. Panther continues to build momentum in its mission to bring privacy and compliance to DeFi. Read on for the full recap below.</p><p>\</p> Stage 9 Internal Testing Complete, Canary Network Prep Underway <p>Panther hit a key milestone in November with the completion of internal testing for Stage 9, the final stage of <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s testnet</a>. This sets the stage for Panther Protocol Foundation’s launch of Panther’s Canary network. The Canary network, which will be run by a Swiss-based foundation, will serve as a critical proving ground, showcasing Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">privacy-enhancing</a> and <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/compliance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">compliance-driven capabilities</a>. Simultaneously, Panther contributors continued to work on refining the codebase.</p><p>We would be remiss if we did not thank our community of 3500+ testers, whose feedback has been invaluable. Stay tuned here and on our <a href="http://www.x.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">social media</a> for further details on access to the Canary network as we continue to deliver our transformative vision for DeFi.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Zone Manager documentation and interface development are progressing as the Protocol prepares to support financial service providers on its platform.&nbsp;</p> Panther Ecosystem Update <p>Panther’s thought leadership in DeFi privacy and compliance was fully displayed at <a href="http://devcon.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DevCon</a> 2024, one of the world’s premier Ethereum developer conferences in Bangkok, Thailand.</p><p>During DevCon’s Privacy ftw side event organized by <a href="http://zkmonk.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zkMonk</a> and <a href="https://www.zk-hub.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zkHUB</a>, Panther’s Technical Lead, Igor Markelov delivered his presentation, "Private Data Sharing to Enable Compliance in DeFi." Igor showcased&nbsp; Panther’s cutting-edge innovations, including:</p>  ElGamal encryption&nbsp;  <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-deep-dive-into-secure-multi-party-computation-mpc/">Multi-party computation (MPC)</a>  <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/learn/cryptographic-primitives/zero-knowledge-proofs?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zero-Knowledge circuits</a>&nbsp;  <p>These technologies form the backbone of Panther’s ability to facilitate secure, compliant transactions. Igor also spoke about customizable <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/zone-manager?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zone Management</a> rules, designed to help maintain compliance in DeFi operations and offered a sneak peek at the upcoming launch of Panther’s Canary network.</p><p>Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar, participated in a panel discussion alongside representatives from o1Labs, Rarimo, and Aztec. The panel delved into the practical applications of Zero-Knowledge technology, the increasing demand for privacy solutions, and the growing trust in<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/"> ZK rollups</a> as scalable, privacy-preserving tools.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding to the conversation, Panther’s Co-Founder Dr. Anish Mohammed highlighted how privacy-enhancing technologies like <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/learn/cryptographic-primitives/zero-knowledge-proofs?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a> empower users with greater control over their data while simultaneously addressing the critical need for compliance in DeFi.&nbsp;</p><p>At the De.Fi World event, Panther took the spotlight with a compelling presentation by Dr. Mohammed. The session focused on compliant privacy in DeFi, offering insightful comparisons of privacy approaches, the role of analytics, and key considerations for <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/compliance-providers?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">AML compliance</a>.</p> Panther in the Media <p>Panther continued to gain momentum with media coverage in November, with prominent features in leading publications and insightful media appearances.</p><p><a href="https://coinpasar.sg/navigating-the-privacy-paradox-in-defi-transparency-vs-confidentiality/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Coinpasar</a> spotlighted Panther in a byline exploring how Panther leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkSNARKs) to address the inherent tension between blockchain transparency and user privacy. Similarly, the Metaverse Post published an article, "<a href="https://mpost.io/the-role-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-in-protecting-user-data-in-defi/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">The Role of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Protecting User Data in DeFi</a>", delving into the importance of confidentiality without compromising blockchain integrity.</p><p>Additionally, Panther was interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/InfiniteCrypto?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Infinite Crypto Podcast</a> and <a href="https://www.web3pod.xyz/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Web3 Podcast</a>, with Sam Kamani about privacy technologies, compliance solutions, and the transformative role of Zero-Knowledge technology in DeFi. Yet-to-be-published, we will share the direct links to each episode after they air.&nbsp;</p> Conclusion <p>Panther achieved major milestones in November, completing Stage 9 internal testing, advancing the Canary network launch, and showcasing groundbreaking innovations at global events. With growing recognition from media and thought leaders, Panther is at the forefront of shaping the future of confidential decentralized finance. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year (Amber O’Hearn, Michael Harms and Jason McGee). Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held at the end of December.</p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">ZCG Elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining why they believe they should be elected to the ZCG Committee. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly by replying to their individual posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Friday 13th December 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning”. Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>After the deadline for nominations closes, Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community.</p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select three candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2025.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The three candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2025.</p>



<p>Prospective candidates should beaware of the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications, in accordance with the strictures and guidelines set forth in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a> and <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1015">ZIP 1015</a>. Currently, formal Committee meetings are held every two weeks, and the Committee meets informally for brainstorming sessions on a weekly basis.</p>



<p>Committee members currently receive a stipend of $1,725 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC).</p>



<p>With the adoption of <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1015">ZIP 1015</a>, the Zcash Community Grants Program is in the process of transitioning from ZF to the Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF). </p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>The Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF) is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement, and is obligated to have an appropriate policy and processes in place to ensure that actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed appropriately, in order to avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial authority. <a href="https://www.financialprivacyfoundation.org/_files/ugd/9ba471_3469edaa00944ed0bf46deb77e5c56eb.pdf">FPF’s conflict of interest policy can be found here</a>.</p>



<p>Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members are required to complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with FPF (to ensure that their status and relationship with FPF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify FPF of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.</p>



<p>The following policies also apply in relation to ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the FPF board. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with FPF (to ensure that their status and relationship with FPF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify FPF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.

<p>Joint work with Sebastian Angel (University of Pennsylvania), Sofía Celi (Brave), Alex Davidson (NOVA LINCS &amp; DI, FCT, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa), Hamed Haddadi (Brave Software &amp; Imperial College London), Shai Levin (University of Auckland), Elizabeth Margolin (University of Pennsylvania), Gonçalo Pestana (Hashmatter), Joe Rowell (Royal Holloway, University of London), Jess Woods (University of Pennsylvania). This post was written by Brave’s Security Researcher, Sofía Celi.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Just as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deco">DECO</a>, DiStefano is named after the football player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredo_Di_St%C3%A9fano">DiStefano</a>, who, while being Argentinian, worked for Spain most of his professional life. It is related to the fact of using something from one place in another place (TLS data to externally attest) (Image partially AI generated).</p>
<p>The Transport Layer Protocol (TLS) is one of the most widespread protocols that secure data in transport over the Internet. Thanks to its widespread deployment, users are assured that their data in transport remains secure and private as the protocol (especially, in its 1.3 version) provides encrypted and authenticated channels between clients and servers on the Internet. Such channels commonly transmit trusted information about users behind clients such as</p>
<p>proofs of age, social security statuses, bank account information and accepted purchase information. While various applications would benefit from learning such data points, doing so raises significant privacy concerns. Exporting such information as private, anonymous credentials is challenging because it is transmitted over an encrypted and authenticated channel. Meanwhile, both legislation (such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/">GDPR</a>) and standards bodies (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-did-core-20220719/">W3C</a>) have made usage of privacy-preserving data credentials a priority. Therefore, it is critical to develop methods that enable users to selectively and consensually export portions of their data. This would allow them to prove specific statements or authenticate that the data originates from a trusted source, such as a particular website, without compromising privacy.</p>
<p>To illustrate the problem, consider that Alice wants to prove to a service that they are over 18 (a website, for example, can request such a proof). Currently, most age verification services require users to upload identification documents containing extensive personal information, raising significant privacy concerns. If Alice chooses not to share their ID, they may be denied access to the service, even though they meet the age requirement. Meanwhile, many websites, such as company payroll systems or DMV portals, already store and serve verified birth dates. Alice could, in theory, share a screenshot of her birth date from one of these sites, but this approach has two major flaws: screenshots are easily forged, and even if their authenticity could somehow be guaranteed, they would reveal unnecessary information, such as Alice’s exact birth date, instead of simply proving that they are over 18. This situation highlights the need for a mechanism that achieves two goals: proving the authenticity of the data (ensuring it is not forged) and proving a specific statement about the data (e.g., that Alice is over 18) without disclosing additional details. Such a solution would enable both proofs of provenance and proofs of statements, which will allow users to access services without compromising their privacy and ensuring trust. These types of proofs can be useful, for example, in anti-fraud checks (and we will talk about this at the end of the post).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will explore a solution to this problem by leveraging TLS to create both proofs of provenance and proofs of statements. This approach enables users to consensually generate zero-knowledge proofs of their data, allowing them to securely access additional services while preserving their privacy.</p>

 DCTLS protocols 
<p>Designated-Commitment TLS (DCTLS) protocols, also known as three-party handshake (3PH) protocols or ZKTLS, enable modified TLS handshakes that allow specific statements about the data exchanged in a TLS channel to be securely exported to a designated verifier (a trusted party). These protocols secret-share private session data between a client and verifier, and compute the <a href="https://tls13.xargs.org/">handshake and record-layer phases of TLS</a> phases of TLS using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_two-party_computation">two-party computation (2PC)</a>, a type of MPC that allows two parties to jointly compute a function while keeping their respective inputs private. Notable examples of DCTLS protocols include <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00938">DECO</a>, <a href="https://old.tlsnotary.org/pagesigner">TLSNotary/PageSigner</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2976749.2978326">TownCrier</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/964">Garble-then-Prove</a>, and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1377">Janus</a> (similar techniques are also used to produce <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/grubbs">zero-knowledge middleboxes</a> for proving that client traffic adheres to corporate browsing policies, for example, and for devising multi-party TLS clients/servers).</p>
<p>Despite their claims of practicality, these protocols face significant barriers to wide-scale adoption.</p>
 
 
<p>Lack of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc8446.txt.pdf">TLS 1.3</a> Support: None of the protocols listed explicitly provide secure support for TLS 1.3, even though it became the dominant version of TLS as of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3450057">December 2020</a>. According to <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#tls-1-2-vs-tls-1-3-vs-quic">Cloudflare Radar</a>, TLS 1.3 now accounts for 63% of secure network traffic, compared to only 8.7% for TLS 1.2. Support for TLS 1.3 is therefore crucial. Even when TLS 1.3 is supported, existing protocols often lack rigorous security analyses or fail to address efficiency concerns associated with implementing TLS 1.3 ciphersuites and protocol steps in maliciously-secure 2PC.</p>
 
 
<p>Security Limitations: Current security arguments lack flexibility, as they are tied to specific, static protocols, ciphersuites, and 2PC primitives. This rigidity poses risks; for instance, primitives used by DECO have already been shown to <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1621">be</a>  <a href="https://info.fireblocks.com/hubfs/A_Note_on_the_Security_of_GG.pdf">insecure</a>. Moreover, client privacy is frequently overlooked, with protocols exposing the server a client communicates with to the verifier: potentially revealing sensitive browsing history.</p>
 
 
<p>Deployability Challenges: No fully-featured, open-source implementation of a DCTLS protocol exists that combines strong security guarantees with interoperability for common Internet browsing tools. This absence hinders practical adoption and widespread deployment.</p>
 
 
<p>In order to solve all these problems, we introduce DiStefano. But, prior to explaining our protocol, let’s see how DCTLS protocols work.</p>

 DCTLS in detail 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>DCTLS protocols allow a Client to generate commitments to TLS session data communicated with a Server that can be sent to a designated third-party Verifier. They consist of the following phases: 1. A (Verifier-assisted) handshake phase, 2. a (Verfier-assisted) query execution phase, and 3. a commitment phase. Over TLS 1.3 (given an informal description of TLS 1.3 with 1-RTT and with certificate-based authentication), these phases look like this:</p>
<p>Handshake phase. In this phase (as seen below), the Server learns the same secret session parameters as in standard TLS 1.3, while the Client and the Verifier learn shares of the session parameters that only the Client would normally learn: they engage in the core TLS 1.3 protocol using a series of 2PC functionalities, hence, they secret-share session data and arrive to session secret keys that are secret-shared.&nbsp;</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Record Layer-Query Execution phase. At the record layer, encrypted traffic is exchanged between the Client and the Server (as seen below). The Client sends an encrypted query (e.g., an HTTPS request) to the Server with assistance from the Verifier. Since the session secret keys are secret-shared, the Client and Verifier collaboratively compute the encryption of these queries using two-party computation (2PC). Similarly, encrypted responses from the Server (e.g., an HTTPS response) can be decrypted using the same joint procedure. Note that these responses must first be committed to, as discussed in the next phase.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Record Layer-Commitment phase. After the encrypted queries are sent and encrypted responses are received, the Client commits to the session by forwarding the ciphertexts (e.g., the encrypted responses) to the Verifier (as seen in box 3 of Figure 1). In exchange, the Verifier provides the Client with its shares of the session secret keys. This allows the Client to verify the integrity of the Server’s response and, later, prove statements derived from it to the Verifier. For example, using the committed encrypted response now held by the Verifier, the Client can prove in zero-knowledge that a specific statement is true (e.g., that an HTTPS response contains a field representing age, and that the age is greater than 18).</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>As we can see, DCTLS protocols are straightforward: they allow a trusted third party (the Verifier) to participate in the handshake (by performing operations in 2PC), enabling the Verifier to commit to encrypted data. This data can later be used to create zero-knowledge proofs. We require this commitment for zero-knowledge proofs: the data that one intends to prove a statement about must be committed to, ensuring its immutability. However, the Verifier never learns the plaintext data unless the Client chooses to reveal it. The Verifier only holds shares of the full session secret keys, and the encrypted data cannot be decrypted unless the full session secret keys are known.</p>

 DiStefano: Decentralized Infrastructure for Sharing Trusted Encrypted Facts and Nothing More 
<p>While all DCTLS follow a similar approach, with our protocol, DiStefano, we improve upon it by:</p>
 
 
<p>Making it all work with TLS 1.3 as described in the previous section and in detail in our paper.</p>
 
 
<p>Providing a full security model: we provide a modular, standalone security framework that guarantees security in the presence of malicious adversaries.</p>
 
 
<p>Improving privacy guarantees:&nbsp; In the handshake phase, when the Server sends its certificate messages to the Client, relaying those messages to the Verifier for verification would disclose the Client’s browsing history over time. This is because the Server’s certificate contains its identity, which could potentially reveal the Client’s activity. In DiStefano, we aim to prevent this. Instead, we use zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of valid signatures (ZKPVS) for signatures generated during TLS exchanges. In this scheme, one holds a valid signature issued by your keypair, while a verifier holds a set of valid public keys, one of which corresponds to your keypair. The goal is to demonstrate that the signature is valid with respect to this set without disclosing your specific public key. This ensures that the prover’s identity remains private, preserving the Client’s privacy. For this purpose, our <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1595">CDLS</a> scheme can be used with EC-DSA signatures.</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
 
 Making AES-GCM be a commitment scheme: To commit to the encrypted data, one could use traditional commitment schemes such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme">Pedersen Commitments</a>. However, we opted to leverage the existing functionality provided by the TLS 1.3 protocol. This involves adapting AES-GCM (the algorithm supported by TLS 1.3 to encrypt data),&nbsp; to act as a commitment scheme. Since AES-GCM, when used in an AEAD setting, functions as a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/664">non-committing cipher</a>, we introduced modifications to make it committing. Specifically, this was achieved by verifying the tag in relation to the ciphertext. For a comprehensive explanation of our approach, please refer to our paper. 
 
<p>As such, DiStefano is a DCTLS protocol that operates securely within TLS 1.3, offering formal security guarantees and ensuring client privacy. It is also highly efficient, as demonstrated through WAN experiments evaluating its performance in practical scenarios. The results indicate that runtime increases are proportional to the latency introduced, with slight deviations due to circuit preprocessing and GCM share derivation. Circuit preprocessing adds to the runtime but is an offline, amortizable cost. The derivation of GCM shares, reflecting the multi-round trip nature of the protocol, consistently takes less than a second. Even with these factors, the total online costs remain significantly lower than typical TLS handshake timeouts, which are usually configurable between 10 and 20 seconds. Additionally, the impact of increasing latency appears sublinear, suggesting that DiStefano maintains high efficiency and practicality across a variety of browsing scenarios.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>So, what else can be done? Well, DiStefano is a pretty complete protocol that gives you commitments to TLS 1.3 encrypted data, but it does not yet give you the zero-knowledge proofs over that data. Let’s explore that now.</p>

 Zero-knowledge proofs 
<p>The data transmitted over TLS can take various forms, depending on the application. Common formats include HTML for web pages and JSON for APIs, but other formats like XML, binary data, or proprietary protocols can also be transmitted securely over TLS. This means that the data we aim to prove statements about is often structured in these formats. For example, let’s examine a JSON blob containing an age field:</p>
 <code>{
&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "DiStefano Protocol",
&nbsp;&nbsp;"version": "1.0",
&nbsp;&nbsp;"description": "A DCTLS protocol over TLS 1.3.",
&nbsp;&nbsp;"age": 2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;"features": {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"security": "Proven fully secure",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"privacy": "Maintains client privacy",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"efficiency": "Highly efficient"
&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;"performance": {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"runtimeImpact": "Proportional to latency",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"gcmShareDerivationTime": "Less than a second",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"totalOnlineCost": "Below typical TLS handshake timeout"
&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;"latencyImpact": "Sublinear"
}
</code> <p>If this data is transmitted over TLS 1.3 as a Server’s response to a Client’s request, DiStefano can be used to commit to the encrypted data. Once committed, if we want to prove that the field “age” has a value greater than 1 (a proof of a statement), we need to demonstrate the following:</p>
 
 
<p>The data conforms to the JSON context-free grammar: JSON is defined by a formal context-free grammar specifying rules for objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and other components. For example, an object must consist of key-value pairs enclosed in braces {} and separated by commas. Verifying adherence to this grammar ensures the data is valid JSON.</p>
 
 
<p>The field “age” exists at the top level: In the JSON grammar, keys must be strings, and the presence of the “age” key as a direct child of the root object needs to be validated to ensure it is not nested within another object or array.</p>
 
 
<p>The value associated with “age” matches the grammar rule for integers: JSON defines numeric values, including integers and floats. We need to prove that the value of “age” satisfies the grammar rule for integers.</p>
 
 
<p>The value of “age” satisfies a semantic constraint: While grammars handle structural validity, proving that the value of “age” is greater than 1 requires an additional semantic check beyond the grammar rules.</p>
 
 
<p>We are actively working on research to address these challenges. For point 1, for example, we build on the outstanding <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1886.pdf">Reef</a> protocol, extending it to handle context-free grammars. This enables proving that committed JSON data either matches or does not match a given regular expression. For points 3 and 4, we are designing custom zero-knowledge proof systems that allow generating proofs over AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305, the two primary ciphersuites supported by TLS 1.3. Expect blog posts and papers on this soon!</p>

 Why is this useful? 
<p>Earlier in this blog post, we discussed how leveraging TLS 1.3 encrypted data to create proofs of provenance and proofs of statements can be valuable for allowing users to access additional services. However, this is just one example of its potential.</p>
<p>These types of proofs can also be useful in anti-fraud checks. For instance, a user could prove in zero-knowledge that they have an account with one of several authorized banks (without revealing which bank it is). This kind of proof could serve as a signal that the user is not a bot, enabling them to access services while preserving their privacy and preventing them from being falsely flagged as a bot. One can also use these proofs to verify “real” events by producing statements that confirm the origin and trustworthiness of data, helping to demonstrate that it was not generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, it is important to note that DCTLS protocols could become actively harmful tools for monitoring or censoring client traffic in certain applications, especially in automated systems without human involvement. We would like to emphasize that deployment of tools such as DiStefano must be considered carefully in such contexts.</p>

 Interested in trying our protocol? 
<p>If you are interested in trying our protocol, we implemented <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/distefano">a full prototype</a> of DiStefano in C++. It is built directly over BoringSSL, so it can be integrated easily over Chromium-based browsers. In fact, one of our future works is integrating this implementation directly on the Brave browser so we could leverage this protocol to detect fraud behaviour (detect bots, for example) and attest humanity without degrading usability.</p>
<p>If you are further interested in reading our research, you can read <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1063">our paper</a>. Or you can find us at the <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2025/">NDSS2025</a> Symposium, where the paper will be presented.</p>

<p>Today we are proud to unveil <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake">SILK staking</a> — an opportunity to earn meaningful yield in the form of&nbsp;SILK.</p><blockquote>Combining inflation &amp; volatility resistance with a safe yield opportunity, SILK is leveling up as the world’s most powerful stablecoin.</blockquote><p>SILK has outperformed USD by nearly 19% since April 2023. Combining this outperformance with 10%+ staking yield at launch, SILK empowers stablecoins to enter into a new era where the yield earned is meaningful.</p><blockquote>No longer are you stuck in the trap of needing to have your DeFi yields have to outpace inflation.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap">Buy SILK</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake">Stake SILK</a></blockquote><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake</a><p>Recently, we revealed our plans for <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-goes-omnichain-expanding-access-to-silk-and-secure-defi-8ad38f5dfaa9">Shade and SILK to go omnichain</a>. SILK staking is part of the first step of giving SILK a yield bearing homebase for its omnichain journey.</p><p>In addition to SILK staking, Shade Protocol will be aiming to soon launch dSILK — a liquid yield bearing version of SILK. This version of SILK will be the bedrock of the SILK economy, combining inflation resistance an earnings product all into one liquid token that be used to send / spend / trade / lend / and&nbsp;more.</p><p>In summary, dSILK and SILK staking takes SILK to the next level — unlocking the next stage of liquidity growth and adoption.</p> Staking Rewards <p>Initial SILK staking campaigns will start conservative, with plans for a larger and more aggressive roll out as we approach the launch of ShadeX — the official Shade Protocol encrypted money market. SILK staking features instant unbonding, ensuring seamless entry and exit from the savings opportunity. The initial campaign for SILK staking will go for 30 days, with additional reward campaigns to be started in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>SILK staking rewards come from interest fees charged on SILK borrowers. SILK staking serves as a growth mechanism that positively generates more of the following:</p><p>- More SILK supply<br>- More interest fees<br>- More liquidations<br>- More trading fees<br>- Higher SILK Earn yield <br>- More SILK&nbsp;buyers</p><p>You can learn more about the game theory of growing a stablecoin by listening to the video&nbsp;above.</p> Conclusion <p>In conclusion, the unveiling of SILK staking and the upcoming launch of ShadeX and dSILK mark significant milestones in Shade Protocol’s journey towards revolutionizing decentralized finance. Our push to become the most secure omnichain private DeFi is stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>Our focus on privacy, ease of use, and continuous improvement through continued iterative upgrades, Shade Protocol is not only shaping the future of DeFi but also empowering individuals to reclaim control over their finances and data. As the community eagerly anticipates the release of ShadeX and our omnichain expansion, Shade Protocol remains dedicated to its mission of building an unstoppable, decentralized financial ecosystem for&nbsp;all.</p><p>Website: <a href="http://app.shadeprotocol.io/">app.shadeprotocol.io</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p>

<p>Bitcoin’s Taproot update paved the way for a new &amp; exciting era for Bitcoin, as it expanded its use case far beyond that of an immutable ledger. However, Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens and, more recently, Runes, have limited functionality compared to what DeFi is capable of, on other smart contract blockchains. BitcoinOS envisions a revolutionary Bitcoin economy that stems from truly programmable tokens, unlocking staking, governance and many other use cases. Using BitSNARK and Grail, BitcoinOS enables Bitcoin “rollups”, which act as execution environments that use BTC as gas fee and inherit security from the L1. The missing link was always a trustless bridge between Bitcoin L1 and any potential L2. And Grail Bridge achieved just that - using zero knowledge cryptography, BTC could be transferred to other chains without relying on other custodians’ trust assumptions. In that sense, Bitcoin block #853626 is historically meaningful as it contains the first-ever onchain verification of a zero knowledge proof, on Bitcoin. A truly programmable smart contract operating system on Bitcoin was no longer a mere concept…it became a reality through BitcoinOS.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Yago's background  The effect of Trump’s election on the crypto industry  The goal behind BitcoinOS  The history of Bitcoin’s programmability  Verifying ZK proofs on Bitcoin  Taproot  Ordinals  BitSNARK, Grail bridge and Merkle Mesh  BitcoinOS modularity and sequencing  An impending (r)evolution of the industry  Bitcoin vs. Ethereum L2 landscape  Bringing Bitcoin liquidity to Cardano  BitcoinOS roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a>Edan Yago on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/BTC_OS">Bitcoin OS on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

 NymVPN stable release &amp; NYM buyback before&nbsp;launch <p>Dear friends and fellow freedom fighters,</p><p>We’re in the final push to the launch of NymVPN to the world in January 2025! But now’s no time for publicity, just hard facts and tasks. Getting to launch means hitting crucial milestones, and testers and stakers play a big part in the&nbsp;success.</p><p>November marked the first milestone with the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-v2024-11-is-here-6186d49e3c8d">stable release of NymVPN</a>. This update improves network security and stability for users, but also lays the foundation for user payments being unlinkable to their use of the&nbsp;app.</p><p>The Nym network has had a major upgrade with the Magura release resulting in measurable improvements to reliability. The release begins the process of culling outdated nodes and ensuring equitable rewarding.</p><p>In preparation for launch, staking on nodes is crucial for the health of the network. So if you’re wondering which nodes you should stake, here’s a <a href="https://explorer.nym.spectredao.net/account/n1rnxpdpx3kldygsklfft0gech7fhfcux4zst5lw">list of top performing Nym nodes</a> who are currently in the official Nym Delegations Program. Staking NYM on them will go a long way to improving network performance while also ensuring a good&nbsp;APY.</p><p>To bootstrap the Nym treasury and improve network performance ahead of launch, Nym is conducting a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-buyback-33e3ec88c4dc">token buyback</a> of $1 million USD in NYM. As payments for NymVPN begin to roll in, there will be a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-token-flow-powering-the-worlds-most-private-network-48c15db379c5">perpetual NYM buyback</a> organically linked to the demand for and usage of the app. The goal of Nym tokenomics is two-fold: the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-v2024-11-is-here-6186d49e3c8d">value of NYM</a> will be linked to paid usage of the app, and the increase of users will improve the privacy of&nbsp;all.</p><p>The next major NymVPN release is scheduled for December to introduce zk-nym credentials and beta payments. With this coming release, the full infrastructure of NymVPN will be in place before being rigorously tested for launch over the holidays. Want to help the team prepare for it?

Great products, afterall, are built in phases. NymVPN 2024.11 includes:</p>  Improved user experience: A streamlined sign-up / sign-in flow allows your single anonymous access code to be used to connect up to 10&nbsp;devices.  Anonymous access: The revamped login system prepares the way for zk-nyms which will allow you to pay for NymVPN without ever being linked to your use of the&nbsp;app.  Security updates and bug fixes: General improvements make for better app performance and security following an external security&nbsp;audit.  Improved connectivity: A new state machine significantly enhances the stability of network connections.  <p>This app version is currently compatible with <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/macos">MacOS</a>, <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/linux">Linux</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nymvpn-fast-secure-vpn/id6471254143">iOS</a>. Versions for Android and Windows will soon follow, so stay in touch on socials for announcements!</p><p>Remember, NymVPN Beta is still free for everyone to test until launch in January 2025, so <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">get your anonymous access code&nbsp;today</a>!</p> NymVPN marketing <p>The Nym marketing team is gearing up for the January launch campaign. Discussions with privacy-focused tech companies and blockchains are in the works, and an affiliate marketing campaign to get NymVPN before the eyes of over 10 millions of eyes worldwide in January is well underway. Expect a big marketing push as the New Year arrives when the app is ready for the general&nbsp;public.</p> Nym rebrand <p>The Nym rebrand is in its final stages, and there are big things on the stove for the New Year! At the beginning of January, you can look forward to some treats: a new visual identity for Nym, a freshly stylized experience of the NymVPN app, and a unified nym.com domain! Look out for Nym’s New Year’s Resolutions for a sneak&nbsp;peak!</p> The Nym&nbsp;network  Magura network&nbsp;update <p>November’s Magura network release improves the reliability of the Nym network and updates Nym tokenomics. And the results are noticeable already with measurable improvements on reliability.</p><p>The Magura release includes the roll-out of “naive rewarding” as an interim step in the token economics powering the network before it goes to fully paid access. And it includes the completion of project smoosh, combining gateway and mixnode functionality into a single Nym node&nbsp;binary.</p> Staking <p>The Magura update has also begun the process of culling non-performing and outdated nodes. As a staker, you should now check your nodes to make sure they are still eligible for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>When in doubt, stake on Nym nodes that are in the official Delegations Program (DP) because they are required to meet the latest requirements! You can find the DP program wallet and list of top quality nodes&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/account/n1rnxpdpx3kldygsklfft0gech7fhfcux4zst5lw">here</a>.</p> Explorer <p>In the wake of Magura, Nym explorers are getting a major revamp. The official Nym network explorer remains <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">here</a>. The explorer currently shows both upgraded Nym nodes as well as legacy gateways and mixnodes to enable a smooth transition to the revamped&nbsp;network.</p><p>Operators and stakers can look forward to an Explorer V2 launching very soon with additional staking and operator features!</p> Important changes for operators <p>Magura includes five main changes that operators need to be aware&nbsp;of:</p>  NYM reward pool is now distributed across 5 layers of nodes to include entry and exit gateways as well as three layers of mix&nbsp;nodes.  Nym nodes are now multi-functional. Operators now simply run a Nym node and then enable gateway and mix node&nbsp;modes.  Project smoosh is complete. This means that operators simply run Nym nodes and the mixnet contract now only “sees” Nym nodes. Operators will have to run up to date software to be included in the active set and gateways will have to get stake for the first time in order to be selected to the active&nbsp;set.  Node selection algorithm now includes a configuration score to determine if a node is included in the active set: Selection = config score * total stake * performance ^ 20. This is to cull any outdated nodes from the set and make sure the network is running up to date software.  Operators now must agree to operator <a href="https://nymtech.net/terms-and-conditions/operators/v1.0.0">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> to confirm legally that you do not gather logs on&nbsp;users.

<p>Ever felt like the internet is spying on you? You searched for a pair of shoes, and suddenly every ad was for a sneaker. That’s targeted advertising, but that’s not what this post is entirely&nbsp;about.</p><p>In early November, the South Korean Personal Information Protection Commission levied a $15 million fine on Meta for illicitly collecting and sharing sensitive user data. The four-year investigation revealed that the tech giant had gathered personal information, including political views, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs, from approximately 980,000 Facebook users without explicit consent. This data was subsequently shared with over 4,000 advertisers.</p><p>While the Meta scandal highlights the pervasive nature of digital surveillance, it’s important to recognize that financial privacy is also under threat. Traditional banking systems, though seemingly private, are subject to extensive regulatory oversight. Every transaction, no matter how small, is recorded and can be accessed by <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/government-surveillance-drives-encrypted-messaging-app-dev-out-of-australia-7c94a5d56c32">government agencies</a>. This level of surveillance raises questions about the extent to which financial privacy can truly be protected in the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</p> The Data&nbsp;Economy <p>The digital economy thrives on data. User data is the lifeblood of many tech companies, enabling them to personalize ads, recommend products, and refine their services. However, this data-driven approach raises serious privacy implications. When personal information is collected and analyzed without explicit consent, it can lead to targeted advertising, identity theft, and even social manipulation.</p><p>In the financial space, cyberattacks and data breaches are on the rise, exposing sensitive financial information to malicious actors. To put things in perspective, a staggering 75% of financial services organizations have fallen victim to at least one data breach in the past five years. It is also an open secret that governments may use data collected by financial institutions to monitor citizens’ economic activities.</p> Cryptocurrency: A Double-Edged Sword <p>Cryptocurrencies, often touted as a bastion of financial privacy, are not immune to surveillance. While legacy blockchain technology offers a transparent and immutable ledger, it also exposes transaction data to public scrutiny. Although pseudonymous, blockchain analysis tools can be used to track the flow of funds and identify individuals behind certain transactions.</p><p>This is where privacy coins like PIVX and others shine. PIVX, in particular, stands out as a leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency, offering a comprehensive suite of privacy features such as zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>In an era where personal information is constantly being collected and analyzed, these cryptocurrencies offer a much-needed solution for individuals seeking to maintain control over their online presence.</p><p>PIVX.

 Stable release prepares the way to full&nbsp;launch <p>The latest stable version of NymVPN v2024.11 is now released for MacOS, Linux, and iOS, with Android to be available early next&nbsp;week.</p><p>This app release follows last week’s major Magura network update and improves app performance, security, and connectivity. This is a big technical boost ahead of the launch of zk-nyms &amp; beta payments in December 2024 and the full commercial launch of NymVPN in January&nbsp;2025.</p><p>NymVPN v2024.11 includes a streamlined log in flow and major network security&nbsp;fixes.</p> Compatibility <p>NymVPN v2024.11 is currently released&nbsp;for:</p>  MacOS  Linux  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nymvpn-fast-secure-vpn/id6471254143">iOS</a> (currently not yet available in Apple Store France, but can be <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/0vmRJNrL">downloaded here</a>)  <p>The Android release will follow early next week once bugs are properly addressed.</p> Magura network&nbsp;release <p>The Nym network underwent a significant upgrade last week to prepare for NymVPN v2024.11. This includes some breaking changes for operators. But most important for NymVPN users is that now all Nym nodes are configured to function as both mix nodes and gateways for clients and to receive equal rewards. <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-virtuous-token-cycle-next-step-magura-fc5eb3fd2941">Read more</a> on what this means for the Nym tokenomics powering the privacy network at the foundation of&nbsp;NymVPN.</p> Account sign-up / sign-in&nbsp;flow <p>There is now a new, streamlined system for signing up for NymVPN and logging into the app from multiple&nbsp;devices.</p>  Create account on the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">nymvpn.com</a> with a recovery phrase, and make sure to securely save&nbsp;it!  Use your recovery phrase to log into NymVPN on MacOS, Linux, mobile Android (coming next week), or iOS. Windows will be coming next&nbsp;month  You can then add (up to 10) additional devices by logging in with the same recovery&nbsp;phrase  <p>* Note that fair usage is now enforced from the centralized API based on the anonymous credential. Users can view their account plan fair usage&nbsp;summary.</p> Fixes following security&nbsp;audit <p>Since the July security audit conducted by Cure 53, the Nym team has been working on addressing all the identified bugs and network leaks identified in the report. This release addresses issues related to the authentication with gateways (STS) and session key generation. The Nym SDK has been upgraded to fix these issues in the NymVPN&nbsp;app.</p><p>Stay tuned for a full report on these fixes in the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/trust-center">Nym Trust&nbsp;Center</a>.</p> State Machine <p>A state machine is an important VPN component for maintaining reliable network connections. State machines have now been integrated into WireGuard, daemon, VPNlib, and account controller. This will lead to a more seamless user experience in switching between NymVPN modes and connecting with gateways.</p> Next stop: zk-nyms, beta payments, and plugging all&nbsp;leaks <p>The next release of NymVPN is scheduled for 10–15 December 2024 and will introduce beta payments with zk-nyms for fully unlinkable traffic through NymVPN, as well as major leak&nbsp;fixes.</p> zk-nyms issuance and&nbsp;sending <p>Zk-nyms are the foundation of anonymous access with NymVPN: they ensure that you can pay for access to the Nym network with full anonymity, even from Nym&nbsp;itself!</p><p>When you pay for a traditional, centralized VPN service, your usage of the app, and even your traffic records if they are kept, can be directly linked to your identity through your payment&nbsp;records.</p><p>Nym’s novel solution is a zero-knowledge access credential, whose issuance system is currently being piloted into the NymVPN app. Keep in mind that the real value of zk-nyms comes with unlinking your payment records for your usage of the networks. This means that when NymVPN payments go live next month, users can rest assured that their personal information won’t be compromised.</p> DNS and IPv6&nbsp;leaks <p>Currently, all leaks while connected with NymVPN are fixed. The Nym dev team is continuing its work in plugging all leaks that occur prior to connecting with the NymVPN app. Nym remains committed to not releasing a full commercial version of the app until all these risks are fully addressed.</p><p>Remember, the success of NymVPN depends a lot on our dedicated community of testers.

If you’re excited about the next generation of the internet, check out the show: <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/hrr_h-XC">https://link.chtbl.com/hrr_h-XC</a></p><p>We've heard a lot about the premise and the promise of prediction markets for a long time, but they finally hit the main stage with the most recent election. So what worked (and didn't) this time? Are they really better than pollsters, is polling dead?&nbsp;</p><p>So in this conversation, we tease apart the hype from the reality of prediction markets, from the recent election to market foundations... going more deeply into the how, why, and where these markets work. We also discuss the design challenges and opportunities (including implications for builders throughout). And we also cover other information aggregation mechanisms -- from peer prediction to others -- given that prediction markets are part of a broader category of information-elicitation and information-aggregation mechanisms.&nbsp;<br><br>Where do domain experts, superforecasters, pollsters, and journalists come in (and out)? Where do (and don't) blockchain and crypto technologies come in -- and what specific features (decentralization, transparency, real-time, open source, etc.) matter most, and in what contexts?&nbsp; Finally, we discuss applications for prediction and decision markets -- things we could do right away to in the near-future to sci-fi -- touching on trends like futarchy, AI entering the market, DeSci, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our special expert guests are Alex Taborrok, professor of economics at George Mason University and Chair in Economics at the Mercatus Center; and Scott Duke Kominers, research partner at a16z crypto, and professor at Harvard Business School&nbsp; -- both in conversation with Sonal Chokshi.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder: None of the following should be taken as business, investment, legal, or tax advice; please see a16z.com/disclosures for more important information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:<br>(from links to research mentioned to more on the topics discussed)</p>  <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html">The Use of Knowledge in Society</a> by Friedrich Hayek (American Economic Review, 1945)  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eberem/everything_is_priced_in/">Everything is priced in</a> by rsd99 (r/wallstreetbets, 2019)  <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/ideafutures.html">Idea Futures (aka prediction markets, information markets)</a> by Robin Hanson (1996)  <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/auctions/paper">Auctions: The Social Construction of Value</a>&nbsp; by Charles Smith  <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~qc2/BA532/2002%20AER%20Morris%20and%20Shin.pdf">Social value of public information</a> by Stephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin (American Economic Review, December 2002)  <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1516179112">Using prediction markets to estimate the reproducibility of scientific research</a> by Anna Dreber, Thomas Pfeiffer, Johan Almenberg, Siri Isaksson, Brad Wilson, Yiling Chen, Brian Nosek, and Magnus Johannesson (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (November 2015)  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21054">A solution to the single-question crowd wisdom problem</a> by Dražen Prelec, Sebastian Seung, and John McCoy (Nature, January 2017)  <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/Targeting_Entrepreneurs_AER2022_64933cef-316a-437f-8ca4-885d870b2ba1.pdf">Targeting high ability entrepreneurs using community information: Mechanism design in the field</a> by Reshmaan Hussam, Natalia Rigol, and Benjamin Roth (American Economic Review, March 2022)  <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall12/papers/ms020408.pdf">Information aggregation mechanisms: concept, design, and implementation for a sales forecasting problem</a> by Charles Plott and Kay-Yut Chen, Hewlett Packard Laboratories (March 2002)  <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/if-i-had-a-millhtml">If I had a million</a> [on deciding to dump the CEO or not] by Robin Hanson (2008)  <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html">Futarchy: Vote values, but bet beliefs</a> by Robin Hanson (2013)  <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/11/09/infofinance.html">From prediction markets to info finance</a> by Vitalik Buterin (November 2024)  <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/">Composability is innovation</a> by Linda Xie (June 2021)  <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/composability-is-to-software-as-compounding-interest-is-to-finance/">Composability is to software as compounding interest is to finance</a> by Chris Dixon (October 2021)  <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/daos/">resources &amp; research on DAOs</a>, a16z crypto  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you think: <a href="https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z">https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

It is the first basket currency utilizing Curve products with more to&nbsp;come.   Holding vYIELD gives exposure to scrvUSD (and its yield) and VRSC equally (50/50%). Generated conversion fees are also added to the reserves.  <a href="https://news.curve.fi/introducing-scrvusd/">Savings crvUSD</a> (scrvUSD) is a decentralized interest-bearing stablecoin that earns yield simply by holding the currency.

After its launch vYIELD, VRSC and scrvUSD can be converted freely with each other through the vYIELD’s AMM (automated market maker) function.  Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant with low conversion fees (max. 0.05%.)<a href="http://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency">docs.verus.io</a>  vYIELD’s initial supply is 100,000. After the preconversion period has ended the supply is distributed to the users that preconverted. After that the supply becomes dynamic (burning vYIELD when converting back to VRSC or scrvUSD, and minting vYIELD when depositing VRSC or scrvUSD into its reserves.)  Preconversion is possible until 5 December 2024.

  Centered on on-chain growth, BAT Roadmap 3.0 introduces disintermediation, expanded blockchain integrations, and a creator growth program to elevate BAT utility across Web3 and beyond.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The focus for BAT Roadmap 3.0 is on-chain growth. Within the Brave Rewards and Brave Creators ecosystems, this means disintermediating the way BAT flows through the platform, expanding self-custody options for payments and contributions, and providing users with new avenues to earn and utilize BAT. Beyond Brave, our focus will be to promote BAT growth and adoption in the broader attention economy, across all blockchains that can support BAT. This means providing even more opportunities for projects, dApps, and creators to integrate BAT utility and grow with the Brave and BAT userbase.</p>
<p>Useful <a>roadmaps</a> provide general direction, while also being flexible enough to anticipate unforeseen challenges. As we iterate and find market fit, it is expected that some roadmap items may become less of a focus over time, while others are emphasized.</p>

 BAT in Brave Rewards 
<p>In line with BAT Roadmap 3.0, we aim to release Brave Rewards 3.0 in the first quarter of 2025, an upgraded Brave Rewards experience.</p>
<p>With Brave Rewards 3.0, we aim to include:</p>

 New ways to earn rewards 
 
 Draws where users can receive larger BAT amounts, earnings multipliers, and other bonuses 
 Rewards for completing on-chain quests 
 Rewards for completing surveys 
 

 New self-custody options 
<p>Expand self-custody payout options to support a wider range of blockchains and Layer 2 networks.</p>

 Redesign and UX overhaul&nbsp; 
<p>Rewards 3.0 will include a totally refreshed design and user experience. This new design implements a modular framework, making it easier to:</p>
 
 Showcase BAT utility cases (dApps, shopping, etc.) 
 Compose new Brave Ads experiences and earning opportunities 
 Integrate Pay with BAT where appropriate within Rewards UX 
 Improve Brave Creators discovery and better connect users with creators 
 

 Rewards Offer Wall 
 
 Introduce a new Rewards Offer Wall with exclusive benefits for Brave Rewards users. The Offer Wall will include a combination of both dynamic, locally-matched offers, and persistent partner deals.&nbsp; 
 Integrate the Brave Ads system to work in tandem with the Offer Wall. For example, use Brave Ads’s local machine learning algorithms to show notifications whenever an offer on the Offer Wall is particularly relevant to a user, is unlocked, or in response to a series of actions the user takes. 
 

 Disintermediation 
 
 Continue to develop and publish work on <a>Boomerang</a>, our decentralized, privacy-preserving, and verifiable incentive protocol 
 Find and work with blockchains and smart contract platforms that can support the implementation of Boomerang’s smart contracts&nbsp; 
 

 BAT in E-commerce 
 
 Pay with BAT for Brave Products like <a>Brave Premium</a> (Brave VPN, Talk, Leo, etc.) 
 Pay with BAT for <a href="https://store.brave.com">Brave Merch Store</a> items 
 Add support for BAT on major crypto payment rails 
 

 BAT in Brave Creators 

 Expand supported platforms 
 
 Significantly increase the number of social platforms available for creators to register their accounts/channels with Brave Creators, including Rumble, Odyssey, and more. This allows creators to collect BAT and other on-chain crypto contributions across a wider range of platforms. 
 Partner with Web3 creator platforms to integrate BAT support, along with other utility incentives. 
 

 Expand blockchain and Layer 2 support for contributions 
 
 Enable creators to link on-chain addresses from more blockchains and Layer 2 networks to their sites and channels, particularly those that support BAT. 
 Add support for Web3 domain names. 
 

 On-chain subscriptions 
<p>Allow users to set up scheduled, on-chain subscriptions to Brave creators.</p>

 Creator Growth Program

<p>Bootstrapping and maintaining a validator set can be a challenging endeavour, especially for projects that are in search of a product market fit. However, this does not mean one should abandon the ethos of decentralisation in favour of a more streamlined centralised approach. The notion of shared security had been previously explored in the Cosmos ecosystem, but Symbiotic takes it a step further, making it readily available for any project, regardless of its native blockchain, through restaking. Symbiotic is a modular coordination layer that sources node operators and economic security in a maximally capital-efficient manner.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Misha’s background  Symbiotic’s origin story  How Symbiotic tackles decentralisation  The role of restaking in proof-of-stake models  The economics of restaking  The architecture of Symbiotic  Liquid restaking tokens (LRT)  Expanding restaking beyond Ethereum  Slashing  Symbiotic smart contract immutability and future updates  Ecosystem development  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/Psalom">Misha Putiatin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/symbioticfi">Symbiotic on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the upcoming <a href="https://zfnd.org/zconvi/">ZconVI</a>, a virtual gathering of Zcash enthusiasts and experts, scheduled to take place from Tuesday, March 4 to Friday, March 7, 2025. This four-day event promises to be an engaging platform for learning, collaboration, and innovation within the Zcash community.</p>



 Event Overview 



<p>ZconVI will be a fully virtual event, allowing participants from around the globe to join without the constraints of travel. The event will showcase how we can achieve Synergy Through Decentralization, highlighting the collaborative efforts of multiple organizations in planning and executing the event content. However, it is important to note that the sessions themselves are not restricted by any specific theme, providing a broad canvas for diverse topics and discussions.</p>



 Collaborative Approach 



<p>The conference structure is designed to foster collaboration among key organizations within the Zcash ecosystem:</p>



 
 Day 1 (Tuesday, March 4): Zcash Foundation (ZF) will curate the content, setting the tone for the conference with insightful sessions and discussions. 



 Day 2 (Wednesday, March 5): Electric Coin Company (ECC) will take charge of planning, bringing their expertise and vision to the forefront. 



 Day 3 (Thursday, March 6): Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) will organize the day’s content. Notably, they are encouraged to explore topics beyond their direct funding activities. 



 Day 4 (Friday, March 7): ZecHub will conclude the event with a day filled with innovative ideas and community-driven discussions. 
 



<p>Each day will feature a co-curated panel session. These panels are a collaborative effort among all partner organizations.</p>



<p>ZF is proud to continue to support <a href="https://www.zkav.club/">Zk AV Club</a> by awarding them a grant for ZconVI. Zk AV Club, under Ryan Taylor’s leadership, will have complete creative freedom to empower communities and amplify their individual voices. For each day of ZconVI, alongside the official event programming, Zk AV Club will be hosting an interactive live podcast. ZF will be working with a separate production company to livestream the event, which will further free up Zk AV Club’s time so they can do what they do best!&nbsp;</p>



 Logistics and Coordination 



<p>Zcash Foundation will handle all logistical aspects of ZconVI. This includes managing audiovisual needs, registration processes, attendee communication, graphic design for event materials, and more. The Foundation will again utilize the well-received Whova platform, and update the app to maximize opportunities for community engagement throughout the conference.</p>



<p>Each participating organization will have a liaison working closely with the Foundation to ensure that all necessary information for their planned sessions is communicated effectively.</p>



 Request for Proposals 



<p>ZconVI is set to be an unmissable event for anyone interested in the future of privacy technology and decentralized systems. Contribute to the diverse lineup of sessions and panels curated by leading organizations in the Zcash ecosystem. We invite you to <a href="https://forms.gle/Q74f38ZDYwky2ogD6">submit an RFP</a> outlining how your presentation will move a project, conversation or idea forward for the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



 Stay Tuned 



<p>Don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking virtual conference as we explore the synergy of decentralization! Attendee registration will open in February 2025 and be free of charge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please check <a href="https://zfnd.org/zconvi/">Zcash Foundation’s website</a> for answers to frequently asked questions and ongoing updates. Additionally, we will post updates on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/">Zcash Forum</a> and <a href="http://@zcashfoundation">Twitter/X</a> as planning progresses.</p>

 Magura network update and readying latest release of&nbsp;NymVPN <p>Nym’s major network update (Magura) went live last Tuesday, setting the stage for what will become a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-virtuous-token-cycle-next-step-magura-fc5eb3fd2941">novel form of Nym tokenomics</a>. With payments live, usage of NymVPN will be linked with NYM buy-orders which in turn will be rewarded to Nym node operators providing privacy protections for&nbsp;users.</p><p>After some delays as a result of network instability following the Magura release, the release of the latest NymVPN app is now scheduled for next&nbsp;week.</p><p>Below is everything you need to know about these two important releases. Here’s the full <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/nymvpn-roadmap-through-2024">timeline</a> for NymVPN finishing out 2024. Don’t forget, this is all in lead up to the two big&nbsp;things:</p>  December 2024: Early bird access to the robust NymVPN app with payments!  January 2025: The official launch of NymVPN to the world, at a symbolic time when it needs a real paradigm shift in online&nbsp;privacy  <p>Remember, NymVPN Beta is still open and free to use, so <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">sign up today</a> and instantly receive a free 30-day access voucher. Nym needs your testing, testing,&nbsp;testing!</p> Network <p>The Nym network underwent a major update with the release of Magura v2024.13. This release prepares the network for the latest stable release of NymVPN next week as well as the foundational tokenomics for node operators.</p> What changes with&nbsp;Magura?   Operation smoosh is complete: Now all Nym nodes will function as both mix nodes and entry/exit gateways.  Rewards distribution: Rewards will be distributed equally across all three layers: entry gateways, mix nodes, and exit gateways.  Removing under-performing nodes: Nodes are now required to run the latest Nym binaries and to agree to the node <a href="https://nymtech.net/terms-and-conditions/operators/v1.0.0">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> committing importantly to <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/nyms-zero-knowledge-network">no-log’s policies</a>. This will increase the overall performance of the Nym network for clients. Nodes not meeting these conditions will not be eligible to be part of the active&nbsp;set.  <p>Read about all the changes to <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-virtuous-token-cycle-next-step-magura-fc5eb3fd2941">Nym operator tokenomics here</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3G1pJqvO2VM?si=9QBbkfldnycyD0_C">watch the recent Node Operator Town Hall</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> Patch for mainnet instability <p>While the Magura release worked stably in sandbox, the mainnet release led to some unexpected network instability. The dev team has now worked through the issues and released a Magura patch today which should begin to stabilize connectivity once&nbsp;again.</p><p>Huge thanks to the operator community for being active and responsive!</p> Note for NYM&nbsp;stakers <p>If you’re staking on Nym nodes, please stay tuned for guidance next week on restaking your tokens following this week’s network&nbsp;changes.</p> Changes to explorers <p>The release of Magura means that current explorers will soon be replaced. For the time being, please refer to <a href="https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/">harbourmaster</a> for node and network information.</p> NymVPN  NymVPN v2024.11 coming next&nbsp;week <p>Due to the network issues following the Magura release, the latest stable release of the NymVPN app, originally scheduled for Nov. 21, has been postponed until next week while the dev team implements needed fixes. Nym remains committed to delivering the highest quality technology to our community.</p><p>This delay will not affect the next release and launch of payments on 12 December 2024 as&nbsp;promised</p> What to expect from NymVPN&nbsp;v2024.11 <p>Here are some of the important things to expect from the latest NymVPN&nbsp;release:</p>  A streamlined sign-up/sign-in flow  Network and connection stability thanks to state machine implementations across&nbsp;apps  The launch of the zk-nym credential system ahead of payments in&nbsp;December  Security fixes as a result of the July 2024 security&nbsp;audit  <p>Stay tuned for the NymVPN v2024.11 release announcement next week for compatible devices and confirmed changes.</p><p>Until next week comrades!

<p>November 21, 2024 — Today, we’re excited to announce the latest addition to Brave Search: chat mode for Answer with AI. This new feature offers the option to ask follow-up questions from the basis of an initial query to Brave Search.</p>
<p>It’s available today for all <a href="https://search.brave.com">Brave Search</a> users around the world.</p>

 Building on the foundation of “Answer with AI” 
<p><a>Earlier this year</a>, we introduced “Answer with AI” in Brave Search, becoming the only large-scale, real-time answer engine focused on privacy and free from Big Tech dependencies. Since its launch, usage has surged, with “Answer with AI” now generating more than 11 million answers daily. These AI-powered summaries appear at the top of the search results page whenever a question-like query is detected, offering users quick, concise information.</p>

    
    Your browser does not support the video tag.

<p>Question-like queries deliver helpful summaries sourcing information from across the Web.</p>

 Combining the best of both worlds 
<p>As generative AI and chat interfaces become increasingly popular, we’ve observed that users rely on different tools for different needs:</p>
 
 
<p>Search engines excel at scouring the web to retrieve images, links, and information based on a single query. However, they’re limited in allowing follow-up questions or maintaining context, so each new query essentially starts from scratch.</p>
 
 
<p>Chat applications, by contrast, facilitate conversational interactions, which are great for exploring topics through related questions and maintaining context. However, they’re not optimized for broad web searches; getting relevant search-like results often requires toggling a setting or crafting the query in a particular way.</p>
 
 
<p>Brave Search bridges this gap by adapting the experience based on the nature of each query, eliminating the need for users to choose between chat-first or search-first approaches. Starting today, when a query is recognized as a question, Brave Search provides a summary with a chat bar (answers can also be triggered manually by clicking the AI icon to the right of the search magnifying glass icon). Engaging with this chat bar opens a chat experience, allowing users to explore the topic in more depth.</p>
<p>This experience is powered by a combination of open and internal LLMs, plus Brave Search results. This allows Brave Search to ground responses in real-time search results, significantly reducing the chance of AI hallucinations.</p>

    
    Your browser does not support the video tag.

<p>Asking a follow up question expands the initial answer into a chat experience, offering sources along the way to highlight the origin of the information surfaced with each new question.</p>
<p>Side-by-side, it’s clear how Brave Search offers the best of both worlds, whether the user starts with search-like or chat-like query:</p>
<p>Brave vs. Google on a traditional search query</p>


    
    


    



      
      
    
<p>Brave vs. ChatGPT on a complex chat query</p>

<p>Here’s how Brave Search compares to leading search and chat assistants that are broadly-available today:</p>

<p>*Chats are ephemeral by default and expire within six hours. An option to save chats to Brave’s Leo AI assistant is coming soon.</p>

 Privacy by default 
<p>The new chat feature has all the same privacy protections of Brave Search and its Answer with AI feature. Brave Search does not profile you or store your queries. The same is true when using chat mode in Answer with AI: these conversations are ephemeral, meaning they’re not persisted or stored. Your conversations with Answer with AI remain safe and private.</p>

 How to try it 
<p>All Brave Search users, regardless of what browser they’re using to access the Web, can take advantage of the new chat feature.</p>
<p>If Brave Search is already <a href="https://search.brave.com">set as your browser’s default search engine</a>, simply start typing in your browser’s address bar. If Brave Search isn’t your default search, you can visit <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a> in any browser. Once you enter a query, you’ll see an Answer with AI summary right at the top of the results page for most queries. From here you can simply ask a follow-up question.</p>
<p>And while we strive to offer follow-up chat to everyone for free, reasonable usage limits apply.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 About Brave Search 
<p>Brave Search is the fastest growing independent search engine since Bing. Unlike <a>Big Tech</a> search engines, Brave Search does not profile its users; unlike supposedly alternative engines, Brave Search serves results from a truly independent index of the Web. This means Brave Search can offer both industry-leading privacy and an effective counter to the bias and censorship prevalent in Big Tech’s personalization.</p>
<p>Brave Search continues to reach new all-time highs, serving more than 36 million queries per day (and more than 1 billion queries each month). It’s the default search engine for most new <a>Brave browser</a> users, which now has over 70 million users worldwide.</p>
