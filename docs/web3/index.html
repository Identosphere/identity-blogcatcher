<p>Some people might call Jonathon Keats an artist, but he calls himself an experimental philosopher. His body of work explores the way that human life intersects with political and economic systems. His first major work, in the year 2000, involved sitting in a chair thinking for hours, and then selling his thoughts to patrons at prices calculated on the basis of their income. He once copyrighted his own mind as a sculpture. He created a ringtone based on John Cage’s famous piece, 4’33”, which is four minutes and thirty-three seconds of complete silence. He built a pinhole camera that takes photographic exposures lasting 100 years. In Berkeley, California, he built a temple for the worship of science. Recently, he has been involved in efforts to formalize rights of nature.&nbsp;</p><p>Jonathon challenges us to look carefully at the assumptions built into our markets, our democracies and our technologies, and constantly seems to do it in ways that seem abstract at the time, but end up prefiguring political or cultural issues years or decades before they erupt. He’s a wonderful guide to this territory, and to the big questions it involves.&nbsp;</p><p>In this conversation Matt and Jonathon discuss the philosophy of timekeeping. They consider the connectedness and the alienation of being on universal atomic time, the promise of alternative systems such as the river clock, and how different notions of timekeeping influence our understanding of democracy and nature.</p><p>Jonathon Keats is an experimental philosopher, artist and writer. He is currently a fellow at the Berggruen Institute, a research fellow at the Long Now Foundation, a research associate at the University of Arizona, principal philosopher at Earth Law Center and an artist-in-residence at Hyundai, the SETI Institute and Flux Projects. His most recent book is “You Belong to the Universe: Buckminster Fuller and the Future” (Oxford University Press).</p><p>Mentioned:</p>  <a href="https://alaskarivertime.org/About">Alaska RiverTime</a>  <p>If you have feedback or ideas for future episodes, email us at <a href="mailto:info@radicalxchange.org">info@radicalxchange.org</a>.</p><p>Host: Matt Prewitt</p><p>Guest: Jonathan Keats</p><p>Producer: Jack Henderson</p>

 PIVX Weekly Pulse (May 9th, 2025 — May 15th,&nbsp;2025) <p>Keep up with PIVX! Get your weekly dose of key market insights and community updates.</p> Market Pulse   Masternode Count: Demonstrating continued network strength, the number of active PIVX masternodes has risen to 2,123, up from last week’s&nbsp;2,117.    Price Check: While the Daily USD Value showed a period of consolidation this past week, with values holding steady between $0.16 and $0.18, the overall narrative remains encouraging. This week’s average price of $0.1758 represents a tangible step forward from the $0.1694 recorded in the preceding week. The upward trajectory, even amidst daily stability, likely reflects the unwavering commitment of the PIVX community and the tailwinds of a generally bullish cryptocurrency market providing a supportive environment.  v  Trading Buzz: The total weekly trading volume for PIVX witnessed a significant pullback this week, registering at approximately $16.5 million, a stark contrast to the previous week’s $40 million. Nevertheless, the daily trading volume maintained a healthy pace, consistently exceeding $2&nbsp;million.  <p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>One of the early selling points of cryptocurrencies was a promise of a new era of financial freedom and control. Ironically, most blockchain transactions remain completely public by design. Your wallet activities and spending patterns are exposed for anyone curious enough to&nbsp;look.</p><p>Privacy protocols emerged as the solution to this transparency problem. They create a protective shield around your financial activities, preserving your right to privacy. Join me as I explore the ABC of privacy protocols.</p> Why Privacy&nbsp;Matters <p>Know-Your-Customer (KYC) isn’t exactly a bad thing. As a matter of fact, you may not appreciate the value of KYC until your funds are stolen and recovered. However, given our increasingly connected world with massive digital footprints, you never know who is watching.</p><p>Individuals publicly associated with cryptocurrency are frequent targets for attackers, and tragically, their family members can also be at risk. Here are some chilling incidents to jolt your interest:</p>  Dad Kidnapped for Ransom: Imagine your dad snatched in broad daylight! That’s what happened to the father of a wealthy French crypto holder in Paris this May. The brutal twist? Kidnappers cut off one of his fingers to force compliance with their multi-million-euro Bitcoin ransom demand. Five suspects were caught, but the sheer audacity and violence highlight the real-world dangers of being a known crypto asset&nbsp;holder.  Ledger Co-Founder Tortured for Crypto Keys: In January 2025, David Balland, a co-founder of the massive crypto wallet firm Ledger, his wife, and a former colleague were victims of a home invasion. Balland himself was kidnapped, and in a horrifying act, his finger was severed to coerce him into revealing crypto wallet credentials. The gang even contacted another Ledger co-founder for&nbsp;ransom.  Teenage Crypto Heist Turns Violent Kidnapping: Three teenagers, emboldened by the allure of digital wealth, lured a crypto event host in Las Vegas in November 2024, kidnapped him at gunpoint from his own home, and drove him into the desert. They then proceeded to drain a staggering $4 million in crypto and&nbsp;NFTs.  <p>Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies expose your transactions to public view. Your wallet address functions like a public record that anyone can monitor. Over time, repeated transactions create patterns that can link back to your real identity.</p><p>Data analytics companies track these patterns to profile your spending habits. Government agencies might monitor your financial activities and wealth accumulation. Even your business competitors could gain insights into your deals and strategies. Privacy isn’t just a nice feature to have in this environment — it is essential for genuine financial independence and security.</p> Basic Types of Privacy Protocols <p>1. Stealth Addresses</p><p>Think of stealth addresses as burner phones for your crypto transactions. They generate unique, one-time addresses for each transaction you receive. Even if someone knows your main public address, they cannot connect it to these temporary addresses. Your complete transaction history remains private and compartmentalized. Monero incorporates this technique as one of its core privacy features.</p><p>2. Ring Signatures</p><p>Ring signatures cleverly mix your transaction with others to create ambiguity about the source. Imagine placing your signed check in a stack with several others of the same amount. An observer would see that a valid check exists, but couldn’t determine which person wrote it. When someone attempts to trace your transaction, they encounter multiple possible senders instead of just you. Your true identity blends into this carefully constructed group.</p><p>3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs</p><p>These sophisticated protocols work like mathematical magic tricks. They allow you to prove you know something without revealing what that thing is. In cryptocurrency transactions, you can verify you have sufficient funds without displaying your actual balance. You can confirm a transaction’s validity without exposing any sensitive details. Zcash built its privacy features around this technology, with PIVX implementing several bespoke upgrades.</p><p>4. Confidential Transactions</p><p>These specialized protocols conceal the amount being transferred while maintaining verifiable transactions. Observers can confirm that a valid exchange occurred but cannot see how much money changed hands. This prevents outsiders from analyzing your spending amounts or patterns. Cryptocurrencies like Grin and Beam implement this approach as a central&nbsp;feature.</p><p>5. Coin Mixing/Tumbling</p><p>Mixing services combine your coins with those from other users. They shuffle everything thoroughly and return different coins of equivalent value to each participant. This process resembles putting your marked dollar bills in a hat with others, mixing them thoroughly, and having everyone draw the same amount they contributed. CoinJoin protocols operate on this principle to break transaction trails.</p> Major Privacy Cryptocurrencies <p>Monero (XMR)</p><p>Monero is perhaps the most popular privacy-focused cryptocurrency. It implements a comprehensive suite of protections, including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions by default. Every single transaction automatically receives these privacy benefits without requiring special settings. Your balance, transaction history, and recipient information remain hidden from prying&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>Zcash (ZEC)</p><p>Zcash offers a flexible approach to privacy through its innovative zero-knowledge proof system called zk-SNARKs. Users can choose between fully private “shielded” transactions or transparent ones similar to Bitcoin. This optional privacy model appeals particularly to institutions and businesses that need privacy for sensitive operations while maintaining regulatory compliance when required. The cryptographic foundations of Zcash come from rigorous academic research.</p><p>PIVX (PIVX)</p><p>PIVX brings privacy to the proof-of-stake consensus model. It began as a fork of DASH but evolved significantly in its own direction. PIVX implemented a custom privacy protocol called zk-SNARKs (similar to Zcash) through its SHIELD technology. Users can choose between transparent and private transactions according to their needs. The project combines privacy with energy efficiency through its staking mechanism. This unique blend makes PIVX stand out as both environmentally conscious and privacy-focused. The PIVX community strongly emphasizes decentralized governance, allowing stakeholders to vote on development decisions.</p> Privacy Protocols on Public Blockchains <p>Secret Network</p><p>This innovative blockchain platform extends privacy to the realm of smart contracts. While standard smart contracts expose all their data and operations publicly, Secret contracts maintain data confidentiality while executing programmed functions. This breakthrough enables private decentralized applications, including confidential DeFi services, private NFT marketplaces, and anonymous voting systems. Secret Network provides privacy for entire applications rather than just basic transactions.</p><p>Aztec Protocol</p><p>Aztec brings sophisticated privacy features to Ethereum through an advanced layer-2 solution. It employs zero-knowledge proofs to shield critical transaction details from public view. Users can obscure transaction amounts, sender information, and recipient details while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum network. The protocol creates private versions of tokens that can interact seamlessly with existing DeFi applications. This integration brings powerful privacy options to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.</p> Regulatory Challenges <p>Government authorities worldwide have expressed growing concerns about privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. They worry these tools could potentially facilitate illicit activities beyond regulatory oversight. These concerns have led some cryptocurrency exchanges to delist privacy coins to avoid regulatory complications.</p><p>Compliance with financial regulations becomes particularly challenging when transaction details remain hidden. The privacy cryptocurrency community actively works to address legitimate regulatory concerns while still protecting fundamental user privacy rights and financial sovereignty.</p><p>In conclusion, privacy doesn’t exist to conceal wrongdoing — it protects your fundamental right to financial autonomy. We naturally expect privacy in other financial contexts, using sealed envelopes for mail and secure passwords for banking. Privacy protocols simply extend these normal expectations into the cryptocurrency realm.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy. Your Choice.<br>To stay on top of PIVX news please visit PIVX.org and Discord.PIVX.org.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-abc-of-privacy-protocols-0c48172f80c8">The ABC of Privacy Protocols</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Empeiria’s development update from April&nbsp;2025</p><p>Over the past weeks our team focused on reliability, identity‑centric functionality, and polishing the end‑user experience.</p><p>Take a look at some of the key milestones that move our Self‑Sovereign Identity (SSI) stack closer to a public launch — and what they mean for builders and the wider community.</p> 1. Test Infrastructure: From Unit to Full‑Stack Confidence <p>Testing is mission‑critical for an identity network, so we invested heavily in new automation.</p><p>Core libraries now sit at nearly 100 % unit‑test coverage, giving us early warning when edge‑cases creep&nbsp;in.</p><p>On top of that, we built a Docker‑orchestrated end‑to‑end (E2E) framework that spins up the complete stack — blockchain nodes, agents, and auxiliary services — in a disposable network.</p><p>Every pull request now runs the same interactions a production system would perform, catching integration bugs before they leave the&nbsp;branch.</p> 2. Linked Resources Module: On‑Chain Proof for Any&nbsp;Asset <p>Our new linked‑resources Cosmos‑SDK module lets a DID owner anchor versioned resources -revocation lists, credential schemas, media, or arbitrary JSON directly on‑chain.</p><p>Each upload is signed by the DID controller, timestamped, and assigned a monotonic version so consumers can verify both authenticity and freshness.</p><p>This unlocks lightweight, verifiable registries without a separate storage service and paves the way for richer ecosystem integrations.</p> 3. MCP Server: Faster QR Flows &amp; Cloud‑Native Deployment <p>We released a brand‑new Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server, now hosted in its own repository at <a href="https://github.com/empe-io/mcp-server%5B.%5D(https://www.notion.so/1e35ca766165802b9318da6d74c3411e?pvs=21)">https://github.com/empe-io/mcp-server</a></p><p>The server exposes the complete set of SSI operations through a streamlined API and ships with plug‑and‑play Issuer and Verifier services you can deploy in a single&nbsp;click.</p><p>Test API keys and sandbox addresses are pre‑configured in the&nbsp;.env.test.example file, letting developers issue and verify credentials in minutes. A convenient /qr endpoint can also return wallet‑ready QR codes on demand, smoothing agent‑to‑wallet hand‑offs without extra libraries.</p><p>Learn more about MCP Empe Server: <a href="https://x.com/empe_io/status/1920826190756995091">https://x.com/empe_io/status/1920826190756995091</a></p> 4. EMPE DID Wallet: Fresh Look, Secure Backups, Biometric Login <p>The wallet received its first full design overhaul since&nbsp;alpha.</p><p>Users will notice a cleaner layout, clearer credential previews, and snappier navigation on low‑power devices.</p><p>Under the hood we introduced an encrypted backup/export option that lets you download all credentials in a single protected file, while a companion seed‑word export secures your DID keys. Restoration stays a one‑tap operation — ideal for device migrations.</p><p>We also enabled biometric authentication and broadened deep‑link support for seamless transitions between any on‑device app and the&nbsp;wallet.</p> 5. EMPE Hub: Credential‑Gated Airdrops &amp;&nbsp;Faucet <p>On the platform side, the Airdrop section of the Empe Hub now issues an eligibility credential that doubles as anti‑sybil protection.</p><p>Holding that credential unlocks a new faucet protected by rate‑limits and on‑chain revocation checks, dramatically reducing the risk of bots draining test&nbsp;funds.</p><p>The flow showcases how Verifiable Credentials can safeguard token distribution without sacrificing user experience.</p><p>Stay tuned for upcoming details about on-chain&nbsp;airdrop!</p> 6. AI Credential Agent Prototype: Conversational Issuance&nbsp;Demo <p>Our prototype conversational agent now begins each session with a quick KYC validation, confirming the user’s identity before any sensitive data is exchanged.</p><p>Once verified, the agent gathers only the necessary details about the user’s tax profile and — when the criteria are met the agent issues a compliant credential via the MCP pipeline.</p><p>The entire flow happens in a single chat, concluding with a wallet‑ready QR code, and demonstrates how SSI agents can seamlessly combine identity proofing and document issuance while keeping the user in&nbsp;control.</p> 7. Backend &amp; API: Launch‑Ready Clean‑Up <p>Finally, the API layer underwent a spring clean: we removed deprecated endpoints, unified error codes, and tightened request validation. Container hardening, SBOM generation, and stricter CI gates round out the picture, positioning us for external security audits and the forthcoming mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p> Looking Ahead <p>With confidence in our test coverage, a powerful new on‑chain resource model, and user‑facing tools ready for prime‑time, we are gearing up for performance tuning under load and a full security&nbsp;review.</p><p>May will also bring an external developer preview of the wallet SDK — stay tuned and, as always, thank you for building the future of trust with&nbsp;us!</p>

<p>Google has agreed to pay Texas $1.375 billion to resolve claims around its unlawful collection and tracking of users’ private data. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced the agreement, emphasizing that the settlement sends a strong message to tech companies that they were not above the law and would be held accountable for violating user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The lawsuit, initially filed in 2022, alleged that the tech giant secretly tracked users’ movements, private searches, and even collected biometric data such as voiceprints and facial geometry through various products and services, including Google Photos and Google Assistant. These practices, according to the lawsuit, violated the privacy rights of Texas residents.</p><p>Google, while agreeing to the settlement, did not admit any wrongdoing. The company was quick to state that the agreement resolves “old claims” related to product policies that have already been updated. Google also clarified that the settlement does not require any further changes to its current products or services. A Google spokesperson stated that the company is pleased to put these issues behind them and will continue to build robust privacy controls into its services.</p><p>The settlement is the largest data privacy payout from Google to a single state, exceeding previous settlements obtained by other states in similar cases. Texas has been proactive in holding tech companies accountable for data privacy violations. In a similar case, Texas secured a $1.4 billion settlement with Meta over the company’s use of facial recognition software without user&nbsp;consent.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>Once live, the Input | Output (IO) led integration will bring full Cardano support to Brave Wallet, including Cardano native assets, as well as send, receive, swap, and signing capabilities- all natively embedded within Brave’s best-in-class browser wallet. This establishes Brave as a key partner to the Cardano community in the age of Voltaire.</p>
<p>San Francisco, May 12th, 2025: Input | Output (IO), the preeminent Web3 blockchain infrastructure and engineering firm, today announced a strategic partnership with Brave Software, the creator of the leading privacy-first browser and&nbsp; integrated multi-chain Brave Wallet. Together, they will integrate Cardano into the Brave Wallet, enabling Cardano blockchain access and token management from within the Brave wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our partnership with IO reflects Brave’s commitment to building a Web3 that maximizes interoperation for user choice, while giving them better tools to engage with decentralized ecosystems,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave and the Basic Attention Token (BAT). “Integrating Cardano into Brave Wallet not only expands multi-chain access, but also enhances security, governance participation, and the overall user experience.”</p>
<p>Through this integration, Brave users and the broader Cardano community will gain direct access to Cardano’s blockchain for activities such as governance participation and native asset management, all within the privacy-focused Brave Wallet. Additionally, Brave Wallet will support the execution of swaps with Cardano native tokens and other on-chain transactions. This major milestone enhances Brave’s multi-chain capabilities, adding to its existing support for networks like Ethereum and Solana. Cardano users will now be able to manage native assets like NIGHT, engage in governance, and seamlessly swap tokens—securely and privately—through Brave’s in-browser wallet.</p>
<p>“This collaboration with Brave is a natural fit,” said Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IO. “We share a vision for a more secure, accessible, and user-respecting Web3. By bringing Cardano into Brave Wallet, we are not only  expanding functionality for Cardano users in the age of on-chain governance, but also advancing a new standard for how blockchain networks should empower individuals—protecting privacy while enabling active, on-chain participation.”</p>
<p>The partnership also sets the stage for future innovation around engagement with Cardano’s governance and Midnight, a blockchain developed by Shielded Technologies, an Input | Output spinout focused on confidential smart contracts and data protection.&nbsp;</p>

 About Input | Output (IO) 
<p>Input | Output (IO) is a world-leading blockchain infrastructure and research engineering firm dedicated to building a sustainable Web3 ecosystem. IO is committed to advancing the next generation of blockchain innovation, focusing on scalability, security, and real-world adoption through pioneering research and cutting-edge engineering.</p>

 About Brave Wallet and Brave 
<p>Brave Wallet is the secure, multi-chain crypto wallet built directly into the Brave privacy browser—no extensions required.

Brave Wallet users can connect other “cold” wallets like Ledger &amp; Trezor. They can buy, store, send, and connect to DApps on Solana, Ethereum and EVM chains, Zcash, and Filecoin.</p>

<p>As society evolves, so do its values and principles, but is that desirable for technology that seeks to build the most reliable, trustless and censorship resistant global settlement layer? Ever since the rise in popularity of Solana with its inflow of retail capital in a memecoin gold rush, Ethereum became even more criticized for sticking true to its core values despite the completely divergent demands of market participants. Moreover, the rollup centric scaling roadmap seemed to further silo attention and cause liquidity fragmentation, driving away value from Ethereum mainnet.

<p>As AI agents increasingly mediate financial transactions, healthcare decisions, and supply chain operations, a $7T verification fraud crisis looms — a figure highlighted by Anthony Scaramucci at ADFW 2024. With 85% of enterprises citing data provenance as their top AI adoption barrier, Empe L1 blockchain and Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerge as Web3’s answer to trusted AI interactions.</p> Why Trust&nbsp;Matters?   AI agents become increasingly autonomous and influential without tools to verify and&nbsp;trust.  Traditional systems waste $7T annually on verification costs.  62% of executives distrust AI decisions due to unverifiable data&nbsp;sources.  Deepfakes and phishing scams cost businesses $12B+ yearly, demanding cryptographic proof of authenticity.   MCP Empe Server: AI Trust&nbsp;Solution <p>MCP Servers are systems that provide context, tools, and prompts to AI clients. They expose data sources like files, documents, databases, and APIs to make them accessible to AI&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Empeiria drops the world’s first MCP Web3 Trust Layer — scalable, private and future-proof.

  AI Ascent 2025  <p>Sequoia convened builders and researchers in AI for another packed day of conversations, talks and demos.</p>   
	By Team Sequoia	 



Published May 8, 2025
  



 
<p>On May 2, we hosted our third AI Ascent event in San Francisco, bringing together more than 100 leading founders and researchers in AI to engage with what partner Pat Grady calls, the “tremendous sucking sound in the market” for AI, and his advice to “go at maximum velocity, all of the time.” Partner Sonya Huang talked about the improved retention rate of generative AI applications and pronounced that coding had reached “screaming product-market fit.” And partner Konstantine Buhler looked ahead to how the agent economy will transform how we work, and laid out the technologies we need to get there.</p>



<p>Over the course of the day we talked with AI leaders including Sam Altman of OpenAI, Jensen Huang and Jim Fan of Nvidia, Jeff Dean of Google, Mike Krieger of Anthropic, Bret Taylor of Sierra and many more. The talks ranged from new business models for AI agents, the race to build data centers, the power of vertical applications and the importance of open source.</p>



<p>Below is a selection of videos from the event (some sessions were off the record).</p>

<p>The PIVX story began in 2016, and since then, it’s been a tale of continuous evolution. From a fundamental shift in its consensus mechanism to ongoing improvements in its privacy technology, PIVX has continued to build. But what does the future hold for this leading privacy&nbsp;coin?</p><p>Let’s dive&nbsp;in…</p> PIVX’s Core&nbsp;Tenets <p>Before peering into the future, it’s essential to understand the foundational principles that guide PIVX’s long-term vision. Top on the list is the project’s commitment to privacy. Many proponents of the project would agree that privacy is not merely a feature for PIVX; it is a fundamental right and a core tenet. The long-term vision centres around continuously enhancing and innovating privacy-preserving technologies to empower users with control over their financial data.</p><p>Another foundational principle is decentralization and community governance. PIVX has always championed decentralization, not just in its network architecture but also in its governance. The Masternode network plays a crucial role in decision-making and funding proposals, ensuring the community actively shapes the project’s future.</p><p>As a digital currency intended for real-world use, security and network stability are paramount. PIVX’s ongoing development roadmap prioritizes maintaining a robust and resilient network that users can trust for their transactions and holdings. And while privacy and security are critical, PIVX recognizes the importance of user-friendliness. One of its goals is to make privacy accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise, through intuitive interfaces and seamless integrations.</p> The BHAG <p>There have been <a href="https://forum.pivx.org/threads/its-time-pivians-lets-define-our-bhag-big-hairy-audacious-goal.2737/">discussions</a> around defining a Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) for PIVX since the beginning of 2025. Weeks of vibrant deliberation across social platforms culminated in a compellingly ambitious BHAG: “Developing circular economies powered by PIVX.” To a great deal, the new mission aligns with the mission of PIVX Labs, which is to “Build a parallel economy, reachable anywhere in the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>This points to the possibility of prioritizing efforts that champion a PIVX-powered economy. While this is ambiguous in both interpretation and implementation, I expect to see more exchange listings and integrations with local businesses.</p> Ambassador Program <p>Speaking of local businesses, one key item on the roadmap is the Ambassador Program, which is still being refined to ensure its effectiveness and sustainability. The initiative is envisioned as a crucial catalyst for grassroots adoption.</p><p>By empowering passionate community members to become local evangelists and facilitators, the Ambassador Program aims to foster organic growth and real-world use cases for PIVX at a foundational level. This boots-on-the-ground approach will be instrumental in building local circular economies where PIVX can truly&nbsp;thrive.</p> PIVX Labs <p>Labs in the powerhouse behind a handful of PIVX products, including PIVX Rewards, PIVCards, and the MyPIVXWallet (MPW). As an integral part of the project, its current roadmap is hinged on four pillars — wallet (banking), cards (spending), rewards (earning), and messaging (communication).</p><p>The first pillar focuses on developing a comprehensive wallet, extending its functionality beyond basic transactions to encompass a range of banking-like features, aiming to be a central hub for users’ financial activities.</p><p>Complementing this is the second pillar: cards for spending, which seeks to integrate user-friendly card solutions, making it seamless for individuals to utilize their PIVX for everyday purchases.</p><p>The third pillar centers on rewards for earning, envisioning the creation of various mechanisms and platforms that empower users to accumulate PIVX through active participation and contributions within the ecosystem.</p><p>Finally, the fourth pillar emphasizes messaging for secure communication, aiming to integrate private and protected communication capabilities directly within the PIVX environment.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.3.0">Zebra 2.3.0</a>.</p>



<p>This release includes a number of improvements to regtest mode, by adding methods to reconsider and invalidate blocks, as well as fixing a bug that was preventing some transparent transactions from being served by Zebra in regtest mode. Additionally, this release restores Zebra’s ability to mine blocks on testnet and regtest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have also made several improvements to the set of RPC methods supported by Zebra to cover the required validator node use cases once zcashd is deprecated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the release includes the following breaking changes:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The RPC endpoint is no longer enabled by default in Docker. Users who require it must follow <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/docker.html#rpc">these instructions</a>. 



 We no longer publish Docker images tagged with the <code>sha-</code> or <code>v</code> prefixes. 



 The <code>getblocktemplate-rpcs</code> Cargo feature has been removed, and the functionality behind that flag is now available by default. 
 



<p></p>



<p>You can see a full copy of the included changes in the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.3.0">v2.3.0 Release Notes</a> on GitHub.</p>

  Partnering with FastAPI Labs: Simplified App Deployment   <p>Sebastián is removing roadblocks for app developers—and transforming the software development process. </p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a>	 



Published May 5, 2025
  



FASTAPI LABS FOUNDER SEBASTIÁN RAMÍREZ.



 
<p>We at Sequoia knew Sebastián Ramírez well long before we became the lead investor in his company, <a href="https://fastapilabs.com/">FastAPI Labs</a>. In 2023 he was the inaugural recipient of our <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/open-source-fellowship-applications/">Open Source Fellowship</a>.</p>



<p>We started the fellowship because we recognized that open source is the lifeblood of software, and that open source contributors around the world make commercial software better and more reliable. We wanted our first fellowship recipient to be someone who already had a huge impact on the open source ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sebastián perfectly fit that bill! He is the creator of <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, the wildly popular open-source Python framework used everywhere from Fortune Global 500 corporations such as BMW, American Express and Roche, to academia, to nonprofits such as NASA’s Space Telescope Science Institute and the Red Cross. At the start of the fellowship, Sebastián was overflowing with ideas to improve on what he’d built—and we are proud to have supported his work in the years since.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting a company came up several times in our many conversations with him. In a sense, Sebastián has been an entrepreneur his entire life, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sebastian-ramirez-spotlight/">having taken the road less traveled many times before</a>. And he has plenty of the grit and perseverance a founder needs. Building a new business today may be a fad for many engineering and business graduates, but Sebastián was intentional about what his company would do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FastAPI the open-source framework was born from Sebastián’s vision for solving a complicated problem—building an API in Python. FastAPI Labs the company was born from his frustration with how difficult it is to deploy an app. It turns out that the software development lifecycle is an exercise of moving the cheese: you remove one bottleneck, only to discover the next. And Sebastián has never been someone to shy away from removing bottlenecks or solving gnarly problems. That’s why he and his team are building <a href="https://fastapicloud.com/">FastAPI Cloud</a>: a service that enables developers to seamlessly deploy apps to the cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given our long relationship with and belief in Sebastián, it’s only natural that we’re leading the seed round in FastAPI Labs, and we are excited to continue to support him and his team.</p>

<p>The European Parliament has given its nod to a ban on anonymous cryptocurrencies within the EU, setting a target implementation date of 2027. The new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), supposedly driven by the imperative to clamp down on money laundering and the financing of terrorism, will likely clamp down on privacy coins such as Monero, ZCash, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>The new <a href="https://x.com/EuCInitiative/status/1915012789602836794">regulations</a>, part of a wider legislative push against illicit financial activities, will effectively prohibit the issuance and trading of cryptocurrencies that do not permit the identification of their users. Specifically, credit institutions, financial institutions, and crypto asset service providers (CASPs) will face a prohibition on maintaining anonymous accounts and handling cryptocurrencies that enhance&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Proponents of the ban argue that the inherent anonymity of these tokens presents a considerable threat to financial security, rendering them attractive instruments for illicit actors. By outlawing their availability within the EU, lawmakers intend to cultivate a more regulated and traceable environment for digital assets, aligning them more closely with established financial systems concerning anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) protocols.</p><p>However, this move has ignited significant controversy within the cryptocurrency community. Critics voice concerns that the ban encroaches upon the fundamental principles of privacy and decentralization that underpin many cryptocurrencies. They argue that anonymous tokens serve legitimate purposes, providing financial privacy for individuals in various contexts, and that a sweeping prohibition could stifle technological advancement and push users towards less regulated ecosystems outside the EU’s jurisdiction.</p><p>Furthermore, questions have been raised regarding the practicalities of enforcing such a ban and its potential ramifications for the broader crypto market. Implementing a complete prohibition on anonymous tokens could prove technically complex, given the decentralized and borderless nature of many cryptocurrencies. There are also uncertainties about how exchanges and other crypto service providers operating within the EU will effectively identify and delist such tokens by the 2027 deadline.</p><p>But according to Vyara Savova, senior policy lead at the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI), “the regulations (the AMLR, AMLD, and AMLAR) are final, and what remains is the ‘fine print’ — aka the interpretation of some of the requirements through the so-called implementing and delegated acts.”</p><p>This decision by the European Parliament underscores a growing global trend of heightened regulatory scrutiny over the cryptocurrency market. While jurisdictions worldwide grapple with the optimal approach to managing the risks and opportunities associated with digital assets, the EU’s decision to ban anonymous tokens signals a clear inclination toward prioritizing traceability.</p><p>PIVX.

  Brave for Android 1.78 introduces a new Shields option called Block Elements, which lets you tap any on-page annoyance and hide it

<p>This is the 34th post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Vadym Struts (Senior Software Engineer) and Kleant Zogu (Mobile Product Designer) and was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (VP, Privacy and Security).</p>
<p>Brave for Android 1.78 introduces a new Shields option called Block Elements, which lets you tap any on-page annoyance and hide it.</p>



    


    



<p>Most websites are crowded with visual clutter, largely due to third-party advertising. This problem is even worse on mobile devices, where limited screen real estate makes every banner feel even more intrusive, especially on news or recipe websites. Brave already protects you from many of these annoyances by automatically stripping away third-party ads and trackers, cookie consent notices (<a>read more</a> about how we’re automatically detecting cookie consent notices) and those “Open in app” prompts. This ensures a safe and pleasant browsing experience the moment you download Brave.</p>
<p>Now, Brave for Android takes this annoyance blocking a step further by allowing you to manually hide any remaining page clutter. This could be a sidebar of “Trending” clickbait, a promo banner you can’t close, or anything else that gets in the way of focusing on the content you care about.</p>
<p>The Block Elements feature already exists on desktop, but we’ve revamped the experience there to improve its usability and better align with Android.</p>

 How to block elements 

 Android 
<p>To block unwanted page elements on Brave Android:</p>
 
 Tap the Shields icon in the address bar. 
 Tap Advanced controls. 
 Tap Block element. 
 Tap the page element you want to block. 
 Press the Block Elements button. 
 
<p>The unwanted page element will now be hidden.</p>
<p>


    


    



      
      
    



    


    



      
      
    </p>

 Desktop 
<p>To block elements on Desktop:</p>
 
 Right-click on the page you’re viewing. 
 Select Block elements. 
 Select the element you want to block. 
 Press the Block Elements button. 
 



    


    



      
      
    

 Clear all blocked elements 
<p>On both Android and desktop, you can easily undo your changes and bring back blocked elements for a website:</p>
 
 Open Shields. 
 Click or tap Clear all blocked elements. 
 
<p>Note: This action will only clear rules for the website you’re currently viewing. Also note that the Clear all blocked elements option will only appear at the bottom of the Shields panel if you have any blocked elements on the page.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Clear all blocked elements on Android</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Clear all blocked elements on desktop</p>

 Customizing blocking rules 
<p>Under the hood, the Block Elements feature works by adding custom, cosmetic filter rules for individual sites. To see all of your per-site custom rules, you can press Manage filters while selecting elements to block. Alternatively, you can navigate to brave://settings/shields/filters on both Android and desktop.</p>
<p>On desktop, you can also find other elements at the same DOM level by moving the slider. This can be useful to block multiple related elements or narrow down the block. Click Show rules to see the changing cosmetic rules.</p>



    


    



<p>Selecting multiple elements on wikipedia.org</p>

 User-friendly privacy features 
<p>Similar to the <a>Shred feature</a> on iOS, we designed Block Elements on Android to be a usable and fun feature that gives you more control over your browsing experience. However, note that blocking elements on a page might cause the website to break, especially if the website changes over time. If a page suddenly looks odd (for example, the page is blank or has unusable buttons) tap Clear all blocked elements to undo your changes for that page.</p>
<p>As always, let us know what you think on <a href="https://community.brave.com">community.brave.com</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://x.com/brave">social media</a>.</p>

 PIVX Weekly Pulse (Apr 25th, 2025 — May. 1st,&nbsp;2025) <p>Don’t miss a beat with PIVX! Our weekly highlights keep you updated on crucial market trends and everything happening within the vibrant PIVX community.</p> Market Pulse   Masternode Count: The number of active masternodes now sits at 2,111, an increase of 7 over the last week, signalling a healthy and ongoing commitment to the PIVX&nbsp;network.    Price Check: Riding the positive crypto market wave, PIVX is showing impressive price action! Over the past week, the Daily USD Value traded between $0.14 and $0.2, resulting in a strong weekly average of $0.1552. This positive momentum appears to be bolstered by strong community sentiment, with excitement building around potential new exchange listings and the upcoming Ambassador Program.

   On April 17, 2025 we opened a Dev Fund Poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to determine which of the funding proposals have the most support, or if the Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block rewards should go to miners.

<p>On April 17, 2025 we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/d55e9c6a-1b8a-11f0-8188-0ebcee0014ca/view">Dev Fund Poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to determine which of the funding proposals have the most support, or if the Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block rewards should go to miners. Additionally the poll surveyed community members about prioritizing an extension of the Dev Fund and implementation of a new funding model, even if it requires postponing NU7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>128 ZCAP voters participated in this poll, representing 64% of the total number of members. The results appear below.</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q1: Which of the following funding proposals do you support? You can select more than one proposal.</p>



 
 Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C) (84 votes/32.3%) 



 Community-Governed Funding Model (41votes/15.8%) 



 Pure Coinholder Funding Model (28 votes/10.8%) 



 Pure ZCAP Funding Model (39 votes/15.0%) 



 Zcash Governance Bloc (zBloc) (44 votes/16.9%) 



 The Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block reward should go to miners. (24 votes/9.2%) 
 



<p></p>



<p>Note: This question allowed for multiple selections, therefore the percentages above represent the total number of votes for each option, based on a total of 260 selections made across all options.&nbsp;</p>


 
 


 



 



<p></p>



<p>Q2: Do you support prioritizing the extension of the Dev Fund and the implementation of a new funding model, even if it requires postponing NU7?</p>



 
 Yes (66 votes/51.6%) 



 No (43 votes/33.6%) 



 Abstain (19 votes/14.8%) 
 



 


 
 


 



 



<p></p>



<p>Based on these results we can conclude that the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-ecc-community-and-coinholder">Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C)</a> has the greatest level of support and that an extension of the Dev Fund and implementation of a new funding model is ZCAP’s recommended path forward. The outcomes of this poll will be considered along with the ZAC and coin holder polls to determine if there is community consensus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would like to express our gratitude to everyone who contributed to this process. Thank you to those who drafted proposals, engaged in discussions and debates on the Zcash community forum, across social media, and during community calls. Additionally, we appreciate those who organized alternative community polls and are grateful to everyone who took the time to vote.</p>

<p>During Q1 2025, Least Authority (in their role as the Zcash Ecosystem Security Lead) undertook an audit of the FROST Demo code, including the <code>frost-client</code> command line tool and <code>frostd</code> server components. We expect that the FROST server, <code>frostd</code>, will be used by wallets to help participants and coordinators communicate with each other and that the FROST client, in addition to being a working command line tool, will help wallets to integrate FROST as an example of how to interact with the server.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Panther Protocol has completed a major milestone as it approaches its mainnet launch, having been successfully audited by blockchain security firm <a href="https://veridise.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Veridise</a>. The audit of the protocol confirms that Panther’s smart contracts and privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as the protocol’s Zero-Knowledge (ZK) circuits, meet Veridise's high-security standards.&nbsp;</p> Why This Matters <p>The security of Panther's smart contracts and privacy-enhancing technology is critical to instilling trust and adoption of its confidential transaction infrastructure by both users and market operators. The Veridise audit confirms that Panther’s smart contracts and cryptographic implementations function as intended.</p><p>Beyond security, the audit verifies that Panther’s privacy-preserving architecture is implemented correctly and operates as designed, including the protocol’s compliance mechanisms, logic-related functions of the protocol, and protocol-wide vectors. Veridise also assessed Panther Protocol’s cryptographic primitives. In total, Verdise's assessment of Panther Protocol V1 was conducted over 171 in-person days.&nbsp;</p> What This Means for Panther Users <p>For users, this means greater confidence in Panther’s infrastructure. With the audit complete, Panther’s privacy-preserving technology has been independently validated, improving the security and reliability of transactions. Web3 users can utilize Panther Protocol’s solutions, knowing that the system has undergone rigorous scrutiny and improvements where needed.</p><p>For full transparency, the final audit report is available <a href="https://github.com/pantherfoundation/audits/blob/main/Veridise%20Panther%20Protocol%20250425.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.</p> What’s Next? <p>Panther’s Canary Network was recently launched on Polygon. This live, production-like environment uses real assets to fine-tune functionality before mainnet launch. The Canary Network features a single Zone operated by Eurobit, a Spanish crypto exchange, providing a preview of Panther’s privacy-preserving infrastructure.</p><p>The Canary network will continue to operate for 2-3 months.

  Partnering with Nuvo: The Future of B2B Commerce  <p>The number of businesses and the volume of trade in the global economy are exploding—yet much of it remains offline and disconnected. Sid, Rameez and their team at Nuvo are building the modern B2B commerce network to accelerate how businesses connect, build trust and coordinate trade at scale.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bryan-schreier/">Bryan Schreier</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a>	 



Published April 30, 2025
  



TEAM NUVO.



 
<p>A coffee roaster in Minnesota is gaining customers across the country. But when a new restaurant places an order, the roaster doesn’t get paid right away. Instead, they begin a slow process of onboarding the restaurant, extending trade credit with payment due in 30 days or more, and navigating a maze of paperwork, references and risk checks. Multiply that across dozens of new customers, and growth starts to feel like strain. More risk. More complexity. Less time to focus on the business itself.</p>



<p>This is how the $5 trillion trade credit market operates: manually and offline.</p>



<p>Trade credit is the most common form of capital allocation across the global goods economy, yet the infrastructure behind it remains fragmented and outdated. While consumer lending is built on centralized bureaus and machine learning models, businesses still rely on instinct, emails and spreadsheets to decide who they can trust. There is no shared system for verifying partners or coordinating trade at scale. The result is slower growth, greater risk and untapped opportunity across the industries that power the world.</p>



<p>Opportunities are everywhere, but the people who recognize them are rare—and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidmalladi/">Sid Malladi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rameez-remsudeen/">Rameez Remsudeen</a> are one in a trillion. Sid and Rameez co-founded <a href="https://nuvo.com/">Nuvo</a> with a goal to solve trade credit, and a vision to build a connective layer for how businesses establish trust, form relationships and grow faster together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Nuvo, businesses create a verified profile that shares critical trust signals with potential partners—licenses, creditworthiness, banking information and trade history—all in one place. That same coffee roaster can now validate new customers, connect with better suppliers, negotiate stronger terms and scale their trade relationships without chasing paperwork or waiting weeks for approvals. Every relationship becomes easier to start, faster to scale and stronger over time.</p>



<p>And as more companies join Nuvo, they bring their buyers and sellers with them. Each connection strengthens the network, making it more powerful and valuable for every participant. It is a dynamic we have seen before in iconic companies like PayPal, Block&nbsp; and Stripe, where early adoption created lasting flywheels that reshaped entire industries. We believe Nuvo is on a similar path, building the trusted infrastructure that B2B commerce has needed for decades.</p>



<p>Sid and Rameez have approached this problem with the depth, speed and precision that we believe defines enduring companies. They have spent time inside the industries Nuvo serves, from lumber to logistics to fresh produce, understanding how trade relationships are built and where they break. They listen carefully, intentionally evolve the company as it scales, and move quickly. When we discussed a strategy shift to accelerate go-to-market, for example, it was fully executed within two weeks. That discipline and agility are already showing in results. Thousands of businesses are now joining Nuvo every month.</p>



<p>We are proud to partner with Nuvo on this journey by leading their Series A, which will help them <a href="http://nuvo.com/jobs">grow their team</a> and expand their suite of products. They are tackling an invisible but critical part of the global economy and building the infrastructure that will allow millions of businesses to trade with more trust, more intelligence and fewer barriers.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard the saying — “if it’s free, then you are the product.” For decades, tech giants have harvested and profited from your data. But have you ever stopped to consider how exactly this&nbsp;happens?</p><p>What are the intricate processes that turn your online activities into billions of dollars? The answer lies in surveillance capitalism, a powerful economic force that thrives on the constant monitoring and monetization of your digital life. Join me as I simplify the complexities of this system, revealing how your data is being leveraged and, more importantly, offering practical steps you can take to understand and potentially limit its&nbsp;reach.</p> What is Surveillance Capitalism? <p>Surveillance capitalism, a term coined by Harvard Business School professor, Shoshana Zuboff, is the monetization of data captured through monitoring a person’s online activities and behaviours. It thrives on the relentless extraction of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Every click, every search query, every location ping, every purchase, and every message — these digital breadcrumbs are meticulously collected and analysed. Sadly, this isn’t simply about providing better services; it’s about creating a comprehensive and predictive model of your behaviour, your desires, and your future&nbsp;actions.</p><p>To better understand how surveillance capitalism works, think about some seemingly innocuous interactions you have online daily. Your interactions on social media — posts, likes, shares, and comments — paint a detailed picture of your interests, relationships, and opinions. Even the time you spend looking at a particular post is valuable&nbsp;data.</p><p>Your search history reveals your immediate needs, your curiosities, your health concerns, and your purchasing intentions. The mobile applications you use collect data such as your location, contact lists, call logs, and app usage patterns. These provide a constant stream of information about your movements, social circle, and daily routines. And if you are a fan of smart devices, things like voice assistants, smart home devices, and wearable technology collect audio recordings, environmental data, and physiological information.</p><p>When you visit websites, your online activity is tracked through HTTP cookies, small text files stored on your device by your web browser. These cookies record a wide range of data, including your browsing history (pages visited, time spent on each page), preferences (language settings, display choices), and interactions with websites (clicks, form submissions, purchases).</p><p>This data collection often happens in the background, without explicit consent or a full understanding of its implications. While companies may argue that this data is anonymized or aggregated, sophisticated techniques can often re-identify individuals from seemingly anonymous datasets.</p> The Monetization Engine: Turning Data into&nbsp;Profit <p>The raw data itself is valuable, but its true power lies in its transformation into predictions. Surveillance capitalists invest heavily in sophisticated algorithms and artificial intelligence to analyse these vast datasets and identify patterns, correlations, and causal relationships. This analysis allows them to create detailed “behavioural profiles” of individuals and&nbsp;groups.</p><p>These profiles are then used in a multitude of ways to generate profit. Targeted advertising is perhaps the most visible manifestation of surveillance capitalism. By understanding your interests and preferences, companies can serve you highly personalized advertisements, increasing the likelihood of clicks and conversions. Does it not surprise you that you get bombarded with sneaker ads right after you search for one&nbsp;online?</p><p>There is also the issue of predictive analytics where businesses use these behavioural profiles to anticipate future trends, consumer demand, and market shifts. This allows them to optimize their products, pricing, and marketing strategies. Furthermore, data brokers and other companies aggregate and sell these behavioural insights to a wide range of organizations, including marketing firms, financial institutions, and even political campaigns.</p><p>Beyond simply predicting behaviour, surveillance capitalism aims to influence and direct it. By subtly nudging users with personalized content and recommendations, platforms can shape their decisions and actions. This raises ethical concerns about manipulation and autonomy.</p> The Asymmetry of Power: A Society Under Observation <p>Surveillance capitalism creates a significant power imbalance. Individuals are largely unaware of the extent and nature of the data being collected, how it’s being analyzed, and the ways in which it’s being used against them or to influence their choices. The opaque algorithms that drive these processes further exacerbate this asymmetry.</p><p>The <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-erosion-of-digital-privacy-what-you-need-to-know-in-2025-9dc9bf6dd6d6">expectation of privacy</a> diminishes as our digital footprint expands and becomes increasingly scrutinized. Knowing that our online activities are being tracked and analysed can lead to <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/china-intensifies-surveillance-arrests-tibetans-for-phone-and-internet-use-89bfa18a134d">self-censorship</a> and a reluctance to express dissenting opinions or explore unconventional ideas.</p><p>Meanwhile, the ability to predict and influence behaviour raises concerns about the potential for manipulation at scale, both commercially and politically. When our choices are subtly guided and our desires are anticipated, our sense of agency and self-determination can be undermined.</p> Taking Back Control: What You Can&nbsp;Do <p>While the challenges posed by surveillance capitalism are significant, individuals are not powerless. There are steps you can take to mitigate its impact on your life and contribute to a more privacy-respecting digital environment:</p> 1. Enhance Your Digital Literacy: <p>We all love free services and often search for free alternatives to some of our most used apps. However, you must recognize that “free” online services are often funded by the collection and monetization of your&nbsp;data.</p><p>I bet you don’t read privacy policies (I don’t too). But while often lengthy and complex, try to understand what data is being collected and how it’s being used. Look for clear and concise summaries. Keep up-to-date on data privacy news, regulations, and technological developments.</p> 2. Adjust Your Online&nbsp;Habits: <p>In an idealistic world, you wouldn’t have to worry about sharing your most precious moments with your online family and friends. But the world isn’t idealistic. So, think twice before posting personal information on social media or filling out unnecessary online&nbsp;forms.</p><p>Use browser extensions designed to block trackers and cookies. Consider alternatives to mainstream search engines that don’t track your searches.</p><p>For sensitive conversations, use messaging apps that offer end-to-end encryption. And of course, limit location tracking on your devices and only grant location permissions to apps when necessary.</p> 3. Leverage Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: <p>A VPN can encrypt your internet traffic and mask your IP address, making it harder to track your online activity.

<p>More partners. More perks. More BAT utility.</p>
<p>Brave’s <a>Rewards 3.0 Partner Program</a> is off to a strong start. We launched the program last month to expand <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token (BAT)</a> utility across Web3, and give our partners premium exposure to Brave’s over 85 million monthly active users. This month, we introduce a new slate of partners pushing the boundaries of Web3 media, usability, and engagement. In addition to 6 new partners, April brings new <a>Brave Rewards</a> product updates and developments.</p>

 &nbsp;Brave Rewards 3.0 product updates 
 
 Rewards 3.0 now available on Android 
 Updated Rewards UI with a single-page view for easier navigation and viewing on desktop and Android 
 Added more brandable cards for Rewards partners

 Meet April’s featured partners 
<p>This month’s partners are transforming how people engage with Web3, from community-owned media and collaborative storytelling to digital identity, privacy tools, and movement-based rewards. Each brings something unique to the table for Brave Rewards users and BAT holders: From educational content and token-gated perks to fitness incentives and weekly community engagement, these projects are helping enhance BAT’s presence across culture, content, and everyday life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>New partner offers will roll out on the Brave Rewards Offer Wall, Notification Ads, Newsfeed, and New Tab Takeovers throughout the program, giving users more ways to explore, earn, and engage with BAT.</p>

 Coinage 
<p><a href="https://www.coinage.media/">Coinage</a> is the first community-owned crypto news outlet, delivering original reporting, sharp analysis, and a weekly video series that puts its members in the producer’s seat. Coinage introduces a Web3 media model where subscribers can join the Coinage DAO co-op to collaborate, own, and earn patronage dividends. Zack Guzman, founder of Trustless Media and Coinage, appears on <a>Episode 67 of The Brave Technologist</a>, where Zack discusses his journey from traditional media to Trustless Media, and the model he’s pioneering with Coinage.</p>
<p>As part of the program, Coinage is exploring ways to reward community engagement with BAT, including perks for sharing episode feedback, voting on future topics, and unlocking exclusive content.</p>

 H3 Entertainment 
<p><a href="https://x.com/h3entertain?lang=en">H3 Entertainment</a> is pioneering the next era of entertainment by empowering fans and filmmakers to collaborate in a transparent, decentralized media ecosystem. With a mission to democratize storytelling through Web3, H3 is reshaping how content is created and shared.</p>
<p>During the program, H3 will develop video campaigns around Brave and BAT, including high-impact introduction ads, Web3 explainers, and creative concept pieces to boost awareness and onboard new users.</p>

 STEPN 
<p><a href="https://www.stepn.com/">STEPN</a> is a move-to-earn lifestyle app from the team at FSL with over 5.7 million users. STEPN rewards users with tokens and NFTs for walking, jogging, or running outdoors. As a pioneer in Web3 fitness, STEPN transforms physical activity into digital rewards, promoting healthier habits while connecting physical activity to on-chain value. STEPN is among a growing cohort of products that show crossover potential for Web3 to add value to physical activities.</p>
<p>Through the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program, STEPN will integrate custom Brave and BAT in-game collectibles and BAT-powered prize pools to help users stay active and earn along the way.</p>

 Unfungible 
<p><a href="https://www.unfungible.xyz/">Unfungible</a> is a leading Web3 marketing agency dedicated to pioneering community building, having supported over 200 NFT projects and brands, driving more than $100 million in client revenue through innovative campaigns and Web3-native expertise. Together with Brave, they have co-hosted weekly X Spaces panels since May 2024, highlighting NFT and Web3 trends featuring guests from Forbes Web3, MemeFi, PublicAI, and many more.</p>
<p>These panels have generated 1.9 million impressions and reached over 150,000 listeners. As part of the Program, Unfungible will offer Brave Ads media credits to their top Web3 clients each month, enabling them to leverage Brave’s premium ad network and amplify their reach.</p>

 Unstoppable Domains 
<p><a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/?ref=ac4f9d4dec334fc&amp;gad_source=1">Unstoppable Domains</a>&nbsp;is a leading provider of on-chain domain names, including .crypto, .nft, and .pudgy, giving users full ownership and control of their digital identity.</p>
<p>Since 2021, Brave and Unstoppable have partnered to bring native support in Brave for decentralized websites in the Brave browser, eliminating the need for extensions or custom settings.</p>
<p>Today, BAT can be used to purchase on-chain domains at Unstoppable, through the crypto option with Coinbase. On-chain domains can be used in the Brave Wallet to easily send and receive BAT and other cryptocurrencies. Through this program, we’re working together to unlock even more opportunities for our users.</p>

 Zcash Media 
<p><a href="https://z.cash/ecosystem/zcash-media/">Zcash Media</a> is an independent team of creators in the Zcash ecosystem that creates high-quality educational content focused on Zcash, privacy, and the future of money. Their work is produced by the award-winning team at 37 LAINES.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://x.com/jswihart">Josh Swihart</a>, CEO of <a href="https://electriccoin.co/">Electric Coin Company (ECC)</a>, joined Brave’s <a href="https://x.com/AttentionToken/status/1914702758990524483">weekly BAT Community Call</a> (Tuesdays at 2 PM Pacific / 5 PM Eastern on Brave Talk) to discuss Zcash’s <a>ongoing partnership</a> with Brave and Filecoin Foundation, and our recent rollout of <a>shielded Zcash support in the Brave Wallet</a>. The call drew over <a href="https://x.com/AttentionToken/status/1914778895217533309">1.3K live simulcast viewers</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the program, Zcash Media will work with Brave on new short-form content that underscores our shared mission to protect user privacy and expand support for shielded Zcash transactions in the browser. Privacy education is key, and Brave, Brave Rewards, and Zcash Media will collaborate to inform the public on the importance of privacy for the Web, search, and transactions.</p>

 Updates from March partners 
<p>The Rewards 3.0 Partner Program kicked off with strong momentum in March with 7 inaugural partners: Bandit’s Badchain, CHOMP, Decentraland, GuanoCoin, Karate Combat, Pudgy Pop, and SOL Incinerator. We launched Brave Ads campaigns, co-branded activations, and early BAT integrations that helped partners build visibility, boost engagement, and pilot new on-chain experiences.</p>
<p>To foster collaboration, we launched the Collab Lab: a dedicated space where Rewards 3.0 partners, BAT Ambassadors, and community leaders connect to co-create campaigns that drive mutual value and expand the BAT ecosystem.</p>
<p>Decentraland spotlighted its <a href="https://mvfw.org/">Metaverse Fashion Week</a> through a Brave New Tab Takeover, allowing millions of Brave users to discover the event (and earn BAT just for seeing the campaign with Rewards enabled). Decentraland’s Executive Director, Yemel Jardi, appears <a>on episode 68 of The Brave Technologist</a>, discussing the role of community in open virtual worlds, lessons learned in their journey to discover market fit, and more.</p>
<p>Karate Combat collaborated with the BAT Community to launch a series of limited digital collectibles on <a href="https://drip.haus/echo">Drip Haus</a>. Styled like retro fight night ticket stubs, the NFTs unlock access to a token-gated viewing party for <a href="https://karate.com/events/kc54">KC54</a>, streaming May 2nd via <a>Brave Talk</a>, with live commentary by BAT Ambassador and martial arts coach <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cryptodojo">Crypto Dojo</a>. The Brave and BAT logos will continue to be featured in the Karate Combat arena for all eyes to see at KC54.</p>
<p>CHOMP joined our recent <a href="https://x.com/AttentionToken/status/1905330319965778096">BAT X Spaces panel</a> on Web3 gamification and design, and <a href="https://x.com/lukemulks/status/1894527747772616955">stopped by our weekly BAT Community Call</a>. During its Brave New Tab Takeover last month, CHOMP welcomed over 2000 new users in just 24 hours—some becoming power users. To date, CHOMP has released five BAT-powered interactive decks, each drawing hundreds of participants and showcasing BAT as a strong driver of engagement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, updates from GuanoCoin, SOL Incinerator, and Pudgy Pop are underway and will be shared in the next update.</p>

 How interested partners can get involved 
<p>Web3 builders and projects can join the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program to gain access to a highly engaged, privacy-conscious user base, and help shape the next wave of utility for BAT. <a href="https://blocksurvey.io/brave-rewards-30-partner-program-interest-form-3jNtl5c9Sb2om5LOneVd7Q?v=o">Get in touch to learn more</a>.</p>

        How multimodal models are unlocking new forms of human expression and fluid intelligence.

<p>For most of computing history, intelligence flowed through a narrow channel: text in, text out. </p>



<p>If you could code or write, you had power. If you couldn’t, you were boxed out. Digital tools were built for verbal, logical thinkers. Everyone else—visual thinkers, spatial reasoners, musicians, creatives who think in movement or metaphor—had to translate their intelligence into text to be understood by machines.</p>



<p>That era is ending.</p>



<p>We’re entering a new phase of AI: one where models natively understand and generate across modalities—text, image, code, video, audio, voice—not as plugins, but as representations in a unified latent space. This isn’t just a technical upgrade. It’s a shift in the cognitive interface between humans and machines.</p>



<p>Multimodal AI is not just about making cooler images. It’s about unlocking intelligence that’s been latent, unexpressed, or trapped in the wrong modality. It’s about turning the act of thinking itself into a richer, more fluid medium.</p>



<p>This is AI’s synesthesia moment.</p>



 Multimodality: The new superpower&nbsp; 



<p>Multimodal models don’t literally “think” in pictures or sounds—they encode and generate meaning through a universal latent representation.</p>



<p>That’s the leap. Not a patchwork of plugins or stitched-together APIs, but a single system that learns and expresses concepts through a shared semantic embedding space, where a sentence, a sketch, a snippet of code, or a melody are all interconnected representations of meaning.</p>



<p>When Google announced Gemini, it described the model as “built from the ground up to be multimodal.” So was GPT-4o. These aren’t add-ons—they’re foundational systems each built on their own universal representations.</p>



<p>Why does that matter? Because it fundamentally changes how intelligence is represented inside the model. Instead of translating across separate sensory domains, multimodal models encode information into a shared latent space—enabling seamless transitions between forms of expression.</p>



<p>Under the hood, this unified approach enables a more expressive and controllable generation process. Consider the two dominant paradigms in image generation: diffusion and next-token prediction.</p>



<p>Diffusion starts with noise and gradually refines it—like a sculptor carving form from chaos. Next-token prediction works more sequentially, adding elements incrementally. While GPT-4o’s precise internal workings aren’t fully public, its image generation appears to integrate both approaches: creating a rough semantic outline autoregressively, then refining it through diffusion processes. The outputs aren’t “thought” in images or audio—they’re decoded from the latent space. This unified latent representation makes outputs better because generation happens all together, rather than across loosely coupled systems.</p>



<p>Previously, image generation meant rewriting prompts, piping them through DALL-E, and hoping for the best. With GPT-4o, prompting feels collaborative. You can speak in fragments or metaphors, and the model effortlessly decodes these into coherent results.</p>



<p>The same latent-space shift is happening with voice. Models like Sesame’s voice engine capture tone, emotion, pacing, and style—not because they “think” in sound, but because they decode nuanced semantic representations directly into expressive audio outputs. Voice becomes a fully expressive medium, with vast implications for storytelling, education and interaction.</p>
 







 
 Translating intelligence with AI synesthesia 



<p>Digital tools have long favored those who express themselves verbally. But intelligence isn’t limited to words. Some think visually, rhythmically or spatially.</p>



<p>Multimodal AI bridges these gaps. Visual thinkers no longer need paragraphs. Conceptual thinkers no longer need to wrestle with interfaces. Musicians and speakers no longer depend solely on editors or engineers. Intelligence can now fluidly express—and translate—across mediums via a shared latent space.</p>



<p>This is AI synesthesia: converting strengths in one cognitive domain into capabilities in another. If you’re adept at prose but not code, AI bridges the gap through semantic representations. If you’re a gifted designer but struggle to pitch verbally, AI transforms your sketches into narratives.</p>



<p>Scriabin, the Russian composer and mystic, experienced music as color. His neurological synesthesia enabled fluent transitions across sensory modalities. What was once rare neurological wiring is now becoming our shared digital capability, mediated through latent semantic representations.</p>



<p>Your intelligence is no longer siloed—it’s fluidly transferable.</p>
 







 
 Raising both floor and ceiling of human capability 



<p>The implications for work are profound. Multimodality raises both the floor and ceiling of human capability.</p>



<p>The floor rises as specialized skills become accessible. No design degree is needed to create beautiful visuals, nor coding expertise to automate workflows. AI fills the gaps—fast.</p>



<p>The ceiling rises, too. Specialists can explore across modalities. Data scientists can craft visuals without designers. Strategists can prototype without engineers. Composers can narrate stories. More time is spent at the forefront of their expertise rather than on technical minutiae.</p>



<p>This doesn’t make everyone an expert—it amplifies those who already are. Meanwhile, routine “middle skill” tasks—basic design, simple data analysis, boilerplate content—may automate or morph into new roles focused on prompt design and output supervision. Demand at the high end, for originality and domain-specific insight, may surge.</p>



<p>We’ve seen this before. Word processors didn’t end writing—they transformed who writes and how. Multimodal AI will similarly redefine every knowledge field.</p>
 







 
 Fluid intelligence 



<p>We’re just beginning to understand what it means to think through a unified latent space across modalities.</p>



<p>As multimodal AI becomes native to the tools we use every day, intelligence starts to feel less like a fixed trait and more like a transferable asset. We are now entering the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">creative new world we predicted</a> two-and-a-half years ago: Visual thinkers can speak in paragraphs. Coders can sketch in pixels. Writers can prototype products. Musicians can narrate. The barriers between disciplines, roles and modes of thought begin to dissolve.</p>



<p>This isn’t just a UX improvement—it’s a new mental operating system.<br>Your strengths are no longer limited to the format you were trained in.<br>Your ideas are no longer trapped in the mode you happen to be best at.</p>



<p>In the synesthesia era, creativity becomes translation.<br>Expression becomes multidimensional.<br>And intelligence becomes fluid.</p>

The Verizon <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:ent:ea:na:8888855284_ds_cid_71700000082347933_ds_agid_58700006959920338&amp;utm_term=verizon%20dbir&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=GGL_BND_Security_Exact&amp;utm_content=Enterprise&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAABymyRFAo0sxykBuprNabTMLbLJtG&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwn6LABhBSEiwAsNJrjqqqBGm-SIgLQg47pn4b2982CXm7qFu4Aqu7bFp1YBAib87sPROBCBoCk_AQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)</a> for 2025 paints a stark picture, revealing that ransomware was involved in a staggering 44% of all data breaches analyzed. This represents a 37% increase from the previous&nbsp;year.</p><p>The report, which examined over 22,000 security incidents, including 12,195 confirmed data breaches, highlights a disturbing trend: once threat actors gain access to a network, ransomware deployment is increasingly becoming the&nbsp;endgame.</p> A Double-Edged Sword: Decreasing Payments, Increasing Incidents <p>Interestingly, despite the surge in ransomware incidents, the median ransom payment saw a notable decrease, dropping to $115,000 in 2024 from $150,000 in 2023. This decline could be attributed to a growing resistance among victim organizations, with 64% choosing not to pay the ransom — a significant increase from 50% just two years&nbsp;prior.</p><p>However, this silver lining is overshadowed by the sheer volume of attacks. The fact that ransomware is involved in nearly half of all data breaches means that even with lower individual payments, the overall financial and operational impact on organizations remains substantial. The costs associated with recovery, downtime, reputational damage, and potential regulatory fines can far outweigh the ransom demand&nbsp;itself.</p> The Disproportionate Impact on Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs) <p>The Verizon DBIR also sheds light on a concerning disparity in how ransomware affects different sizes of organizations. While ransomware was a component in 39% of breaches affecting larger organizations, this figure skyrockets to a shocking 88% for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). This stark contrast suggests that SMBs, often lacking the robust security infrastructure and dedicated cybersecurity teams of larger enterprises, are disproportionately targeted and more susceptible to the devastating consequences of ransomware attacks.</p><p>Craig Robinson, Research Vice President for Security Services at IDC, aptly summarizes this, stating that organizations lacking proper IT and cybersecurity maturity — often SMBs — “are paying the price for their size with ransomware being present in 88% of breaches.”</p><p>PIVX.

  Cookiecrumbler automates cookie notice detection using LLMs, enhancing Brave's privacy features while minimizing website breakage through scalable, region-specific blocking and community collaboration.

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This is the 33rd post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Anton Lazarev (Sr. Research Engineer) and Moritz Schafhuber (Staff DevOps Engineer), and was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (VP, Privacy and Security).</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce two major updates in Brave’s ongoing work to improve cookie consent notice blocking. First, we’ve open sourced <a href="https://github.com/brave/cookiecrumbler/">Cookiecrumbler</a>, a tool that automatically detects cookie consent notices on websites by using open-source LLMs and even suggests fixes for them. Second, we’re now <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/cookiecrumbler-issues/issues">publishing GitHub issues</a> with the results of our Cookiecrumbler crawls across popular websites, inviting the broader adblocking community to help refine and triage these findings.</p>

 The challenge of blocking cookie consent notices without breaking websites 
<p>Brave blocks cookie consent notices by default. These banners are both annoying and harmful to user privacy (given how websites often implement them). Worse, as we mentioned in <a>our blog post</a> announcing cookie consent notice blocking, researchers have found that many consent systems still track people, <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/papers/Matt-etal-20-SP.pdf">even when users reject all cookies</a>. These notices are especially useless in Brave, since we already block third-party tracking scripts and pixels (which protects you, for instance, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7316539316560695297">when your health plan provider accidentally shares your data with Google Ads</a>).</p>
<p>Blocking cookie consent notices offers clear benefits on privacy and reducing annoyances, but it also carries risks. Overly broad or incorrect blocking can break essential website functionality, from checkout flows to layout problems. We’ve encountered many issues (broken scrolling, blank pages) when a cookie consent notice block is applied indiscriminately. To reduce their maintenance burden, adblock list maintainers tend to rely on as few rules as possible for the widest coverage. However, cookie consent notice implementations can vary significantly from one site to another, making Web-wide generic rules a frequent source of breakage. In response, we’ve spent the past few months cleaning up community-maintained <a href="https://github.com/easylist/easylist/tree/master/easylist_cookie">cookie consent notice blocking lists</a>, removing generic rules that repeatedly cause problems.&nbsp;</p>

 Enter Cookiecrumbler 
<p>Cookiecrumbler lets us scale site-specific cookie consent notice blocking across the Web. It uses open-source LLMs to automate detection, which lets us identify cookie consent notices across all sorts of site-specific variations, including non-English notices. We chose an LLM-based approach to automate the task of identifying notices for a few reasons, among them:</p>
 
 It’s easier to perform (as cookie consent notices tend to use similar text) 
 It’s repetitive (which helps with the sheer scale of the Web) 
 It’s low-risk (allowing human reviewers to remove false positives upon visual inspection) 
 It’s cheap, as every crawl costs on the order of cents (while we experimented with bigger and more expensive models, smaller models also offered great results after some tweaking) 
 
<p>This kind of LLM-based automation frees up human reviewers to do the more nuanced work of actually blocking the notice. As mentioned before, poorly applied blocking rules can break core site elements. That’s why we retained human review as part of the process: filter list maintainers and community members help confirm and tweak Cookiecrumbler suggestions before they go live. We’re also working on improving the quality of blocking rule suggestions offered by Cookiecrumbler.</p>
<p>Cookiecrumbler also supports different locations and languages. Cookie consent notices can look very different depending on a visitor’s geographic region or language settings. Cookiecrumbler has support for various geographical vantage points, so that it can see the website as a user in a particular region would see it.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Cookie notice in Thai</p>
<p>Cookiecrumbler runs completely on Brave’s backend, and uses publicly available lists of top websites for detection purposes. We’re exploring how we can build Cookiecrumbler into the browser to bring smart cookie notice detection closer to the user. But, like everything we do at Brave, this will only happen after a full privacy review so we ensure Cookiecrumbler works with user privacy and choice in mind.</p>

 How Cookiecrumbler works 

 Website list creation 
<p>First, Brave creates a custom version of the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu">Tranco list</a> that’s tailored to different regions (since cookie consent notices are often region-specific). A prioritized list of websites per region helps us focus on the most popular websites for users in multiple countries.</p>

 Automated crawling 
<p>Next, a crawling <a href="https://github.com/brave/cookiecrumbler-tools/blob/main/crawl.py">script</a> running on our CI servers takes these lists of websites and calls the Cookiecrumbler API for each website and region.</p>

 Cookiecrumbler 
<p>Once the API call is made, the Cookiecrumbler process starts:</p>
 
 The Cookiecrumbler API receives the request from the crawling script running in CI, and launches <a href="https://pptr.dev/">Puppeteer</a> (a headless browser) to load the website. We use proxies to load the website from the desired region. 
 We identify and gather candidate HTML elements from the page that might be cookie consent notices. 
 These elements get passed to the LLM, which identifies whether they’re cookie consent notices. It also suggests a fix, if applicable. 
 Cookiecrumbler sends this response back to the crawling script. 
 

 Publishing crawl results 
<p>After a crawl is done, we take the list of websites for which Cookiecrumbler identified a cookie notice (along with the region for that cookie notice), and publish this list to <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/cookiecrumbler-issues/issues">a new GitHub repository</a>.</p>



    


    



      
      
    

 Privacy without site breakage 
<p>Brave already offers robust and privacy-first cookie consent notice blocking by default. Cookiecrumbler extends that with an automated, large-scale process to detect new and changing banners. In combination with our work on removing brittle generic rules, we’re able to use Cookiecrumbler to ship a cookie consent notice blocking experience that doesn’t cause frequent website breakage.</p>
<p>We first unveiled Cookiecrumbler (under a different name) at the <a href="https://adfilteringdevsummit.com/">Ad Filtering Dev Summit</a> last year. Since then, we’ve made significant progress in lowering false positives, adding support for multiple languages, and ensuring coverage across multiple geographical vantage points. We’ve already seen the benefits of Cookiecrumbler, with fewer reports of notice blocking-related breakage and higher user retention and growth overall. By detecting and addressing potential breakage points proactively, we’re delivering on Brave’s commitment to a privacy-first and user-first Web.</p>

  Partnering with Listen Labs: Next-Level Customer Obsession  <p>Alfred, Florian and their team are on a mission to give every business deep, insightful research at scale—and fast. 
</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bryan-schreier/">Bryan Schreier</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a>	 



Published April 23, 2025
  



Alfred and Florian.



 
<p>Imagine your company wanted to be as customer-obsessed as possible, and realities such as time and space were no object. What would you do? You’d talk to every customer you could. You’d talk to them until you understood exactly who they are and what they think of your product. You’d find a way to synthesize all these conversations into a canonical understanding of customer behavior. And you wouldn’t do all of this just once. You’d do it regularly—every time you change anything about your product or service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nothing like this has ever been possible before. But today, it is.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://listenlabs.ai/">Listen Labs</a> is a giant leap forward in customer obsession. Businesses use their AI-powered platform to conduct market research beyond the constraints of what humans can do. Where traditional methods like interviews and surveys made companies choose between quality and quantity, Listen is enabling companies to understand their customers at both great depth and great scale. We at Sequoia are proud to support their next-level customer research, and to lead both their seed and Series A rounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re customers of Listen at Sequoia, and were frankly blown away by how well the product addresses what every company wants—to deeply understand their customers, so they can improve their products, build stronger brands and acquire customers more effectively. Listen automates every step of customer research, from crafting questions and recruiting participants to conducting interviews and analyzing responses. The platform can reach millions of participants in more than 200 countries and simultaneously hold thousands of empathetic, insightful conversations. And it only takes hours, instead of weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Listen gives businesses clear insights, automatically generating presentations on par with the output of a management consultant—together with video highlight reels of a company’s customers providing key points of feedback. Fortune 500 companies spend tens or even hundreds of millions per year on such work—and Listen can deliver superior project results faster and at a far lower cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Listen’s achievements are no surprise given the backgrounds of founders Alfred Wahlforss and Florian Juengermann and their team. Florian, previously a national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and Alfred, a repeat founder with extensive user interview experience, first came together at Harvard to found an AI avatar app. It went viral, gaining 20,000 users on its first day—and they built an early version of Listen to learn as much about those users as possible. Alfred and Florian are obsessed not just with understanding customers, but also with <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/listenlabs">recruiting</a> the highest-caliber talent. Among their first hires were several medalists of the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) and International Collegiate Programming Content (ICPC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>To date, Listen has conducted more than 300,000 interviews for customers like <a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/canva">Canva</a> and <a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/chubbies">Chubbies</a>. It’s also spread organically through Sequoia, where we’ve used it for everything from research on industry trends to gathering customer feedback during due diligence.</p>



<p>We’re excited about Listen because it has the potential to change how companies build their products and services across industries—enabling businesses from software to CPG to VC to iterate on everything from product prototypes to brand and advertising far faster. Deeply understanding your customers is a competitive advantage, and we’re proud to be by their side.&nbsp;</p>

  The Always-On Economy: AI’s Real Impact in the Next 5-7 Years  <p>Before we get to full-blown AGI, hybrid agent/human systems will remove temporal friction from the economy and create new opportunities.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a>	 



Published April 21, 2025
  



 
<p>While discussions about artificial intelligence often oscillate between immediate applications and far-future scenarios of artificial general intelligence (AGI), there’s a crucial middle ground that deserves our attention. In the next 5-7 years, AI will reshape and accelerate our economy by enabling “always-on” operations across numerous sectors. This transformation isn’t merely theoretical—it’s already happening in some industries, offering a preview of our near future.</p>



 The present: Islands of always-on 



<p>The future is indeed already here, just unevenly distributed. Several sectors have already achieved “always-on” status through AI:</p>



<p>Financial markets exemplify this transformation as early adopters of AI way before the LLM era. What once required physical traders shouting in pits during limited hours has evolved into a 24/7 digital marketplace. This was the result of thousands of brilliant quants creating predictive algorithms to determine when to buy or sell—collectively known now as electronic market makers (e.g. Citadel Securities). The result is a smooth, convenient experience for consumers with better prices. Modern consumers can now execute trades at midnight on a Friday—an impossibility just a few years ago.</p>



<p>Healthcare has seen similar evolution. Companies like Viz.ai have revolutionized stroke detection, providing expert-level analysis around the clock in 40% of U.S. hospitals. Before such innovations, if a patient came in at an off hour they wouldn’t be guaranteed the highest quality diagnostic treatment. Now, with AI imaging always on, a LVO (large vessel occlusion) stroke can be detected any day or time. This technology is particularly vital for rural facilities lacking 24/7 specialist coverage, demonstrating how AI can democratize access to expertise. AI-powered devices now constantly track vital signs, creating an “always-on” healthcare presence that was previously impossible. These systems continuously monitor patients’ conditions remotely, immediately alerting providers to concerning changes and enabling data-driven decisions based on real-time information rather than periodic check-ins. The technology extends from hospital settings to patients’ homes with companies like Commure, which offer devices that can perform sophisticated diagnostics (like blood cell counts) through simple procedures such as finger-pricks.</p>



<p>Physical security has been transformed by AI into systems of perpetual vigilance. Previously, only high-value facilities had human-monitored camera systems. Today, AI-powered surveillance systems like Verkada use continuous computer vision to monitor countless cameras simultaneously, triggering notifications only when necessary and providing advanced pattern recognition beyond human capabilities. Similarly in law enforcement, police departments now use always-on AI platforms like Peregrine that function as tireless analysts. These systems unify disconnected data across agencies into actionable intelligence, continuously identifying connections between cases and monitoring threats in real-time. This capability was demonstrated at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, where the technology provided constant threat monitoring.</p>



 The near future: Expanding always-on operations 



<p>The next half-decade will see this always-on capability extend to numerous other sectors:</p>



<p>The days of “high call volume” messages and limited business hours are numbered. AI will handle front-line support continuously, with human managers available for escalations. Small businesses will compete with large corporations in providing 24/7 customer care, using AI to filter and escalate only truly urgent matters.</p>



<p>Rather than waiting for general-purpose robots, specialized systems will enable 24/7 operations in specific domains. For instance, automated food preparation systems will allow restaurants to operate continuously, maintaining consistent quality regardless of time or staffing constraints. AI-powered systems will enable autonomous manufacturing as robots work alongside human operators to maintain continuous production cycles. This will transform manufacturing by optimizing production flow and improving overall efficiency while maintaining the critical human judgment and creativity that drives innovation. Cobot exemplifies this type of future, and is already live in production in logistics and manufacturing operations to redefine human-robot collaboration.</p>



<p>Medical professionals will benefit from AI-powered documentation systems that operate continuously. Consider emergency surgeons responding to 3 AM calls—AI will automatically document these urgent communications, allowing doctors to focus entirely on patient care and superior outcomes rather than administrative tasks. AI note-takers like Freed and Abridge are transforming healthcare by eliminating documentation burdens. And always-on information systems like OpenEvidence help doctors keep up with the latest treatments instantaneously.</p>



<p>ChatGPT already provides students with a 24/7 tutor (that can also do their homework!) and education is primed to become one of the largest use cases for generative AI as its reliability improves and schools figure out how to incorporate it into their curricula responsibly. Not only will AI agents adapt to students’ level of understanding and cognitive needs, but as workers retrain to keep up with the changing job market there will be an increased demand for after hours adult education service as well.</p>



<p>Companies like XBOW have pioneered always-on penetration testing for enterprises. AI is forecast to increase the surface area for cyberattacks as criminals get better at writing their own malicious agents, but 24/7 security will rise to stay ahead of the bad guys.</p>



<p>Always-on will also have an impact on recruiting. 24/7 HR agents will allow candidates with jobs and families to interview for positions at 10 pm or on weekends, allowing great candidates who previously couldn’t schedule interviews to apply.</p>



<p>Fleets of autonomous vehicles will become mainstays in many communities, fulfilling Uber’s original mission to “make transportation as reliable as running water.” Unlike other services with capacity fluctuations, autonomous fleets will maintain consistent availability regardless of time. Benefits include eliminated surge pricing, reliable service in underserved areas, more efficient fleet utilization and reduced total vehicle requirements.&nbsp;</p>



 The Broader Implications 



<p>This shift toward an always-on economy will have profound effects:</p>



 
 Economic efficiency: The elimination of traditional business hours will reduce economic friction and increase asset utilization. 



 Global competition: Time zones will become less relevant as AI enables continuous operation across borders. 



 Work patterns: Traditional 9-to-5 schedules will evolve as systems operate continuously, requiring new approaches to human oversight and intervention. 



 Resource distribution: Peak demand periods will flatten as pricing mechanisms encourage off-hours usage. 
 



 The Always On Workforce 



<p>The real transformation AI brings in the next 5-7 years isn’t about replacing human intelligence—it’s about removing temporal constraints from our economy. This shift toward continuous operation will create new opportunities while challenging traditional business models and work patterns. Organizations that adapt to this always-on paradigm will find themselves at a significant advantage in an increasingly fluid and accelerated economic landscape.</p>



<p>The key to success will not lie in completely automating human tasks, but in thoughtfully integrating AI systems to enable continuous operations while maintaining human oversight where it matters most. This hybrid approach will define the next phase of economic evolution, creating a more responsive and efficient economy that never sleeps.</p>

<p>In November 2025, the current Dev Fund established under ZIP 1015 will expire, and 100% of block rewards will be allocated to miners. If a new Dev Fund is not in place by the time ZIP 1015 expires in November 2025, 100% of block rewards will go to miners.</p>



<p>Today we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/d55e9c6a-1b8a-11f0-8188-0ebcee0014ca/view">ZCAP poll</a> intended to assess whether there is community consensus to create a new Dev Fund and corresponding funding model and, if so, which proposal is preferred. This poll is part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring that the Zcash community has a significant and meaningful role in shaping decisions concerning the future direction of Zcash.</p>



<p></p>



 ZCAP Poll Questions 



<p>In this poll we are asking the following questions, and provide the following response options.</p>



 



<p>Q1: Which of the following funding proposals do you support? You can select more than one proposal.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C) 



 Community-Governed Funding Model 



 Pure Coinholder Funding Model 



 Pure ZCAP Funding Model 



 Zcash Governance Bloc (zBloc) 



 The Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block reward should go to miners.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Below is a summary of the five proposals:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community and Coinholder (C&amp;C) Funding Model (C&amp;C) : Allocates 8% of block rewards to ZCG and 12% to a Coinholder-Controlled Fund, active until the third halving in November 2028. It gives ZCG and coinholders distinct decision-making roles, with grants from the coinholder fund requiring 420,000 ZEC to be approved. For more information, see this <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-ecc-community-and-coinholder">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community-Governed Funding Model: Allocates 8% to ZCG and 12% to a ZCAP-Controlled Fund managed by the Zcash Foundation. It prioritizes community consensus, with a 50% participation threshold for ZCAP voting, and secures funds in a multisig wallet. For more information, see this <a href="https://github.com/jackgavigan/zips/blob/patch-3/zips/draft-jackgavigan-community-governed-funding.md">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pure Coinholder Funding Model: Allocates 20% of block rewards to a Coinholder-Controlled Fund, active until the third halving. Grants require 420,000 ZEC for approval and are managed exclusively by coinholder voting. For more information, see this <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-pm-pure-coinholder-funding">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pure ZCAP Funding Model: Allocates 20% of block rewards to a ZCAP-Controlled Fund managed by the Zcash Foundation. All funding decisions are made by ZCAP, with a 50% participation threshold, and funds are held in a multisig wallet. For more information, see this <a href="https://github.com/jackgavigan/zips/blob/patch-4/zips/draft-jackgavigan-pure-zcap-funding.md">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash Governance Bloc (zBloc): Allocates 20% of block rewards to a Community Fund split into Large and Minor Grant pools. Governance is shared across constituencies like Coinholders, ECC, and ZF, each with adjustable voting power and thresholds. For more information, see this <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-ecc-zbloc">link</a>.</p>



 



<p>Q2: Do you support prioritizing the extension of the Dev Fund and the implementation of a new funding model, even if it requires postponing NU7?</p>



 
 Yes 



 No 



 Abstain 
 



 



<p></p>



<p>The results of ZCAP polls are advisory but serve as an important signal to ecosystem participants, funders, and developers. The poll will close at 12:00 am UTC on May 1, 2025 and results will be shared by May 5th.</p>



 We Support Community Consensus 



<p>While the Zcash Foundation Board recently voted unanimously to endorse <a href="https://zfnd.org/why-the-board-endorses-the-community-and-coinholder-funding-model-cc/">the Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C)</a> ZIP proposal, we deeply respect the voice of the Zcash community and are fully committed to upholding its collective decision even if it diverges from our Board’s recommendation. The Foundation will support the community’s choice and take the necessary steps to help implement it.</p>



 Why ZCAP Matters 



<p>This poll is part of our ongoing efforts to provide the Zcash community with a meaningful voice in decisions about the future of Zcash. As always, the results of ZCAP polls are non-binding but serve as an important signal to ecosystem participants, funders, and developers.</p>



<p>The ZCAP process is a transparent, community-driven way to surface the views and priorities of long-term Zcash supporters. Though advisory in nature, these votes play a vital role in informing decisions across the ecosystem. Thank you for lending your voice.</p>



<p>As always, we welcome feedback from the Zcash Community. If you have comments or suggestions, please join the conversation on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/moving-the-dev-fund-discussion-forward/47464">Zcash community forum</a>.&nbsp;</p>
