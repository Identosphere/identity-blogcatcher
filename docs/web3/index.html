 Quality of life and bug fixes for Aztec’s local developer testnet <p>A few months ago, we released the Aztec <a href="https://aztec.network/sandbox/">Sandbox</a> at zkHack&nbsp;London.</p><p>The Sandbox is a local developer testnet intended to be a first look into how Aztec will ultimately work: as a privacy-first Layer 2 on Ethereum. It allows developers to write Aztec-native smart contracts with public and private logic, testable in Aztec’s Private Execution Environment (PXE).</p><p>In conjunction with our <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy/">announcement</a>, we quietly recruited multiple teams of developers to work closely with us to identify bugs in the Sandbox, expand its feature set, and begin experimenting with novel privacy primitives.</p><p>As a result of close collaboration with these pioneers, we are proud to announce a series of bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and other enhancements to the&nbsp;Sandbox.</p> Our Ambition <p>Our Sandbox announcement blog post called it “the most ambitious software release in Aztec Labs’ history.” And with great ambition comes great quality of life improvements.</p><p>So we’re thrilled to share some of the obstacles our developers have run into and the work we’ve done to improve Aztec’s DevEx in order to highlight the novel application design space enabled by our software.</p><p>Now that the Sandbox is more stabilized and feature complete, we will be welcoming folks into future rounds of feedback.</p><p>Subscribe to our newsletter to stay in the loop and get the latest with <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a>, Sandbox, and Aztec&nbsp;Labs:</p><blockquote><a href="https://embeds.beehiiv.com/83354329-29bf-48be-ba17-a99d72424ace">📰 Subscribe to the Aztec Developer Dispatch</a></blockquote> Developer Experience Improvements <p>Early on, developers had to update a bunch of different pieces of software every time we pushed a new update. Docker, NPM packages, dependencies in nargo.toml, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>With the volume of updates we were (and still are) shipping — weekly on Tuesday — this quickly became very annoying. In fact, one of the major complaints about the Sandbox-and the reason this wasn’t an open-invite testnet-was the speed of iteration and the number of continuous changes.</p><p>So we designed a new update flow ( <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2488">aztec-cli update</a>) that updates all components in one go via a <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2875">Docker-only install</a> experience, instead of manually juggling 4 different components.</p><p>We also bundled nargo (the Noir package manager) as WASM in the Docker image in the new update flow. This removes the extra step of installing nargo for writing contracts, so developers can get right into <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/contracts/main">writing Aztec.nr contracts</a>.</p><p>We’ve also implemented a slow updates tree to make it easier to read historical public storage in private functions.</p><p>Many external developers kept running into this constraint — if a private function is reading from public data, it is conceivable that by the time the private function executes, the public data has changed. This is one nuance of working with a network that has both private and public state, but we wanted to make it easier for developers to handle&nbsp;this.</p><p>So as mentioned above, we’ve implemented a <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/slow-updates-tree">slow updates tree</a> — this is a contract containing public data that won’t change within a predefined time interval (for example, ‘over the next epoch’ or ‘over the next 500 blocks’). As long as the transaction in question is executed before that time interval, the public data will stay constant as it’s read from the slow updates&nbsp;tree.</p><p>At any time during the epoch, devs can tell the tree to update their particular public values to a new value. This data is stored in a pending tree. Once the epoch is over, the slow updates tree gets updated to use the pending values. This should be a useful data structure for developers who want to explore the new design space opened up by public ←→ private interactions.</p> What’s in a&nbsp;name? <p>Finally, better names. We know that Aztec Labs has not historically been great at naming, so we’re trying to be better at&nbsp;it.</p><p>First, we’ve removed the term ‘commitment’ in favor of ‘note hashes’. This is just more intuitive, since the ‘commitment’ actually comes from the hashing of the note (in other words, by hashing a note, you commit to the contents of that note, since changing any of the contents will change the hash!). <br>We’ve also named the private execution environment of the network as PXE (or ‘pixie’), instead of the other candidate name that we almost went with&nbsp;(PEE…).</p> Tutorials and&nbsp;Examples <p>The challenges of working with a completely new execution environment are not lost on us, so we’ve also been creating additional references for developers exploring a new ecosystem like Aztec’s. Here are some of the improvements we’ve made for tutorials and accompanying examples:</p>  More examples of custom notes — our network abstracts away a lot of the complexities associated with UTXOs, note commitments, and nullifiers. But custom notes are still hard to grasp without examples.  So we created a few more examples!  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/address-note">AddressNote</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/field-note">FieldNote</a> are two examples of custom notes that should help developers grasp the note structures.  Aztec boxes — our version of Truffle Boxes. Essentially, a package with a dedicated user interface showing developers how to use Aztec.js and how to write Aztec contracts. These <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/cli/blank_box">Aztec boxes</a> act as a reference for developers to install and see how the different components interact to help create full stack&nbsp;apps.  Portal tutorial, using Uniswap — Aztec portals are one of the most unique features of the Aztec L2. Portals allow for direct interactions with Ethereum, privately. In other words, no one can know where the transaction is coming from, besides the fact that it is coming from somewhere on&nbsp;Aztec.  <p>(Long time followers may recognize this type of functionality as <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/sunsetting-aztec-connect-2/">Aztec Connect</a>, a previous iteration of our network. The <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec network</a> gets Aztec Connect functionality, out of the&nbsp;box!)</p><p>Tactically, portals are smart contracts written in Solidity that are related to the Ethereum smart contract that is being interacted with. <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/tutorials/uniswap/main">This Uniswap tutorial</a> helps developers understand how to use these portals to interact with L1 applications from the Aztec&nbsp;L2.</p> Smashing Bugs <p>Finally, bug fixes. There are always going to be a lot of bugs in new software, and the Sandbox is no exception.</p><p>Here are a few of the bugs that we’ve fixed recently:</p>  If the <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/3012">length of a note</a> was incorrect in the compute_note_hash_and_nullifier method, developers would just get a ‘no method found’&nbsp;error  We weren’t properly <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/3193">deserializing arrays of&nbsp;structs</a>  Multiple things broke in the Sandbox — here is one&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2953">Example</a>  The sequencer would go into <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2502">an infinite loop</a> when duplicate nullifiers were submitted  Here are <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug">all of the bugs</a> we’ve fixed in the past 2&nbsp;months  <p>Hopefully, it’s clear that we’ve been busy making the Aztec ecosystem a more enjoyable place for developers to explore the design space opened up by programmable privacy. These improvements should meaningfully improve the quality of the developer experience for interacting with the Aztec Sandbox, and in due time, the Aztec&nbsp;network.</p><p>We are committed to improving the intuitiveness of our execution environment and continuously upgrading our documentation (look at <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+docs">this activity</a>!). All of this work is a result of listening to the challenges that the Aztec developer community is facing, fixing problems transparently, and working diligently to create a credibly neutral network with programmable privacy.</p> To our&nbsp;partners <p>We couldn’t do it without you. You chose to chew glass and soldier through weekly updates, breaking changes, bugs, all to make privacy more intuitive for others.

<p>Modern AI has allowed us to build the world’s first <a href="https://youtu.be/0wIUK0nsyUg?feature=shared&amp;t=1685">creative computers</a>. Fields that once seemed uniquely human — like visual art, writing, music, or even the art of conversation — are now accessible to software in ways we couldn’t previously imagine. For many consumer AI apps, this is an incredible and groundbreaking feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For business applications, though, creativity poses a problem. Lack of reliability in AI systems (i.e., their tendency to say things that might offend customers, violate compliance rules, or otherwise damage the business) is one of the biggest barriers to widespread adoption in the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is probably no closed-form solution to AI reliability. Building perfectly well-behaved applications would defeat the purpose of using AI in the first place (i.e., its creative nature). But it is possible to put bounds around acceptable model outputs, if developers have the right tools and primitives to express their intentions. And it is certainly valuable to at least have a better understanding of whether AI behavior has changed. Building this framework is a massive opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why we’re thrilled to announce our seed investment in <a href="https://distributional.com/">Distributional</a>. Distributional is building a platform for robust and repeatable testing of AI and machine learning models. The company’s core observation is that rigorous testing, as part of the CI/CD process, has been critical to achieving reliable performance in traditional software development. Good software teams don’t push to prod without passing their build tests first.</p>
<p>The Distributional team believes the same approach will work in AI, but that the right tools don’t yet exist. Traditional testing frameworks only provide static checks — confirming that a piece of code produces the same result every time — while most AI/ ML tools are based on bespoke evaluation functions or manual “vibe checks.” In a sense, Distributional combines these approaches. It provides a standard set of tests (e.g., Python functions) designed to run in the CI/CD pipeline, which work natively with dynamic systems (e.g., checking that code produces results within a certain acceptable range, or distribution, with each run).</p>
<p>The Distributional team has met with more than 25 AI leaders from Fortune 100 companies, AI startups, and financial institutions, and has received early validation on its approach. Each leader identified testing as one of the top barriers to AI adoption within their organization, and many even agreed to become early beta customers, provide ongoing product feedback, or support the company in an effort to help solve the problem. It’s easy to see why users are so eager to find a solution, when you consider what’s at stake: One CTO from a Fortune 100 technology company believes a lack of reliability in AI systems costs their company $10 million a day.</p>
<p>We first met Scott Clark, the CEO of Distributional, back in 2016 through our investment in his prior company, SigOpt. SigOpt was an MLops company in the supervised learning era, and was ultimately <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/sigopt-to-scale-ai-productivity-performance.html">acquired by Intel in 2020</a>, where Scott became a VP and GM for AI. He lived the AI-reliability problem every day through the customers he supported at those companies. He’s a zealot for solving hard statistical problems in the real world, and he’s now applying his passion and experience to tackle AI reliability.</p>
<p>We couldn’t be more excited to work again with Scott, Nick Payton, David Rosales, Michael McCourt, and the rest of the team to help make creative computers a bit more well-behaved.</p>

<p>As software has eaten the world, it has become integral to every industry and nearly every endeavor in our society. As a result, the governments around the world have become increasingly interested in the implications and how they might regulate the technology.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen with Internet regulation in the 1990s, high quality regulation can enable an industry to thrive while protecting consumers. However, as we’ve seen with the regulation of nuclear power, misguided and politicized regulation can kill an industry and greatly exacerbate problems like climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that advancing technology is critical for humanity’s future, so we will, for the first time, get involved with politics by supporting candidates who align with our vision and values specifically for technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While “Big Tech” is well represented in Washington D.C., their interests are often at odds with a positive technological future as they are more interested in regulatory capture and preserving their monopolies. As a result, technology startups need a voice.</p>
<p>We are non-partisan, one issue voters: If a candidate supports an optimistic technology-enabled future, we are for them. If they want to choke off important technologies, we are against them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, we believe:</p>
 
 America’s best days are ahead if we retain our global technology leadership. The primary thing that can undermine that is misguided regulatory policy. 
 Artificial Intelligence has the potential to uplift all of humanity to an unprecedented quality of living and must not be choked off in its infancy. We can do this by requiring that AI behaves within the law and rules of our society without regulating math, FLOPs, methods of R&amp;D, and other misguided ideas. 
 Decentralized technologies from the blockchain/crypto/web3 ecosystem will create a fairer, more inclusive economy than the centralized, monopoly-enabling technologies of web 2 and the industrial-era financial system. Still, we need clear regulation to eliminate bad actors exploiting the technology for nefarious purposes. 
 We are entering the golden era of biological research. AI is maturing at a time when life sciences and healthcare are also transforming into data-driven disciplines, with both industries increasingly driven by AI and engineering, with its power and opportunity to fundamentally change how we diagnose, treat, and manage disease and deliver health. However our regulatory regime and processes are built based on a model of crude industrial revolution era technologies. As a result, we risk harming far more people than we save with our “safety” measures. 
 
<p>Every penny we donate will go to support like-minded candidates and oppose candidates who aim to kill America’s advanced technological future. </p>

<p>While the marketplace business model is evergreen, every new platform changes how and where transactions happen. The Internet took us from classifieds and poster boards to sites like Amazon, eBay, and Craigslist, while mobile enabled apps like DoorDash, Uber, and Instacart.</p>
<p>Now, we believe generative AI promises to revolutionize marketplaces again. It will not only transform how products and services are sold — but also how they are made.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-1-ICONS-1.png"></a></p>
<p>GenAI will shake the foundations of the supply side for marketplaces, while also giving buyers access to unprecedented inventory and creating a much better user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next 3 to 5 years, we expect some existing marketplaces will pivot, some will go out of business, and some will be supercharged with the help of AI. We’ll also see a group of new companies built from the “ground up” around AI, which will likely look more dynamic than anything we’ve seen before.</p>
<p>Here’s where I see the opportunities — and what founders of legacy marketplaces may want to consider.</p>
 Demand Side   
<p>AI’s impact on buyers (the demand side) should be fairly consistent across marketplaces, and almost entirely positive. Both new and existing marketplaces that embrace AI should see key improvements such as:&nbsp;</p>
 New search modalities  
<p>Buyers will no longer have to search for items by an exact title, or meander through complex filters. They can use natural language, images, or even just a vibe to describe what they’re looking for and get results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes will reduce scrolling fatigue and make it more likely for a search to convert into a transaction. If you’ve ever spent 20 minutes or more browsing DoorDash, you understand that closing the gap from “inspiration” to actually finding what you’re looking for is crucial to getting an order placed.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-2.png"></a></p>
 Custom supply creation   
<p>Imagine a marketplace where a searched-for product (e.g., “mittens with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders_mittens_meme">the Bernie Sanders meme</a> printed on them”) doesn’t yet exist. The marketplace can then match the user with a supplier who is able to bring their vision to life — at the quality level and price they are looking for. Think of this as “Etsy on steroids” for every type of product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One example here is Pietra’s AI product design tools. Pietra allows creators and entrepreneurs to make products to sell to their audiences. The company recently launched an AI-first generator that can further customize (using natural language) SKUs that are then brought to life by the company’s marketplace of global manufacturers. CEO Ronak Trivedi<a href="https://twitter.com/therealRoShow/status/1731699885911732541"> has said</a> that 40% of the company’s custom manufacturing requests are already coming from the AI tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To see how it works in action, check out this short demo. For as long as we can, we're making this free to all entrepreneurs, not just Pietra members. <a href="https://t.co/oCKDgp53uu">pic.twitter.com/oCKDgp53uu</a></p>
<p>— Ronak Trivedi (@therealRoShow) <a href="https://twitter.com/therealRoShow/status/1728128003438440598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
 Negotiation and customer service   
<p>LA creative studio Brain recently released a virtual garage sale, where users haggled with AI to get lower prices on real products. While this was a one-time experiment, it opens up intriguing possibilities. Why shouldn’t marketplace buyers have an always-on assistant, trained on supplier data, that can answer questions, play price negotiator, or provide other forms of customer service? This could also be positive for suppliers, reducing time spent on non-core tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-3.png"></a></p>
 Supply Side   
<p>The impact of AI on sellers, or the supply side, is trickier. While the downstream implications might not be entirely positive for legacy marketplaces, they open up space for new marketplaces to emerge or existing marketplaces to pivot towards emerging opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see 2 main ways that AI will impact supply, based on the type of marketplace:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Digital or IRL product/service: Is what you’re selling delivered entirely digitally, or does it require “real world” inventory or infrastructure? </p>
<p>AI can’t fully replace a house on Airbnb…but it can help suppliers on the platform become more efficient, by automating their busywork (e.g. writing listings, answering questions from potential guests) so they can focus solely on the transaction.</p>
<p>In contrast, AI might actually replace “the product” for marketplaces that sell digital goods or services, such as Upwork. For example, why would you hire an online copywriting service if an AI can do similar work for free? Some of these marketplaces may face an existential challenge from AI.</p>
<p>2. Personal or commoditized supply: Is what you’re selling a commodity (price and availability are all that matters), or do users care about the specific SKU / supplier?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buying a logo on a site like Fiverr is, arguably, closer to the “commodity” end of the spectrum. You likely care more about getting a reasonable output for a reasonable price, versus the specific creator. This approach is more susceptible to AI automation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other cases, supply is truly personalized — e.g., buying content from your favorite Patreon creator. AI is less likely to fully replace these suppliers (at least in the near term) and is, instead, more likely to supercharge their work by helping them create content faster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on these 2 vectors, here’s how I predict different types of marketplaces will be impacted by genAI, from most to least disrupted.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-4.png"></a></p>
 Marketplaces selling digital, commodity products   
<p>Marketplaces <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2928076-5c52-43e9-8872-08fda2aa2fcf">like Upwork and Fiverr</a> have already seen a drop in transactions and earnings as buyers churn and generate the “product” themselves via AI tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-5.png"></a></p>
<p>These companies have an interesting decision to make. Do they pivot to focus on AI-native suppliers, who will offer their writing services at much lower prices, and try to make it up in volume? Or, do they train or fine-tune a model that can fully replace their own supply, at the risk of potentially losing buyers who prefer knowing a human did the work, but retaining all of the revenue? In this case, the company would become the one and only supplier.</p>
<p>Canva, which offers an in-platform marketplace of designs from independent creators, provides an interesting example here. The company is training a text-to-design model, but says it <a href="https://www.forbes.com.au/news/innovation/canva-to-indemnify-users-for-what-its-ai-spits-out/">will pay</a> development commissions to creators who contribute their data to the model from a 3-year $200 million creator fund.&nbsp;</p>
 Marketplaces selling digital, personalized products   
<p>Examples include Cameo or Patreon, where users are buying digital content or services, but care about who the specific supplier is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the near term, AI should “supercharge” these suppliers — giving them the ability to make more with less resources.&nbsp; With Cameo, for example, a celebrity could (hypothetically!) use ChatGPT to write scripts, HeyGen to generate a realistic avatar, and ElevenLabs to mimic their voice — completely outsourcing video creation to AI.</p>
 <a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-6.png"></a><p>If you’ve seen “deepfake Tom Cruise,” you know we’re not far from completely AI-generated Cameo videos!</p> 
<p>In the long run, celebrities may end up competing with deepfakes of themselves (are Cameos less “valuable” if anyone can generate them with AI?), or with other celebrities and influencers who join Cameo because AI makes it easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marketplaces will have to decide where to draw the line. Do they ban AI usage, build AI tools to augment their suppliers, or pivot towards AI-first supply? One option is allowing suppliers to offer a lightweight, AI-powered version of their product / service. On the photography platform <a href="https://imagen-ai.com/">Imagen</a>, users can pay to re-edit their photos in the style of known photographers. This is somewhere in-between a human-generated and AI-generated output, giving users a (likely) lower-cost product, but still with the “touch” of the supplier they care about.&nbsp;</p>
 Marketplaces selling physical, commodity products   
<p>Think Instacart or Uber, where users care about a base level of quality (alongside price and availability), but aren’t set on having a specific shopper, driver, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These marketplaces can use AI to streamline their seller operations. But beyond this, they will be less dramatically impacted.&nbsp;</p>
 Marketplaces selling physical, personalized products   
<p>Think Etsy, eBay, or Whatnot, where users are looking for a specific SKU or seller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would this be the case? The reality is, the Etsys and eBays of the world rely on individual suppliers to stay in business. These suppliers are currently hindered from selling more items by frustrating manual processes, such as uploading item descriptions, setting prices, providing customer service, cross-listing and managing inventory across platforms, and more. AI should be able to extract away all the pain here, making it easier for existing sellers to sell more — and for new sellers to get in the game!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legacy marketplaces like eBay have already started to test AI-powered functionalities. eBay’s new <a href="https://innovation.ebayinc.com/tech/features/magical-listing-tool-harnesses-the-power-of-ai-to-make-selling-on-ebay-faster-easier-and-more-accurate/">Magic Listing tool</a> turns a single photo into a full listing, filling in item traits and even generating a full text description, which are pretty sophisticated! In early testing, 95% of sellers used the AI description.</p>

 
	<a>
				
				
	</a>
     

<p>With more sellers listing items with more detail-filled descriptions, buyers are more likely to find something that fits what they’re looking for, kickstarting a positive flywheel of liquidity and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while we’ve largely talked about physical products, this also applies to services. For example – Incredible Health, a marketplace that connects nurses with health systems, <a href="https://www.incrediblehealth.com/blog/ai-features-nurse-hiring">recently launched</a> a resume generator to help more suppliers (nurses) succeed on the platform. As 30% of nurses start their job search without a quality resume, this “Resume Wizard” helps them create an optimized resume in five minutes.</p>
 The Future   
<p>The future is bright for marketplaces in the AI era. Buyers will have more options than ever, and AI will unlock a much more delightful user experience through natural language search, automated customer service, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the flip side, sellers will be able to do their jobs more efficiently, with the help of an AI assistant that serves as a second (or even third) pair of hands to drive their business. By abstracting away everything that isn’t core to the transaction, they can drive more volume and focus on the parts of the job where their “special touch” matters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end result? AI should drive more liquid and more stable marketplaces — with more listings, higher conversions to transaction, and more repeat purchases than ever before.&nbsp;</p>

Participants could follow whichever tracks they wished to based on their skills and enthusiasm — or even follow all&nbsp;three.</p><p>By the end of the final two&nbsp;weeks…</p>  Builders were invited to submit a project for selection by the Nym DevRel&nbsp;team  Operators were invited to submit a node for the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-delegation-programme-is-now-open-c371c74610c5">Delegations Programme</a>  Visionaries were invited to submit impact proposals either as an individual “Nymja” or as a “Squad” — organisations based on camaraderie, shared enthusiasm, group chats and multi-sigs. (If you want to dive deeper into squads, <a href="https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/">have a read of&nbsp;this…</a>)  <p>Many community members met new people during Shipyard and formed Nym Squads as operators, builders or visionaries.</p><blockquote>But you might be wondering what is a squad?? Squads are an organisational form based on camaraderie, shared enthusiasm, group chats and multi-sigs. If you want to dive deeper, have a read&nbsp;<a href="https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/">here…</a></blockquote> How were the winners selected? <p>Several squads submitted great projects across all three tracks. Winners were shortlisted by the team of track leads, with final winners selected by core team leadership on the basis of quality, completeness and to ensure a good spread across competencies and geographies.</p>  3 builder projects were&nbsp;approved  100 node operators have been selected for the Delegations Programme out of more than 300 applicants and have been notified individually  28 squads have been selected focusing on building software, building community, and building network&nbsp;capacity  <p>Thank you to everyone who applied. Due to the quality of applications Nym rewarded 28 squads instead of the initially planned&nbsp;10!</p><p>This is just the first round, so even if you weren’t successful this time, get ready to organise for next year — where new opportunities will open for promising squads and node operators.</p> Winning squads: spotlight <p>To give you a taste of some of the winning squads, here are a few of the most outstanding proposals:</p> <a href="https://github.com/TupiNymQuim">TupiNymQuim Squad</a> <p>One of the top-performing squads was TupiNymQuim of Brazil. Not only did they apply with a high-quality impact proposal strongly rooted in their community, they also built a Nym integration with <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> during the Shipyard Level 3 hackathon:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/TupiNymQuim/Incognito">Incognito Search</a>  <p>Congratulations!</p> <a href="https://github.com/Raw-Box/graypaper">Rawbox Squad</a> <p>Rawbox were another top performer, developing a strong proposal to create a Nym router with the mission to “create a basic physical infrastructure for a new generation of decentralized internet.” The RawBox router will be based on<a href="https://opnsense.org/"> OPNsense</a> (FOSS enterprise-grade firewall), BTCPay Server, and Nym services.</p><p>Congratulations!</p> <a href="https://linktr.ee/lunardao">LunarDao Squad</a> <p>LunarDao Squad hardly needs an introduction among those who have been working and advocating for privacy online. LunarDAO is one of the first truly anonymous decentralised organisations with a main focus on collective investment into privacy projects, while also focusing on education and Lunarpunk culture. An important ecosystem partner for Nym, they enable Nym engagement and adoption among Web3 privacy OGs and newbies&nbsp;alike.</p> <a href="https://t.me/CoinMetrika">CoinMetrika</a> <p>If you’re familiar with the crypto scene of the CIS region, or have had a closer look at the nodes making up the Nym mixnet in the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">network explorer</a>, CoinMetrika may ring a bell. Long-time Nym supporters and node operators, CoinMetrika is a popular Russian-speaking group focused on crypto education and running validators for various blockchain projects. As part of their Squad Grant, CoinMetrika is joining the Nym Delegations Programme as Russian-speaking mentors, and will spread the word about Nym and its mission within the CIS&nbsp;region.</p><p>Smaller grants were awarded to squads who are just starting out with their local communities. These included:</p> <a href="https://heather-yacht-ddf.notion.site/Roadmap-f40e3b3e621d4c9e96858dcc5a51a1c0">Ukraine Privacy Alliance&nbsp;Squad</a> <p>The UPA squad (not to be confused with the <a href="https://privacyalliance.com/">Universal Privacy Alliance</a>) was formed by the growing Ukrainian community. Their objectives include setting up nodes and producing educational material in Ukrainian, pursuing local partnerships and more. Nym has a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/be-brave-as-ukraine-build-anondrop-at-the-kyiv-tech-summit-hackathon-4959ea99cfb8">long-standing relationship with Ukraine</a> as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-could-help-anonymously-document-war-crimes">reported</a> so it is only fitting to boost the local community and Ukrainian language&nbsp;content!</p> WSA Squad (Web3 Safety Advancers) <p>The WSA Squad was set up by Nymja cadets in Bangladesh to educate the local Web3 community on privacy. The grant will enable them to set up nodes and begin education on Nym and privacy in the&nbsp;region!</p> Privacy Warriors&nbsp;Squad <p>The Privacy Warriors squad was formed by Turkish Nym community members with the aim of establishing partnerships with Turkish universities, holding events and creating Nym Turkish language content and educational material. The Turkish community is one of the largest and most active communities around Nym and this will help level up the resources and events available to strengthen the community and make it increasingly autonomous.</p> And finally the top reward goes&nbsp;to… <p>The top reward of 100,000 NYM tokens went to outstanding community member <a href="https://twitter.com/pawnflake">Pawnflake</a> for building <a href="https://explorenym.net/">ExploreNym</a>!</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/community-spotlight-introducing-explore-nym-delegation-advisor-f713b64b1478">Community spotlight: introducing Explore Nym &amp; Delegation Advisor</a></p><p>Last year, Pawnflake joined the very first Shipyard Academy and went from being a full time gamer to teaching himself how to code and growing his skills to become a pillar of the Nym community. Pawnflake will be leading mentorship in the Nym Delegations Programme.</p><p>Congratulations and a huge thank you to Pawnflake for all his work, enthusiasm and dedication to the Nym&nbsp;mission!</p><p>These are just a handful of the many incredible projects — scroll down to the bottom of this post for the full list of fantastic winners.</p> Nym Shipyard: what&nbsp;next? <p>Shipyard was just the beginning of training and preparing the Nym community for next year. Nym will be launching its first commercial application, <a href="https://nymvpn.com/">the NymVPN</a>, on the mixnet. This means everyone will need to step up to prove that this powerful privacy infrastructure is run by a strong community of operators and token&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>Squads will play a crucial role in 2024, increasingly responsible for autonomously leading the Nym communities across the world. They will act as hubs of knowledge, running channels, running high-quality nodes, organising builders and beta-testers, running workshops, hackathons and more. Each squad will be unique, shaped by the talents of the founding&nbsp;members.</p><p>Be among the first to find out more — peek into 2024 on Friday, 15 December for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myt6QE_U4FY">last Nym community call of&nbsp;2023</a>!</p> Full list of winning&nbsp;squads <p>An enormous 104 squads submitted impact proposals.

In addition, we would also like to thank the co-authors of EIP-6963 for helping to find an interoperable solution to this long standing issue. In particular, thank you to Pedro Gomes (<a href="https://github.com/pedrouid">@pedrouid</a>), Kosala Hemachandra (<a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke">@kvhnuke</a>), Richard Moore (<a href="https://github.com/ricmoo">@ricmoo</a>), Gregory Markou (<a href="https://github.com/GregTheGreek">@GregTheGreek</a>), Kyle Den Hartog (<a href="https://github.com/kdenhartog">@kdenhartog</a>), Glitch (<a href="https://github.com/glitch-txs">@glitch-txs</a>), Jake Moxey (<a href="https://github.com/jxom">@jxom</a>), Pierre Bertet (<a href="https://github.com/bpierre">@bpierre</a>), Darryl Yeo (<a href="https://github.com/darrylyeo">@darrylyeo</a>), and Yaroslav Sergievsky (<a href="https://github.com/everdimension">@everdimension</a>). Finally, we’d like to thank the participants of the 6963 task force Telegram channel and those who participated in discussions on the AllWalletDevs Discord channel. This post was written by Kyle Den Hartog.</p>
<p>Today, Brave is announcing the launch of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963">EIP-6963</a> support in Brave Wallet on iOS, Android, and Desktop. Together with other digital wallets and connection libraries, this update is the first step to improving the UX onboarding experience shared between DApps and wallets. With the addition of EIP-6963, we’ve worked with various wallets to coordinate and ship a modification to a very specific implementation decision made early on in Metamask—a decision that ended up becoming a de facto standard, and limiting users’ experiences with Web3. In a nutshell, EIP-6963 support makes it easier than ever for users to use many different wallets without hidden workarounds like changing settings or setting up separate browser profiles for each wallet.</p>

 How did we get here? 
<p>When extension-based wallets were first created, there was a pattern established around how DApps communicated with wallets: they used extension scripts to inject a JavaScript object called “window.ethereum”, which DApps then built around in order to communicate with the wallet. Due to the way JavaScript works in the browser, this pattern worked well when there was only a single wallet. However, once people began installing multiple wallets, the pattern created a new and frustrating problem. Wallets had to “fight” over the window.ethereum object by treating prototype pollution as a feature instead of a bug.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this created odd interactions for end users: when they clicked “connect” on the DApp, it had no way to communicate with the wallet the user selected on the page. Worse, the wallet had no way to detect which wallets the user had installed, and so many of the DApps just assumed the user was using MetaMask. This explains why, when you try to use a DApp, clicking MetaMask will actually pop up a different wallet.</p>

 How does EIP-6963 fix this? 
<p>Essentially, we as a group of wallet developers and connection libraries decided in this spec to define a different communication method—one that didn’t require wallets to compete over a single JavaScript object. Instead, wallets could all “announce” themselves individually, providing the DApp a way to simply listen for all of these announcements. Furthermore, the various wallet options could identify themselves more easily and supply an image to the page, thus optimizing the process of selecting a wallet. This was achieved through an event-concurrency loop built on EventListeners and Events.</p>

 What does it look like? 


    
    

    


    



<p>Just like that, you can now utilize many different wallets at the same time with DApps that support EIP-6963.</p>

 What’s possible with this new pattern? 
<p>This work opens new patterns that weren’t previously possible. DApps can even choose to ignore window.ethereum altogether and communicate with multiple wallet providers at the same time. That means, for example, that your favorite DeFi DApp can simultaneously connect your cold wallet with a ledger hardware via Brave Wallet, and your hot wallet in Metamask. You could thus have two addresses connected at the same time, perform a swap, and more seamlessly move your tokens between a hot and a cold wallet. These possibilities only scratch the surface, and over time we should see some new and interesting user experiences (ones we at Brave are excited to support) especially in the form of additional privacy for users.</p>
<p>To conclude, with friendly coordination of leading wallet builders, users should expect to see improved wallet connection experiences across the Web3 DApp landscape, ready for the next major influx of users. To try the new connection experience with Brave Wallet, visit <a href="https://eip6963.org">https://eip6963.org</a> made by the <a href="https://github.com/walletconnect/eip6963/">WalletConnect</a> team. And be sure to let your favorite DApps know they should start supporting EIP-6963 too!</p>

<p>Over the past half century, Wall Street was completely revolutionized by computers.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, human brokers on the stock exchange floor haggled to buy and sell every stock, writing their agreements on pieces of paper.</p>
<p>But in 1971, the NASDAQ, the world’s first electronic stock exchange, was introduced. Electronic trading platforms followed in the 1980s, and the rise of the internet in the 1990s brought online brokerages like E*TRADE.</p>
<p>In the 2000s, technology radically changed not just how stocks were traded, but the decision behind which stocks to trade. Firms like Citadel, DE Shaw, and Two Sigma started to employ High Frequency Trading, computer algorithms capable of executing thousands of trades per second.</p>
<p>Quants, the algorithm writers, overtook master traders, who manually studied companies. Algorithms overtook hunches. The quant funds who led the pack raked in hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>100% of stock trades used to be made by humans. Today, <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/10/05/the-stockmarket-is-now-run-by-computers-algorithms-and-passive-managers">80%</a> are made by computer algorithms.</p>
<p>AI is about to bring a similar <a href="https://a16z.com/ai-at-the-intersection-the-a16z-investment-thesis-on-ai-in-bio-health/">revolution to healthcare</a>.</p>
<p>Over the next few decades, at least half of the $4.3 trillion dollar American healthcare industry will be <a href="https://a16z.com/where-will-ai-have-the-biggest-impact-healthcare/">AI-driven</a>.</p>
<p>AI will drive <a href="https://a16z.com/digital-biology/">drug discovery</a>, proposing medicines not yet dreamed up by man. AI will play a key role in diagnosis, <a href="https://a16z.com/the-next-webmd-an-llm-as-your-front-door-to-healthcare/">helping humans know what’s wrong sooner</a> so they can get access to life-saving treatments. AI will change <a href="https://a16z.com/commercializing-ai-in-healthcare-the-jobs-to-be-done/">how care is delivered</a>, as every human will have a world-class AI doctor in their pocket. And AI will <a href="https://a16z.com/ai-the-teammate-clinicians-need/">eliminate a lot of the infuriating back office minutia</a> in healthcare.</p>
<p>The markets are significantly undervaluing this opportunity.</p>
<p>This is partially because the market only knows non-AI healthcare companies today. In the <a href="https://a16z.com/healthtech-show-your-magic/">digital health public markets</a>, there are (1) tech-enabled service companies that have excelled in speedy go-to-markets, but have been low margin due to human labor, and (2) healthcare SaaS companies that are high-margin, but have struggled in go-to-market because of the difficulties of selling SaaS to human-loving healthcare entities.</p>
<p>AI health companies will not have these limitations. Margins will be way better than human services. Go-to-market will be far easier because AI companies can sell “AI humans,” as opposed to fighting the uphill battle of selling software on which healthcare companies must train their overworked employees. Just like the internet completely transformed go-to-market for software companies, AI will transform <a href="https://a16z.com/commercializing-ai-in-healthcare-the-enterprise-buyer-perspective/">go-to-market</a> for healthtech companies.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the scale of the AI opportunity in healthcare, consider that publicly traded, profitable healthcare companies today (excluding pharma) generate $2.6 trillion in revenue and yet turn only $170 billion (~6.5%) of that revenue into profit. Imagine if these were able to achieve even a 15% increase in efficiency1 for having infinite access to low-cost AI “workers.” That alone would drive $314 billion more in operating profit and ultimately $5.6 trillion in incremental enterprise value, even assuming no improvement in valuation multiples or growth in topline revenue. That would nearly triple the enterprise value of profitable public healthcare companies, and we believe that number is conservative!</p>
 <p>Source: CapIQ as of 11/30/2023; Andreessen Horowitz analysis</p> 
<p>So will this happen? What kinds of companies will capture this AI opportunity?</p>
<p>We can look to the introduction of the internet in the 1990s to see what happened in the last technological revolution. Pre-internet—in 1990—the biggest companies at the time were largely in non-tech industries like oil and gas (Exxon Mobil), pharma (Merck), CPG (Coca-Cola), auto (GM), and telecom (AT&amp;T). While some small public companies in the 1990s like Apple and Microsoft embraced the internet and 500x-ed to become the biggest companies in the world, the vast majority of value accrued to startups founded as the internet was taking off. Today these startups—Alphabet, Meta, Amazon—have knocked all of the aforementioned biggest companies of 1990 off the top 10 list.</p>
<p>The same will likely happen with AI in healthcare. While some public healthcare companies will transform their strategies with AI and excel because of it, the vast majority of the value will accrue to AI health companies being started now.</p>
<p>Today resembles the early days of the internet. Will there be an AI bubble that bursts just like the dot com one did? Probably. But the best companies will rise from the ashes and transform human health.</p>

<p>There is a unique window of opportunity today for a new 3D Creation Engine (aka game engine) to revolutionize the way we create games, film, virtual worlds, and simulations. Unity, Unreal, Roblox and Godot – the predominant 3D engines – are all 15+ year old technologies architected for a different era of computing. The emergence of generative AI, cloud computing, and new spatial platforms is poised to disrupt 3D creation end-to-end. And, in the case of Unity, the damaged trust from their <a href="https://x.com/tkexpress11/status/1702054746411221386?s=20">recent pricing change execution</a> has left the community seeking alternatives.</p>
  Brief History Of Game Engines 
<p>Humans have always desired to construct and explore worlds of our own imagination. From the age-old realms created in myths to the digital domains we traverse today in video games, the fidelity of these worlds has never been more immersive nor culturally impactful. And with AI, we are only beginning to understand the possibilities.</p>
<p>Up to now, bringing transcendent virtual worlds to our screens has been the domain of only a few supremely talented creators – legends like Shigeru Miyamoto, James Cameron and George Lucas. Today, we’re entering an age where creative technology will allow anyone to create virtual worlds and bring their imaginations to life.</p>
<p>A game engine is the canvas by which these real-time 3D interactive worlds are constructed and rendered. They combine 3D assets (characters, props/objects, environment, etc), animation (how they move), code (how they work), physics (how they interact), sound effects (how they sound), particle effects (smoke, fire, liquid, etc) and narration/speech (what they say).</p>
<p>Before the 2010s, most studios developed their own internal engines to build their games. Now, almost all games are built using the third party engines shown below, excluding some of the largest AAA budget games that still develop on their own (e.g. EA’s Frostbite, Infinity Ward Engine, etc).</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Engine-Market-Map-large-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Today, “game engines” are used not just to author video games but any virtual simulation – thus we’re renaming the game engine to 3D Creation Engine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first half century of computer graphics, there was a bifurcation of tech, tools, and rendering pipelines to develop games and everything else that required high visual fidelity: animation/VFX, architectural visualization, advertising, etc. While games are rendered in real-time on end-user devices based on input, VFX/animation shots are rendered offline in data centers and “pre-canned.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around the same time that Unreal Engine (“UE”) was being developed, Pixar released RenderMan, which was the state of the art offline renderer for CGI/animation. The name RenderMan was coined in reference to the Sony Walkman for a futuristic rendering software that was so tiny it could fit inside a pocket. Of course, this vision came to reality through the games industry (which is often the tip of the spear for technological innovations). Now, as game engines’ graphics capabilities reach near photorealistic, the industries and toolsets are colliding.</p>
  What is a Next Generation 3D Creation Engine? 
<p>Below are some of the key technologies that will underpin the emergence of new 3D Creation Engines:</p>
 AI native engines unlock creativity at the speed of thought 
<p>We are moving towards a state where creation may start with a simple text box to generate a first draft of your project. And with that, the barriers to entry for new creators dramatically decrease. Given 3D experiences are an amalgamation of art, sound, animation, code, physics and more, a fully AI-native engine will not call underlying generative models in isolation but the models will be multi-modal, leveraging semantic scene or world understanding as input. You place a desk asset in an office setting. An AI copilot then suggests “auto-filling” the scene with appropriate office furniture, like a chair, computer, bookshelves, and office supplies. A character dropped into a room has a physics based understanding of the setting and inherently knows the animation it should enact to roll the chair out and sit on it without the developer having to choose and apply a specific animation file. The relevant sound effect is then generated in real-time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the help of AI, the creation experience moves towards auto-pilot but the creator should always be able to intervene and express directorial control over any decision. <a href="https://a16z.com/the-generative-ai-revolution-in-games/">No longer will content creation be the project bottleneck</a> but team collaboration and review. Creator roles within a studio will move from <a href="https://x.com/tkexpress11/status/1605298183386472448?s=20">extreme specialization</a> (e.g. riggers, environment artists, texture painters) towards creative generalists.</p>
 Cloud native engines maximize customization 
<p>Today’s engines are monolithic desktop applications originally designed before modern cloud architecture and the SaaS age. The engine should be highly modular, built on microservices and APIs allowing developers to assemble the right engine for the project at hand without the bloat that today’s engines can bring. Further, with the assets, data, and transformations co-located in the cloud vs locally, developers can scale compute elastically to complete a specific task. Also, rather than deliver a large static build of a game to the end player, assets can be streamed progressively from the cloud.&nbsp;</p>
 Multiplayer co-creation for fast iteration by distributed teams 
<p>Other creation suites in our toolbelt have moved to cloud native applications (Google Suite, Figma, Canva, Replit, <a href="https://sequence.film/">Sequence</a>, etc) but game development has lagged behind. A cloud native engine will enable creation of 3D experiences using any device from anywhere via a browser. It would allow creators to easily and instantly collaborate together in real time with a globally distributed team, increasing iteration speed. Version control systems would be built in natively, just like Google Docs.</p>
 UX that adapts to creators 
<p>Part of the magic of cloud native applications is that the UX can be adaptable. There are many personas in a game studio: from artists to developers with varying levels of technical knowhow. Yet, despite different personas and many different use cases for 3D Creation Engines (gaming vs VFX, etc), the editor UX remains constant. For a novice, it can be incredibly daunting. A cloud based, modular application can offer many different UX’s. The editor may gradually introduce more functionality and controllability to the user as they climb the learning curve. The engine may also have a marketplace of third-party editor UXs with each built to serve a particular use-case.&nbsp;</p>
 Community modding enabled out of the box 
<p>A next gen engine should be designed to enable a first-class modding environment out of the box that developers can choose to extend to end user creators. Because the editor, assets, and data will live in the cloud, a developer will have the option to extend a secure and controlled cloud sandbox environment – much like the one they used to develop the original game – to creators outside the studio. Modders will be able to remix another’s creation and republish with ease.&nbsp;</p>
  How Will a Next Gen Creation Engine Arise? 
<p>It is unlikely that a Next Gen Engine emerges that simultaneously tries to serve as many use cases on as many platforms as we see with Unity and Unreal today. It becomes an incredibly deep tech investment not just to get to an MVP but to then break through the developer cold start problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than competing with the incumbent engines head on trying to serve every use case, a Next Gen Engine will likely arise through a few routes where a traditional game engine is unbundled:</p>
 
 Vertical Focus: Best-in-class at serving a specific game genre or art style&nbsp; 
 New Platforms: Optimizing for a specific platform 
 AI World Generator: Building a consumer facing AI world building platform 
 
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Unbundling-the-Engine-large-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The incumbent engines have the advantage of having a developer base of millions trained in their tools that studios can hire from. They have a vast marketplace of third party plug-ins, add-ons and integrations in addition to whatever proprietary plug-ins studios might have built themselves. There’s a wealth of community knowledge and learning materials documented in forums, textbooks and tutorial videos. Any professional studio choosing to build on a young untested engine does so at substantial risk to their production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unity, founded in 2004, took nearly 5 years of bootstrapping to launch the engine, cultivate a cult following of Mac hobbyist developers, raise venture funding and ascend the curve of relevancy such that studios with real budgets were willing to bet their projects on Unity. To boot, it likely would have failed – alongside a large graveyard of past engine failures – had it not been for the serendipitous luck that came with the launch of the iPhone and the fact that Unity was perfectly suited to support it as a build target.</p>
<p>For a new engine to break through, we’re more likely to see an unbundling with a focus on a few specific use cases to start.</p>
 Vertical Focus 
<p>The next widely used engine will likely start as a modding and vertical creation platform around a specific game genre or art style rather than a general purpose, horizontal engine. Think Unreal Editor for Fortnite, not Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to convince developers to build on a new third-party engine that hasn’t been proven out by either the engine developer themselves or other successful game developers. Unreal Engine of course was born out of the development of Epic’s games Unreal and Unreal Tournament. Developers need to be inspired by the capabilities and art of the game and assured that the engine is battle tested. Even Unity grew out of a failed game called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luDwU3JGw5A">Gooball</a>. Godot was used by the engine creators to ship games for nearly 10 years before the engine was open-sourced.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a GTM strategy and as a way to prove out the engine, we are likely to see the developer build the first game (or series of games) on top of the platform. Enabled by AI, doing so should be possible at a fraction of the time and cost to develop a game over the last decade. The first party content does not necessarily need to be a smash hit. It just needs to seed the platform and kickstart the creator flywheel until a viral hit (e.g. the Fortnite Battle Royale mode) is found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year Epic launched Unreal Editor for Fortnite (“UEFN”) which is a vertical UGC platform around Fortnite. The creation tools abstract a lot of the complexity from the flagship UE. The platform today is mostly a collection of custom training modes or maps for Fortnite Battle Royale with visions to expand out in terms of game types/genres.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that today the value of a consumer facing UGC platform far outpaces a game engine. Roblox can safely demand a 30% revenue share whereas UE takes less than 5% (and only 12% in total including the Epic Gaming Store contribution). The attractiveness of the UGC business model is why Epic’s investment behind UEFN likely now surpasses that of UE alone.</p>
<p>Rather than having two separate creation tool sets (UEFN and UE), however, if technically architected properly from the get-go, a next gen engine could allow a creator to publish a mod/game into the UGC platform or self-publish externally from the same tool. The modular engine could adapt to the skill level and specs of the project. When a Roblox developer “levels up” and is ready to self-publish their own game outside of the platform, they leave the ecosystem and have to go learn Unity or Unreal. With a next gen UGC platform and engine that would not be necessary.</p>
<p>We may see a collection of vertical, genre-focused platforms emerge. Where UEFN best serves lovers of Battle Royale/Third Person Shooter games, you may see an equivalent for Real-Time Strategy, sports, party or 2D games. For example, <a href="https://www.pahdolabs.com/">Pahdo Labs</a> is building an anime ARPG game and creation platform around it. <a href="https://www.robotogames.com/">Roboto Games</a> is developing a survival crafting game plus modding platform. <a href="https://www.ocp.gg/">Omni Creator Products</a> is building a UGC platform around its sandbox game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the vertical creation platforms we’re likely to see will be around <a href="https://a16z.com/the-neverending-game-how-ai-will-create-a-new-category-of-games/">AI native games</a> equipped with AI NPCs alongside asset, voice and sound generation at runtime. Having a flagship game pave the way for how the underlying systems and AI models should best work together will create a great starting place for other creators to design even better games on top. In fact, in some ways we’re already seeing early signs of this with <a href="https://www.convex.dev/ai-town">AI Town</a> which is an AI “simulated dollhouse” game with autonomous agents. Creations like <a href="https://zaranova.xyz/">Zaranova</a> are building off of the <a href="https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town">base project</a> framework, which already has an AI agent stack, to create their own game designs off the core experience. <a href="https://incite.dev/">Incite Interactive</a> is building a platform to build AI native narrative-based games.</p>
<p>Some of these creation platforms may build the engine from scratch or they may fork an open source engine similar to how <a href="https://www.themirror.space/">The Mirror</a> has built their platform off Godot. Each platform though will need to deeply embrace AI into the creation workflows to make it 10x easier for new creators and kickstart the player to creator flywheel. While it’s unlikely you will see the current crop of professional studios building off these new engines from the start, new studios will emerge who are native to the tools just as we saw on mobile then Roblox and now UEFN.</p>
 New Target Platforms 
<p>Unity and Unreal will also be unbundled by new engines best serving new target platforms such as XR or underserved platforms like the 3D web. While Unreal and Unity try to support all platforms enabling cross-platform development, they make performance tradeoffs with the engine for the one-size-fits all approach. Both Unity and Unreal (to a greater degree) have heavy runtimes that make it challenging to deliver high performance 3D experiences to low powered XR devices and the browser. Having a built to suit engine designed at a low level for these devices would maximize graphics performance. For a few examples, <a href="https://ambient.run/">Ambient.Run</a> looks to support browser games and <a href="https://wonderlandengine.com/">Wonderland</a> supports WebXR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will also see the emergence of immersive/spatial 3D creation applications. It can be painful to develop a spatial computing experience from a 2D screen. Having an authoring experience in XR that is native to the device can be transformative in terms of achieving the full design intent. Certain 3D artistry tools like mesh sculpting feels tailor made for <a href="https://x.com/nickbeyeler/status/1728240988735565900?s=20">spatial computing with gestural inputs more akin to sculpting in the physical world</a>. <a href="https://volumetrics.io/">Volumetrics</a> is building a native 3D authoring platform and engine for spatial apps.</p>
<p>We’ve previously predicted <a href="https://x.com/tkexpress11/status/1648330486518005765?s=20">a rise in browser based games</a> driven in part by WebGPU, WebAssembly, WebXR etc and for the distribution advantages developers enjoy over the app stores where they face the 30% fee. A more lightweight engine that can reach peak performance in the browser could earn market share.</p>
<p>In tech, there is always a constant pendulum swing between unbundling and rebundling. Ultimately, these engine unbundling approaches are market wedges to find soft spots where a new creation tool can provide 10x improvement over incumbents. Once they gain their edge, It’s likely that a next gen engine could expand its focus/potential over time, similar to how Roblox is now trying to level up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tu40neoRMw">support photorealistic games</a>. The modular engine that underpins a vertical creation platform could expand towards another genre (more easily than it took UE to expand from shooters to any genre). An XR-focused engine could expand to support cross-platform development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 AI World Generator 
<p>Just as 3D creation gets unbundled and streamlined, we will simultaneously see the emergence of new consumer-facing tools that reimagine 3D world building as we know it. These tools will seem so unorthodox that many game devs will initially think<a href="https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy"> it’s a “toy</a>,” because that’s exactly what it will be. In fact, the “game” will likely not be in the output but in the creation experience itself.</p>
<p>Imagine taking a single picture or a text prompt and <a href="https://x.com/Koven_Yu/status/1733192368508322080?s=20">generating a 3D scene</a> on the fly. You step into the scene, potentially with a VR headset, and explore endlessly. See something you don’t like? Reprompt the scene either in part or in whole. Under the hood, as you move, the frames are each generated in real-time–not rendered in the traditional computer graphics paradigm.</p>
<p>Today, the closest representation we have of this experience would be static scenes captured using scanning apps like <a href="https://lumalabs.ai/">Luma</a> or <a href="https://poly.cam/">Polycam</a> which allow you to step into an enclosed environment you’ve observed in the real world frozen in time. In recent months, we’ve seen massive technical leaps in generative AI towards this use case. <a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/">3D Gaussian Splatting</a>, released in August, was a meaningful improvement over Neural Radiance Field (NeRFs) 3D capture methods offering much faster rendering speeds, more editability and better quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon, however, new applications will emerge allowing us to make the scenes dynamic, first by <a href="https://twitter.com/8infinite8/status/1729456066394485134?s=46&amp;t=932SdFEpIbgWUFU1sOkrmQ">reanimating characters</a> captured or <a href="https://neuralradiancefields.io/gaussianeditor-swift-and-precise-3dgs-editing/">dropping new objects into the scene</a> with inpainting. Then, we will be able to expand beyond the captured scene, essentially out-painting and allowing the model to hallucinate an endless perimeter. The models may even begin to <a href="https://neuralradiancefields.io/physgaussian-gives-3d-gaussian-splatting-physics/">understand the laws of physics</a>, which would allow you to actually interact with the environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In time, these scenes will be generated not by capturing several hundred images of a desired scene in the real world, but by <a href="https://x.com/alexcarliera/status/1733548910487191962?s=20">prompting with a single image or text</a>. Present the model with an image from your childhood and re-enter the world like a time machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hard to predict all the emergent use cases that are unlocked by this 3D worldbuilding potential. From the consumer side, the act of imaginatively building a world, recreating a memory or exploring a dream-like environment will be groundbreaking. As the tools mature and controllability refined, professional use cases will develop. From creating a virtual stage for a film to architectural visualizations and walkthroughs, the tools will move from the toybox to the enterprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  So What Does This All Mean? 
<p>The landscape of 3D Creation Engines will change dramatically over the next decade which will in turn alter the face of the entertainment industry at large.&nbsp;</p>
 Existing game engines will persist…but only in the near-term 
<p>Unity and Unreal will likely maintain their dominance within traditional professional studios early on. They will introduce AI-assisted tooling into their legacy UX. But as these new age creation platforms arise off the back of AI, cloud computing and new hardware, a new generation of professionals will be ushered in just as we’ve seen in music and video. As the next gen engines mature, even legacy professional studios will adopt.</p>
<p>Roblox, and now UEFN, have a stronger foothold because of the network effects of their UGC platforms, which speaks to the value of enabling UGC.</p>
 We’ll witness a cambrian explosion in content diversity 
<p>As the training and cost to create approaches zero, the only limit is one’s imagination, not the technical skills required. With that, we’ll see a cambrian explosion of new games and interactive entertainment experiences. As we’ve seen in the past, modding and bringing new creators into the ecosystem creates genre defining games. Blizzard’s Warcraft II had a world editor used by a modder to create “Aeon of Strife” a MOBA style game which later inspired “Eul” to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota">DotA</a> in Warcraft III’s editor which ultimately led to League of Legends, the iconic MOBA game.</p>
 3D Creation Engines should charge a revenue share vs SaaS pricing 
<p>We believe Unreal and (now) Unity have paved the way for a future engine to charge a revenue royalty share rather than a fixed SaaS price fee. Between 2-5% of revenue will likely remain the norm to use a commercial engine and all the services that come with it.</p>
<p>The next gen cloud engine equipped with native modding capabilities will enable the “UEFN platform in a box.” A developer building on the engine can build a game and instantly unlock a modding marketplace where they can benefit from a share of the end creator’s revenue. The engine developer themselves may also see a share of the revenue from the modding platform they power. This would be as if Epic licensed its entire tech platform (i.e. engine, multiplayer stack, economy/payments stack, etc) for UEFN to another developer.</p>
<p>Here’s an illustration of the monetization potential from the engine developer’s perspective:</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Three-Parallel-Paths-For-Creators-to-Publish-Their-Game-large-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
 Games and film become indistinguishable 
<p>Culturally, Hollywood and the games industry have already been <a href="https://x.com/tkexpress11/status/1613921332714168323?s=20">colliding</a> with one of the year’s most popular TV Shows (The Last of Us) and movies (Super Mario Bros) originating from gaming while one of the most popular new games of the year was Hogwarts Legacy.</p>
<p>The tech stacks have been merging too with 3D Creation Engines being used for VFX/animation pre visualization, then virtual production and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU0gvPcc3jQ">soon final renders</a> – per the original RenderMan vision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a production standpoint, soon The Last of Us or Harry Potter may not need separate 3D assets for their movies vs games. Film crews will be able to capture a scene with a camera then use AI and a “virtual camera” to generate the scene from a different vantage point. If they don’t like the cut – how the actor read a line, how the extras moved, etc – the director can fix it in post-production with a text prompt.</p>
<p>From a consumer perspective, Netflix (or a disruptor) will likely ship with a runtime player where we can hit pause at any moment and step into the world of Hogwarts and explore the virtual world. In time, we will even be able to go on my own quests and interact with the AI NPCs I encounter, which are as lifelike as Hollywood actors.&nbsp;</p>
 Endless games and finite attention time reshifts the landscape 
<p>First, known IP will matter more than ever. We can imagine known IP like Harry Potter becoming vertical creator sandboxes for these interactive worlds. Some experiences will employ intentional game design from creators. Creators who want to tell linear stories will also be able to within these “virtual sets”. Or if the consumer wants to explore the wizarding world in an unstructured way to create their own adventures that option will be available to them too.</p>
<p>Second, content recommendation algorithms will improve. As consumers interact with more content within each platform, the platform will be able to recommend better content based on their interests. While it’s possible 3D Creation Engines will eventually be able to automatically create personalized content – we think it is unlikely this content wins out with players. Human creative innovation will always reign supreme – AI will help bring it to life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 The future is interactive 
<p>Everything in the world of gaming and entertainment will change. Any world our imagination takes us to can be depicted on screens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will not happen overnight as there are many challenges to overcome: research problems remain unsolved, the compute requirements are tremendous, new business models will need to be invented, and likely most importantly, founders need to discover the right AI native creation UX to balance ease of use with power and depth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, this new future of entertainment that only recently seemed incomprehensible is just a few years away, and the future is interactive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are entering a new frontier in life sciences unparalleled in human history, as emerging technologies are changing the biotech industry along a few vectors including decreasing costs in sequencing, synthesis, etc., the ability to program, simulate and iterate in silico and in vivo and entrepreneurial accessibility. BlueYard’s strategy around biology is based on the premise that humankind’s ability to engineer and understand biology will not only fundamentally transform how we diagnose, treat, and manage disease, but also reinvent how we produce new materials and the food required to support human life and sustain our planet. In recognition of these step-function changes, over the last years, we have backed a dozen companies in the space — ranging from <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/clock-bio-7275d798ba82">cellular reprogramming to combat aging</a> to <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/origin-bio-b3932d07b50b">sustainable material</a>s produced in microbes.</p><p>We believe tomorrow’s industry-defining biology companies will be founded by technologists and scientists who are building the interconnected elements that can become the fabric of our future (see our <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/blueyard-3-74255d983edc">thesis</a>). We are excited about empowering this next generation of founders and have renewed our partnership with <a href="https://nucleate.xyz/">Nucleate</a>, the student-led non-profit organization dedicated to empowering the next generation of biotech leaders, aimed at fostering innovation in science at the earliest&nbsp;stages.</p><p>This year, Nucleate has expanded in Europe by opening core chapters in Germany and Denmark. Via our partnership, Nucleate has committed a pool of up to $2 million to fund the next generation of founders that have made it through the organization’s six-month Activator Program during 2024. The objective is to back 10 to 20 new teams across the European ecosystem as they migrate from the academic lab to a commercial entity and build the new platforms that re-engineer our society’s biology experiences.</p><p>We are also excited to announce the winners of the 2023 Nucleate Venture Prize. In total we awarded $1.45 million in the form of uncapped SAFEs to fund early-stage companies working across synthetic biology, therapeutics and drug delivery:</p>  Fusix (Technical University of Munich) — Fusogenic oncolytic viruses.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.5.0.</p>



<p>This release includes a “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP) implementation of shielded scanning, with a new “zebra-scan” crate and behind an experimental “shielded-scan” feature. This marks the first step towards full support for shielded scanning in Zebra and we’re excited to continue building out the functionality. Ongoing development is tracked in issue <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7728">#7728</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Important Security Warning 



<p>This new feature is for experimental use only and has known security issues. We recommend that you do NOT use regular or sensitive viewing keys with Zebra’s experimental scanning feature. You should also NOT use this feature on a shared machine. If you do want to <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan.html">try this out</a>, we suggest that you generate new keys for experimental use.</p>



<p>Also included in this release:</p>



 
 A fix for a panic that was introduced in Zebra v1.4.0, which happens in rare circumstances when reading cached sprout or history trees. 



 Further improvements to how Zebra recovers from network interruptions and prevents potential network hangs. 



 Improvements to limit the ability of synthetic nodes to spread throughout the network through Zebra, to address some of the Ziggurat red team report. 
 



<p><br>As of this release, Zebra requires Rust 1.73 to build. </p>

 Episode Transcript 
<p>This transcript has been condensed and edited for readability and clarity.</p>
<p>Seema Amble: Let’s start off by talking about the founding story of Modern Treasury and a little bit of background from leaving LendingHome [currently named, Kiavi].</p>
<p>Dimitri Dadiomov: Sure, well Modern Treasury really came out of a set of pain points we had at LendingHome. So I was a product manager managing the investing side of this marketplace. And on one side, people would come and apply to get a loan, for a fix and flip renovation loan. And on the investing side, we had to create a website that allowed people to open an account, fund it, and then basically select a number of properties to invest in and basically build a portfolio of that. And so we&nbsp; jokingly would call it ugly Airbnb, because it was&nbsp; like Airbnb in the user experience, but every property had water damage, or had some sort of issue with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so that was what you’re investing in. And so there’s like a website and a web flow, and how does the customer actually get in and create an account, but then there was the financial money movement aspect of it. When we fund a loan, a wire would go out that will essentially fund that deposit over an ACH debit or a wire. And then every time that a borrower repays the loan, we would take the ACH debit, split it up, send it to the right wallets, do it all proportionally, there’s&nbsp; this crazy, crazy spreadsheet math.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that number of payments, as the platform scaled, became really, really crazy to manage both in terms of the engineering challenges around how do you actually connect to the bank? There was not as much fintech infrastructure as there is today. And so everybody had to build their own connections. And I started running around asking friends of friends at different companies. “Hey, how do you guys do this at your company,” and I would meet a friend of a friend of a friend who finally would do this the same way, basically. Where like, a lot of people inside the company are building things, one off, and never have enough investment in that to justify why they need to go and do this at a slightly higher quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it’s one of these things that’s really not a core competency for most of the companies I was talking to. And so they couldn’t justify the right level of investment. And at the same time, it was the same thing that they all needed. And so that was really the origin of Modern Treasury. So in 2018, my two co-founders and I left and started Modern Treasury and went through Y Combinator. And that was the origin story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we were solving a problem that we observed a lot of different companies had, and the solutions that these other companies had were expensive and subpar. And so it felt like it was a place that was ripe for new software products.</p>
<p>Seema: How did you think about, “Here’s the minimum viable product (MVP) that I’m going to build given this pain point?” What was the MVP and how did you figure out the initial product before launch?</p>
<p>Dimitri: So, very early on, because we’re solving our own problem, we had some strong opinions. And one of the opinions that we had was that the only way to solve this problem was something that would bridge the technology and engineering and EPD sides of the company. And those teams really wanted APIs and web hooks and event logs, and those developer things. And at the same time, they were working in a world that interacted with the financial system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so these teams were building things in their writing code that facilitated real money movements in the real banking system. And they ended up in real statements. And so you had this whole host of other teams — finance, ops, capital, markets, etc. — who are living in a world of PDFs and spreadsheets and they needed to know what’s going on. Those teams really need a dashboard, they need an online user experience with a workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so the MVP really was an API to initiate and reconcile payments, specifically, ACH and wires is what we started with. So bank rails, and then a dashboard that showed you what was going on and allows you to drill in and click on things and actually see the details of different payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you can think of it as like 3 legs of a stool: how do I connect to the bank? Do I have the backend integration to the bank systems? How do I surface that in an API to the tech team, so they can actually build that into the product? And then a dashboard for all the different teams that are having to reconcile all of this activity?</p>
<p>Seema: How long did it take to build the MVP?</p>
<p>Dimitri: When we wrapped up YC, we still were not live with our first clients. So it probably took us about 10 or 12 weeks to build it. But it took us a while to find the right clients and to actually go and implement it with their bank and bank account. So it probably took us about 10 weeks to build the MVP in a functional way. And then took us about 5 months total to go over the first customer.</p>
<p>Seema: That’s a great segue into talking about your first set of customers. How did you think about approaching your first customers? Did you go through warm introductions, cold outreach, and who was doing that outreach?</p>
<p>Dimitri: All of the above is the short answer. So we were very focused on collecting product feedback. And then aspirationally, hopefully, maybe one of these customers would sign. That’s a little bit of how we thought about this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we had we started out with really going after companies that we knew had this problem today and just to see what is it that they have in their&nbsp; toolkit today, and do they have needs that our product would fill? So we would meet with companies that were like 300, 500 people, they probably had like a payments engineering team. It was maybe like a 4 or 5 person team. And they were strapped and they had a lot of requests, and we’re trying to talk to them about what they could actually start using from our toolkit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very quickly, we realized these companies would have too much inertia internally to actually sign up with a small startup. And so we started talking to much smaller companies, you know, 3-person, 5-person, 10-person companies who had not yet built the payments engineering,&nbsp; maybe didn’t have a head of finance. They didn’t have any of that infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so for them it was a much easier decision to go and basically opt into using a new solution for their product. Our first customer there was a mutual friend of ours, and he was starting a new company. And it was just him and his co-founder, and I think one other person at the time. And they were starting a new company that they knew they had to go build a money movement system that was fairly sophisticated. Because of the nature of the product as a healthcare&nbsp; benefits product, there’s a lot of money movement going on inside of those accounts. Like every time payroll runs, they get funds coming in, they have to reconcile them, they have to put them in the right reserve account for vision, medical, dental, things like that. So there’s a pretty complicated spaghetti diagram of money movements and reconciliations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they trusted us enough to say, “Okay, you guys can be at least our early solution, we’ll see if you scale,” and that really put us in business.</p>
<p>Seema: How did you think about building trust and getting these initial customers to trust you with their money?</p>
<p>Dimitri: I think having a personal relationship is super important in the early days. I mean, there’s sort of nothing else that can replace trust. I don’t think it’s an accident that our first client was somebody that actually knew us from before. And I had known this person for quite a long time, like we had a lot of prior history together that allowed them to feel trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I think for something like an infrastructure decision, first of all, there’s a technical question of can we solve the problem? But then there’s a second question of, can you solve the problem for a long time? And that’s actually a pretty hard question to answer. Does somebody else have to believe that you’ll still be doing this 5 years from now? And you can, as a founder, you can say, like, “Well, I’m very set on that.” But obviously, there’s a number of other circumstances that have to come along, that makes sure that that’s actually the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, it’s something that you have to answer forever. And every time we sign companies, they’re wondering in the back of their mind, “Will you be around for a long time?” Because they’re making a bet, not just on feature and functionality, but also on the availability of the feature and functionality for a long time. And I think that’s something that is particularly hard to do in a startup for infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So a lot of it comes down to the cheat code, which ends up being: you develop a personal relationship, they trust you, they know that you’re serious about it. You don’t do a lot of pivoting and trying to test out other business models. So I think there is, you have to have a lot of conviction that like this is what you want to do, just at a personal level, that’s actually something that you have to decide for yourself. And then you have to stick with it so that they see a mounting campaign of signing new customers, adding new features, adding new banks. And that’s a lot of what we did later on, we started thinking about our brand and our content and announcements and things like that. More of like a strategy to build trust, but really signaling how serious and long term we were about this topic.</p>
<p>Seema: It almost sounds like you were doing marketing back to your existing customers. Did you think about it actively as marketing to your existing customers, and maybe celebrating wins?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dimitri: I mean, we thought about it actively not just for customers, but also for recruiting. So that first company that I mentioned was in healthcare and our first hire, she was joining from a healthcare company. And of course, we’re like, “We’re huge in healthcare.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, you’re always leaning into the things that are working and you try to build up confidence. I think there’s an element, as a founder, it doesn’t really matter what product you’re&nbsp; in, you’re always trying to build confidence across the ecosystem. Your customers feel good about your team, your team feels good about your investors, your investors feel good about your customers, like all of that has to work around you. So that’s very much a focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we thought about marketing, what we thought about more than anything is like we’re trying to create a category of payment operations. It was not really a topic that people talked about, obviously, it was present in a lot of places, but nobody thought about that. And so we were focused on let’s talk about what the common challenges in payment operations are.</p>
<p>Seema: How much did you have to educate potential customers saying, “Hey, this is this is a real problem that you need to solve with software” versus them thinking, “Okay, we have this process, but we haven’t really decided this is a category that we want to buy software in?”</p>
<p>Dimitri: I think different companies approach solving this problem in different ways. So the problem is not made up, the problems are real. But how you solve it is going to be different across different companies. So there’s going to be some companies that are going to be very engineering first about every problem that they see. And they’re going to try to build and automate and build the technical solution, even before they have any volume in any real pain.</p>
<p>And there’s other companies that are actually the opposite. They’re very comfortable spending time on doing things in Excel sheets, and uploading CSVs, to bank portals, and so on. And in some cases, you have companies that grow very large, in some cases for decades, and they’re still doing that. And so, there’s definitely an element of what has been the process that has worked for you for a long time, you understand how it works, you know how to train people who are coming into the organization and make them do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you think about certain industries that have a lot of paperwork around them, you think about real estate or healthcare, like you just associate those industries with a lot of bills and invoices and paperwork. That’s very different from maybe certain industries that have gone through this digital transformation, if you will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things that I think about is how do we make sure that we can serve both. So our product isn’t narrowed to one or the other. Like, it’s okay, you can build. So one of the design principles that we’ve had is everything we build is available in both the API and the UI. And you can do things by hand, or you can automate them. But nothing is going to be 100% automated, the world is going to be like at best, 99% automated, there’s always going to be one offs and refunds and new things. And somebody’s going to want to do it by hand. And so how do we make sure that you can build to do both? That’s something that’s very important. So I think you can define your product in such a narrow way that actually it doesn’t solve the totality of the problem. You have to be careful about that.</p>
<p>Seema: Did you think about consciously coining the term “payment operations” or “money movement” or was that just sort of happening around you?</p>
<p>Dimitri: So we shouldn’t take any credit for our CEO, she started out really focusing on brand and marketing. And it was really her conception of it as like, let’s actually define how we talk about this. So people know what they’re buying. And one of the side effects of category creation is that in the beginning, you’re the only one in it. So there’s a marketing benefit of being able to point to this and say, “Hey, we’re trying to solve this problem. And we’re leading in it.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, you made it up, of course you’re leading in it. But I think it’s something that is important to think about, if there should be some place or something where you can tell a customer hand over heart, we’re actually the most focused on this problem, or the best at this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seema: How did you guys think about marketing versus sales and what to prioritize?</p>
<p>Dimitri: Yeah, we did not have a sales team for a long time. We invested more heavily in marketing upfront, and we got a lot of inbound leads coming from bank referrals, coming from other activities that we’re doing. So it really wasn’t until probably 2 years or something into the journey that we brought on our first dedicated salesperson. And I think the benefit of that is that everybody in that company was selling in some way, shape or form, and everybody in the company was focused on spending time with customers or prospects. And for good reasons or bad, we weren’t in a huge hurry to get the sales machine up and running, because we really wanted to make sure the product was good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seema: Your first few customers, they’re probably giving you feedback, saying I’ve got all these other things that are broken in my payments stack as well. How did you think about prioritizing feedback and feature requests from there?</p>
<p>Dimitri: So I took a biology class in undergrad and one thing that stuck with me, the professor was a big like birding hobbyist. And he would always talk about how if you think about all the species in the world, birds are ones where we actually know a fair bit to a certain degree of certainty that we know all the species of birds, because the marginal bird that we’re discovering is increasingly small and gray or small and brown. And so, it’s harder and harder to distinguish between them. And so I think there’s an element of insight in there around feature requests. When you get feature requests, in the beginning, they seem to be random, and they seem to be&nbsp; all over the place. And as you talk to more customers, and you do more product discovery, you discover more and more of the feature requests are really small, or increasingly smaller changes from what you already have. And of course, you find completely new species and completely new things that you may not necessarily want to go build. And it’s a conscious decision to go into that or not. But in the narrow area of what you’re trying to solve, you do get a lot of similar requests. And that actually gives you a lot of certainty or a lot of confidence, that like if I build this, I will probably build something useful to a lot of people because so many people have asked me for the same thing. Yeah, you discover new features, you file them away, perhaps and you say maybe someday we’ll go do that. But you have to focus on things that increasingly look like the most boring new species of birds you’ve just discovered.</p>
<p>Seema: How did you think about new competition coming up and how your product was differentiated?</p>
<p>Dimitri: I think it’s really customer use cases and customer stories that I think tell the whole story. So when you actually are talking to specific customers, it’s obviously always a good practice to find out what else have they considered or are considering? Or is there something else that they could be doing, and making sure that your product can stand on its own 2 feet and win against that? So I don’t think that it’s like an overwhelming focus for us, we’ve always been of the opinion that if we build really good software for companies that are good businesses, then we’ll grow with them.</p>
<p>But of course, there are companies that are starting new things all the time. And you take a look at them, and you look for things that make sense that you haven’t thought about before, and you improve your own product.</p>
<p>Seema: It feels like you’ve been very focused on just doing the right thing for your customers in terms of building product, versus spending a lot of time thinking about the competition.</p>
<p>Dimitri: There’s a saying that it’s very rare that companies die of homicide, they usually die of suicide. Companies usually mess up in some way that is actually just very internal. So when you read a lot of business books, I think people talk about competition, but the reality is when you think about the big crashes of businesses in the past couple of years, it’s all things that they’ve done themselves. Like, it’s not actually decisions that were brought on by an evil competitor. It’s like, No, you just did something stupid. So I think as a founder, you’re like, how do I make sure that we don’t do something stupid internally in our company, and as long as we deliver value, and we get customers to use our product, and we’ll listen to them, and we like fix the things that they don’t like about our product? You know, it’ll all work out.</p>
<p>Seema: Other than don’t do something stupid, what advice do you have for early stage founders who are starting their company trying to acquire their first few customers?</p>
<p>Dimitri: Even though we were mostly focused on product and usability, we spent a lot of time thinking about the business model and pricing and things like that. And maybe it’s good to think about what might be around the corner, but at the end of the day, I think early stage founders spend too much time thinking about the business and not often enough about the product. I think the reality is that in the early days, you don’t know what you don’t know about how people use your product. So designing the right pricing levers, you want to have some confidence that this product is useful. And you could charge for it. Obviously, if you don’t, I’m not saying don’t charge anything, because I think if you don’t charge anything you, you aren’t discovering the real willingness to pay. And I think that’s a problem. But I do think that from a business perspective, it is much more important for early stage companies to build a product that people love. And then you can figure out how to turn into a business.</p>
<p>Seema: Well, Dimitri, thank you so much for joining me. This has been great.</p>

<p>Biology operates at the single-cell level: human tissues are composed of highly heterogeneous cells interacting and regulating each other, and all interactions within the cell reverberate throughout the whole organism. A full understanding of individual cells, including genotype, function and phenotype, could unlock the biology of multiple diseases. However, most high throughput biological experiments are still performed on 96 wells at a time and all single-cell platforms are only able to run very specific assays on a few thousands of cells at a time, while lacking the capability to connect multiple assays or modalities at a&nbsp;time.</p><p><a href="https://www.zafrens.com/">Zafrens</a> is developing a novel platform that expedites drug discovery and overcomes the tradeoff between throughput and depth of analysis. The company’s Z-Screen is a step-change in throughput and resolution of experiments, expanding the conventional 96-well format to 50,000–200,000 wells with imaging and single-cell multi-omic capabilities integrated in every well. Large CRISPR, CAR-T, mRNA libraries, or endogenous molecular heterogeneity, can be mapped to their individual manifestations as cell behavior, cell-cell interactions and secretions. The founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/swamy71/">Swamy Vijayan</a>, is an experienced biotech entrepreneur, having previously built Omiome (a DNA sequencing platform sold to <a href="https://www.pacb.com/">PacBio</a>) and <a href="https://www.plexium.com/">Plexium</a> (small molecules targeting protein degradation with several programs advancing to clinical&nbsp;trials).</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Due to the broad application of its technology — from small molecule discovery to cell and gene therapies — we believe that Zafrens has the potential to become a fabric for developing novel therapeutics. Moreover, with its plans for an internal pipeline of RNA-modulatory small-molecules and HLA-agnostic TCR libraries to common cancer mutations, Zafrens also has the opportunity to accelerate the path to initial drug candidates and thereby play a fundamental role in combating cancer and other diseases.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the Zafrens team on their mission to democratize access to therapeutics, irrespective of modality.

<p>“That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – Walt Whitman</p>
<p>Cures have long been medicine’s highest, and all-too elusive, aspiration. Therapies that compensate for or correct errors in DNA are the Holy Grail for devastating diseases caused by genetic mutations.</p>
<p>The first generation of genomic medicine, gene therapy, arrived in 1990 when doctors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/books/chapters/more-than-human.html">delivered</a> a healthy gene to a girl with severe immunodeficiency so she could fight infections. Genomic medicine 2.0 dramatically kicked off with the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22745249/">discovery</a> of CRISPR which, in just over a decade, has gone from gene-editing <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23287718/">tool</a>, to <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/press-release/">Nobel Prize</a>, to <a href="https://a16z.com/from-bacteria-to-bedside-the-arrival-of-crispr-medicine/">FDA-approved medicine</a>. Because CRISPR makes double-stranded breaks in DNA, with risks of unintended effects, early applications focused largely on inactivating disease genes. The development of more precise and versatile tools heralded the 3.0 era of genomic medicine: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03543-z">base editors</a> change single “letters” of genetic code and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1711-4">prime editing</a> enables small edits on the order of 50 letters.</p>
<p>MIT researchers <a href="https://www.abugootlab.org/team">Omar Abudayyeh</a> and <a href="https://www.abugootlab.org/team">Jonathan Gootenberg</a> trained under CRISPR pioneer <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/feng-zhang">Feng Zhang</a>. I remember reading their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01527-4">PASTE</a> paper and thinking it had the potential to be the fourth and final chapter in genomic medicine. PASTE enables programmable genomic integration (PGI)—the ability to insert any DNA sequence of any size precisely into any location without making double-stranded breaks.</p>
<p>Monogenic diseases are caused by an error or mutation in a specific gene; every patient with the disease has the same diseased gene but it’s not necessarily caused by the same mutation. Gene editors correct specific mutations; therapies based on this approach require one medicine per mutation, an unfeasible undertaking when there are many mutations across the population. By dropping in the entire fully corrected gene into the patient’s cells, PGI enables one medicine per gene irrespective of a patient’s specific mutation. This is a seismic shift. PGI is essentially molecular transplantation surgery, but for genes instead of organs.</p>
<p>In addition to correcting mutated genes inside the body, PGI has the potential to revolutionize engineering and design for cell therapies. Because of its ability to integrate large segments of DNA across multiple genomic locations in parallel, PGI brings rapid design-make-test timetables to cell therapy discovery, potentially broadening cell therapy applications well beyond cancer to other common diseases.</p>
<p>Seeing the profound potential for PGI, Jonthan and Omar founded <a href="https://tome.bio/">Tome Biosciences</a>—and this Tome is full of characters. CEO and diehard “Dead Poets Society” member Rahul Kakkar is a practicing physician and serial biotech entrepreneur coming off of the nearly $2 billion sale of his previous company. Chief Scientific Officer John Finn was an early employee at Intellia, leading their efforts to bring their CRISPR technology into the clinic. CTO Matt Barrows led the massive manufacturing scale-up for Moderna’s COVID vaccine. And COO Ed Freedman and Chief People Officer Diane Wong have decades of company-building experience. Together they have built a team at the frontier of genomic medicine.</p>
<p>Tome is <a href="https://tome.bio/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pr-2023-12-12_Tome-Biosciences-Launches-with-Over-200-Million-in-Funding.pdf">launching</a> with over $200 million to advance its PGI platform to focus on in vivo and ex vivo applications, with support from a16z Bio + Health, ARCH, GV, Longwood, Polaris and other leading investors. First up on Tome’s in vivo surgical slate: monogenic diseases of the liver. On the ex vivo cell engineering front, Tome is using PGI to rewire cells to cure common, chronic diseases—an area of great promise—with an initial focus on B-cell driven autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>The story of genomic medicine is being written and Tome will contribute its verse.</p>

As Pranav notes in the episode, the research and development process in medical AI development so far has been siloed by specialty, but generalist medical AI exists outside those siloes. If generalist medical AI is successful, it could act as a dynamic support system to a physician, almost like a medical resident.</p>

  Partnering with Tacto: Future-Proof Supply Chains  <p>André, Nico, Johannes and their team are building the modern supplier-management solution millions of businesses need.</p>   
	By Luciana Lixandru, Julien Bek, and Cornelius Menke	 



Published December 11, 2023
  



TACTO CO-FOUNDERS JOHANNES GROLL, NICO BENTENRIEDER AND ANDRÉ PETRY.



 
<p>Sometimes you meet a team and you just know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first learned last year about Tacto co-founders André Petry, Nico Bentenrieder and Johannes Groll and the procurement solution they were building, we already had a keen interest in the category. While businesses have for decades used CRMs (customer relationship management systems) to grow their revenue, where was the SRM (supplier relationship management system)? More attention to the supplier and cost side of the equation was clearly needed, as geopolitical tensions, COVID ripple effects and regulatory changes have created unprecedented supply chain uncertainty and price volatility.</p>



<p>For the world’s largest companies producing physical goods, some supplier relationship tools are available via incumbents. But for millions of mid-sized businesses (SMBs), these options are too cumbersome and too expensive; 90% have no procurement solution at all. Instead, they’re stuck tracking every supplier, certificate and quote manually, in email and Excel. It’s a daunting proposition—especially when you realize that even a company making a seemingly simple product like tape might have hundreds of suppliers and procure tens of thousands of different articles.</p>



<p>Those mid-sized industrial companies are exactly who <a href="https://www.tacto.ai/">Tacto</a> was built to serve, so in late 2022, we reached out to their team to discuss the possibility of a partnership. Unfortunately for us, they’d just finished raising their seed round. But we didn’t want to give up—so we started speaking with customers in the sector, hoping to learn more about the business. What we heard made us even more interested in the product André, Nico, Johannes and their team are building.</p>



<p>Customers told us Tacto had helped them streamline every aspect of the procurement process, from requesting, evaluating and responding to quotes; to tracking suppliers’ regulatory certifications; to analyzing prices and preparing for negotiations. Where their employees once spent hundreds of hours on interviews, questionnaires and data entry, the platform now automatically gathers and standardizes that information—and of course, uses AI to help them make sense of it. Tacto has also dramatically simplified compliance with Germany’s new Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which imposes stricter supplier reporting to every business with at least 1,000 full-time employees. Even better, it’s easy to integrate—no year-long sales cycles or big IT projects—and, thanks to André, Nico and Johannes’s insistence on an elegant, consumer-grade UI, it’s easy to use, as well.</p>



<p>But customers didn’t just sing the praises of Tacto’s product; we also heard amazing things about its team. André, Nico and Johannes have stellar credentials—all three met at the elite Center for Digital Technology and Management in Munich. They started Tacto in early 2020 after seeing the challenges of procurement firsthand, pushed ahead when skeptics in the space told them it wouldn’t work, and now, have stuck with it long enough to prove those skeptics wrong. They are high-energy, thoughtful and relentlessly focused on performance—and, importantly, they have an impressive ability to attract talent. Tacto’s team members deeply understand the problems their customers are facing, and they work quickly to solve them.</p>



<p>After hearing those rave reviews, we knew we had to try again—so we traveled to Munich to meet André face-to-face. We walked out of that first one-hour coffee with a high degree of conviction in Tacto, and a couple of weeks later, flew back to spend the day with the team and offer them a term sheet. Sequoia was far from the only firm vying for Tacto’s attention—but in that high-pressure environment, we saw for ourselves the qualities that make André, Nico and Johannes great leaders. We were thrilled that they chose us to lead their Series A.</p>



<p>Today, the future is bright. Tacto is now serving customers across a wide range of industries, from mechanical engineering to packaging to medical technology, and impressively, they have grown quickly while retaining every one of their happy customers. In the months and years ahead, as supply chain challenges continue and new regulations expand beyond Germany across Europe, André, Nico, Johannes and their team will be there to make life better and easier for even more companies—and we are excited to support them along the way.</p>

<p>The acceleration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology adoption across industries has indicated widespread organisational acceptance of the novel technology. The advent of this new technology has brought more efficient and creative possibilities. However, the use of language models in AI raises concerns about trustworthiness in its training and the output it generates. This leads us to the question: How can we leverage existing technologies to bridge this lack of trust?</p>



<p>This article explores the challenges surrounding trust in AI system inputs and outputs, how blockchain could be the solution to establish trust, and various integration challenges that need to be accounted for.</p>



<p></p>



 Trust challenges of AI systems 



<p>Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, organisations have made enormous strides to implement AI within their technological systems. Enthusiasm for this new technology promising productivity enhancement, has also generated discussions on whether we can trust these systems. Who has been training these AI models? How can we be sure that the information output it generates is reliable and unbiased? </p>



<p></p>



 Transparency of AI language models  



<p>AI systems require a large language model (LLM) to learn and have a basis to create outputs from. However, due to the lack of transparency surrounding what goes into the LLMs, doubts arise on data input authenticity and reliability.</p>



<p>Authenticity: If the origin, quality, and representativeness of the input data are not transparent, it raises concerns about the authenticity and reliability of the model’s understanding.</p>



<p>Reliability: Lack of clarity regarding the source of training data leads to scepticism about the model’s ability to accurately reflect real-world scenarios and diverse perspectives. This creates uncertainty on whether the model’s output can be trusted and used accordingly.</p>



<p>Explainability: There is a lack of self-explanation in AI systems on how a specific outcome is generated when prompted. This poses a significant hurdle to understanding and trusting AI’s outputs. What data did the system pool together to carry out its decision-making process when prompted?</p>



<p></p>



 Ethical standards in AI training 



<p>AI systems often make decisions based on complex algorithms and data that include principles governing the training of AI models. Thus creating the need for a standardised set of ethical guidelines governing the training of AI models.</p>



<p>One primary concern is the ethical framework guiding the selection of data used in training these systems. The opaqueness surrounding the training data raises ethical concerns, particularly related to bias. If the data used to train AI models contain biases, the model may unintentionally perpetuate those biases in its outputs. Without transparency, it becomes challenging to identify and address biases in the training data. Therefore making it difficult to avoid potential negative consequences.</p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. AI output 



<p>Another significant challenge revolves around the ability to distinguish between outputs generated by AI systems and those by human intelligence. Can we reliably identify whether the output presented is a result of human thought or an algorithmic process? </p>



<p>Authentication is particularly crucial in scenarios where information transparency is essential, such as journalism, content creation, or academia. This distinction between human and AI-generated content also carries ethical implications. It prompts discussions on attribution, accountability, and the potential influence these systems might have in shaping public opinion. As AI becomes more integrated into society, different mechanisms are needed to transparently demonstrate the origin of information.</p>



<p></p>



 Output challenges 



<p>When speaking of trust within AI, we must also evaluate the ownership and intellectual property rights of AI-generated output. The challenge lies in determining whether outputs are established through AI’s novel agency or the accumulation of various other sources that warrant intellectual property rights.</p>



<p>The artwork industry can be used to illustrate the debate on whether generative AI should give credit to artists. Since the system draws inspiration from its training model, would the new artwork’s ownership belong to AI? This debate highlights legal and ethical dilemmas, due to a lack of established frameworks that promote fair compensation for contributors. As AI systems evolve, there is a pressing need to redefine traditional notions of ownership. Acknowledgment of the collaborative nature of AI development is needed while safeguarding the rights of those involved in the generative process.</p>



<p></p>



 Role of blockchain in establishing trust 



<p>Based on the trust challenges discussed above, blockchain technology could be the solution as a trust layer for AI. Blockchain’s decentralised design, using transparent and immutable data records, guarantees universal accessibility, enhanced authentication, and verification processes for all users.</p>



<p></p>



 Ensuring transparency in data processes  



<p>One of the fundamental challenges in trusting AI, as discussed, lies in the lack of transparency regarding data input processes. Blockchain can resolve the transparency issue by recording every step of the AI training and data input process. This ensures that the origin and reliability of the data used to train AI models are traceable and verifiable to reflect real-world conditions.</p>



<p>By leveraging blockchain, organisations facilitating AI technology can instil confidence in stakeholders regarding the reliability of its AI-generated outputs. This safeguards against potential misuse and establishes a foundation for accountability in the development and deployment of AI.</p>



<p></p>



 Tracing decision-making processes  



<p>Transparency enabled by blockchain technology can address the inherent explainability challenges associated with AI’s black-box nature. Establishing a transparent trail of the data and model processes integrated enhances the reliability of AI decisions.</p>



<p>The availability of a comprehensible trail can address the lack of confidence and scepticism present in generative AI. Traceability encourages independent evaluation, empowering users to revisit and assess AI’s decision-making steps, thereby contributing to a more accountable and trustworthy AI environment.</p>



<p></p>



 Leveraging immutability to validate data input reliability 



<p>The immutable nature of blockchain technology contributes to providing security to data records and data transactions. Every piece of information entered into the blockchain is time-stamped and linked to previous data blocks, creating an unbroken chain of custody. This not only enhances the accountability of data sources but also enables stakeholders to verify the authenticity of inputs. As a result, users can confidently rely on the integrity of the data feeding into AI algorithms, knowing that any attempt to manipulate or compromise the information would be immediately detectable. On the other hand, blockchain can be used to drive sustainability goals for successful operations in the long run. For further understanding of how blockchain can sustain long-term ESG goals for organisations, refer to this ebook on <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">using blockchain for sustainability.</a></p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. machine contributions 



<p>Distinguishing between outputs generated by human intelligence and those crafted by AI is critical. The widespread use of AI in optimising many of our daily processes is bound to be used in other various domains, such as work-related situations and advisory roles.  This has caused increasing evaluation on whether information distributed is completely human or contains traces of AI contribution. </p>



WorldID is used as a global digital identity to anonymously prove a person’s unique identity.



<p>Thus the use of smart contracts in the blockchain ecosystem provides a mechanism for creating verifiable identities for both human and machine contributors.  OpenAI’s <a href="https://worldcoin.org/world-id">WorldID</a> initiative is an example of how smart contracts can be employed to authenticate the origin of contributions. Its application will enable a clear distinction between human and AI-generated outputs. Their initiative could address future concerns about accountability and ethical considerations in various domains such as authentic journalism and recognition.</p>



<p></p>



 Establishing auditable trails for tracing errors 



<p>In the complex landscape of AI, errors and biases in outputs can have significant consequences for end users. Blockchain-based systems can offer the solution of an auditable trail that records every transaction and interaction within the AI ecosystem. In the event of errors or biases in AI outputs, this auditable trail provides a comprehensive analysis of the training data and its parameters, facilitating the identification and rectification of issues. This auditable trail also serves as a critical tool for post hoc analysis, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of AI algorithms to meet evolving ethical and performance standards.</p>



<p></p>



 Challenges between AI and blockchain integration 



<p>The integration of AI and blockchain technology may provide us with a starting point in establishing trust, however, there are still potential challenges that experts should address when considering this integration.</p>



<p></p>



 Scalability 



<p>One prominent concern is the scale and scope of AI applications. AI systems often work with massive datasets, and to fully integrate them with blockchain, a highly efficient, low-cost network is essential. However, the transactional and resource costs associated with blockchain networks remain a significant hurdle.</p>



<p></p>



 Cost efficiency 



<p>Initial setup costs can involve acquiring the necessary hardware, software, and infrastructure to support both AI algorithms and blockchain networks. Maintenance costs also arise as ongoing updates and improvements are essential to keep both technologies optimised and secure. Transaction costs associated with blockchain networks, such as fees for data storage and processing, can accumulate. Particularly when dealing with large-scale AI applications that require frequent interactions with the blockchain. Lastly, organisations will need to invest in skilled professionals who can navigate the complexities of integrating AI and blockchain, adding to the overall human resource expenses.</p>



<p></p>



 Interoperability 



<p>There are various blockchain platforms available, and achieving interoperability between them poses a challenge since smart contracts and AI applications might need to interact across different blockchain networks. AI models and algorithms may be developed using different frameworks and technologies. Therefore, ensuring a seamless integration with blockchain platforms can be a complicated process. </p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Compliance 



<p>The topic of interoperability across both technologies also highlights regulatory challenges on two fronts. The decentralised and global nature of blockchain introduces uncertainty, as compliance requirements vary across jurisdictions. Simultaneously, the use of AI, particularly in sensitive domains, is subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny with a focus on data privacy, transparency, and accountability. Combining these technologies requires a dual compliance effort of addressing regulations specific to each domain and staying up to date with technical developments, to develop a standardised process for compliance.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The widespread integration of AI technology has prompted critical discussions surrounding transparency, authentication and ethical standards in AI language models. Blockchain, through its transparent and immutable nature, emerges as a promising solution to address these concerns. It offers transparency in data processes, traceability of decision-making, and validation of data input reliability. However, the integration of AI and blockchain presents a set of challenges, such as scalability, interoperability, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. Thus, when leveraging this integration, a balance is needed between innovation, and ethical considerations. AI developers should ensure that the collaborative development of AI is transparent, accountable, and trustworthy for the benefit of its users.</p>

<p>1) Can you tell us a little about yourself?</p><p>I’m what everyone knows as ‘JSKitty’ — the infamous dev cat of Labs (since the SnappySnap days)! Young British dev, a never-ending interest in tech, from crypto to global-finance, game-dev and AI, I’ve pretty much touched every computer-related subject that anyone could think of — and my end interest ended up being with crypto, after I found Bitcoin around early&nbsp;2014.</p><p>Before PIVX, I worked at ZENZO, before ZENZO, I worked on multiple early projects, like the “DeepOnion” privacy coin, or “eXperience Points (XP)” back in the 2017&nbsp;bullrun!</p><p>Before all those, I was a Game Developer, with two published games, and a handful of unpublished ones, mostly solo-built, some with friends, but all of them were built in a home-schooled method, I do not have a single academic grade to my name, and I don’t need&nbsp;one!</p><p>2) When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>In early 2013–2014 I ended up coming across (in a way that is now lost to my memories) a Bitcoin faucet, the ancient “Freebitco.in” site (which is still running today, damn!), at that point, I was just barely a game developer, had zero knowledge (hah) of Bitcoin, crypto, most of programming, and even finance in general — over the years, I collected Bitcoin, I learned about it, got incredibly obsessed over the technology from the newfound of decentralised systems and “programmable money”, I joined the BitcoinTalk forum and engaged, actually got a fairly reputable BitcoinTalk account in those days, back when coins would often do “Banner Campaigns” where BCT users would advertise a coin on their banner, fun times,&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>3) When and why did you get into&nbsp;PIVX?</p><p>This is an interesting one, around late 2017 roughly, I was effectively a serial-tipbot-dev as a kid, a surprising amount of projects used to have my Tipbots, I built them from scratch, they had various community-building features, and I would bounce from project-to-project hooking them up and watching the communities enjoy&nbsp;them.</p><p>In that time, I met Snappy and the original-ish tipbot operator (Buer), in which I poked around for the status of it, and saw that it was effectively dead — so I teamed up with Snappy, who LOVED the idea, and immediately helped me to make the ‘PIVX Tipbot’ a reality — and for those months that it ran, I remember it was a huge success, with a bot-powered Radio and DJ system that members would gather and rock with — Snappy would act as a host — that, that community spirit, is what kept me in PIVX, even if the original idea, was merely to propagate a&nbsp;tipbot.</p><p>4) What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the&nbsp;market?</p><p>It’s teams (Core and Labs), it’s long-lived testament of surviving the harshest markets, it’s unique blend of Bleeding-Edge tech with PoS, in which a dozen “PIVX-firsts” occurred and continue to occur. — PIVX as a technology, and a currency, is an incredible feat, to say the least, one that is underappreciated by the wider&nbsp;market.</p><p>5) Can you tell us about your journey as a developer and engineer that led you to the creation of PIVXLabs; mypivxwallet and PIVCards?</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/PjuCvCHDyp">PIVX Labs,</a> or at least the ‘soul’ and idea of it, was born of Snappy — the Catalyst of PIVX Labs as-of-today was back when me, Snappy, Kyeno and various other developers, some long gone now — decided that PIVX needed more than just a Core Wallet, the problem with 2017–2020 PIVX was that there were a severe barrier to entry, as well as a UX that is not up to the modern standards of&nbsp;‘Web3’.</p><p>Labs came to fruition from the demand of Labs being needed — we knew PIVX needed a lighter, faster, easier wallet that anyone in the world, on any device, with any experience level; could setup and use, without compromising on security. <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MyPIVXWallet</a> was Labs first creation.</p><p>We also knew that PIVX needed more than wallets to thrive as a currency — <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/">PIVCards </a>enabled using PIV in the real-world, easier than any other platform on the market — What will we build next? I’m not sure yet, but it will be another pillar to PIVX’s real-world adoption and usage — That, is why Labs&nbsp;exists.</p><p>6) As a developer, what are some of the technical aspects or challenges you encountered while building mypivxwallet, and how did you overcome&nbsp;them?</p><p>In general, there are three-ish ‘pillars’ of MPW’s architecture to decide&nbsp;upon:</p><p>- Convenience.</p><p>- (De)centralisation and/or&nbsp;Privacy.</p><p>- Security.</p><p>Increase one, and generally, the other two decrease, how do you build something perfect in all three? Truthfully, you can’t, there are trade-offs to be made somewhere, for something.</p><p>My first and foremost priority for MPW has been Security: for example, MPW since even the first day, NEVER allowed saving a wallet to disk without an encryption password — ironically, this is a more secure practice than the Core Wallet, which does not force this measure on first&nbsp;launch.</p><p>But for Privacy? This is tough, MPW uses Blockbook explorers to sync your transaction history, which requires the app to send your Public Keys to said Blockbook to retrieve your balance — this is not fun, but the alternative: chain header sync, would lengthen the synchronisation time of MPW MASSIVELY, which is a huge hit to Convenience.</p><p>Sure, only a gone-rogue Blockbook can actually collect, store, analyse that data — but it is still a possibility, depending on your threat model, that may already be too much data exposure for&nbsp;someone.</p><p>Back to security: many platforms, like Password Managers, will encrypt your password data locally, and then upload your encrypted data to their Cloud storage — this means you can retrieve your data from the internet, or cross-sync things across your devices, which is incredibly convenient: but what if that service gets compromised? It’s a ticking time bomb before your data is decrypted by an attacker, and boom, account gone — MPW could add encrypted cloud-sync for convenience, and to give users the ability to recover their wallet even if their device exploded randomly — sure, but is it worth the&nbsp;risk?</p><p>This is our daily challenge, a balancing act of conflicting design philosophies.</p><p>7) How does mypivxwallet simplify the onboarding process for new users, particularly those who may be unfamiliar with cryptocurrency wallets?<br> <br> <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MPW </a>focuses massively on: “less is more” in a User Experience sense — the default design assumption of MPW is to assume the user is the least knowledgeable in any area of the wallet, as such; complex features are walled off behind “Advanced Mode”, which hides complex things by default — users can create an MPW wallet, jot down their seed on paper, and encrypt their wallet, within just 1–2&nbsp;minutes!</p><p>8) With the recent launch of PIVCards could you share a little about this phenomenal PIVX use&nbsp;case?</p><p>PIVCards was, funnily, a completely random whim-idea I had a few months ago and decided to prototype in a single week of spare time — having gotten the ‘itch’ to do something new outside of MPW, PIVCards was a massive technological and logistical challenge, and I am surprised that such a small team managed to build it as well as we&nbsp;did.</p><p>PIVCards has processed almost 400 orders, worth a total of ~$17,500, since the initial prototyping, and we HUGELY underestimated the volume we’d be handling, so PIVCards had a full two/three weeks of additional polishing by me, to get it scaling better and with less manual input needed — now, although still imperfect, the service runs entirely autonomously, with near zero manual labour required aside from the occasional logistical ‘edge-case’ we&nbsp;hit.</p><p>9) Finally, what advice or encouragement would you give to aspiring developers and entrepreneurs who are looking to make an impact in the cryptocurrency industry?</p><p>Find what excites you, fascinates you, what grabs at you with the grasp a black hole has on the cosmos: and dive in to it, trust the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Why keep what you love, as a mere side-hobby, rather than a way of&nbsp;life?</p><p>Work doesn’t have to be ‘for someone’, nor does it have to be boring, unexciting — break the chains of being a corporate cog, find what you love, master it, and with enough time and energy (and very importantly: networking), you will make a living with it, doing what you&nbsp;love.</p><p>Sending gratitude to JSKitty for taking the time to sit down with me and share some insights into his background and experiences.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/decembers-pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-jskitty-founder-and-developer-of-pivxlabs-487e2cc3ba5f">December’s PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on JSKitty, Founder and Developer of PIVXLabs.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Step in and explore the community working to defeat metadata surveillance</p><p>What was a trickle is becoming a steady stream and soon it will be a raging river: stories of how metadata is being used to deanonymise and profile people online. In the past 24 hours, news stories circulated about how Apple and Google are handing over <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/governments-spying-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-2023-12-06/">push notification metadata</a> from Android and iOS devices to agencies of various governments across the world, in order to deanonymise users and link them to app&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/sorotan-komunitas-memperkenalkan-explore-nym-delegation-advisor-3193839d9315">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/hecho-por-la-comunidad-explore-nym-y-el-asistente-para-delegaciones-7afcba9cbcee">Español</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BC-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%B5%D0%BC-explore-nym-%D0%B8-delegation-advisor-ed5cbef1f6ae">Русский</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E8%81%9A%E7%84%A6-%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D%E6%8E%A2%E7%B4%A2-nym%E5%92%8C%E4%BB%A3%E8%A1%A8%E5%9B%A2%E9%A1%BE%E9%97%AE-89c5af3f7284">中文</a></p><p>US senator Ron Wyden has called for transparency by the companies, highlighting that the sheer volume of requests that Google and Apple receive, and which governments and agencies are gaining access to this information, is largely&nbsp;unknown.</p><p>What is clear however is your metadata is not protected, neither by law nor by encryption.</p><p>Now, there are a lot of big bad things happening in the world at the moment, from ecological and economic crises, to wars and famine. Online mass surveillance and the rise of AI might feel similarly overwhelming, a complex systemic storm that one can do little about. But luckily, that is not the&nbsp;case.</p><p>One of the best ways to stay sane and not succumb to hopelessness in the midst of neverending crises is to start doing something about it, ideally alongside other people. The Nym community is seeing more and more people join with exactly this mindset: a strong drive to do something about the problem of digital surveillance to improve the state of digital technologies. More specifically, to solve the problem of metadata surveillance.</p><p>This blog post introduces <a href="https://explorenym.net/">Explore Nym</a>, a new tool developed by community Nymja <a href="https://twitter.com/pawnflake">Pawnflake</a> to make it easier for you or any new joiner to participate in the Nym network and help protect metadata online. But before delving into the tooling, first, a brief primer on metadata:</p> Metadata, huh? <p>Metadata is the data about your data. Rather than the content of a message, metadata refers to things like the time, frequency and size of a message, and where it is sent from. Just as footprints mark routes trodden into the snow, every online interaction leaves behind traces of digital activity that reveals user behaviour.</p><p>Another way to think about metadata is as the patterns of communication. These patterns reveal as much, or even more about a person, their relationships, status, psychological state and habits than content itself. And with the powerful pattern recognition technologies coming out with AI, these are increasingly vulnerable.</p><p>Mixnets are currently one of the only technologies that protects metadata. Mixnets encrypt and mix internet traffic so that patterns become untraceable. In the case of the Nym mixnet, this ‘mixing’ happens by a decentralised network of operators all over the world, making it near impossible for an observer to trace communication from sender to receiver. These operators are rewarded with NYM tokens for providing this mixing&nbsp;service.</p><p>Now, in order to be a part of this incredible community, you do not necessarily have to become an operator yourself. Instead, you can support operators by engaging in what is called ‘staking’ and earn a share of operator&nbsp;rewards.</p> What can I do to prevent metadata surveillance? <p>The simplest way to get involved with Nym is by engaging in what is called “staking”. Staking is a common practice in Web3, used as a way to signal sentiment about something by temporarily locking up one’s crypto tokens. Think of it almost as a vote to show what you care about or believe in, but where the amount of tokens also shows the strength of that sentiment.</p><p>In the case of Nym, staking is a way for the Nym community to signal how much they believe in a mix node operator and their ability to provide a good quality of service. And in return for staking, you receive a portion of operator rewards, meaning you have a direct economic interest in staking on well-performing nodes.</p><p>Here’s what to&nbsp;do:</p>  Download the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/wallet">Nym&nbsp;wallet</a>  Get hold of some native NYM tokens (via the wallet, Kraken or elsewhere)  Grab a Club Mate or cold beverage of your choice and get ready to explore the wonderful worldwide community of Nym&nbsp;nodes!  <p>Some mix nodes run their operations with profits going to social good projects in Latin America, while others use their profits to set up Nym squads to expand their operations.</p><p>There are several parameters you might want to consider when delegating to a node, but luckily, PawnFlake has put some work into simplifying things for&nbsp;you!</p> ExploreNym — developed by PawnFlake <p>Are you entirely new to staking? Community member PawnFlake has created <a href="https://explorenym.net/">ExploreNym</a> which gives a simple breakdown and guidance on how best to choose mix nodes to stake&nbsp;on.</p><p>The <a href="https://explorenym.net/delegation-advisor/">Delegation Advisor </a>automatically provides suggestions for nodes to delegate stake to. Depending on whether you are simply concerned with highest returns or whether you are keen to improve the overall decentralisation of the network, the advisor provides three suggested nodes that perform best along those criteria so you don’t have to do too much research.</p><p>If you want to go a little deeper, you can also look into each individual node to check their uptime, stake saturation, time estimated until they reach saturation, estimate rewards and&nbsp;more.</p><p>ExploreNym is <a href="https://github.com/ExploreNYM/bash-tool">open source</a> and currently in Beta. So if you have friendly feedback and encouragement for Pawnflake, do jump in the Nym channels to show your appreciation!</p><p>Disclaimer: Nym can not officially endorse this tool, but the team and community does love it — it’s a great example of independent development, helping the community in a very real&nbsp;way!</p> Getting to know Nym operators <p>Nym node operators are an interesting bunch. Ranging from professional Web3 infrastructure operators such as <a href="https://nodes.guru/">Nodes Guru</a> who have been with the project since the beginning, to hacktivist squads forming in and around hacklabs in Latin America as well as computer science university groups. Even traditional telecoms company SwissCom are running nodes via their Web3 arm <a href="https://swiss-staking.ch/">Swiss&nbsp;Staking</a>.</p><p>If you are interested in exploring and getting to know Nym operators a little better, here are some of the channels you might want to&nbsp;join:</p><p>Telegram</p>  <a href="https://t.me/NYMDELEGATION">Delegation channel</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">Node setup&nbsp;chat</a>  <p>Matrix</p>  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat">General</a>  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Node Operators</a>  <p>The diversity of operators, decentralised geographical location and range of servers all contribute to the security of the mixnet, ensuring that Nym remains an open, secure global privacy infrastructure to protect metadata.</p><p>The Nym mixnet can be used today&nbsp;via:</p>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/nymconnect">NymConnect</a> with a select range of apps and&nbsp;wallets  <p>And very soon&nbsp;via:</p>  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> for full system protection of outgoing and incoming traffic. <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">Sign up for the waitlist&nbsp;now</a>!

 TL;DR 



<p>As Electric Coin Co. (ECC) and the Zcash community prepare for public retrospectives of zcashd Network Upgrade 5 (NU5) and what has become known as the sandblasting attack, this blog post details ECC’s motivations, challenges, and accomplishments with regard to each.&nbsp;</p>



 
 The NU5 upgrade was an ambitious undertaking to eliminate the need for trusted setups, increase user confidence, and enhance Zcash’s security and scalability. 



 The implementation of Halo, a cryptographic breakthrough, on Zcash made possible trustless, private, digital-cash transactions for the first time on mobile phones. 



 A malicious attack following the upgrade led to significant wallet performance issues, prompting ECC to enter Emergency Mode. Our response involved multiple technical updates, performance improvements, and the release of new mobile-wallet SDKs. 



 Despite the challenges and delays, ECC succeeded in improving the security and resiliency of Zcash.

 What the FUD? 



<p>ECC’s mission is to empower economic freedom, and most organizations that work on Zcash-related projects, like the Zcash Foundation (ZF) and Zcash Community Grants (ZCG), have similar community-minded objectives for the betterment of humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, since Zcash came into the world in 2016 a stream of misinformation (and some coordinated propaganda) has been circulated on social media, forums, and other community platforms meant to incite FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).</p>



<p>The rumors claimed that Zcash was compromised, or that it was vulnerable to counterfeiting, or that there was a backdoor that would allow third parties to access a user’s transaction information without their consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And unfortunately, until NU5 was released, there was a major obstacle in confronting these attacks: the trusted setup. When Zcash launched, its zero-knowledge proofs required a <a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony">Ceremony</a>, or trusted setup phase, to produce public parameters that allowed users to construct and verify private transactions.</p>



<p>This technique was pioneered by ECC, and it required multiple parties in different locations using complex security measures.</p>



<p>Regardless of the extra-careful planning and execution plus redundant security, Zcash users and observers had to trust the historical fact that the ceremony participants weren’t conspiring to deceive the public. Trusted setups don’t allow for a mathematically verifiable supply, and as long as these complicated procedures were required for major Zcash upgrades, there would always be doubters and detractors. And the doubters would have a point — mathematics is verifiable, but history isn’t. The reputation and integrity of Zcash was being challenged, and in ECC’s view, this was an issue the community couldn’t afford to ignore.</p>



 NU5: A call to action 



<p>In 2019, ECC engineers Sean Bowe, Daira Emma Hopwood, and Jack Grigg had been working on scalability design and experimenting with a solution for efficient recursion when Bowe made a discovery.</p>



<p>“I just stumbled upon a technique to do this zero-knowledge proof construction on completely ordinary elliptic curves,” Bowe said. “And so over the course of maybe 24 hours, it went from, ‘Ooh, that’s really exciting, that’ll be neat if we can do that’ to ‘Holy crap, now that we don’t have trusted setups or anything, it’s all really simple. It was a series of steps that turned from a nice insight into a complete paradigm shift.”</p>



<p>Halo, as it would come to be known, is a zero-knowledge proving system that enables recursion without a trusted setup in an efficient way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bowe’s discovery was a cryptographic breakthrough heralded by the industry, and in 2021 ECC committed to implementing Halo in Zcash.</p>



<p>Halo on Zcash would make trustless, private, digital-cash transactions possible for the first time on mobile phones. It would serve as a catalyst for Zcash user confidence and provide a path to much greater scalability, while making the protocol more attractive, faster, and less expensive for others to build on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the ECC blog:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Halo on Zcash would enable circuit upgrades without the need for trusted setups, making the Zcash shielded protocol more agile for future improvements, such as supporting additional assets like [Zcash Shielded Assets, or ZSAs]. We want to make it easy for other projects and tokens to benefit from Zcash features, such as privacy through encryption. Trusted setup will become a remnant of the past.</p>



<p>In addition, this upgrade would pave the way for shielded Zcash scale through proof aggregation and blockchain succinctness, two scalability improvements. This would improve the user experience by eliminating frustrating synchronization time that plagues all blockchains today, reducing the traditional blockchain bloat, and allowing for non-escalating fees as usage increases. In conversations with large social platforms who expressed interest in native Zcash support, a viable path to scalability was given as a requisite near-term consideration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In January 2021, after more than a year of Halo R&amp;D, ECC concluded that the benefits of Halo on Zcash outweighed other protocol priorities, and we proposed implementing it in NU5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/8qSA29vWWds?si=6hvbieHC23DzuvmX">Zcash Media video</a> about the original Ceremony, its participants (including Edward Snowden), and how Halo makes trusted setups obsolete.</p>



 NU5 objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our NU5 goals from the outset were to (1) make Zcash more secure, (2) give Zcash users confidence by making the supply mathematically verifiable, (3) make future upgrades easier, and (4) enable future upgrades to benefit from recursive proofs for scalability and programmability improvements.</p>



<p>Our original estimate of 6-7 months turned out to be overly optimistic — as new discoveries were made, opportunities were revealed in the process, and technical complexities arose — and in the end the journey took almost a year and a half.</p>



<p>Along the way, we confronted a number of technical challenges. For example, the complexity of including Orchard support in the zcashd embedded wallet was not properly accounted for in the original estimates for the NU5 timeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ECC faced time-consuming engineering hurdles, like building a complicated circuit for Halo-plus-Orchard to make it work on mobile devices. And midstream, we made the decision to implement <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/unified-addresses-in-zcash-explained/">unified addresses</a> (UAs) to enable shielded by default in supporting wallets. The design and build-out of UAs were difficult, and if ECC had been practicing product-driven planning and development at the time (like we are now) we believe we would have identified the need for UAs sooner and their implementation would have been smoother.</p>



<p>In addition to battling technical obstacles like these, plus a few <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-4-5-1/">surprise bugs</a>, ECC spent significant time and resources advocating for and defending our roadmap decisions against criticism for: our rationale (getting rid of trusted setup wasn’t worth the time and effort, ZSAs were more important), our planning (we kicked off the discussion publicly before planning enough -and- we planned too much before starting the work), the decision to license Orchard under the Bootstrap Open Source Licence (BOSL), the decision to implement Unified Addresses (UAs), and our overall approach to network upgrades (our priorities were arbitrary and out of touch).</p>



<p>It’s important to acknowledge that we had significant community support during the process, too. Overall, community sentiment was positive. We received valuable insight and feedback from our <a href="https://electriccoin.co/team/">Scientific Advisory Board</a> and crucial security audits from <a href="https://hackmd.io/@qedit/zcash-nu5-audit">Qedit</a> and <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/11/02/public-report-zcash-nu5-cryptography-review/">NCC group</a>.</p>



 NU5 timeline and accomplishments 



<p>Not including the pre-implementation research and development, NU5 was a 17-month endeavor that delivered novel technology and improved Zcash user experience.&nbsp;</p>

 May 31, 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash/">NU5 activates on mainnet</a>, eliminating trusted setup for the new Orchard pool and launching a new era for Zcash 
 



<p>When Zcash NU5 activated on mainnet May 31, 2022, it was one of the most important milestones for Zcash since the cryptocurrency launched in 2016. As ECC CEO Zooko Wilcox put it, “an historic step forward for human society.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In launching the Orchard shielded payment protocol utilizing Halo, we eliminated the trusted setup to improve Zcash security and sustainability, made the supply mathematically verifiable, improved scalability because future network upgrades won’t require a complicated setup ceremony, paved the way for increased interoperability by providing a system that could unlock private cross-chain proofs at scale, and introduced BOSL which has returned value to the Zcash community (e.g., Filecoin Foundation and Ethereum Foundation grants to Brave and Edge).</p>



<p>It was a massive effort, and after almost a year and a half of building and wrestling with the technical challenges of NU5, the ECC Core team was ready for some rest. But almost right away, Zcash was hit with another issue we couldn’t ignore.</p>



 



 The sandblasting attack 



<p>In June 2022, almost immediately after ECC launched NU5, a serious problem emerged. The Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction size and activity. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented some wallets (Nighthawk, Edge, and Unstoppable) from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. Wallets weren’t syncing and some users weren’t able to access their funds.</p>



<p>This was a problem that ECC, as the primary maintainer of zcashd and supplier of mobile-wallet SDKs, was best-positioned to confront.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: A call to action 



<p>Some parties at ECC did not initially want to make the assumption that this unusual transaction load was the work of a malicious actor. Eventually however, the evidence that it was a malicious actor became overwhelming — and we have reason to believe it may even have been coordinated by the same actor or group of actors who spread Zcash FUD, and that they may have been paid to do so.</p>



<p>But solving that mystery was less important than fixing the problem.&nbsp;</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could regain access to and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world, private digital cash.</p>



<p>As an initial line of defense, we released&nbsp; performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80%. We also began working on performance upgrades to our mobile wallet SDKs.</p>



<p>In August 2022, with lots of work left to solve these wallet performance issues, ECC went into Emergency Mode. This was our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>The wallet performance issues presented a complicated series of challenges to address, and they required developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that would give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. The solution required changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>



<p>Internally, fee changes were debated from the get-go, but for the first few months, the ECC team focused on additional performance improvements and worked to resolve the issue without fee changes. Later, we decided to implement fee changes to throttle the spam attack.</p>



<p>As users became frustrated with their user experience, some community members became vocal and publicly criticized ECC for not being prepared for the attack and slow to respond.</p>



<p>In February 2023, we were notified by blockchain security firm Halborn of <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">vulnerabilities</a> inherited from Bitcoin Core that may have affected more than 280 chains, including Zcash. This was another all-hands-on-deck emergency on top of the wallet performance issues, and as ECC was the only team notified of the vulnerability, we were the only ones who could make the necessary fixes. The coordination of the disclosure and remediation consumed approximately a month of our time.</p>



<p>To make matters worse, ECC as an engineering organization was attempting to do too many things at once: core node maintenance, supporting CEXes like Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini, backports from Bitcoin, mobile SDKs, mobile wallet applications, and future protocol improvements. ECC <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">restructured</a> in May 2023, which further strained resources temporarily.</p>



 Additional challenges 



 
 At the time, ECC internal communication and project management practices weren’t organized for an Emergency Mode situation. This affected our understanding of priorities and workflow across teams. 



 Before the attack, ECC product strategy focused on adoption first, instead of performance and scalability. Users want new features, and working on improving performance slows feature releases. But the attack took Zcash UX to the limits immediately. 



 Technical debt: We had implemented previous network upgrades with only limited performance improvements. 



 ECC vastly underestimated how long it would take to fix outstanding wallet performance issues. 



 Other technical issues arose that caused delays, such as when speed.z.cash bitrotted and then got deleted while ECC was without a devops manager.&nbsp; 



 The ECC Core team had three different managers during Emergency Mode. 



 Emergency Mode slowed development of our planned wallet product, now known as Zashi. However, we were able to leverage the prototype internally to validate and test SDK improvements. 
 



<p>ECC was lucky to have proactive wallet partners — Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable — who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Timeline and accomplishments 



<p>In all, ECC’s sandblasting response and implementation by third-party wallets consumed about 16 months. By November 2023, Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable were working again (better than ever), and we announced an end to Emergency Mode.</p>



 Timeline 



 
 June 2022: Network spamming began; shielded outputs jumped from a monthly average of 42,600 to 21,622,590 in June alone 



 July 2022: Implemented performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80% and began working on performance improvements to our mobile wallet SDKs 



 August 2022: ECC officially entered <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860">Emergency Mode</a>, although we didn’t use that term in public written communications until March 2023; started researching Spend Before Sync 



 September 2022: While working on zcashd and improved mobile sync experience, re-opened research into possible fee change mechanisms (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317">ZIP 317</a>) and syncing efficiencies (<a href="https://hackmd.io/@str4d/dagsync-graph-aware-zcash-wallets">DAGSync</a>/Spend Before Sync) 



 October 2022: Released zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-3-0/">5.3.0</a> with additional performance improvements to reduce concurrent memory utilization during scanning among other memory and performance related optimisations in the zcashd node 



 October 2022: Reaffirmed our immediate objectives regarding syncing issues with our wallet SDKs and <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/29">communicated our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode</a> 



 October 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-thirty-year-vision/">Communicated our intent </a>to have wallet performance issues resolved by the end of February 2023 



 October 2022: Changes to zcashd increased its robustness against the attack 



 November 2022: Identified and fixed the last known bugs that were blocking the first phase of SDK releases, continued progress on Spend Before Sync, and began prepping both zcashd and mobile wallets for ZIP 317; squashed the last known librustzcash bugs that were blocking wallet release and completed Android &amp; iOS SDK integration 



 December 2022: Completed the implementation of zcashd optimizations expected to save memory and to reduce orphan rates for miners 



 February 2023: Released zcashd<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-4-0/"> 5.4.0</a> to introduce a number of performance improvements, an update to correct supply reporting, and a clean up of legacy features and support functionality to improve ongoing maintenance of the codebase 



 March 2023: Published an <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/update-addressing-zcash-wallet-performance-issues/">update and release schedule</a> calling for an end to Emergency Mode by the end of May 



 April 2023: ECC released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-5-0/">5.5.0</a> with the completed transaction-fee-structure change (ZIP 317) and infrastructure improvements that laid the groundwork for 5.6.0. 



 May 2023: (Restructuring at ECC) Pushed the release date for zcashd 5.6.0, lightwalletd, and SDKs to mid-June. As zcashd 5.5.0 began to be adopted by miners on the network, the fee structure changes began to blunt the efficacy of the sandblasting attack, reducing the rate of blockchain growth and wallet scanning load. 



 June 2023: Released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-6-0/">zcashd 5.6.0</a>, introducing the functionality necessary for light wallets to access spendable funds without fully scanning the blockchain; included updates to address issues related to the ZIP-317 implementation and privacy policy features. 



 July 2023: Lightwalletd 0.4.14 was released, which meant the mobile wallet SDK was the only outstanding piece in ECC’s plan to resolve wallet performance issues and exit Emergency Mode. At this point, we had hoped to release the SDKs in mid-July. 



 August 2023: By the end of July, the adoption of zcashd 5.5.0 by the network was complete, and network transaction load had returned to pre-NU5 levels. However, the accumulated chain data to this point still presented a problem for wallet scanning, and so to mitigate this issue ECC announced the pre-release availability of the Spend before Sync capability in our mobile SDKs and made this functionality available to wallet developers for testing. Several bugs and UX issues were discovered. Timeline for the SDK releases was shifted to mid-September. 



 September 2023: New bugs, UX issues, and dependencies arose that pushed the SDKs release date out to the end of September. 



 Sept. 26, 2023: ECC <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/162">released the updated mobile SDK 2.0</a> for both iOS and Android developers. This was the final deliverable for exiting Emergency Mode. 



 Nov. 1, 2023: After a month in production, no related, major wallet issues were reported and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/wallet-performance-issues-resolved-ecc-exiting-emergency-mode/">ECC declared an exit from Emergency Mode</a>. 
 



<p>The culmination of our sandblasting response was that third-party Zcash wallets were working again, and future attackers were further disadvantaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



 



 The work continues 



<p>NU5 and the sandblasting attack consumed nearly three years. But faced with organized adversity, competing emergencies, and community criticism (some of it warranted), ECC did not stray from our commitment to build. With allies along the way, the community overcame unprecedented technical challenges and resource constraints to make Zcash more resilient, reliable, and safe.</p>



<p>We learned a lot, and although we’d love to step back and take a break, we know the work is more important now than ever. We look forward to distilling the lessons from these experiences in the upcoming retrospective, and we’re honored to continue the effort to build for economic freedom and a world-class Zcash user experience.</p>

  Black Holes and the Intelligence Explosion  <p>Extreme scenarios of AI focus on what is logically possible rather than what is physically possible. What does physics have to say about AI risk?</p>   
	By Dan Roberts	 



Published December 7, 2023
  



 
<p>For better or for worse, physicists will try to understand things that are not obviously physics, with physics. As a <a href="https://danintheory.com/">physicist-turned-AI-founder-and-researcher</a>, I liked to imagine black holes as computers. (In some sense, they’re the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound">largest</a> and maybe the <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v9/49">fastest</a> kind.) In this essay, we consider whether some very special computers will become black holes before they become gods.</p>



 Rising machines 



<p>Artificial intelligence has been a part of speculative fiction long before there was a specific genre called science fiction. AI has also been a part of computer science (though not exclusively so) for (almost) as long as there have been computers. In 1956, the Dartmouth Workshop coined the name “artificial intelligence” for the study of machines that think like humans, and set out to solve the task in a <a href="https://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart564props.pdf">single summer</a>.1 &nbsp;That didn’t really work out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">as planned</a>.</p>



<p>One peculiar thing about progress in artificial intelligence is that the science is far outpaced by the technology: AI is still a “black box” that produces magical results such as winning Go moves, poker bluffs, emotional poems, compelling stories and stunning images. It’s easy to read about how to build such a system—though good luck actually doing so without a huge amount of capital and engineering talent—but nobody knows why, for example, a chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT produces this sentence and not that sentence when given a particular prompt.</p>



<p>But if AI is magic, then it can literally do anything … within the realm of logical possibility. Such possibilities include, according to some whose views are becoming <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">increasingly</a> <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">mainstream</a>, eliminating all biological life on earth.</p>



<p>How can we possibly evaluate these claims? If AI is a black box, how do we know what’s possible? <a href="https://kotaku.com/president-joe-biden-mission-impossible-ai-tech-order-1850980643">How do we separate sci-fi trope from scientific truth?</a></p>



 
 <p>No, seriously, in their above-linked proposal, they say, “We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems [of how to make machines think like humans] if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.”</p>   
 



 Simulated in our universe 



<p>To start, I think that AI systems are not black boxes and can be understood in the same way that we understand any other physical system—through physics!</p>



<p>Okaaaay, you say, what does the abstract AI model that implements ChatGPT have to do with, say, the thermodynamics of the gas inside a room?</p>



<p>(It’s really funny and great that you picked that particular comparison to physics, I’d say!2)</p>



<p>To determine the properties of the collective gas in the room—its thermodynamics—from the underlying motion of the ~1025 or so gas molecules—their statistical mechanics—we needed physical intuition and a set of mathematical tools. Together, these let us zoom out of the microscopic perspective—where we keep track of their individual positions and velocities—to derive macroscopic features—like temperature, volume and entropy.</p>



<p>Another type of microscopically complicated system is the deep neural network (DNN) architecture that underlies recent successful AI models. These models are built from taking a simple but programmable mathematical operation—the artificial neuron—arranging them in layers to perform many such operations in parallel—and then stacking many layers in series to get a complicated function that can, if asked, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">write a play</a> proving the infinitude of primes in the style of Shakespeare. In this case, the microscopic description of the DNN is the literal code that the AI programmer writes, specifying how input is transformed to output.</p>



<p>For a language model, the text is broken up into pieces called tokens that loosely correspond to words; each token is mapped into a high-dimensional vector; the sequence of high-dimensional vectors are mixed up, re-weighted and biased in various ways according to the precise numerical values of the model’s parameters that are learned over the course of a training process; and finally, the model determines a probability distribution over all possible next words given the input and can generate a new word by sampling from that distribution. However, that code is the answer to the how question—how is an output computed from this input—but not the why question—why this output and not another for this input?</p>



<p>This description of how a chatbot works is like the following (microscopic) way of thinking about the pressure exerted by a gas: pressure is force per area; each individual gas molecule imparts a force on the wall every time it randomly collides with the wall; so, we can understand pressure by tracking the position and velocity of every gas molecule in the room, track their collisions with the walls, and add up all the forces. Analogously, this answers the how question for the gas—how does pressure arise—but not the why question—why does pressure rise when the temperature increases?</p>



<p>To answer the why questions, what we found—and, to be clear, by we here I mean historical physicists—is that for some types of microscopically complicated systems, simple macro-level descriptions emerge as the number of the elementary components of the system grows very large. (For example, we can derive the ideal gas law and show pressure is proportional to temperature by studying the distribution of velocities of the gas.) Moreover, we historical physicists were then able to find iterative refinements to these simple descriptions to understand how changing the size of these systems changes their behavior.3 (In this way, we can systematically model deviations from the ideal gas law.) It turns out, that as a complicated system with a large number of elementary components, deep neural networks also have precisely the right properties that enable such a physics-inspired approach to help us understand why they work as they do.4</p>



<p>But this is just an analogy to physics. There also is an explicit reason why physics matters for simulating an AI on a supercomputer.</p>



<p>To see why, consider that when we—and by we here I mean <a href="https://x.com/miramurati/status/1726542556203483392?s=20">the people of OpenAI</a>—build ChatGPT, we need a physical object to contain ChatGPT’s parameters—the weights and biases that control the behavior of the artificial neurons in the network and thus define and implement ChatGPT—and make them available to process input prompts. This object is (vestigially) called a graphics processing unit—a GPU—and each GPU has a fixed amount of internal memory for storing the parameters of AI models.</p>



<p>To train and then run frontier AI systems like ChatGPT, you must leverage not one, but many such GPUs, organized together into a kind of supercomputer: groups of eight GPUs are assembled and connected together in a type of box called a GPU node so they can communicate at high speeds, and then GPU nodes are further stacked and connected together in a GPU cluster inside of a room known as a data center.</p>



<p>At the risk of being pedantic, let’s <a href="https://labs.openai.com/s/4VjlheyWjFRHi4yxu06nenOa">imagine</a> that that room—the data center that contains the supercomputer running ChatGPT—also contains the gas whose thermodynamics we were just discussing. As anyone who is old enough to have bought a GPU for its original purpose—gaming—knows, GPUs come with fans because they generate a lot of heat. Needless to say, thermodynamics of the gas inside a data center is very much impacted by running ChatGPT!</p>



<p>In other words, AI systems are physical objects, and AI inference plays out in physical space. As such, all purported superintelligences are ultimately subject to the physical limits of computation. That’s the main point of this essay.</p>



 
 One could say that the proverbial “black box” was originally just a (black) box of gas… 



 In physics, this goes by the name of the renormalization group, which is a kind of physical refinement and extension of the central limit theorem in math/statistics. 



 For some details, check out this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00008">essay,</a> and for a full blueprint of this approach, check out this <a href="https://deeplearningtheory.com/">book.</a>   
 
 







 
 Collapse into a black hole 



<p>To see why this matters, I want you to now take a moment and imagine an AGI with access to unbounded computational resources. To those worried about the risk such systems may pose to humankind, this thought experiment is often tantamount to imagining an all-powerful <a href="https://ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2">god</a> that can do anything. For instance:</p>



 
 It could be an information oracle—the ultimate successor to Google—as it would encapsulate and reason about the sum total of human knowledge.5 



 It could be used to “solve” science and create new technologies that we can hardly imagine. 



 It could escape the confines of your laptop by using the internet to synthesize artificial life.6 



 It could capture you inside the confines of your laptop by simulating you so accurately that you’d have no objective way of knowing whether you’re the physical you or the simulated you… and then torture that simulation to make you do its bidding. Maybe it creates one billion such simulations, making it near certain that the you having subjective conscious experiences is being simulated?7&nbsp; 



 (I’ll patiently wait here while you ask ChatGPT for a continuation.) 
 



<p>Where did this list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark">jump the shark</a> for you? As for me, rather than enumerating the possibilities of god, I started by imagining a black hole.</p>



<p>Lurking at the very extreme of any physical system lie black holes. Try to pack too much stuff—matter or energy—into any fixed volume, and you’ll find yourself a black hole; try to gather a large enough collection of identical objects together, and you’ll also find yourself a black hole. Although it may not be intuitive, this also places a limit on the amount of computation you can put together in any region of space.</p>



<p>To see why, consider what would have to happen if we scaled up our AGI system towards unbounded computation: as our hypothetical AGI becomes larger, we’ll need more and more GPUs to physically run it. This means constructing more and more GPU nodes, and networking them together in increasingly bigger GPU clusters.</p>



<p>So, how big of a GPU supercomputer can we—and by we here I mean literally anyone, whether humanly or artificially intelligent—actually make?</p>



 
 And it would not hallucinate facts or sources when providing responses. 



 Example from Yudkowsky’s recent Time <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">essay,</a> where he suggests that “to visualize a hostile superhuman AI …[v]isualize an entire alien civilization, thinking at millions of times human speeds …allowing an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms or bootstrap straight to postbiological molecular manufacturing.”

 Bounding computation 



<p>Untangling various network cables and contemplating a bound, let’s consider the interplay of economic limitations, technological limitations and, finally, physical limitations.</p>



<p>As anyone working in AI right now knows, procuring GPUs is extremely difficult, so even an order for only a finite number of GPUs will still take an undefined amount of time to materialize. These supply issues are of course not fundamental obstructions to building, but they do point to the heart of economic issues in scaling: how much of the world’s resources can actually be put to training a single AI model?</p>



<p>Estimates for the cost of supercomputers capable of training the current state-of-the-art LLMs are of order $100M. If the next-generation cluster <a href="https://twitter.com/pfau/status/1644741636172251137?s=20">costs $1B</a>, how many more generations remain? Sure, some very big (as in tech) corporations will be able to spend $10B, though beyond that, there are only ~150 companies globally with a market cap above $100B, and today’s biggest company, Apple, has a market cap of (only) ~$3T. Beyond even that, while the U.S. government can command more resources than an Elon Musk—though let us ignore the near-impossible amount of coordination it would take to incorporate frontier AI efforts into a functioning government institution—$100B–$1T is a likely overall U.S. maximum.8 Even so, imagine that we—and by we here I mean literally everyone—band together and devote all economic productivity towards building the biggest computer, there’s still not much room until we surpass the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD">gross world product </a>(which itself just crossed $100T in 2022). Altogether, this points to roughly 2-3 non-government iterations left (e.g., OpenAI can release GPT-6 or 7), or 5 all-in-world iterations left, before the end of economic scaling.</p>



<p>Ignoring the economics for the moment, couldn’t we in principle just keep making our supercomputers faster? Following the current gradient of innovation, we can see this strategy at work both at the level of the GPU—where we’ve been squeezing more and more transistors together on the same chip—and at the level of the cluster—where we’ve been networking together more and more GPUs in increasingly larger data centers.9 However, trends of smaller transistors and larger clusters are powered by breakthroughs in technology—stacks of innovations that enable us to engineer smaller transistors or efficiently power and connect clusters of GPUs—that are increasingly on a collision course with fundamental limits of physics.</p>



<p>While it’s more difficult to do in-context napkin-math as we did two paragraphs ago, we can give some intuition. The driving inspiration for faster GPUs is Moore’s law, one version of which—the empirical observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles roughly every two years—has held since its first observation in 1965.10 Unfortunately, such observations are likely to be discontinued: <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">estimates</a> predict that transistors made of silicon can be shrunk only by an additional factor of four before the hot environment of the GPU will begin to create computational errors.11</p>



<p>Moore’s-over, making bigger clusters is more than simply stacking server racks in bigger and bigger buildings: each node needs to be properly powered and cooled and networked.12 The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/06/what-is-nvidia-nvlink/">interconnections</a> between GPUs are an essential technology of the supercomputer, since each GPU needs to communicate with every other GPU for a supercomputer-sized AI model to function. Note though that as the earthly footprint of any cluster grows, the typical distance between GPUs is growing with the square-root of that footprint (e.g. the typical linear dimension of the data center): thus, regardless of how good interconnect technology becomes, “<a href="https://www.wired.com/1996/08/id/">the speed of light sucks,</a>” and latency is unavoidable in any superbrain.</p>



<p>So at some point (soon) we’ll reach a bound of how transformer-dense a chip can be, and putting more transformer-dense material together in the same room may not help us because the different parts of that material will be increasingly separated in space, making it harder and harder for it to communicate internally. Perhaps we can account for the former limitation by replacing transistors—e.g., move from electronics to photonics—or maybe we can somehow address the latter constraint by inventing better distributed computing algorithms? Now as computational optimists, let’s say we—and by we here I mean … you know what, I suppose that by we here I mean an actual superintelligent AGI—redirected our entire economy to further scaling the AI, converted all of our natural resources—perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence">literally the planet</a>—into GPUs, and remedied the technical limitations above. What then?</p>



<p>Unfortunately there’s still a terminal point to this kind of scaling due to a more fundamental kind of physics: if you put enough GPUs together, eventually something very surprising is going to happen; they’re going to collapse into a black hole!13 &nbsp;The gravitational attraction of each of the GPU servers to one another is outrageously tiny, but, if you stick roughly 1037 of them together, they will eventually matter in a very serious way.14</p>



 
 As a point of comparison, the entire U.S. Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3326875/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-defense-budget">budget</a> for 2024 is (only) $842B. 



 N.B. there are also gradient-free, if you will, <a href="https://lightmatter.co/">innovations</a> to pay attention to. 



 An alternate version of Moore’s law—which observes that every two years the number of transistors doubles at the lowest price per transistor—has already <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">broken down.</a> 



 In technical terms, this is the scale at which <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/106/19/193503/27706/The-fundamental-downscaling-limit-of-field-effect">thermodynamic fluctuations</a> will begin to dominate. 



 Okay here’s some in-footnote napkin-math: a state-of-the-art GPU node (Nvidia’s DGX H100) uses about <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">10 kilowatts</a> of power; ignoring all the other power needs of the data center—e.g., cooling—a cluster of a million such nodes (8,000,000 GPUs)—roughly ~360x larger than the largest <a href="https://inflection.ai/inflection-ai-announces-1-3-billion-of-funding">publicly known</a> AI cluster and a naive sticker price of ~$500B—would require the amount of power needed at peak by all of NYC in the summer. (See, e.g., Table I-3a, Zone J, <a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/2226333/2022-Gold-Book-Final-Public.pdf/cd2fb218-fd1e-8428-7f19-df3e0cf4df3e">here.</a>) Generating and delivering even that lower-bounded amount of power would be extremely nontrivial. 



 More in-footnote napkin-math: one of Nvidia’s <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">DGX H100 servers</a> contains 8 GPUs, has a volume of 0.15 m3, and weighs 130 kg. Meanwhile, the Schwarzschild radius Rs = 2GNM relates the mass of a black hole to its radius, where Rs is the Schwarzschild radius, M is the mass, and GN = 6.67 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 is Newton’s gravitational constant. If you try to pack enough mass into a small enough region with linear dimensions R such that R/M = 2GN, you will form a black hole. For any collection of N objects of constant density, the mass of the collection scales like N, but the radius of the collection scales like N1/3. Thus, R/M ~N−2/3, and you will always eventually form a black hole by increasing the number of objects in your collection.&nbsp; 



 For comparison, GPT-4 was trained on an order of only 104 GPUs. I hope it’s obvious, but not even the biggest AGI <a href="https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets">accelerationist</a> is likely to bet on the actual existence of 1037 GPUs. 
 



 Practically speaking 



<p>1037 GPUs is a lot. So is 1036. (And so is 101, if you’re a startup, and 100 if you’re just a person. GPUs are expensive.) So what?</p>



<p>Is there anything on our list of unbounded-compute god-like AGI powers above that we expect is limited at 1036 GPUs but permitted at 1037 GPUs?</p>



<p>Items (i) and (ii) are the entire point of investing in AI today. It would be a tragedy if they were not possible. LLMs with the right guardrails and retrieval abilities already are information oracles. Given that humans can reason and do science—some of us without even any GPUs(!)—it’s not clear that a scaling bound from physics will limit AI.15</p>



<p>The <a href="https://intelligence.org/ie-faq/">original AI doomer concern</a> is born out of the idea of an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808604180">intelligence explosion</a>: future AGI systems will have a general intelligence that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems…</p>



<p>This idea is sometimes called <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/recursive-self-improvement">recursive self-improvement</a>; it’s really just the basic idea that investments—in this case, in intelligence—compound exponentially.</p>



<p>The point of this discussion is really just to illustrate the point that there’s no such thing as unbounded computation. This cycle will stop. All aspiring AGIs and their companies are first subject to practical constraints on computation—such as raising an enormous amount of capital to build or access a supercomputer—but even if those “prosaic” limitations are overcome, any derived AGI systems are ultimately subject to a variety of fundamental physical constraints.16</p>



<p>So, does a physical limit of computation perspective on AI matter in practice?</p>



 
 If your conception of AI is as new technology—perhaps even the most incredibly transformative technology—then, I think, likely no. 



 If your conception of AI is creating an infinitely powerful god (or maybe summoning a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzb_CSRO-0g">demon)</a>—a technology that may as well be unbounded magic—then, I think, likely yes. 
 



 
 For items (iii) and (iv), I really don’t know. We—you and me(!?)—should do some physics calculations and find out! 



 Not to mention any <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">“artificial” compute bounds</a> that may be put in place. 
 



 Cutting tails 



<p>By discussing a limit and embedding it in physics, I hope to differentiate between AI—the technology—from AI—the religion. Of course, if you are worried about an infinitely-powerful AGI god, then (self-consistent) fiction shapes your thinking about AI: anything permitted by logic raises a valid concern. My point is that that’s far too broad: thoughtful applications of physical constraints can cut off the very long tail of AI risk and restrict us to a more limited set of outcomes.17&nbsp;</p>



<p>Limited, but not any less crucial. For this reason, I think we should focus on the costs and benefits of AI as we would other revolutionary technologies, rather than treating it as something mythical. Demoting AI from god to tech, from religion to science, still leaves us the ability to accelerate both technology and science—right up to the limits imposed by the laws of physics. In other words, the really exciting outcome from our list of (i)-(v) above is the one where we build a toolfor scientific reasoning.</p>



<p>To get there, we’ll need new ideas that go beyond <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361">pure compute scaling</a>. For researchers, for engineers, and for founders, that’s a (scientific) reason to be optimistic.</p>



 
 Just so we are clear, we are not claiming that a superintelligent AI would, as a cartoon villain set on world domination, choose to ignore the laws of physics and hubristically find itself confined in a black hole. On the one hand, this would certainly be very funny and a hilarious failure mode for any AI that aspires to commit malfeasance via item (iii) above. On the other hand, if you attempted item (v), as I did, you might have noticed that nowhere among ChatGPT’s very imaginatively-boring answers does it make this point; the current AI is blissfully unaware that its successors may be limited by physics. On our third hand, at the very least we may assume that some future chatbots may read this essay…

 🔦Resource: State of Crypto - Policy spotlight  <p>The internet is one of the most important innovations, and engines of progress, in human history — yet it is failing the people who rely on it most: consumers, creators, developers, and small businesses. Control (over decisions, data, and much more) is consolidated among a handful of big platforms, which unilaterally make decisions on behalf of their users; or change the rules suddenly on developers and other builders; and extract prohibitive fees from creators… and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>Blockchains have not only emerged as a credible solution, they also represent an important new computing movement that opens up new opportunities and use-cases well beyond web3. But despite the potential of this industry, critical regulatory guidance has been lacking.&nbsp;</p><p>To share what’s at stake — and provide a resource for anyone seeking to understand, or share more on blockchains &amp; crypto with others more — we put together a quick spotlight deck. It sets context for the why, what, and how of web3; and shares relevant data from our State of Crypto report that you can share with others more broadly. The deck also offers guiding principles to help U.S. policymakers meet their goals of protecting consumers, providing a path to compliance, and ensuring innovation.</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/spotlight-on-crypto-policy/">check out the report here</a> [time: 10 minutes]&nbsp;<br>share: on <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1727371567305470066">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/a16zcrypto_state-of-crypto-2023-spotlight-on-crypto-activity-7133137315786330113-wtfW">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x48fdad58">Farcaster</a></p> 🎨Feature: A creator's journey to self-sovereignty: ‘The why is in the who’ <p>Singer-songwriter, rapper, producer, and performance artist Latashá shares her journey through art, technology (including crypto), NFTs, and “self-sovereignty” in this talk delivered at our second annual Founders Summit a few weeks ago.

Democratizing technology is ‘actually super-hard to do,’ says Andrew B. Hall, a professor of political economy at Stanford Graduate School of Business… Some big-name companies have responded to those concerns by looking for ways to give users more power to decide what guardrails are being put around their products… OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is funding experiments in setting up a democratic process for deciding what rules its artificial intelligence systems should follow…</p><p>Hall says there may be an answer for boosting participation in online democracy — providing rewards to users who get (and stay) involved. In a new paper co-authored with Eliza R. Oak, a PhD candidate at Yale University, Hall studied the governance of Optimism, a startup that creates applications that improve the efficiency of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain platform… In what Hall and Oak believe to be the first study of its kind, they approach the project as ‘a novel laboratory for studying governance.’”&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/inside-government-where-people-are-paid-vote">read more</a> in “Insights by Stanford Business” [time: 5 minutes]</p>  <p><a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/what-kinds-incentives-encourage-participation-democracy-evidence">download the full paper</a>, “What Kinds of Incentives Encourage Participation in Democracy?

Here’s a deep dive into stage 3 development:&nbsp;</p> Circuits <p>The main transaction circuit is ready for Stage 3. We’ve also upgraded our circuits to improve overall protocol security. We have further completed the testing for Rewards Extended Circuit and Balance Checker.</p> Contracts <p>The Vault V1 contract has been delivered.

We expect to complete integration testing by this week.&nbsp;</p> dApp <p>We made significant progress on our dApp in November. Key achievements include the implementation of transaction tracking in the Wallet Engine and the development of a logic for Know Your Transactions (KYT) attestation for both native tokens and $ZKP tokens on the selected chain.</p><p>We have also introduced Commitment Message Encryption to handle sent and received UTXO's commitment hashes, which are critical for rebuilding past transaction history. Our team is further on track to complete updates for Stages 1 and Stage 2 by December 6th, enhancing our dApp's functionality and user experience.</p><p>UI/UX DesignThe community should expect a brand new design work to be released as part of Stage 3.</p> Roadmap for December&nbsp; <p>We’re looking to launch Stage 3 and Stage 4 in December.

<p>COPY FROM BELOW THIS LINE TO VERIFY SIGNATURE BELOW</p><p>One of the first and most important things to announce is that no funds on the Verus network or in Verus wallets were compromised due to this attack, as they were not subject to the vulnerabilities this hacker group exploited. We hope that the hackers were unable to fool anyone into giving up the funds from their Metamask or other Web wallets and that the criminals’ efforts resulted in a negative&nbsp;return.</p><p>This should be a cautionary tale for any communities using Discord, and we will detail what we experienced, in hopes that it might prevent another Discord community from experiencing the same or similar issues. The hackers used a Discord session hijack vulnerability that is currently in use across some notorious hacking groups along with social engineering to inflict significant damage on the Discord server where the Verus community spends much of its time when coordinating. These attacks had no effect on the Verus network, and although the hackers did get control of the Discord server, they did not need to get full control or credentials for any account to inflict their damage on the Discord server. We believe the attack could easily have been cut short immediately if Discord could improve their false positive account disablement as well as their response time to critical support requests.</p><p>What we have determined so&nbsp;far:</p><p>1. The group targeted me and worked to establish trust as journalists for weeks, always persistent, never pushy. After working with me on an article, where I contributed the following content (<a href="https://medium.com/@michaeltoutonghi/what-inspired-the-creation-of-verus-coin-and-how-long-has-it-been-in-development-12731aaa9be4">Verus Article from&nbsp;Hack</a>).</p><p>2. After they said they had completed their article, they worked for 2 days on getting me to accept a content release form, even rewriting it after I refused to agree to their first&nbsp;version.</p><p>3. Once they rewrote it, I clicked a link from their Discord server, and although they weren’t able to get login credentials, they exploited a session hijack link, and immediately went to&nbsp;work.</p><p>4. After they had my account, which had setup the Discord server so many years ago, under their control, they kicked off all admins, installed their own admins, and did something that Discord would have to help explain that got Discord to instantly ban my account, the only one besides Discord that could have kicked them&nbsp;off.</p><p>5. Since then, they started announcing scam links, claiming fraudulent giveaways with Ethereum tokens backed by Verus on websites that if someone with a Metamask or similar wallet engages with, there is a risk of taking assets from them on Ethereum or possibly other networks, not&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>6. We still have not heard from or gotten help from Discord Support since this event began, except that they banned my account, and to our knowledge the scammers are still in the old Verus Discord server attempting to scam an ever dwindling group of members who haven’t left by&nbsp;now.</p><p>7. If you know anyone in the old Discord, please inform them to leave the Discord asap and not engage in any of the announcements, as they are made by impersonators, while people trying to warn are banned and the original admins are locked out of the&nbsp;server.</p><p>8. My old Discord ID is now disabled by Discord, and I no longer have access to our conversations. My new account is miketout.vrsc (this ID), which is not the owner of this Discord, and we have implemented a set of processes for all Discord admins to prevent any such event from occurring again.</p><p>Since the Verus Community is much more than a Discord Server, though we still haven’t found a more suitable engagement platform for the way the community works, a number of people have worked to create and secure a new community Discord Server, and we welcome all Verus Community members and well meaning interested people to&nbsp;join.</p><p>Though we are still hoping to have a conversation with Discord about the hack and how they could improve their security to prevent this for all of their user communities in the future, we have taken steps independently to harden the Verus Discord community in a way that would prevent such an attack in the future, even if the link click session hijack exploit is not resolved. We also have even better security thoughts for the future around leveraging VerusID in easy, meaningful ways. If you have experience writing Discord bots and especially secure servers, please get in touch. Until then, we hope you will rejoin or join the Verus Community’s Discord server and the worldwide, unlimited scale, fully decentralized blockchain protocol conversation.</p><p>Get an invite for the new Verus Discord Community Server: <a href="https://verus.io/discord">https://verus.io/discord</a></p><p>COPY UNTIL THE END OF THE LINE ABOVE THIS&nbsp;ONE</p><p>This article is signed by my ID, mike@ on the Verus network with the following signature:</p><p>AX8OKwABQSBhYU0ShQsu6LSRVay8IY7avMhoy3ub8jhznZnlhD5nGRE4h4U5MEWiPg+DXGJRSXd3bWou5TfNHn/zEPfbMA7d</p><p>(if you are using Safari or possibly another browser, you may need this signature, as the copy comes out a bit different):</p><p>AZAOKwABQSCaekvVN3CBbneot9AHby8S0+YCYevJDSfps3iaML8BF0j9PMdO/37JYxHbuDy/R11hWe9tCI5AInjppcQhQ3hD</p><p>You can verify my signature on any Verus node or lite mode API, by copying the article between the instructions above and entering the ID as mike@ and the signature above to check.

   One topic at the center of the AI universe this week is a potential breakthrough called Q*. Little has been revealed about this OpenAI project, other than its likely relationship to solving certain grade-school mathematical problems.  Amid much speculation, we decided to bring in our new general partner, Anjney Midha – focused on all things AI – to sift through the sea of noise.  Today, we discuss

<p>One topic at the center of the AI universe this week is a potential breakthrough called Q*. Little has been revealed about this OpenAI project, other than its likely relationship to solving certain grade-school mathematical problems.</p><p>Amid much speculation, we decided to bring in our new general partner, Anjney Midha – focused on all things AI – to sift through the sea of noise.</p><p>Today, we discuss the key frontier research areas that AI labs are exploring on their path toward generalizable intelligence, from self-play, to model-free reinforcement learning to synthetic data. Anjney also shares his insights on which approach he expects to be most influential in the next wave of LLMs and why math problems are even a suitable testing ground for this kind of research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Topics Covered:</p><p>02:03 - What is Q*?</p><p>06:21 - Applying model-free reinforcement learning to complex spaces</p><p>13:17 - The role of self-play</p><p>19:04 - Synthetic data’s big unlock</p><p>24:44 - What does this unlock for society?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow Anjney on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/AnjneyMidha">https://twitter.com/AnjneyMidha</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find a16z on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

 Introduction <p>Did you know that besides being able to mine XLA, you can also be rewarded for providing liquidity on our exchanges? Moreover, by doing so, you contribute to making our order books much healthier and more attractive.</p><p>Actively contributing liquidity to our exchanges allows you to play a crucial role in strengthening and sustaining a stable and highly efficient trading environment for Scala. This active involvement enhances market depth and reduces the risk of sudden price fluctuations, ensuring that XLA’s value remains steady and supports smooth trading experiences.</p> What is a liquidity pool? <p>A liquidity pool refers to a collectively sourced pool of cryptocurrencies or tokens locked within an exchange, serving the purpose of facilitating trades between different assets. In contrast to traditional markets with distinct buyers and sellers, liquidity pools utilize automated market maker algorithms (AMM), enabling the automatic trading of digital assets through the utilization of these pools. The primary objective of liquidity pools is to address the issue of illiquid markets by encouraging users to contribute cryptocurrency liquidity in exchange for a portion of the trading fees. Unlike traditional trading, utilizing liquidity pools eliminates the need for matching buyers and sellers, allowing users to seamlessly exchange their tokens and assets using the liquidity provided by other&nbsp;users.</p> What exchanges support liquidity pools? <p>Liquidity Pools for Scala are currently supported on these exchanges:</p>  Xeggex: <a href="https://xeggex.com/markets">https://xeggex.com/markets</a>  NonKYC: <a href="https://nonkyc.io/markets">https://nonkyc.io/markets</a>   Earn profits for providing liquidity <p>By participating as a liquidity provider, users have the potential to receive a portion of the trading fees generated within the pool, creating a steady stream of income. Furthermore, users can seize the opportunity to accrue daily profits, which are automatically credited to their AMM accounts.</p> Risks <p>Impermanent Loss</p><p>Assets held in the AMM Account will be incorporated into the liquidity pool for automated market making. Potential impermanent losses may arise due to fluctuations in asset prices, leading to changes in the ratio of the two assets with the price movements. As the price ratio eventually reverts, impermanent losses gradually diminish, and users can ultimately realize profits from participating in liquidity provision.</p><p>Trusting a third-party</p><p>Storing funds on an exchange always involves risk, as it entails trusting a third-party platform with your assets. We advise against keeping substantial amounts on any exchange and instead suggest securely storing them in one of Scala’s official&nbsp;wallets.</p> How to add liquidity <p>Note: The steps to add liquidity are the same for Xeggex and NonKYC, as they share the same user interface. For this guide, we will use&nbsp;Xeggex.</p><p>Step 1</p><p>Visit <a href="https://xeggex.com/markets">Xeggex</a> or <a href="https://nonkyc.io/markets">NonKYC</a> official website and log in to your account. Click on ‘Liquidity Pools’ in the drop-down menu of the main&nbsp;menu.</p><p>Step 2</p><p>Select the trading pair for which you want to add liquidity, for example, XLA/BTC, then click on “Add Liquidity”.</p><p>Step 3</p><p>Enter the amount of XLA you want to add as liquidity. The amount of the other cryptocurrency (BTC in this case) will be calculated automatically.</p><blockquote>Make sure you have enough XLA and BTC in your account, otherwise, the “Add Liquidity” button will be disabled. If not, you need to deposit the required funds on the exchange and then try&nbsp;again.</blockquote><p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully provided liquidity to the XLA/BTC pair and can now begin earning rewards. We look forward to having numerous Scalanauts contribute to creating a more robust and liquid order&nbsp;book.</p> Community 👋 <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact&nbsp;us:</p>  Website: <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">https://scalaproject.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">https://t.me/scalaofficial</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scalahq">https://twitter.com/scalahq</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/</a>  Scala Mining Stats: <a href="https://scalastats.com/">https://scalastats.com/</a>  Email: hello@scalaproject.io   <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/add-liquidity-and-get-rewarded-4795fdf2f292">Add liquidity and get rewarded</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  In conjunction with Stanford researchers, Circle Research introduced the concept of “R-Pools” which can be used to exchange unsettled recoverable wrapped tokens for base tokens.  
  On November 30, 2023, Circle Research presented and published this idea as part of the DeFi Security track at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security held in Copenhagen.&nbsp;  
  It is recommended for the reader to familiarize themselves with the research from our recent post on recoverability, which can be found <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/a-configurable-and-programmable-wrapper-mechanism-for-recovering-erc-20-tokens">here</a>.  
  
<p>Previously, we introduced recoverable wrapper tokens as a configurable, programmable mechanism to add recoverability features that can help protect developers and users from theft and illicit finance. Different configuration sets suit different contexts and use cases. These sets can range from a general recoverable asset for consumers to a wrapper issued and arbitrated by DeFi protocols to protect their locked funds.&nbsp;</p>

 Digital wallets are essential to the Web3 ecosystem, providing a way for users to store and send digital currencies and serving as a hub to interact with applications. But digital wallets can be difficult for everyday users to set up and keep secure.

 The integration is supported by an automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, that enables simple yield opportunities on day one for all users on EON. &nbsp; 



<p>The Horizen ecosystem is excited to announce its integration with <a href="https://docs.ascent.exchange/">Ascent Exchange</a> with simple yield opportunities via <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vault</a>. This integration is set to significantly enhance the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> platform’s capabilities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, bringing a new level of innovation and efficiency to the industry.</p>



 A New Chapter in DeFi: Horizen EON Meets Ascent Exchange 



<p>This integration represents a major step forward for the Horizen EON ecosystem. By joining forces with Ascent Exchange, Horizen EON leverages Ascent’s expertise in decentralized exchange operations, propelling our platform to new heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Moreover, this integration underlines a shared vision for a unified and interoperable digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can flourish across various platforms.</p>



<a href="https://ascent.exchange"></a>



<blockquote>
<p></p>



<p>“Our integration with Ascent Exchange is a testament to Horizen EON’s commitment to interoperability and resilience in the blockchain ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent’s expertise, coupled with Horizen’s EVM-compatible platform, marks a significant milestone towards creating a more interconnected and robust DeFi ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent Exchange’s early adoption of the Horizen EON platform is set to redefine the DeFi trading space.”&nbsp;</p>
– Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs.</blockquote>



 Simple Yield Opportunities on Ascent Exchange via ICHI Vaults 



  
<p>Ascent Exchange was launched on day one with the support of an automated liquidity management protocol called <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vaults</a>. </p>



<p>This will enable liquidity providers to earn yield with their favorite tokens on Ascent Exchange. Each ICHI Vault allows a depositor to deposit a single token which will then be used as liquidity in an underlying liquidity pool. The Vault prioritizes deposit token yield while protecting from impermanent loss. ICHI Vaults will be launched for a wide range of assets supported by Ascent Exchange.</p>

  Partnering with Squint: Instructions for the Real World  <p>Devin and his team are bringing cutting-edge AR to the factory floor.</p>   
	By Jess Lee	 



Published November 29, 2023
  



Team Squint



 
<p>Every once in a while, technology brings us a magical moment of delight. I remember the first time I used an Apple AirTag. The navigational arrows, haptic feedback and “10 ft away” message created a simple, intuitive way to find my erstwhile keys—and effectively bridged the gap between my mobile device and the real world.&nbsp;</p>



Magic



<p>Squint brings that same Apple-like magic to industrial work. Much in the same way an AirTag can help you find your keys, Squint is a mobile app for the industrial floor—that shows workers step-by-step instructions for how to use machinery.</p>



More magic, on the factory floor



<p>Imagine you’re a worker in a high-stakes industrial setting, navigating a maze of complex equipment on a factory floor. You’ve just been asked to switch production lines because the factory is understaffed, but you’re not familiar with the new machine you need to use. Your options are: a) ask the worker who’s been at the factory for 10 years and knows how to use everything—but they’re super busy, b) read the paper manual—but it’s buried in a binder in the storage room and difficult to find, or c) just wing it—but that could be dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Squint, you have a better option: simply point your mobile device at the equipment to get instant help. Teams can document and record every step of an important procedure, then the app guides workers through it in the real world, augmented with video and all the institutional knowledge they need to do their jobs effectively and safely. You can even use it to check logs, leave notes for the next shift and report maintenance issues. It’s the digital equivalent of the person who’s been at the factory for 10 years, hovering over your shoulder, helping you out.</p>







<p>As America faces an industrial labor shortage, Squint also offers a sorely needed boost in manufacturing productivity and worker retention. Manufacturing is the nation’s fifth largest employment category and growing, as more companies move operations to the U.S. from Asia. However, a quarter of industrial workers are older than 55 and will soon retire, leaving a widening skill gap behind. To bridge it, companies including Colgate-Palmolive, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Michelin, JTEKT, Siemens and Volvo are using Squint to train and retain employees, increase productivity and ensure safety. Colgate-Palmolive, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhGSvkapruc">found</a> procedures were completed 50% faster with Squint—regardless of a worker’s experience level with the equipment. They also saw greater accuracy and reduced training times, and unlocked new insights through Squint’s built-in analytics.</p>



<p>When I first met Squint founder and CEO Devin Bhushan in 2015, he was a 23-year-old software engineer at Yahoo, tasked with writing the Flurry mobile app all by himself. Despite having no prior iOS experience, he did just that—and helped Yahoo’s customers understand their product analytics. He later joined Splunk, where he led the mobile AR team that made data visible for industrial companies. There, he was inundated by requests from customers to see not just their Splunk data, but all their data—and thus Squint was born. Devin’s experience across mobile, AR and product analytics makes him uniquely suited to lead Squint and pioneer this new category of software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia had the privilege of leading Squint’s $3.5M seed round earlier this year, and we got a front-row seat to the team’s incredible pace of progress when Devin and founding PM Dylan Conway joined us for Sequoia <a href="http://arc.sequoiacap.com">Arc</a>, our catalyst for pre-seed and seed-stage companies. Over the last six months, Squint’s tremendous market pull gave us the conviction to lean in and lead the Series A.</p>



Squint Founding PM Dylan Conway and Founder and CEO Devin Bhushan at Sequoia Arc



<p>We’re thrilled to be in business with Devin and his team, and excited for the possibilities they’ll continue to unlock with AR and AI. While today Squint is focused on industrial use cases, we can imagine the app someday becoming the instruction manual for any device or place—from your new coffee maker or camera to your Airbnb stay. This is only the beginning for Squint, and we’re excited to be their partners for the journey ahead.</p>

<p>Phone numbers are pervasive and continue to proliferate as digital identifiers. In many ways, they are a person’s most personal digital identifier. However, the traditional framework doesn’t allow users to have true ownership of their numbers, and hence, their primary digital identities. Given that phone numbers are allocated by centralized entities, securing a number often means disclosing personal information, thereby posing a risk to individual privacy.</p><p>This conventional setup is susceptible to SIM swapping attacks, a rising concern as highlighted by the FBI. In fact, the number of SIM swap fraud cases <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208">increased by 400% year over year since 2020</a>. according to a report by the Federal Trade Commission. Such scenarios have led to numerous high-profile thefts, particularly targeting crypto assets and hijacking prominent social media accounts to mislead followers.</p><p>Moreover, the existing reliance on SMS technology, which debuted over 30 years ago, is outdated and lacks security measures. The architecture remains largely unchanged, without encryption support, thus exposing messages sent via SMS to unauthorized access within a given cellular&nbsp;network.</p><p><a href="https://www.3num.co/">3NUM</a> is poised to revolutionize phone communication systems. They are developing a phone number and messaging system&nbsp;that:</p>  Ensures end-to-end encryption for secure communications.  Provides true user ownership of mobile phone numbers, fortified by public key cryptography.  Preserves privacy, enabling users to join the network without relinquishing any personally identifying information.  Maintains the confidentiality of phone numbers, preventing public disclosure.  Mitigates SIM-swapping threats as it transcends the dependency on SIM cards or centralized, vulnerable services.  Integrates with alternative identifiers like ENS, facilitating user-friendly name addressing as opposed to cumbersome multi-digit numbers.  <p>Mobile communication has become the primary modality for people to stay in touch with each other and with the important events happening around them. The time to upgrade this core infrastructure is long overdue. BlueYard is proud to support the 3NUM team in this important mission.</p>

Let’s take a&nbsp;look.</p> Nym Swapper: why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>Although there is only one NYM token it is currently divided into two flavours: ERC-20 to maximise the availability of NYM on Ethereum exchanges, and native NYM on the Cosmos chain, which allows users to delegate tokens and engage with the Nym ecosystem.</p><p>Only the native NYM token allows users to delegate their tokens and therefore ERC-20 holders cannot currently earn rewards. While it is possible to switch ERC-20 over to native NYM, users have to embark on a lengthy, complicated process with <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/transfering-nym-erc20-to-nym-cosmos-for-bonding-or-delegating-in-nym-mainnet-introducing-gravity-821e417cb0ab">Gravity&nbsp;Bridge</a>.</p><p>Nym Swapper completely dissolves this barrier, allowing users to quickly and painlessly swap ERC-20 for native&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>The application couldn’t be simpler — and should be released by the end of 2023 unless there are unexpected delays.</p> Nym Swapper&nbsp;preview <p>Nym Swapper is a web application for desktop, with mobile support expected to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Nym Swapper currently works with the Nym testnet. The following preview steps and images are taken from this test version but major changes to the process or UI are unlikely. Here’s how it&nbsp;works:</p><p>Hit ‘Connect Wallet’ in the Nym Swapper application and MetaMask will&nbsp;open.</p><p>MetaMask will then prompt the user which accounts they’d like to connect to Nym Swapper. Users can select multiple accounts if they like, and Nym Swapper will automatically update depending on whatever is selected in MetaMask.</p><p>Enter your Nym Wallet account address into the corresponding field in Nym Swapper. In the background, the application validates that the address is accurate.</p><p>Next, enter the amount of NYM you’d like to swap and click&nbsp;accept.</p><p>Hitting accept takes the user to a summary page that displays the deposit and the destination address. The fee is displayed in MetaMask.</p><p>Accepting will open a final prompt in MetaMask. Here, the user can confirm or reject the&nbsp;request.</p><p>Confirming will cause MetaMask to request the transaction go to the blockchain, and at the same time, Nym Swapper will monitor the transaction until it’s successful.</p><p>And that’s&nbsp;it!</p><p>Once the transaction is confirmed, your brand new native NYM tokens will automatically appear in your Nym Wallet. Sometimes this can take a minute or&nbsp;so.</p><p>Summaries of past swaps can then be found at the bottom of Nym&nbsp;Swapper:</p><p>On release, Nym Swapper will support the ERC-20 to native NYM token flow, while the reverse may be added in time.

Here’s a deep dive into stage 3 development:&nbsp;</p> Circuits <p>We’ve updated Stage 1 and Stage 2 circuits following general updates and have delivered the Balance checker unit test.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Core dApp UI is dependent on the smart contract interactions and the circuits designed for these interactions. The design of these circuits is planned in stages to cover basic scenarios first and then move to more complex handling of input parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Contracts  <p>We’ve successfully completed all unit tests. We expect to complete integration testing by this week. The Vault V1 contract was delivered earlier and is in review now.&nbsp;</p> dApp <p>We've made significant progress on our dApp this week. Key achievements include the implementation of transaction tracking in the Wallet Engine and the development of a service function for Stealth Executor Address Calculation. Additionally, we have updated the PRP convert function signature and added zAsset encryption for message type 08. Our team is also on track to complete updates for Stages 1 and 2 by December 1st, enhancing our dApp's functionality and user experience.</p> UI/UX Design <p>On the UI/UX front, we have built a new History page to improve activity tracking. We've further approved and merged an enhanced visual layer for the deposit flow and implemented a logic to preset assets for deposit from the dashboard. The Split functionality for the zZKP special deposit flow has been completed, alongside the addition of new UI components and a Token select dialog. The zAsset page has also received significant updates, further refining the user experience.</p> Community Questions&nbsp; <p>What is the team building?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The team is working on building the V1 mainnet and all its components.</p><p><br>What happens after V1’s into production?</p><p>The product roadmap <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/roadmap?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> discusses the plan post-V1 release.&nbsp;</p><p></p> <p>About Panther</p><p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Multi-signature structures have been around for a while and are securing billions of euros in digital assets. But how do they work? And what are the main differences with a simple single-signature structure?</p>



<p>In this article we will discuss what multi-signature structures are, the use cases of multi-signature structures, and how multi-signature structures work.</p>



 What is a multi-signature structure? 



<p>In essence, a multi-signature structure is a key security feature employed within the blockchain ecosystem to ensure that specific actions require the approval and cooperation of multiple parties before they can be executed. Unlike signatures in the physical world, signatures on a blockchain are performed using digital keys belonging to a certain party.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on a single digital signature, a multi-signature structure mandates that a predefined number of authorised signatures need to happen before a transaction can be executed.</p>



<p>It is important to note that in certain cases a multi-signature structure may also refer to a structure in which an action may require only one signature but has multiple parties that can authorise this action.</p>



 Why multi-signature structures are essential 



<p>But why would anyone use a multi-signature structure in the first place? The answer is simple: security. In a digital ecosystem in which certain actions can not be undone, it is crucial that the integrity and security of these transactions is guaranteed. A multi-signature structure adds an additional security layer to the blockchain ecosystem and addresses some of the security risks of single-signature structures.</p>



 Security risks of single-signature structures 



<p>Single-signature structures, where a single key holder can perform certain actions, are susceptible to various security risks and challenges, such as:</p>



 
 Single point of failure: A single compromised key, whether due to theft, hacking, or human error, can lead to unauthorised access and the loss of digital assets. High-profile hacks and cryptocurrency thefts, such as the infamous Mt. Gox hack in 2014, have often resulted from this single point of failure, putting significant amounts of wealth at risk. 



 Lack of accountability: In a single-signature system, the responsibility and accountability for transactions and decisions rest solely on the key holder. This setup can lead to abuse of power, lack of transparency, and difficulties in tracing fraudulent or unauthorised activities. 



 Loss of keys: The loss of a single private key can result in permanent loss of access to digital assets, which is a common and irreversible issue in the cryptocurrency space. A multi-signature structure can help prevent this while also increasing security. 
 



 Use cases of multi-signature structures 



<p>As is clear from the above, single-signature structures are simple and convenient but can carry significant security risks. Multi-signature structures can address some of these risks in the following ways in various domains:</p>



 
 Secure transactions: Multi-signature structures in wallets, accounts, or smart contracts are used to secure cryptocurrency transactions, requiring the approval of multiple key holders. This approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised or fraudulent transactions. 



 Governance: In corporate environments, multi-signature structures can ensure checks and balances by requiring multiple key holders to approve important actions like financial transactions, board resolutions, or contract agreements. Furthermore, they can be useful for any decentralised multi-party decision-making, such as in DAOs or for blockchain governance. 



 Escrow services: Multi-signature escrow accounts keep financial transactions safe, especially in complex deals. Funds are only released when certain conditions are met. Several key holders must agree, ensuring that the deal terms are followed. This adds an extra layer of security and trust in financial transactions, reducing the chances of disputes and fraud. 



 Custody services: Cryptocurrency custodians and exchanges use multi-signature structures to protect customer assets from threats, including insiders and hackers. With multi-signature wallets, access to assets is controlled by a group of key holders (and often third parties for added security). This makes it tough for a single person to access or manipulate the assets without approval. 



 Legal and compliance: Multi-signature structures are important for legal and compliance processes in the digital world. They ensure that multiple parties must agree on actions like signing contracts or complying with regulations. This reduces legal risks and makes sure these procedures are done correctly. Multi-signature structures promote transparency and security in legal and regulatory matters. 



 Emergency recovery: Multi-signature wallets can act as an emergency recovery mechanism, allowing access to digital assets in case of the loss of one key holder, enhancing the security of digital holdings. 
 



 Why is blockchain needed? 



<p>However, why wouldn’t you use more traditional signature-collection methods? In comparison to traditional methods like multiple Docusign signatures, blockchain offers distinct advantages, particularly in transparency, execution speed, and versatility. Docusign, while efficient for collecting signatures, lacks transparency and doesn’t tie actions directly to signing. It merely signifies approval without immediate execution.</p>



<p>Contrastingly, blockchain’s strength lies in its inherent transparency; each approval is linked to an immediate and irreversible execution of the proposed action. Whether it’s a transaction or a governance proposal, blockchain ensures swift and transparent execution, fostering trust among parties involved. Moreover, Docusign doesn’t provide flexibility in assigning different weights or thresholds for signing. Blockchain, on the other hand, offers versatile permission settings, enabling the establishment of varying levels of authorization. This flexibility extends beyond simple signature collection, making blockchain an invaluable tool for diverse transactional and governance needs within enterprises and across various industries.</p>



 How multi-signature structures work 



<p>Multi-signature structures can be created in multiple ways, such as via account systems, smart contracts, and wallets. While the set-up process for each of these ways can differ, these multi-signature structures all function in a similar way. In order to explain how multi-signature structures work, we will explain multi-signature structures using an account system that can be found on popular blockchains such as <a href="https://eosnetwork.com/">EOS</a>, <a href="https://www.wax.io/">WAX</a>, and <a href="https://xprnetwork.org/">XPR</a>.</p>



 Understanding account systems 



<p>Unlike blockchains like Bitcoin or Ripple which use a single keypair for all transactions, an account system has two different permissions. Permissions can be seen as requirements that need to be fulfilled in order for a transaction to go through. Each permission has certain actions associated with it. A default account has 2 native permissions, namely:</p>



 
 Owner: Shows ownership of the account and is needed to make any changes to the ownership of the account. 



 Active: Used for transferring funds, voting for validators, and making other high-level account changes. 
 



<p>Each permission has one or more key(s) associated with it. Each key associated with a permission has a certain weight, and each permission has a certain weight threshold which needs to be met before a transaction requiring that permission is accepted. This is how an account system works.</p>



 Single-signature structure 



<p>The default structure for these accounts is always a single signature structure. But what does that mean?</p>







<p>As can be seen in the image above, the owner permission has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. The same goes for the active permission which has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. This means that only the (private) key associated with the owner or active permission is required to perform any transaction requiring the owner or active permission, respectively.</p>



<p>In essence, similar to a Bitcoin address, only 1 signature is required to perform any action on this account. This is a single-signature structure.</p>



 Multi-signature structure 



<p>Multi-signature accounts function similarly to default accounts, the main difference between the two is the permissions structure. In a default account all permissions have a threshold of 1 and only have 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it, whereas the permissions in a multi-signature account have a threshold of 2 or higher and have multiple keys or permissions of other accounts with (possibly) varying weights associated with them. This also means that multiple keys or account permissions will have to sign any transaction from the multi-signature account.</p>







<p>An example of a possible permissions structure in a multi-signature account can be seen in the image above. Just like the default account described earlier, this account has both the owner and active permission.</p>



<p>However, the owner permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 3 and has 3 keys associated with it: The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 2, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the owner permission, both John’s active key and either Bob’s or Stacy’s active key would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>The active permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 2 and has 3 keys associated with it. The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 1, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the active permission (any combination) of 2 of the active keys would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>Multi-signature structures like these can be configured in any way, with as many participants as needed, for any goal, ranging from security to governance.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is important to note that in these account systems, or smart contracts, custom permissions can be created for certain actions, such as voting, staking, etc. In order to keep the other permissions separate and secure.</p>

<p>Homo- (Greek prefix meaning ‘same’); -morphic (Greek suffix meaning ‘having a specific shape/form’)<br>Intuitively, one could deduct that homomorphic encryption indicates that the initial data and the encrypted result (cipher) could share the same form. Based on this property, it can be inferred that computation can be performed on the encrypted data, without prior decryption. By decrypting the result, you get the same output as the computation performed on the unencrypted data. While homomorphic encryption can be either additive or multiplicative, fully homomorphic encryption supports both types of operations. Unlike ZKPs, which are proofs of computational integrity, fully homomorphic encryption allows for encrypted data computation, without revealing additional information about the original data. This could provide the missing link for ensuring private transactions on blockchains’ public ledgers.</p><p>We were joined by Rand Hindi, CEO of Zama, to discuss fully homomorphic encryption solutions, how they differ from ZKPs &amp; MPC, and how they can be leveraged to ensure compliant programmable privacy.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Rand’s background and his interest in privacy  Meeting Pascal and founding Zama  Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)  Zero knowledge proofs vs. Multi-party computation vs. Fully homomorphic encryption  Taking fully homomorphic encryption 'mainstream'  Zama’s products  fhEVM  How multi-party computation would secure fhEVM  Multi-key homomorphic encryption &amp; functional encryption  Deploying an FHE rollup  FHE use cases  Privacy  Zama’s business model  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/randhindi">Rand Hindi on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zama_fhe">Zama on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FhenixIO">Fhenix on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  dYdX Foundation: The recently launched dYdX chain features new governance and token economics, that empower stakers and promote validator decentralisation.

 ZenIP 42206 is open for voting. All ZEN holders have until 11/23/2023 00:00 AM UTC (11/22/2023 7:00 PM ET) to cast their vote via <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xc4bc560e7a88348b98ab5c4aa57f847169713cf9280ff164d72302b78d1ae4f2">Snapshot</a>. 
<br>
<p>We’ve noticed that regardless of the voting instructions and documentation that have been provided and positive sentiment towards this proposal, some of the community members may be still experiencing technical difficulties in the voting process. </p>
<p>We have identified four blockers that may be preventing some community members from being able to vote easily. </p>
<p>Here are the solutions for each of these blockers:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 1) Voting from a multi-sig wallet 
<p>If you have ZEN on a multi-sig wallet, you are not able to link it to Horizen EON as this is currently not supported. Multi-sig wallet users can still vote by proving the ownership of their wallet that contains ZEN. Follow these steps:</p>
<br>
 
 You have until the last block before 11/22/2023 08:00 PM UTC (11/22/2023 3:00 PM ET) to send a transaction of 100 zatoshi (0.00001 $ZEN) to this address znmJjX4QyLeZJFawTCP35T7tqfdhNQMNZEJ (Horizen faucet) with the multisignature address you’d like to link. 
 <a href="https://forms.gle/fC24DFkMjPZiZu3dA">Submit this form </a>to claim your multi-sig wallet address before 11/22/2023 09:00PM UTC (11/22/2023 4:00PM ET). 
 Right after that, we will collect, share and apply the allowlist of multi-sig wallets eligible to vote. 
 







 2) Voting from a non-Sphere wallet 



<p>If you have your ZEN in a wallet other than Sphere, such as Arizen or a hard wallet, you can sign a message right from the application/hardware wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your wallet doesn’t support signing custom messages, you can paste your private key at <a href="https://getzen.cash/sign/">https://getzen.cash/sign/</a>, and produce the signature. The procedure is the following:</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your private key making sure you are in a private location.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your EON wallet address, and press on “Sign”.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Copy the signature you have generated.</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a>.</p>



<p>NOTE: Make sure no one can look at your screen, you may expose your private key. Do it at your own risk.</p>



 3) Voting with ZEN staked on a Horizen Node 



<p>If you have ZEN staked on a Horizen node, you can just sign the message with the command:</p>



<p>zen-cli signmessage %ZEN_ADDRESS% “%YOUR_EON_ACCOUNT%”</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a></p>



 4) Voting with ZEN stored on an exchange&nbsp; 



<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to vote using a ZEN balance that is stored on an exchange at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NOTE: miners may experience a discrepancy between the balance available on the explorer and the one available as voting power. That’s because the new Coinbase output is not seen until it’s involved in the first transaction.</p>

<p></p><p>London, 20th November 2023 – The GBBC Digital Finance (GDF) team led engagements around the world last week. Whilst our policy team and Chair of the Board soft-launched GDF’s Digital Finance All-Party Parliamentary Group in London at Digital Assets Week, GDF CEO, Emma Joyce and GDF Head of Community, Madeleine Boys, made their way to Asia to join many industry leaders, regulators, and policymakers at Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF).</p>
<p>As a prelude to the Festival, Elevandi – a not-for-profit organisation set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) – curated and hosted Elevandi Insights, a day of thoughtful roundtable discussions focused on digital finance. AI and Financial Inclusion were both important themes of the day, alongside tokenisation, payments, and digital financial market infrastructure as prevailing discussion topics which set the tone for SFF.</p>
<p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and tokenised money took the centre stage for the Festival’s payments discussions. Several panels mentioned the crucial role of interoperability in the evolution of CBDCs. Speakers also emphasised its broader application in asset tokenisation, which was highlighted from both the public and private sector – find out more from MAS’ recent <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/guardian/interlinking-networks-technical-paper-vfinal.pdf">“Interlinking Networks Technical Whitepaper</a>”.<br><br>Central banks examined the role of CBDCs as drivers of financial inclusion and vehicles to minimise prudential risks once the onset technological risks are overcome. Large financial institutions and private sector representatives highlighted the importance of tokenised money – whether it be in the form of a CBDC or other forms of tokenised money – as the key to settlement as well as the broader scalability of the industry.</p>
<p>Building on these discussions, MAS published the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/project-orchid/orchid-blueprint-final.pdf">Orchid Blueprint</a> outlining the necessary technological infrastructure for future digital currency transactions in Singapore. This blueprint, derived from insights gained during the Project Orchid industry trials, identifies four essential building blocks to support the effective use of digital money in Singapore:</p>
 
 Settlement Ledger: This component is designed to record digital money transfers, featuring native programmability and the atomic settlement of digital tokens. 
 Tokenisation Bridge: Serving as a vital link, this bridge connects existing account-based settlement systems with ledgers that are compatible with tokenised forms of digital money. 
 Programmability Protocol: The blueprint proposes a common protocol, known as Purpose Bound Money (PBM), enabling the specification of conditions for the use of digital money. 
 Name Service: To enhance accessibility and verification, a Name Service is recommended, translating between complex wallet addresses and alternative name identifiers that are readable and meaningful. 
 
<p>The importance of resilient digital Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI) emerged as another theme in these discussions, emphasising its role as a key enabler to the broad adoption and growth of digital assets. The value of open and interoperable networks among global banks and regulators cannot be understated, and the SFF set the scene for another major announcement in this area.</p>
<p>MAS also unveiled a significant expansion of <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiativeshttps:/www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiatives">Project Guardian</a>, which will delve into promising use cases of asset tokenisation on a public blockchain. The most significant aspect is the introduction of new initiative called Global Layer One (GL1), conceived as an open, digital infrastructure fostering cross-border transactions and global liquidity pools. Major institutions such as BNY Mellon, JP Morgan, DBS, and MUFG will participate. This marks a pivotal step toward integration across the entire capital markets value chain, encompassing listing, distribution, trading, settlement, and asset servicing. Key highlights include:</p>
 
 J.P. Morgan and Apollo are collaborating on leveraging digital assets to facilitate more seamless investment and management of discretionary portfolios and alternative assets. The collaboration also involves automated portfolio rebalancing and customization at scale, promising time savings and a reduction in manual processes related to asset servicing. 
 BNY Mellon and OCBC are engaged in a trial for a cross-border FX payment solution, aiming to facilitate secure and interoperable payment solutions across diverse networks. 
 
<p>GDF convened its members its members together on two distinct occasions, both characterised by the same positive atmosphere that resonated with the overall optimistic outlook of SFF.</p>
<p>Our dinner, which we hosted in partnership with Hogan Lovells, focused on the challenges to building digital trust, and facilitating tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs), and the role regulators and policymakers have to play in balancing innovation with safe regulatory frameworks. Ken Coghill from the DFSA and Danny Russell from the Bank of England joined us and shared some opening remarks on behalf of their agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our lunch, which we hosted in partnership with Clifford Chance, brought together technologists and policy experts for a comprehensive discussion on challenges and essential components for institutionalising digital assets, emphasising ongoing technical efforts to enable financial institutions to leverage public blockchain technology. Malcolm Wright, OKX and former VARA regulator, and John Ho, Standard Chartered, opened the lunch with some optimistic remarks about the&nbsp;direction of travel for industry, with a keen focus on the APAC region.</p>
<p>We could not be more grateful for the continued support of our association’s mission to promote best standards of practice for the digital asset ecosystem, and look forward to continuing to bring together and building our community in the APAC region.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Basic Attention Token announces the ‘Sage Burn’, the final mint phase of the BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT collection, set for December 7th, 2023. NFT holders can join this event on Bandit Network, exchanging three NFTs for a rare Sage NFT. This event kicks off a series of exciting BAT NFT collaborations with Bandit.</p>
<p>December 5th, 2023—Basic Attention Token (BAT) is thrilled to announce the “Sage Burn,” the concluding mint phase of the <a>BAT x Adam Ape Brave NFT collection, first launched in November 2022</a> on Solana. Starting on Thursday, December 7th, 2023, we invite holders of BAT x Adam Ape NFTs to participate in the Sage Burn event by <a>“burning”</a> a set of three specific NFTs—Curious, Dabbler, and Degen—to receive one of the highly exclusive Sage NFTs, featuring bespoke artwork from <a href="https://twitter.com/adam_ape_">Adam Ape</a>, and limited to just 300 pieces.</p>

The Sage</p>
<p>Bandit Network, a Web3 platform focused on developing multi-blockchain NFT minting and quests, is hosting the Sage Burn event. With their expertise in crafting engaging and accessible NFT experiences across the many networks supported in Brave Wallet, Bandit brings a fresh perspective to this project. We look forward to this being the first of many BAT NFT collaborations with Bandit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the outset, the goal of the BAT x Adam Ape NFT project has been to showcase BAT/NFT capabilities within the Solana ecosystem. During the premiere mint on November 9th, 2022, fans could purchase BAT x Adam Ape NFTs using <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">Solana-wrapped BAT</a> in addition to SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. The BAT and Solana NFT communities launched the mint with tremendous success, with all 2500 NFTs from the first three tiers minting within three hours.</p>
<p>For collectors and enthusiasts of Brave and Basic Attention Token, owning a Sage NFT is akin to possessing a piece of digital history. These NFTs symbolize the culmination of the first-ever cross-chain BAT NFT mint, and the inaugural BAT NFT collection launch on Solana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For existing BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT owners, access to our exclusive #holders-chat and #holders-giveaways channels is available upon verification.</p>

 What does ‘burning an NFT’ entail, and is it reversible? 
<p>‘Burning an NFT’ refers to the irreversible process of permanently destroying it by transferring it to an address from which it cannot be retrieved. In the Sage Burn event, you’ll encounter several prompts to confirm your decision, emphasizing the irreversible nature of burning your NFTs. Once an NFT is burned, the action cannot be reversed.</p>


    
    

    




    
    


 Who can join the Sage Burn, and is it limited to certain regions? 
<p>Anyone worldwide can participate in the Sage Burn, as long as they possess the requisite set of NFTs.&nbsp;</p>

 Which specific NFTs are required to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>You must possess at least one NFT from each of the three tiers: Curious, Dabbler, and Degen. The NFTs can be purchased separately on secondary marketplaces. (See below.)&nbsp;</p>

 I missed the first phase of the mint. Can I still join the Sage Burn? 
<p>Absolutely! You can purchase BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFTs on secondary marketplaces using Solana (SOL). These marketplaces include <a href="https://magiceden.io/marketplace/bat">Magic Eden</a>, <a href="https://hyperspace.xyz/collection/batxadamape">Hyperspace</a>, and <a href="https://www.tensor.trade/trade/bat">Tensor</a>. Acquiring a set containing a Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFT enables you to participate in the Sage Burn event.</p>

 What do the numbers on my BAT x Adam Ape NFTs signify, and do they impact my participation in the Sage Burn? 
<p>The number on each BAT x Adam Ape NFT indicates its minting order within the collection. For instance, an NFT numbered #139 signifies it was the 139th to be minted. These numbers do not influence your eligibility for the Sage Burn. To participate, you must possess at least one NFT from each of the three tiers—Curious, Dabbler, and Degen – in your connected wallet at the time of the Burn.</p>

 Is it possible to burn multiple sets of Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs to acquire several Sage NFTs? 
<p>Certainly. You have the option to burn any number of Curious, Dabbler, and Degen sets that you possess. If you own multiple NFTs from each tier, you can decide to burn only some of the sets. The choice is yours!</p>

 What if I choose not to burn my Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs? 
<p>That’s completely fine! Holding onto your Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs is entirely your choice. Participation in the Sage Burn is optional, and you are free to decide whether or not to take part.</p>

 Is it possible to get a Sage NFT without participating in the Sage Burn? 
<p>Certainly! After the Sage Burn event, Sage NFTs will be available for purchase on secondary NFT marketplaces.</p>

 What happens if not all 300 Sage NFTs are minted? 
<p>In the event that not all 300 Sage NFTs are minted, the outcome is a smaller circulation of these NFTs. This limited availability inherently increases the rarity of the existing Sage NFTs.</p>

 What is the total supply for each tier in the collection? 
<p>The BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT collection is distributed across four tiers:</p>
 
 The Curious: 1400 NFTs 
 The Dabbler: 800 NFTs 
 The Degen: 300 NFTs 
 The Sage: 300 NFTs maximum*&nbsp; 
 

 What Web3 wallet is needed to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>To join the Sage Burn, you can use your Brave Wallet or any other Solana DApp-compatible wallet, such as Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, and more. You can also use a hardware wallet, such as a Ledger or Trezor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please ensure that all the BAT x Adam Ape NFTs you plan to burn are consolidated in the same wallet. This wallet should be connected to Bandit Network at the time of the Burn.</p>

 Do my BAT x Adam Ape NFTs need to be in the same wallet? 
<p>All NFTs you plan to burn for the Sage Burn event must be in a single Web3 wallet. This wallet should be the one you connect to Bandit Network for participation in the Burn.</p>

 Can I use the Brave Wallet in my Brave mobile app to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>Absolutely. To participate, visit Bandit Network and connect using your Brave Wallet when prompted.</p>

 How can I see my NFTs in the Brave Wallet? 
<p>To view your NFTs, simply go to the NFTs tab in your Brave Wallet.</p>

 I want to sell, trade, or transfer my NFTs. Where can I do this? 
 
 To transfer an NFT: In your Brave Wallet, select the NFT you wish to transfer, click on ‘Send,’ and enter the recipient’s address. 
 To sell or trade: Visit platforms like <a href="https://magiceden.io/marketplace/bat">Magic Eden</a>, <a href="https://hyperspace.xyz/collection/batxadamape">Hyperspace</a>, or <a href="https://www.tensor.trade/trade/bat">Tensor</a>. Connect your Brave Wallet or another Solana DApp wallet to carry out the transaction. 
 

 What are wrapped tokens and what is sBAT (Solana-Wrapped BAT)? 
<p>Wrapped tokens facilitate the use of assets across different blockchains, improving functionality and interoperability. This process locks the original tokens on their native blockchain and creates an equal number of wrapped tokens on a smart-contract blockchain such as Ethereum</p>
<p>sBAT is an example of this. There are several ways to buy or bridge BAT on Solana:</p>
 
 Purchase wBAT directly in the Brave Wallet using Ramp’s fiat-to-crypto service or convert existing SOL to wBAT. 
 Bridge BAT from Ethereum to Solana using the Wormhole Bridge. 
 

 Where can I purchase SOL? 
<p>You can purchase SOL, the Solana network’s cryptocurrency, directly in the Brave Wallet using fiat or crypto via Coinbase Pay, Link by Stripe, Ramp, or other available options. Alternatively, SOL is also available on any cryptocurrency exchange that supports Solana.</p>

 When will you reveal utility for the Sage? 
<p>While there is no guarantee of added utility for the Sage at the time of the Burn, we are collaboratively exploring future options with the BAT Community. Join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/batbrigade">BAT Brigade Discord</a> and Tuesday <a href="https://talk.brave.com/this--is--your--weekly--bat-community--call">BAT Community Calls</a> at 2pm PST/5pm EST to contribute to this ongoing process.</p>

 Deploy a bridged USDC token contract with optionality for native issuance  
<p>Permissionless composability is one of the hallmarks of Web3, contributing to the rapid growth of new applications and blockchain networks by leveraging existing open technology. Circle’s <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">USDC</a> is no exception, stemming from the innovations of the ERC-20 standard and countless third-party frameworks to become the trusted dollar-backed stablecoin that it is today.</p> 
<p>As of November 2023, USDC is issued and circulating natively on 15 blockchains – 7 more than last year – and yet it is also clear to Circle and the broader community that many more blockchains may emerge and rise to prominence over the next several years. These new blockchains could benefit significantly from having access to USDC.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>It’s time to review what Team Panther was up to last week. Here's everything that transpired at Panther last week:</p> Marketing Updates  Extension of the Advanced Staking Program <p>Advanced Staking V4 is now live for the next four months and $ZKP holders can now stake their tokens again. This was made possible due to the successful approval of PIP-19 and the commendable efforts of our <a href="https://github.com/pantherprotocol/panther-core/pull/12/commits/eb1a943766befac076922ffd5f7d1d1ceac616fa?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">community members</a> for updating related smart contracts and deploying a new frontend on IPFS. You can learn more about how to stake your $ZKP <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/staking/advanced-staking-v0.5?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol’s CEO, Oliver Gale, at the European Blockchain Convention <p>Panther Protocol’s Co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, joined a panel discussion on web3 privacy along with leaders from Secret Network and Zama at the European Blockchain Convention. This panel was part of the Secret Soiree side event on the final day of the convention. You can watch a recording of the session below.</p> Product Updates  Stage 2 Developments  Recharge Functionality <p>Making further advancements on Stage 2 of the protocol, the development of recharge functionality for Protocol Rewards has been completed and will be announced separately once the vesting of $tZKP is configured. The Recharge function is the cornerstone of the protocol’s reward system and allows protocol rewards vested on Mainnet to be injected into the reward distribution process on Polygon (viz the one-sided AMM launched in Stage 2). This dynamic interplay with the AMM pool through the Recharge function fosters active user participation while maintaining a responsive and adaptive reward structure within the protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>You can learn more about our reward structure <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a></p> Stage 3 Developments  Circuits <p>The main transaction circuit is ready for Stage 3 and the team will perform the unit testing of the Rewards Extended Circuit and Balance Checker this week. Panther Core dApp user interface is dependent on the smart contract interactions and the circuits designed for these interactions. The design of these circuits is planned in stages to cover basic scenarios first and then move to more complex handling of input parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Contracts <p>The main transaction function of the Pool contract which is the foundation for the stage 3 development has been implemented. We expect to complete integration testing by this week. The Vault V1 contract was delivered earlier and is in review now.&nbsp;</p> UI/UX Design <p>A new version of Panther V1 Design is being worked on and the community should expect a brand new design work to be released as part of Stage 3.</p> Community Questions <p>When will the team publish the updated roadmap?</p><p>The team plans to release an updated product roadmap this week. </p>  About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

Find out how to <a href="https://nymtech2.typeform.com/deleprog">apply</a> for your mix nodes below. The winners will also receive dedicated mentorship from some of the Nym community’s most successful operators, including: Pawnflake, Noisk8, Supermeia, Unclelem.</p> Delegation Programme 2.0 — a step towards strong coverage and decentralisation <p>The Nym mixnet is completely powered by the individuals who run gateways and mix nodes. This is real decentralisation in action. But in order to support the upcoming NymVPN, it’s essential that the infrastructure is running as effectively as possible to accommodate large increases in&nbsp;traffic.</p><p>The goal of the delegation programme is to boost high quality nodes to reach saturation levels where they can start earning rewards. The programme will focus&nbsp;on:</p>  Improving the geographical spread of Nym nodes and redundancy of the&nbsp;network  Increasing the number of Exit&nbsp;Gateways  Ensure well-performing nodes are included in the active&nbsp;set  <p>Right now, more than 550 Mix Nodes operate across the world. Every epoch, 240 of these nodes are selected to the ‘active set’ to provide privacy and earn rewards based on their total stake (reputation).</p><p>However, many new nodes do not have enough stake to get them into the active set. Furthermore, the geographical coverage is somewhat uneven. (See: <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym Explorer</a>)</p><p>The Nym Delegation Programme will bring selected, high-performing nodes closer to the ‘stake saturation point’, therefore making them more likely to be picked for mixing traffic and earn rewards. This will ultimately improve redundancy and geographic coverage.</p><p>The Delegation Programme is about scaling and decentralising the Nym network and improving usability of Nym software. It is designed to improve redundancy by bootstrapping well-performing nodes, particularly those in locations with lower coverage.</p> Operators: apply&nbsp;now! <p>Applications are officially open today, 20 November and close on the 1st of December.</p><p><a href="https://nymtech2.typeform.com/deleprog">Apply here</a> for the chance of a share in the 30M NYM delegations pot — and becoming a top mix node operator.</p><p>Requirements:</p>  Good uptime of your Nym mix&nbsp;node  Your node is currently under 30% stake saturation  You are willing to run a Nym Exit Gateway (preference given to node operators who already run both a mix node and a gateway. Nym Mix Nodes and Gateways will soon be “smooshed” into one binary. Read more&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/faq/smoosh-faq.html#overview">here</a>.)  Preference is given to nodes that are not using AWS, Hetzner, Contabo or Google Cloud VPS providers (check <a href="https://status.notrustverify.ch/d/CW3L7dVVk/nym-mixnet?orgId=1&amp;from=1697899456550&amp;to=1700491456550&amp;viewPanel=32">here</a> for distribution across VPS providers)  <p>Target geographies:</p>  Priority is given to nodes in countries with more than 15 million inhabitants where there are no&nbsp;nodes.  In particular, nodes are welcomed in China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Philippines, Egypt, Nigeria, Turkey, Pakistan, Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh, South Korea, Algeria, Kenya,&nbsp;Ghana.   Key info   Applications open today — apply&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech2.typeform.com/deleprog">here</a>  Applications close 1 December and winners will be announced 15&nbsp;December  A total of 15m-30m NYM in delegations up for&nbsp;grabs  Between 50 and 100 mix nodes will be selected for delegations  A delegation amount of 250,000 NYM from the treasury, to bring nodes to a saturation level that at minimum should get them into the active set approximately 80% of the&nbsp;time  Winning nodes will receive mentorship from successful Nym community operators  The programme will run for 1&nbsp;year   Final note: Nym node&nbsp;settings <p>Nym node operators set their own operator costs (which are redeemed first to cover the cost of operations) and their own profit margin (what the operator claims as profit). The rest of the node rewards are then distributed to people who have delegated stake to that&nbsp;node.</p><p>Now, what has been happening over the past few months is we have seen operators set their profit margin to the minimum in order to attract delegations, but then adjusting their operator costs to sky-high levels. This is considered dishonest behaviour as it tricks delegators and forces a race to the bottom, with operators competing on who has the lowest delegations.</p><p>In order to address this problem, a minimum profit margin will shortly be set to 7% and a maximum operator cost of 2,000 NYM&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>If you have any questions or comments — please get in touch via operator channels in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Element</a>, <a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">Telegram</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>!</p> Resources <p><a href="https://nymtech2.typeform.com/deleprog">Application form</a></p><p><a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym mixnet&nbsp;explorer</a></p><p><a href="https://status.notrustverify.ch/d/CW3L7dVVk/nym-mixnet?orgId=1&amp;from=1697899456550&amp;to=1700491456550">Nym mixnet stats</a> (brought to you by&nbsp;<a href="https://notrustverify.ch/">NTV</a>)</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/operators">Nym node operator&nbsp;guide</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/faq/smoosh-faq.html#overview">Project Smoosh</a> (technical roadmap for Nym&nbsp;nodes)</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/exit-gateway.html">Running an Exit&nbsp;Gateway</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-is-not-a-blockchain-but-it-is-powered-by-one-4bb16ef16587">Nym is not a blockchain but is powered by one</a> (learn about the difference between a Nym node and validators)</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-delegation-programme-is-now-open-c371c74610c5">Nym node Delegation Programme is now open</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Plants have long produced potent human therapeutics and contributed to over 20% of drugs approved since the 1980s, including Morphine and Artemisinin. Although monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs), a promising class of plant-derived compounds with unique pharmacological properties that have already produced drugs such as the chemotherapy vinblastine, could help to revolutionize treatments in mental health and pain management, obtaining sufficient quantities of MIAs for the development of new drugs remains a major challenge due to reliance on natural sources and difficulties scaling chemical synthesis, both of which severely limit the quantities of MIAs that can be produced.</p><p><a href="https://biomia.com/">Biomia</a> has developed a platform for mass-producing plant natural products, particularly MIAs, using engineered yeast. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-krogh-jensen-1a589b6/?originalSubdomain=dk">Michael</a> and <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/jie-zhang">Jie</a>, now Biomia’s CEO and CSO respectively, led the collaborative research effort in partnership with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-keasling-6783754/">Jay Keasling</a>, a well-renowned researcher and entrepreneur in the field of synthetic biology and a Scientific Advisor for Biomia, funded with $10 million by the EU through the <a href="https://www.miami-project.eu/">MIAMI</a> project, a $3 million grant from the Bio-Innovation Institute in Denmark, as well as substantial soft-funding from the Novo Nordisk Foundation. Their breakthrough Nature <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05157-3">study</a> showcased de novo microbial biosynthesis of vinblastine (brand name Velban®), a clinically-approved cancer treatment molecule, achieving the longest biosynthetic pathway replicated in yeast. Expanding upon their initial discovery, the team has also achieved the ability to enhance natural molecules with chemical halogens, creating the possibility to develop novel drugs inspired by natural products with enhanced therapeutic properties — and potentially fewer side&nbsp;effects.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>MIAs are a promising therapeutic class to treat pain, mental disorders and substance abuse disorders, all indications with markets &gt; $10bn globally each, and with an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics. Alone the growing opioid crisis has amplified the need for novel, effective pain medication and therapies for substance abuse, and most anti-psychotics have severe adverse effects with no alternative treatments available. We believe Biomia has the potential to harness its drug discovery and MIA manufacturing platform to revolutionize the treatment landscape for numerous mental and physical disorders through countless novel, nature-inspired molecules.</p><p>We’re excited to be backing the Biomia team on their mission to mass-produce plant natural products from some of the world’s most intractable diseases and additions.

Traditional VPNs know your identity and your browsing history. By using a VPN you might be somewhat shielded from the website or service you are using, but you are entrusting your online privacy to a centralised entity. This exposes you to a single point of control, leaving your data vulnerable to potential breaches, harvesting and surveillance. This creates a single point of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>In short, there is absolutely no need for your VPN to know everything about you in order to provide a good service! In fact, holding all this user information puts both you and the VPN service at risk of data breaches and surveillance. The need for a truly decentralised, privacy-enhancing alternative is painfully evident with the increasing frequency of data breaches and cyberattacks.</p><p>Secondly, when you pay for your VPN, your transaction is routinely interconnected with your online activities, creating a trail of data that can be traced to your digital footprint. This linkage poses a critical privacy risk, as it not only compromises your anonymity but also opens the door for third parties to potentially connect your identity with your specific browsing history and internet usage patterns. The implication of such visibility is far-reaching, often resulting in privacy infringement, unwarranted surveillance, and targeted profiling.</p><p>The exposure of this sensitive information leaves users vulnerable to a range of security risks, including identity theft, data mining, and invasive advertising. There is an urgent need for a more robust and privacy-preserving payment solution that cannot be linked to your online activities, and instead preserves your digital integrity and autonomy.</p><p>And finally, encryption and secure transmissions are important but just not enough to safeguard online privacy. These might protect the content of your communications, but not the patterns of communications. To put it differently, the protection of metadata — the data about your data — remains a formidable challenge.</p><p>Metadata can reveal a great deal about your online behaviour, relationships, and even your state of mind, leaving you exposed to potential tracking and surveillance. Most existing technologies fall short of protecting metadata, leaving a critical gap in your privacy defences. Someone watching the entire network can use the metadata and analyse patterns of communication to deanonymise and learn a lot about you, your location, relationships and habits and what you are doing&nbsp;online.</p> Introducing NymVPN <p>The underlying technology used in NymVPN addresses each of these major vulnerabilities.</p><p>Firstly, NymVPN runs on the fully decentralised Nym network and uses a novel onion encryption such that the app and infrastructure simply cannot know anything about your online activity. Each packet you send looks exactly identical, and each hop through the network only knows the next hop and nothing else about the destination.</p><p>Secondly, the novel zk-nym scheme can be used to prove that someone has paid for the NymVPN, but delinking any wallet address or credit card details from usage of the app. This means you can fairly pay for the service without leaking any unnecessary data points. This will be a huge step and effectively the first live use-case of zk-nyms as a means to anonymously prove right of access to apps and services.</p><p>And last, but not least, NymVPN will have two modes in one app: a speedy 2-hop wireguard VPN and a mixnet mode for strong metadata protection. This will allow you to select different modes for different needs, so that your streaming, for example, can happen over the 2-hop mode uninterrupted, while more sensitive messaging, emails and transactions can take place over the mixnet for strong protection. R&amp;D into split-tunneling is currently also taking place, which would allow you to set your preferences per app. If there is enough demand, this will become a priority!</p><p>This is an open invitation to privacy experts and enthusiasts to join the NymVPN on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#NymVPN:nymtech.chat">Matrix</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/channels/824256813200834580/1174608947697684480">Discord</a>.</p><p>Help ensure that NymVPN solves real-world problems and can confidently be launched as one of the world’s most trustworthy and privacy-enhancing technologies.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-an-invitation-for-privacy-experts-and-enthusiasts-63644139d09d">NymVPN — an invitation for privacy experts and enthusiasts</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        The developer revolution will be as important as the AI revolution.      



 
<p>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is Silicon Valley’s latest obsession. Brilliant minds like <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/elon-musk-reveals-xai-efforts-predicts-full-agi-by-2029/">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">Sam Altman</a> believe achieving AGI is not just likely, but inevitable. Others disagree. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_i-think-the-phrase-agi-should-be-retired-activity-6889610518529613824-gl2F/">Yann LeCun</a>, one of the godfathers of machine learning, has said “there is no such thing as AGI.” <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23779413/silicon-valleys-ai-religion-transhumanism-longtermism-ea">Jack Clark</a> of Anthropic has described the “breathless enthusiasm” for AGI as a “misplaced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M2DaQxTihc">religious impulse</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a lightning rod, AGI captures our imagination. AGI promises <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sam-altman-on-the-a-i-revolution-trillionaires/id1548604447?i=1000525043188">free education and housing</a>, the eradication of poverty with universal basic income, and a reallocation of human capital to science and art. These are worthwhile objectives.</p>



<p>But what if AGI is a distraction? What if there’s another path to this same future—one that does not require a technological leap of faith and is already underway?</p>



<p>There are more developers today than ever before. And the population is starting to snowball. Our thesis is that bringing 1B developers into the software economy could rival AGI in terms of its economic impact.1</p>



<p>Software engineering is one of the most powerful tools that humans have ever invented. If we can make it even more widely available—assisted and accelerated by AI—it could result in the automation of many non-tech industries, creating an economic surplus.</p>



<p>But is this target of 1B developers really achievable? Isn’t software engineering too hard to teach to so many people? And what would we do with all those developers?</p>



<p>Let’s start with the goal of 1B developers. This year, the developer population crossed <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">100M</a>, up from 24M when Github first started reporting the metric in 2017.2 In Github’s recently published <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">State of the Octoverse</a> report, they shared that the global developer population grew 26% in the last year. Github added 21M new accounts in 2022.</p>



<p>We have three reasons to believe hypergrowth in the developer population will persist.<br></p>



<p>First, it’s been getting much easier to become a developer, and we expect this flywheel to continue. In just the last decade, Cloud abstracted away the server. Databases like MongoDB and Postgres simplified the back-end. Vercel and React reshaped the front-end. The best software engineers continue to focus on improving the discipline itself. By iteratively building better and better abstractions, software engineers have created a flywheel that reduces complexity while increasing potency. As a result, a 12 year-old in India can now build a web app in a matter of days, something that would have taken a professional developer weeks before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, market forces continue to attract more and more young people to become software engineers. Already, the best and brightest are disproportionately learning to code. Rather than dampening as more talent has entered the field, the economic returns to software engineering only seem to be expanding. What this means is that the productivity of software engineers, and the applicability of their skills, is expanding faster than the supply.</p>



<p>Third, AI has been an unanticipated accelerator. Today, <a href="https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-for-business-is-now-available/">Github Copilot</a> is writing 46% of users’ code. <a href="https://zapier.com/ai">Zapier</a> enables developers to build automations with text descriptions. <a href="https://openinterpreter.com/">Open Interpreter</a> is turning the command line into a chat interface. With AI copilots, we may eventually be able to program computers using natural language alone.</p>



<p>Growth in the developer population enables the software economy to broaden its scope and impact. For example, companies like Stripe, Twilio and Plaid have created essential building blocks for payments, telecommunications and banking. Traditional companies in mature industries are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/18/despite-mass-layoffs-led-by-meta-its-still-hard-to-fill-tech-jobs.html">bringing on</a> more and more software engineers to drive internal digitization. Newer startups are also taking software and AI and applying these technologies to sectors like mining, robotics, construction, accounting and legal. The opportunity with 1B developers is to drive automation not just in the digital economy, but in the physical economy as well.</p>



<p>Unlike AGI, the promise of 1B developers is not about eliminating work altogether. Rather, it is about taking our resources—human resources—and leveraging them to have more and more impact. Thus, the story of the coming decades may be about the increased power of AI. But more quietly, the methodical march of the developer revolution will continue.&nbsp;</p>

 The <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen DAO</a> is open for voting, and on 11/20/2023 at 00:00am UTC, the Horizen community can start voting on <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a>, to decide whether or not the Horizen Secure Node rewards should be redirected to Horizen EON forger nodes.&nbsp; 



 About ZenIP 42206 – The First DAO Proposal 



<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> proposes redirecting the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The purpose is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network.</p>



<p>To learn more about ZenIP 42206 and the rationale behind the proposal, please read this blog: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">ZenIP 42206 Explained: Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards Into Horizen EON</a></p>



<p>ZenIP 42206 is the first community proposal to be voted on by the Horizen community via the Horizen DAO. Through the <a href="https://forum.horizen.io">Horizen DAO</a>, every member of the Horizen community can have a say in the project’s direction. Check out <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">our documentation</a> if you want to know more about how the <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">Horizen governance</a> works.</p>



 The ZenIP 42206 Voting Process and Timeline 


 
 


<p></p>



<p>The Horizen DAO voting is done on <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a>, an EVM-compatible sidechain on Horizen. The Horizen DAO uses <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a> and <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a> for governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Will the Voting Start?</p>



<p>The voting period for any given proposal will have a specified start and end date and will last 72 hours.&nbsp;</p>



&nbsp;Voting for ZenIP 42206 will start on November 20th,2023 at 00:00AM UTC (November 19th 7:00PM ET), and end on November 23rd, 2023 at 00:00AM UTC (November 22nd, 2023 at 7:00PM ET).&nbsp;



<p></p>



<p>Who is Eligible to Vote?</p>



<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.<br><br>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore, the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>



 How to Vote? 



<p>Before voting, be sure to have read everything about ZenIP 42206 from the following resources:</p>

 Instructions 



 
 Go to the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen DAO Governance page</a> on the Horizen EON web app to get started. 
 



 
 Connect your web3 wallet (ex. MetaMask). P<a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet">lease follow this guide</a> if you need help. 
 



 
 Link your Horizen mainchain $ZEN address to Horizen EON. In order to vote with your mainchain $ZEN, you need to have $ZEN on a <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere</a> mainchain address and link that address to your MetaMask Horizen EON chain address. You only need to link your <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere wallet</a> once. You can use the same wallet for future voting rounds.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Please see <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">this guide for step-by-step instructions </a>on linking Horizen Mainchain and Horizen EON $ZEN Addresses to aggregate your voting power.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Make sure you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask address for the gas fee. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFsjT069v7E">this tutorial</a> to learn how to transfer ZEN from Horizen mainchain to your Horizen EON address on MetaMask 



 Once your mainchain ZEN address is connected to Horizen EON, and you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask for gas fee, it’s time to vote using Snapshot! 



 Join the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Horizen Foundation space</a> on Snapshot if you haven’t done so, turn on the notification so you will get the updates&nbsp;

      Finding Her Place in the Sun         
	By Harry Spitzer	 



Published November 14, 2023
        Lynn Jurich’s unwavering determination to unlock cleaner, greener energy powered the rise of Sunrun.      



 
<p>In March 2023, solar entrepreneur Lynn Jurich took the stage for the Stanford Graduate School of Business’s Climate, Business &amp; Innovation Summit. In the 15 years that had passed since she had attended the school herself, solar energy had come of age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time in history, the cost of solar energy has fallen below that of fossil fuels, and Sunrun, which Jurich co-founded in 2007, is now the largest installer of residential solar panels in the U.S., with more than 800,000 customers in 20 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico. Her unwavering determination to change energy infrastructure (and the world) is what brought Jurich back to GSB that day. But these achievements, and the survival of her company, were never a given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich took her audience back to Sunrun’s early days, to a time when consumer solar was still the wheelhouse of “hippies and hobbyists,” and installation and hardware were expensive. Back then, Jurich and her co-founders had waded through the complexities of the green energy space without a clear sense for how to make their business model, much less the world, sustainable. And they were perilously close to burning through their venture capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our initial vision was that we would be pretty asset-light,” Jurich told the audience. “The existing solar installers out there would be doing the construction and selling to homeowners. We would raise the capital, and own and monitor the systems. So we’d only need a few employees. But we were wrong. Very, very wrong.”</p>



 



<p>The sun had already set, but the teenage Jurich refused to go back inside without sinking a few more shots. She wouldn’t feel content calling it a day until she was, according to her sister Tracy, “basically shooting NBA free-throw percentages.” Focus, which in this case earned Jurich a spot on the Pac-10 recruiting list for basketball by 8th grade, had been Jurich’s speciality since kindergarten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At five years old, Jurich had started writing to-do lists. “My list would be like, ‘invent something.’ Or, ‘make a scientific discovery,’” she remembers. At age six, reading biographies became her pastime of choice, an activity that suited her introverted nature. She’d go to the public library in her neighborhood near Point Defiance, a lush peninsula jutting into the Puget Sound, and work her way through their nonfiction section. She had lots of things she wanted to accomplish, and was looking for proofs of concept. “I was always attracted to people who mastered their craft,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her early favorites centered on strong women: Florence Nightingale, Betsy Ross, Anne Frank. But fittingly, no biography captivated her more than that of Thomas Edison, inventor of the lightbulb (and 1,000 or so other things). In a prescient 1931 exchange between Edison and Henry Ford, Edison notes, “We should be using nature’s inexhaustible sources of energy—sun, wind and tide.” (According to recent sources, the sun produces enough sunlight to power Earth’s electricity needs for a year every hour.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But truly mastering one’s craft was no easy feat—Jurich had internalized this from her biography obsession. It required resolve and concentration, which Jurich maintained through high school and then college at Stanford, where she earned top honors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After graduating, Jurich landed a competitive role at a prestigious private equity firm. Her job was to get in front of entrepreneurs by any means necessary—cold-calling, attending the same conferences as them, befriending their assistants so that she could sit next to them on a plane—and evaluate them for potential investment opportunities. This was daunting for the self-described “strong introvert,” but once she worked up the nerve she found that pushing herself had an important upside. Like her biography kick on steroids, she got to observe dozens of highly accomplished individuals modeling potential paths to success, an experience that made it clear to her that “if there’s a good company out there, it’s going to get funded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After three years working on the investor side, she needed no further proof of concept. “It was just very clear to me that I wanted to be on the entrepreneur side,” says Jurich. This hard-earned clarity led her to return to Stanford for business school.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“How do we get people to give solar a shot?” It was January 2007, and this was the question Jurich, Ed Fenster, a Stanford GSB classmate, and Nat Kreamer, a childhood friend of Fenster’s, had been debating for weeks over pizza and Diet Coke in the living room of Fenster’s San Francisco apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’d filed the paperwork for their company Sunrun just a few days earlier, officially making this question of particular interest for the group. Jurich was fresh off a summer banking internship in Shanghai, where she had been struck by the density of construction and urban energy infrastructure. She couldn’t stop thinking about clean energy and how to make continued infrastructure development more sustainable. Kreamer was recently back from a tour in Afghanistan and motivated to seek energy independence after fighting in a war he’d concluded was mostly about fossil fuels. Fenster had connected the dots, uniting the team in his apartment to solve the challenge of solar expansion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fueled by cheesy carbohydrates and artificial sweetener, they concluded that the real opportunity lay not in developing cleantech, but in deploying it. “We saw that VC money was already being put toward making solar panels cheaper. We were quite certain that innovation was going to happen,” says Jurich. “So we thought, ‘Why don’t we solve the problem of convincing people to give solar panels a shot, and figuring out how to interface with the electric grid?’ That was gonna be the bigger challenge and the bigger area to add value.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer they settled on was to lower the barrier to solar adoption as much as possible for homeowners. Sunrun would offer ‘solar-as-a-service,’ leasing solar panels with a small upfront cost at a time when owning and installing one’s own solar panels was still logistically challenging, and prohibitively expensive for many. “The business model innovation was that we would put solar panels on your rooftop for very little money, and you would sign a 20-year contract to buy the electricity from us for X cents per kilowatt hour,” says Jurich. “So it was a long-term contract for us, the customer didn’t have to spend the money up front, and they could get cheaper power. Win-win all the way around.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going the consumer route, as opposed to leasing solar panels to corporations, was an added challenge, however. It meant figuring out how to install and operate panels on houses of all shapes and sizes in varying conditions around the country. But if they could manage all of that, Jurich believed this approach would ultimately make a more defensible business. “We believed costs would hit grid parity first at the consumer level because consumers pay the most money for power,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By narrowing their focus to homeowners, the founders were actually thinking bigger—not only would they be spreading clean energy, they could reduce inefficiencies in energy infrastructure. “What’s really innovative about solar is you can use an existing roof,” says Jurich. “You don’t have to acquire land. You don’t have to build big transmission lines. You don’t have to interrupt the ecosystem.” The value prop and climate impact seemed undeniable. They’d soon find out it wasn’t such an easy sell.&nbsp;</p>
 







 
<p>Jurich’s voice was hoarse from hollering at passersby. This was her third county fair in as many days, dusty and hot, and a far cry from her time in private equity traveling on private jets (which, at least on an environmental level, felt like karmic justice). Again, Jurich had found herself in the challenging situation of having to talk to strangers. This time, Jurich was donning her company swag (an oversized white tee that read, “A penny for your watts?”) and standing next to an oversized pumpkin. She was desperate to make a sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fenster, they decided early on, would take the role of CEO and focus on raising capital; Kreamer, as president, would take on installations, billing, and system monitoring; and it was up to Jurich as COO to build out their business pipeline (read: sales). She had deduced that the quickest way to sell consumers on solar panels was to go straight to the source. “This was 2007. There weren’t a lot of people online searching, you know, ‘I want a solar energy system,’” says Jurich. “So we were like, ‘Where do you find a homeowner who would be interested in Sunrun?’ I decided to go to places with lots of homes and lots of sun.”</p>



<p>From the rare fair-goer who agreed to chat, Jurich gleaned that “going green” still wasn’t enough—they were willing to consider solar only if it saved them money. Even after Sunrun’s upfront costs (initially about $10,000 for installs, still well below the cost of buying and installing one’s own panels), Sunrun would save them money, but only over the course of years—a commitment most consumers weren’t willing to make with a startup that had existed for just a few months. “What I always told them was, ‘If someone came to your house and said they would install a gasoline tank, and you could buy gas for $1 per gallon for the next 20 years, would you do it? That’s what we’re offering: Electricity at a fixed price for 20 years and it’s cheaper,’” says Jurich. “People thought it was too good to be true.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After dozens of refusals, Jurich finally caught the attention of a woman named Sue who ran a trucking company. Jurich made her pitch, highlighting the fixed, long-term rate, which was much lower than traditional electrical costs. She told Sue that Sunrun would own, operate and maintain the solar panels on her roof, but that they outsourced sales and installation to existing solar installers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sue, excited to bet on a young female entrepreneur, was convinced. And Jurich, after months in the summer heat hawking her solar wares, made her third sale (Sunrun’s first sale was to Fenster, and the second was to his therapist). “Seeing that there was actually consumer interest in this helped me so much,” says Jurich, “It gave me the conviction that this was gonna work, that all the hustle was worth it. That conviction can get you through some pretty hard times.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hard times turned out to be just around the corner, and she’d need all the conviction she could muster.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“We’re done for,” Jurich thought as she read the headlines announcing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Bank. It was September 2008, and Sunrun was desperately in need of funding—money that suddenly seemed entirely unattainable.</p>



<p>Sunrun’s early sales had put its business model to the test. Since the company was covering most of the upfront purchase and installation costs, its ability to sell was contingent upon its ability to raise money. But banks wanted proof of sales before lending. “We had a chicken and an egg problem,” says Jurich. The co-founders were forced to use their seed money—a few million they’d managed to raise from contacts in private equity and banking—to finance their earliest installs. But with dwindling funds and no guarantee that they could secure investments to stay afloat, “it made for an extremely stressful time,” Jurich says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They had finally managed to raise $12 million in June 2008, a lifeline as sales were starting to take off—but nothing close to what they needed to scale. Just as new term sheets began to come their way, Lehman Brothers went under, signaling a complete collapse of the financing ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every day, another bank pulled out of negotiations. Sunrun’s point of contact would be fired, or the entire financial institution would dissolve. But then, in November 2008, there came a flicker of hope. The Sunrun founders received a callback from U.S. Bank, the rare financial institution that hadn’t been decimated by the collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing this was likely their only shot, the founders negotiated a deal they hoped would be hard to refuse. “We were panicking,” Jurich says. “But at the same time, we were like ‘We are going to close this deal because we have no choice.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2008, Sunrun closed a $40 million debt financing round from U.S. Bank. “Looking back, we call this moment our big awakening,” Jurich says. Fenster agrees. “Had we not gotten that deal,” he says, “the company might not have made it another four months.”</p>



 



<p>Six years after bringing Sunrun back from the brink, Jurich’s sense of solar inevitability was feeling like less of a moonshot with every passing day. For one, Sequoia became a believer (and led Sunrun’s Series C), as did traditional energy giant, PG&amp;E, who had invested an additional $100 million to finance installations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which isn’t to say things were entirely sunny. Solar gaining traction threatened most other incumbent utilities, who did all they could to block Sunrun’s growth through lobbying. And then there were the government subsidies—hugely positive in the ways they pushed growth in a sustainable direction, but wildly destabilizing from a business perspective, with one subsidy or regulation unlocking a market one month, and an expiring subsidy making another disappear the next.</p>



<p>In 2009, the Obama stimulus package extended a solar tax credit to homeowners who bought their own system. This lowered the purchase price of solar panels overall, which made it harder for Sunrun to convince homeowners to buy into their leasing model, in particular paying for the company’s upfront installation costs. “That blew up our whole transaction model,” says Fenster. Jurich and Fenster, by then co-CEOs (Kreamer left the company in 2009), decided they needed to eliminate upfront costs entirely in order to remain competitive. To compensate, they increased their new customers’ monthly payments while still managing to stay below traditional utility rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their new no-upfront pricing structure made it easier than ever for homeowners to give solar a shot, but not enough to edge out their competition. Elon Musk’s SolarCity had just gone public and was starting to outpace Sunrun. And SolarCity had something crucial that Sunrun lacked: their own operations and installation capabilities. Seven years in, Sunrun was still essentially operating as a management and financing company, relying on third parties for construction, installation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they wanted to scale, Sunrun would have to take over the third-party labor themselves. This, of course, required a huge amount of capital that Sunrun didn’t have. But, no stranger to complex negotiations, Jurich and Fenster managed to secure a massive acquisition of their largest installations partner, REC Solar’s Residential Division (AEE Solar and SnapNrack), in an all-equity deal as a workaround. Overnight, Sunrun grew from 150 employees to 550. That same year, signaling just how much Jurich had grown as a leader since her days of reluctant cold-calling, Fenster stepped down as co-CEO of Sunrun, and Jurich stepped into the role. “Lynn was a better head for the company than I was,” he says. “There are really smart people who are excellent at making decisions but who aren’t great at managing people. Lynn’s unique in that she can do both.”</p>



<p>Poised for expansion, and in the wake of SolarCity’s IPO, the pressure was on for Sunrun to follow suit. “I knew we needed to go public,” Jurich says. “There were a handful of solar IPOs that had just happened that we didn’t believe in, and we thought they were gonna spook the market. So I didn’t really feel that I had the luxury to slow down at any point in the process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not even when she learned she was pregnant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich’s daughter Blythe was born just a few weeks before Sunrun’s IPO on August 5, 2015, and was in Jurich’s arms when she rang the Nasdaq bell. “I got on a conference call the day I got home from the hospital, and my mom moved in and helped me,” says Jurich. (While Jurich, who had her second child in 2018, didn’t take maternity leave, she expanded maternity leave benefits for the rest of the company, signaling that she didn’t expect others to make the same choice that she had.)</p>



<p>Sunrun’s share price dropped roughly 20% on its first day of trading, which only fed Jurich’s resolve to be as present at the company as possible. She started her investor roadshow when Blythe was just five weeks old, bringing her mother and a nurse along for support. “I was constantly pumping and shuttling milk back and forth between hotels and hedge fund offices,” Jurich says. “It was exhausting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2017, Sunrun had rebounded from its post-IPO dip to become the largest publicly traded rooftop solar company in the U.S. following Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity. After years of fundraising, surviving a recession, battling incumbent utilities, navigating company altering climate legislation, IPOing and becoming a mother, Jurich felt like things were finally in a good place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s when the Wall Street Journal article came out.</p>

<p>In the May 2017 piece, former Sunrun employees claimed the company hadn’t reported order cancellations that may have affected sales data in financial disclosures leading up to the IPO. Jurich denied all wrongdoing, claiming the journalism was “not representative of the company and suspect.” Despite Sunrun’s assurances, the article triggered a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) of Sunrun and its competitor, SolarCity. Sunrun’s stock bottomed out. And shareholders filed a class action suit against Sunrun.</p>



<p>Jurich remembers this time, as her company’s reputation and her own integrity were called into question, as one dominated by a profound sense of grief and powerlessness. Ever since her days of writing her first to-do lists, she’d been laser focused on success. But suddenly, no amount of resolve, no degree of hustle could change the way the world perceived her and her company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, months after the initial article broke, Sunrun released a statement saying that after conducting an internal audit, the SEC didn’t find any evidence of manipulated sales data. Still, the company ended up making a $30 million settlement with shareholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Sunrun’s name had technically been cleared, in the weeks following, Jurich continued to struggle emotionally from the toll the probe had taken. For the woman who had defined so much of her life by her achievements, this failure—which she certainly saw it as—felt existential. She faced a choice: “Your options are either to crumble because you can’t deal with it, or to figure out how to keep going and operate at a higher level,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time, she decided that “higher level” didn’t mean working harder. It meant “reflecting on my values, starting a meditation practice, keeping my fitness going, and not caring too much about what other people think,” says Jurich. She was able to let go, minding public perceptions less as her company slowly but surely regained its footing and earned back consumer trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, from their all-time low in share prices, something surprising happened. “The WSJ article was an interesting inflection point for the company,” says Fenster, “because after it caused the stock to bottom, momentum started to come back.” Over the next two years, Sunrun’s stock rose roughly 400%, signaling to the world that Sunrun had staying power.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Just before Thomas Edison’s death, in that same 1931 conversation with Henry Ford, he said, “I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.” Today, Jurich feels closer than ever to paying out her hero’s bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2007, Sunrun has deployed 5.7 gigawatts of total solar capacity, making it one of the world’s largest sources of networked solar energy. In 2019, Sunrun overtook Tesla’s SolarCity as the leading installer of residential rooftop solar panels in the U.S. “We’re at this inflection point where consumers have wrapped their minds around solar power, and they accept it,” says Jurich, who stepped down as CEO of Sunrun in 2021, but remains the company’s Co-Executive Chair.</p>



<p>Part of that acceptance comes from a greater understanding of climate urgency. It comes from legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other clean energy initiatives, reinstates generous tax credits for homeowners who install solar panels. And it comes from increasingly affordable solar hardware, a trend the founders predicted at Sunrun’s outset (today, solar panel prices are down nine times since 2006). An additional factor is technological advancement: “One of the challenges with solar was always that you couldn’t store it,” says Jurich, “but now, batteries have completely changed that. You can generate, store and distribute energy to the grid without building new plants, or even solar farms. You can just use existing roofs!” To that end, in 2020 Sunrun funded and helped found Lunar Energy, an independent company focused on building the next-generation home battery system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade and a half working in clean energy has made Jurich a realist about the magnitude of her company’s undertakings. Which is why, more than ever, she’s looking to others to share the burden, and in part why she returned to her alma mater in March 2023. This was a chance to speak to a new generation of potential clean energy leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do worry that the United States broadly has lost the skillset to develop large-scale infrastructure,” Jurich said toward the end of her keynote. “But I encourage all of you to help. I’ve already talked to a couple of you who have great business ideas around trying to make labor more efficient, making large-scale construction more efficient. And I do think we will get there.”</p>



<p>By “there,” Jurich means a sustainable future of clean energy abundance. And on a personal level, she hopes for a future with more balance, filled with more of the hard-earned equanimity on display at the GSB climate summit. “One of the things I’ve come to appreciate in life is that in order to be most effective, you need periods of both intensity and periods of rest and renewal,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rest, as always with Jurich, is a relative concept. She’s Co-Executive Chair of Sunrun, Chair of Lunar Energy, and she’s launching a women’s health institute and writing a novel—imagining different worlds while working to improve our own. But at the very least, “I’m no longer trying to do it all at once,” she says. That simply wouldn’t be sustainable.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year (Amber O’Hearn, Michael Harms and Jason McGee). Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in December. </p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">ZCG Elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining why they believe they should be elected to the ZCG Committee. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly by replying to their individual posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Monday 4th December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>In mid-December the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select three candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2024.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The three candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2024. </p>



<p>Prospective candidates should beaware of the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications, in accordance with the strictures and guidelines set forth in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a>. Currently, formal Committee meetings are held every two weeks, and the Committee meets informally for brainstorming sessions on a weekly basis. </p>



<p>From January, Committee members will receive a nominal stipend of $650 per calendar month from ZF (paid as shielded ZEC). This stipend may be subject to review, given the budgetary constraints that ZF currently faces.</p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Zcash Foundation is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement, and is obligated to have an appropriate policy and processes in place to ensure that actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed appropriately, in order to avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial authority.. </p>



<p>Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members are required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following policies also apply in relation to ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.

 The Horizen DAO increases community involvement in decision-making for improvements to the protocol and ecosystem. 



<p>The Horizen community is excited to announce the Horizen DAO is now open for all $ZEN holders to participate in governance and take an active role in the direction of the project!</p>



<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. A strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is informed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on the <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/guiding_values">Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 How to Participate in Voting 



<p>Voting for the Horizen DAO is done on Horizen EON, an EVM-compatible sidechain on Horizen. The Horizen DAO uses <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a> and <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a> for governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain including the $ZEN you have staked with the Horizen EON validators. Therefore, the more $ZEN you hold,&nbsp; the more voting power you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.jpg"></a> 


<p></p>



<p>The voting period for any given proposal will have a specified start and end date and will last 72 hours. For more information about the process of voting, please start <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Introducing the Horizen DAO Special Council 



<p>What is the Horizen DAO Special Council?</p>



<p>The Special Council serves as a steward for the Horizen DAO and provides oversight of the Horizen Foundation with security of the Horizen DAO and ecosystem as its paramount focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What exactly does the Special Council do?</p>



<p>Special Council members serve as a DAO committee and function as a liaison between the Horizen community and the Horizen Foundation. In practical terms, this means providing review and oversight during the improvement proposal process, calling emergency operational meetings as needed to discuss and address security threats to the Horizen DAO, any protocol utilizing the Token, the Tokenholders, or the Foundation, and serving as signers on the Horizen community multi-signature wallet.</p>



<p>Who are the Special Council members?</p>



<p>Initially, the Special Council will be made up of 7 individuals initially appointed by the Foundation Director(s):</p>

<p>Leading decentralised perpetual exchange, dYdX V4 recently migrated to Cosmos to build its own sovereign appchain, in order to provide its users a much better trading experience, while continuing to deliver DeFi innovations (e.g. permisionless markets). By having full control over the appchain’s parameters, the dYdX DAOs can shape the future of the protocol, starting from the very bedrock, ensuring proper distribution and incentives for the validator set. From early adopter of L2 zero knowledge proofs (STARKs), to building its own Cosmos appchain, dYdX has proven once again to be a trailblazer for new technologies.</p><p>We were joined by Charles d’Haussy, CEO of dYdX Foundation, to discuss dYdX V4’s recent migration to a Cosmos appchain and what challenges it solves in terms of: order book decentralisation, validator distribution and user experience.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Charles’ background, from Asia to CEO of dYdX  dYdX’s history and V4’s transition to a Cosmos appchain  How perpetual futures work  dYdX supported assets and permissionless markets  DeFi innovations vs. CEX UX  The current state of dYdX V4’s alpha mainnet  dYdX validator dynamics &amp; order book decentralisation  dYdX’s DAOs &amp; governance  Mitigating MEV (feat.

<p>Written by Anirudha Bose.</p>

 Summary 
<p>With our recent Brave browser release version 1.60, we are excited to introduce two powerful features for the Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) gets a major overhaul, with first-class support for parsing ERC-4361 messages, and a brand new UX. We also extend our redesigned signing experience for Brave Swap to CoW Swap orders. Both these features enhance the security and UX of signing messages in Brave Wallet.</p>

 Sign-In With Ethereum 

 What is Sign-In With Ethereum? 
<p>Sign-In With Ethereum (or SIWE for short) replaces traditional login credentials with wallet-based sign-in functionality. Imagine a world where your wallet can help you login stamped with the indelible ink of an Ethereum wallet address of your choosing. This functionality shifts the role of authentication away from large centralized identity providers, into the hands of the individual.</p>
<p>The Sign-In With Ethereum protocol defines a method by which Ethereum accounts can sign in to external services by signing a standard message format as defined in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361">ERC-4361</a>.&nbsp; Thanks to this standard, you get the power of self-custodial identity while remaining portable across wallet implementations.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Next-level SIWE 
<p>Brave Wallet always had basic support for SIWE. Since SIWE uses <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191">ERC-191</a> (Signed Data Standard), we’ve been able to display SIWE prompts as human-readable plaintext messages, but without any validation by the wallet.</p>
<p>In this latest update, we’re introducing a significant improvement to Sign-In With Ethereum support with our implementation of an <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/19443">ABNF parser</a> for ERC-4361 conformant messages. This allows us to not only interpret SIWE messages and present them with a better look and feel, but also to improve the safety of signing into third-party apps and services. However, since there may still be cases where the SIWE message does not conform with these specifications, we fallback to legacy ERC-191 signing for maximum interoperability.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Safety features 
<p>Once a SIWE message is successfully parsed, we verify the message for binding of domain, account, and chain ID fields, and display an appropriate error message if there’s a mismatch. This measure is designed to prevent phishing attacks, where a malicious actor may obtain a valid authorization to a legitimate third-party service. This is particularly important for SIWE, since the sign-in action is basically producing a signature for a message, which is susceptible to spoofing by a motivated attacker.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 CoW Swap 

 What is CoW Swap? 
<p>Coincidence of Wants (CoW) is a concept from the field of economics, particularly related to the barter system. It describes a situation where two parties each hold an item the other wants, so they agree to trade these items directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://swap.cow.fi">CoW Swap</a> leverages this idea for trading on-chain assets. It is an interface built on top of the CoW Protocol—a fully permissionless trading protocol that leverages batch auctions as its price finding mechanism. CoW Protocol enables batch auctions to maximize liquidity via CoWs in addition to tapping all available on-chain liquidity whenever needed. Users express off-chain intents as signed <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712">EIP-712</a> typed messages through the CoW Swap interface. The CoW Protocol gathers these intents into a batch auction, to be settled by solvers that compete to find the most optimal CoW. The winning solver then executes all intents in a single on-chain transaction, maximizing trade surplus and saving on network fees.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>A CoW settlement transaction</p>

 The dangers of off-chain messages 
<p>Signing off-chain messages, such as CoW orders, is unfortunately not the most friendly UX on any wallet. While off-chain messages significantly improve usability by providing a reliable way to exchange data through a gasless experience, such messages are largely opaque and unreadable to users. This is very similar to blind-signing of transaction calldata (which we have discussed in depth in a <a>previous blog post</a>). Because signing off-chain messages does not incur a gas fee, users are very likely to blindly approve a signing request without verifying the details. A maliciously crafted message is more than capable of draining assets from users’ wallets, without raising any suspicion because of its verbosity.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1604074440941506560">December 2022</a>, a scammer stole 14 <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">BAYCs</a> worth over 852 ETH ($1.07 million USD) at the time, through a sophisticated, month-long social engineering scam. The victim was tricked into signing a gasless <a href="https://docs.opensea.io/reference/seaport-overview">Seaport</a> message, which actually created a private bundle listing all of his BAYCs to the scammer for 0.00000001 ETH. Such attacks are becoming increasingly common due to the massive adoption of off-chain messages in NFT marketplaces, DEXs, etc.</p>

 EIP-712 to the rescue 
<p>EIP-712 proposed a standard for signing typed structured data as opposed to bytestrings. While typed messages are easier for machines to read, they are still not user-friendly enough for most people. For users to be able to confidently approve signing requests for CoW orders, they need to clearly see all the order details such as formatted amounts, token symbols, logos, etc.</p>
<p>We conceived the idea to solve this problem at <a href="https://www.dappcon.io">DappCon 2023</a> in Berlin where we met CoW Swap’s engineering team. After brainstorming together, we came up with the <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/20203">solution</a> to implement a message parser for CoW orders, to be able to extract the relevant parameters, and render them in a familiar way that’s easy to understand. The parser is tied to the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#rationale-for-typehash">type hash</a> of the specific order struct used by CoW Swap, to prevent the parser from being used on non-CoW messages. We’ve also implemented calldata parsers for cases where the swap involves an on-chain transaction like, for example, when the user is swapping a native asset (such as ETH, or XDAI). Here’s what the final result looks like:</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Conclusion 
<p>In the 1.60 release of the Brave browser, we have completely revamped the experience of Sign-In With Ethereum using Brave Wallet. We’ve added safety features and UX improvements that make the SIWE experience comparable to signing in on websites with traditional login credentials. You can try it out at <a href="https://login.xyz">https://login.xyz</a>, which also has developer documentation for supporting SIWE on your websites.</p>
<p>We have extended similar improvements to the signing of CoW Swap orders, turning the unreadable off-chain messages into something that users can easily audit. You can try it out at <a href="https://swap.cow.fi">https://swap.cow.fi</a> on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.</p>
<p>We intend to bring similar improvements to the signing experience in Brave Wallet, in order to protect users from inadvertently signing malicious messages and transactions. Stay tuned for major updates on these improvements coming soon to Brave Wallet.</p>

<p>Despite the many alternative flavors of NoSQL databases that have caught the attention of developers over the years, relational databases remain the de facto standard for storing and retrieving digital information. Every technology worker from the back-office IT personnel to the modern Web developer has been trained to use, manage, and query relational databases. SQL, the language used to interact with relational databases, is the lingua franca of data management. Yet, while blockchains can be thought of as decentralized databases, they are not geared for the same storage and query tasks as relational databases, making them too slow, too expensive, and decidedly foreign for the average developer to interact with. This creates a paradoxical and undesirable situation in which developers of decentralized technologies choose the path of least resistance for their data storage needs: traditional, centralized, relational databases.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://tableland.xyz/">Tableland</a>, a multi-chain relational database network that brings SQL to smart contracts. Using this foundation, Tableland is developing Basin — a product for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) projects. With a focus on user-friendly tools and cryptographic data formats, Basin is designed to make data secure and usable for generations to come. Provenance tracking ensures a transparent data lineage, while Filecoin guarantees decentralized data accessibility and permanence. With Basin, Tableland is <a href="https://mirror.xyz/tableland.eth/UJMDvy8vAqekOGpPmspRGzdl2-osjPeGVaIv2Lv4Oh0">solving a critical pain point </a>for DePIN projects by creating a more secure, efficient, and transparent decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Tableland launched their community in Q2 of 2022 with 3000 <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/tableland-rigs">utilitarian NFTs</a> with their metadata stored in relational tables in Tableland itself, showcasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAc0xDyQDZbo-PnGBbv1aBTVMVwd4qncL">tangible use case</a> for the product. The NFTs sold out in under 5 minutes. Since then, they’ve launched on Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and other L2&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>As crypto continues to grow and quickly evolve, developers will lean toward tools and technologies that make them more productive. Tried and true, widely adopted patterns such as relational tables and SQL will continue to play an important foundational role, even as applications become decentralized. With growing momentum behind DePIN projects, Tableland can position itself as a foundational building block for a world where crypto-economic incentives are used to coordinate physical infrastructure. We are excited to be backing the entire Tableland team on their&nbsp;mission.</p>

This update forms the basis of the exit gateway node — an essential part of the new ‘Smooshed’ setup in the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>The next step will be to ‘smoosh’ gateways and mixnodes, so operators can easily service any hop in the network, radically improving the redundancy of the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Read on to find out all about the Galaxy&nbsp;update.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/faster-better-stronger-smooshier-improving-mixnet-coverage-with-project-smoosh-eaf4b215507f">Faster, better, stronger, Smooshier — improving mixnet coverage with Project&nbsp;Smoosh</a></p> Exit gateways now run a ‘deny&nbsp;list’ <p>NymConnect has, until now, run on a limited ‘allow list’ only letting through traffic from a very narrow number of applications. With the upcoming release of NymVPN — the evolution of NymConnect into a consumer product — this is changing to a ‘deny list’ in order to enable privacy for the broadest possible user base, with the widest available range of web services.</p><p>In short, this means that gateways will now block known malicious traffic, rather than only allowing the traffic of a select few services. This is a much more permissive setup to enhance appeal and accessibility for end&nbsp;users.</p><p>To protect operators, an <a href="https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/exit-policy.txt">exit policy</a> has been introduced so known malicious actors are blocked by default. This is based on a combination of the <a href="https://tornull.org/">Tor Null advisory block list</a> and the <a href="https://tornull.org/tor-reduced-reduced-exit-policy.php">Tor reduced exit&nbsp;policy</a>.</p> Introducing Nym Operators Legal&nbsp;Forum <p>To further assist operators, <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/exit-gateway.html">Nym DevRels have started to compile a document for legal best practice and&nbsp;advice</a>.</p><p>The document serves as the basis for a consultation with Nym node operators on any concerns, plus additional support and information operators might need throughout the change for ensuring maximum availability, usability and adoption.</p><p>Operators are invited to research their own jurisdictions and add their findings to this document.</p><p>To do so, create a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/documentation/operators/src">repository</a>, then message DevRels to alert them in the new <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!YfoUFsJjsXbWmijbPG:nymtech.chat?via=nymtech.chat&amp;via=matrix.org">Nym Operators Legal Forum on Element</a>. Note: only members of the general or node operator rooms may access the Legal Forum on&nbsp;Element.</p><p>While Nym core team cannot provide comprehensive legal advice across all jurisdictions, work is ongoing to build knowledge and experience with the help of the community and legal&nbsp;counsel.</p><p>That said, Nym core has now published preliminary findings from legal counsel on Nym exit gateways in two jurisdictions, <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/swiss.html">Switzerland</a> and the <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/united-states.html">United States</a>. These should not be viewed as comprehensive legal counsel and are presented unedited.</p><p>Given the legal similarity between Nym exit gateways and Tor exit relays, it is also recommended that operators acquaint themselves with <a href="https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/tor-exit-guidelines/">Tor community exit guidelines</a>.</p><p>Nym core team cannot provide operators with definitive answers regarding the potential risks of operating open gateways, but there is evidence of some considerations that may arise, from operating Tor exit&nbsp;relays:</p>  From a technical perspective, Nym node operators may need to implement additional controls, such as dedicated hardware and IP usage, or setting up an HTML exit notice on port&nbsp;80.  From an operational standpoint, node operators may be expected to actively manage their relationship with their ISP or VPS provider and respond to abuse requests using the proposed templates.  Legally, exit relays are typically considered “telecommunication networks” and are subject to intermediary liability protection. However, there may be exceptions, particularly in cases involving criminal law and copyright claims. Operators could seek advice from local privacy associations and may consider running nodes under an entity rather than as individuals.  <p>Nym node operators are strongly encouraged to join operator channels on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Element</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">Telegram</a> to share best practices and experiences.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-galaxy-update-has-just-completed-c54beea6c01a">Nym node ‘Galaxy’ update has just completed</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.4.0.</p>



<p>This release includes support for mining RPC methods in all release builds, bundles the Zcash verification parameters into the zebrad binary, and updates Rust dependencies to match the zcashd 5.7.0 release.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some notable improvements from our previous release include <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7772">better recovery from brief network interruptions</a>, and mitigation of potential network and verification denial of service and performance issues. We have restored our macOS tests in CI, and now support macOS on a best-effort basis.</p>



<p>We have also changed our documentation website URL, and are considering deprecating some Docker image tags from release 1.5.0 onwards.</p>



 Mining RPCs in Production Builds 



<p>Since the 1.4.0 release, Zebra’s mining RPCs are <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7740">available in release builds</a> so that any Zebra instance can be used by a solo miner or mining pool. With this release, we are providing production level support to 12 mining related RPCs, including getblocktemplate,&nbsp; submitblock, getmininginfo, getnetworksolps, [z_]validateaddress and getblocksubsidy. Do <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">let us know</a> if your mining pool requires any extra RPC methods or fields!</p>



 Zcash Parameters in zebrad Binary 



<p>zebrad now bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly into its binary. This increases the binary size by a few megabytes, but reduces the size of the Docker image by around 600 MB because the parameters don’t contain the Sprout proving key anymore. We have also removed the “zebrad download” command as it is no longer necessary. If you have upgraded zebrad to 1.4.0 or later, and zcashd to 5.7.0 or later, you can delete the zk-SNARK parameter files to save approximately 700 MB disk space. For more details, please check out our <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.4.0">release notes</a>.</p>



 macOS Support 



<p>We have restored support for macOS x86_64 on a best-effort basis. macOS builds and some tests run in Zebra’s CI. You can check out the list of Zebra <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/supported-platforms.html">supported platforms</a> for more details on the different tiers of support we provide for the listed platforms.&nbsp;</p>



 Deprecation Warnings 



<p>In an effort to remove redundancies and simplify things, we would like to share the following deprecation warnings.</p>



 DockerHub Image Tags 



<p>Zebra currently publishes 11 DockerHub tags for each new release. We want to reduce the number of DockerHub tags we publish in a future minor Zebra release. Based on usage and user feedback, in release 1.5.0 we could stop publishing:</p>



 
 The 1 tag, which updates each release until NU6 



 The 1.x tag, which updates each patch release until the next minor release 



 The 1.x.y tag, which is the same as v1.x.y 



 The sha-xxxxxxx tag, which is the same as v1.x.y (for production releases) 
 



<p>We also want to standardise experimental image tags to -experimental, rather than .experimental.</p>



<p>This means that, for release 1.5.0 onwards, we are considering only publishing the following tags:</p>



 
 latest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 latest-experimental (a new tag) 



 V1.5.0 



 v1.5.0-experimental 
 



<p>Please let us know if you need any other tags by <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">opening a GitHub ticket</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend using the “latest” tag to always get the most recent Zebra release.</p>



 Documentation Website URL Change 



<p>We have replaced the API documentation which was previously available on the doc.zebra.zfnd.org website with <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>. Zebra’s API documentation can now be found on:<br></p>



 
 <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>, which renders documentation for the public API of the latest crate releases; 



 <a href="https://doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org/zebrad/">doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org</a>, which renders documentation for the internal API on the main branch. 
 



<p>This API documentation is in addition to the <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/">Zebra Book</a> user documentation, which is still available as usual.</p>

Anchored to these economics are key dates every quarter from the launch of the Nym mainnet and initial coin offerings through to May 2024. These are something called the ‘vesting schedule’ or vest dates — in simple terms, this is where more tokens are released into the&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Let’s quickly take a look at when the remaining vest dates are and what this&nbsp;means.</p><p>For NYM holders already familiar with the token economics, scroll below for the latest supply figures plus parameter changes (spoiler alert: there are no changes at time of publication).</p> How does the Nym vesting schedule&nbsp;work? <p>For newcomers to the Nym universe, the granular details of how the token operates might feel a little confusing.</p><p>But the main thing to remember is unlike many tokens in the Web3 world, the NYM token is deflationary. This is similar to Bitcoin and means there is a finite number of NYM tokens that exist and will ever exist: 1&nbsp;billion.</p><p>However, not all of these tokens are yet in circulation.</p><p>Instead, there are two important mechanisms that affect the number of tokens in circulation.</p><p>They are each tied to a ‘smart contract’ hosted on the Nyx blockchain. They&nbsp;are:</p>  Token rewards for Nym nodes. These are distributed monthly from the ‘mixmining pool’. This is facilitated by the mixnet smart contract.  Token vest. This is where tokens that have been allocated to Coinlist buyers, backers, and the Nym core team are released on a quarterly basis. This is facilitated by the vesting smart contract.  <p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-breakdown-of-the-smart-contracts-that-run-the-nym-token-economics-3a61b4139f95">A breakdown of the smart contracts that run the Nym token economics</a></p><p>The overall vesting schedule began in 2022, the year the Nym mainnet went live and the NYM token was publicly listed. There are quarterly vests over the course of two years ending in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>The most recent vest dates were 2 November to Coinlist buyers, then 4 November to validators, and then on 5 November to backers and advisors, who hold the most NYM tokens out of any&nbsp;group.</p><p>See below for the vest schedule through to May,&nbsp;2024:</p><p>It is important to remember that because NYM tokens are deflationary, large vest dates may have a temporary impact on the value of the NYM&nbsp;token.</p><p>This is to be expected, according to the laws of supply and demand. Token price movements around vest dates tend to rebalance and recover afterwards.</p> What does the token supply look&nbsp;like? <p>Openness and transparency are essential to the Nym mission, so the core team publishes regular updates on the number of tokens currently circulating.</p><p>Anyone can check the current token supply at any time using <a href="https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/circulating-supply">this&nbsp;API</a>.</p><p>At the time of writing, the total circulating supply is 607.4m&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Additionally, 22.4% of tokens remain in the mix-mining pool, essentially a bootstrapping mechanism to reward node operators for good&nbsp;mixes.</p><p>As paid usage begins with the upcoming NymVPN, the fiat or crypto that VPN subscribers pay for access will be converted to NYM tokens and distributed as rewards to the various entities that make the service possible. This leads to a circular flow of NYM tokens with sustainable demand.</p><p>Furthermore, the zk-nym zero-knowledge protocols enable subscribers to unlink their payment from their credentials and usage of the service, thus protecting their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-roadmap-update-2023-24-2466711e1fad">Nym roadmap update — 2023–24</a></p> Staking parameter update <p>Tied to the vesting schedule and the token economics is something called a staking parameter update. This entails adjusting the target staking supply to account for the increase in overall staking supply. An increase here, in turn, affects node stake saturation point and therefore the APY of nodes and delegators.</p><p>Before diving into that, here are the current parameters:</p>  Circulating supply: 607 million NYM&nbsp;(<a href="https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/circulating-supply">API</a>)  Locked staking supply: 168 million&nbsp;NYM  Max staking supply: 657 million&nbsp;NYM  Target staking supply: 230 million&nbsp;NYM  Mix node stake saturation point: 960,000&nbsp;NYM  <p>Let’s walk through these one by one and explain why they&nbsp;matter.</p><p>The NYM tokens that are released during the vests entail a significant increase in the circulating supply of tokens. In addition to this, token holders can also stake some of their locked tokens (concretely, 10% of their original locked amount can be&nbsp;staked).</p><p>The circulating supply plus locked staking supply determines the max staking supply, meaning the total amount of NYM tokens that could in theory be staked on Nym&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>Now, it is highly unlikely that all tokens will be staked on Nym&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>For example, right now 150 million NYM, representing 23% of the max staking supply, are&nbsp;staked.</p><p>For this reason, a target staking supply is set at a reasonable number between the max staking supply (657m) and actual current level of staked tokens&nbsp;(150m).</p><p>The target staking supply parameter is set to maximise APY, or rate of return, for currently staked tokens, while nevertheless incentivising further&nbsp;staking.</p><p>This determines the stake saturation point of Nym nodes. The stake saturation point is found by dividing the target staking supply by the number of rewarded mix nodes: 230m / 240 = 960k saturation point.</p><p>The saturation levels of a node signify its reputation, and this affects whether the node is selected to the active set (or ‘epoch’) in the mixnet, and earning rewards. If all nodes reach saturation too easily because the target is set very low, then the incentive algorithm no longer works, and staking loses its significance in the selection process.</p><p>In short: setting a target lower than the current level of staked tokens would disincentivise people from operating nodes and delegating stake. But setting the target a lot higher could raise the saturation point to unreachable levels. This would harm the APY of mix nodes, and also disincentivise operating and&nbsp;staking.</p><p>So, in order to offer a good APY to operators and stakers, the target staking supply for rewards is higher than the current level of staked tokens, but lower than the current maximum of 657m, and set at&nbsp;230m.</p><p>And those all together are the ‘parameters’.</p> Parameter update — no&nbsp;update! <p>Changes to the parameters are only necessary when the level of staking in the mixnet is approaching the&nbsp;target.</p><p>This number might increase with rewards being released every month from the mixmining pool. And it is even more likely to increase with the quarterly vest, as this releases a large amount of tokens that can be&nbsp;staked.</p><p>Having said all that, the target staking point of 230 million NYM is still a way off, therefore none of the parameters need to&nbsp;change.</p><p>The parameters will be revisited with the next vest to assess whether the total staked in the network is nearing the&nbsp;target.</p><p>Whew: deep breath.

<p>Bootstrap Org, the nonprofit parent organization of Electric Coin Co., has added long-time Zcash community contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/michlai007">Michelle Lai</a> to its Board of Directors. Michelle joins members Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Zaki Manian, and Zooko Wilcox.</p>



<p>“Michelle has worked hard to support Zcash and the cause of financial freedom for years,” Fairless said. “We love her insight and imagination on tech product use cases.”</p>



<p>A graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (2007), Michelle has spent half her career in crypto and half in financial services, including stints at Anchorage Digital, Bitpay, Credit Suisse, a private equity buyout fund, and as a consultant to CEOs of large financial services companies. She’s performed a wide range of roles, including COO, BD and product roles, and says she most enjoys solving tricky business problems and managing high-stakes negotiations.</p>



<p>She is passionate about crypto-related technology as “a means of achieving a fairer and freer world.”</p>



<p>In Michelle’s words:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My journey with Zcash started in 2018 when I worked at a crypto asset custodian and we were looking to support $ZEC. Since then, I’ve fallen further down the privacy money rabbit hole, becoming a member of the first grant organization in 2021 (the Zcash Open Major Grants committee) and then staying involved as someone who actively advocates for privacy and freedom applications in crypto.</p>



<p>My vision of tomorrow’s Zcash is one that earns its place back as a leader of privacy tech in crypto so that we can keep supporting the universal values of privacy and freedom. We did it once with the best talent in ZK and engineering, and we can do it again.</p>



<p>Today, as the crypto privacy community faces several challenges, including market sentiment and regulatory onslaught, I join the Bootstrap team to navigate the turbulent waters we find ourselves in. I have had professional experience in turnaround situations and hope to bring that to bear in this new role on the board of Bootstrap.</p>



<p>The road ahead is strewn with both extremely difficult questions and compelling opportunities for all ZK and privacy projects, including us. It will take a grand effort for us to arrive at a new horizon, but this is the moment where we dig in, gear up, and keep marching on in service of humanity.</p>



<p>If you have ideas and opinions from anywhere in the crypto community, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.</p>

<p>The very nature of Ethereum addresses, expressed as random hexadecimal character strings, represents a big hurdle for mass adoption, as they are not human-readable. ENS domains were envisioned to not only solve this and provide a seamless UX, but to also be the cornerstone of on-chain identities. However, in the current multichain landscape, a plethora of decentralised naming services arose, which led to a heterogeneous domain name pool. As a result, ENS aims to expand to L2s and non-EVM chains, attempting to provide consistency, in order to further reduce user friction and limit conflicting domain names.</p><p>We were joined by Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, to discuss the current state of decentralised naming services from a multichain and L2 perspective, and how these ultimately tie into decentralised identities.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Nick’s background and ENS history  The plethora of decentralised naming services  ENS use cases  Interacting with Web2 DNS  L2 compatibility for ENS via CCIP Read  ENS wrapper and subdomains  CCIP Read  Bridging ENS to non-EVM L2s  Coinbase’s cb.id  ENS and on-chain privacy OPSEC  Account abstraction  The future of ENS  Governance   <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick Johnson on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ensdomains">ENS on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture.

<p>A busy month just went by! Here’s everything we did and what’s on the horizon for Panther.</p><p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>October has been a productive month for us, and we’re excited to share our progress in many areas as we work towards Panther v1. <br>Without further ado, let’s dive in.</p> Tech Updates  Stage 2 <p>The latest development sprints were focused on solving a bug related to an external library used for Stage 2, an external factor that has caused a delay. <br><br>Our Incentivized <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Testnet Stage 2 </a>is now officially underway, bringing a wave of features and rewards to the Panther community. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Stage 2</a> is critical as it puts our user interaction and reward mechanisms to the test, laying the groundwork for Panther Protocol’s privacy-preserving features. Our protocol’s privacy is intricately tied to unique game-theoretical features that encourage active user participation, making this stage a pivotal moment for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Stage 2 includes creating and activating your Panther Account, finding your onboarding bonuses, and claiming your vouchers. <br>Your participation and feedback are crucial as we move closer to our v1 release. Thank you for being a part of Testnet Stage 2, and don't hesitate to share your thoughts through our community channels!</p> V1 redesign <p>Over the past weeks, we have done some UX refinements too. The focus was reviewing what we have learned from the previous design iterations and expanding on it further while also elevating the user experience. Another objective was to revamp and update the onboarding process for more seamless account setup.</p><p>You can take a look at a quick preview below:</p> Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi Protocol <p>Just in case you missed our last update, on October 2nd we hosted <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1zqKVqmnqaaxB?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a great conversation via Twitter Spaces</a> with our partners at PureFi. We’ve discussed our upcoming v1 integration and replied to questions from the community.&nbsp;</p><p>This was an excellent opportunity to demonstrate how Panther and PureFi are collaborating to make privacy-preserving DeFi effortless.</p> <blockquote><p>Did you check out our latest Spaces with <a href="https://twitter.com/PureFi_Protocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@PureFi_Protocol</a>? <br><br>Give it a listen to understand how Panther and PureFi are working together to make privacy-preserving <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">#DeFi</a> a no-brainer. <br><br>Here's the full recording (now on YT too!) and a thread with the highlights 🧵🧵 <a href="https://t.co/GIbI5txjMI?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">pic.twitter.com/GIbI5txjMI</a></p>— Panther Protocol (@ZKPanther) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1712516464425447649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">October 12, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>Now and through the end of January 2024, Electric Coin Co. (ECC) objectives center on delivering an improved ZEC user experience, primarily through the Zashi wallet. Across teams — Product; Engineering; PeopleOps; and Communications and Advocacy — ECC employees are focused on work that either directly contributes to the wallet or in some way makes ZEC and Zashi adoption more viable.</p>



<p>Background: ECC uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR process</a> for prioritizing and delivering measurable work on four-month cycles. In October, teams met and finalized planning for T3 2023-24 (October-January).</p>



<p>Priorities were developed to accomplish or make meaningful progress on the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Release the next version of the Zashi app including a new UX and UI 



 Transition more responsibilities to the wider Zcash community so ECC can focus on building Zashi, starting with the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/decentralizing-zcash-digital/45349">Decentralizing Zcash Digital</a> effort.&nbsp; 



 Take meaningful steps in the effort to transition Zcash from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), Zashi’s eventual consensus mechanism, by publishing a design with security arguments, and a protocol simulator. 



 Maintain policy efforts to ensure Zashi and Zcash are (1) accessible and usable by people in the United States and (2) considered socially beneficial. Continue hosting notable policy events and publishing episodes of the PGP for Crypto Podcast. 



 Support select ecosystem teams and projects that directly benefit Zashi users
 
 Support Brave’s integration of Zcash and encrypted media/files. 



 Support Edge, Unstoppable, and Nighthawk’s use of the ECC mobile wallet SDKs. 



 Build and/or improve Zashi features (e.g., implementing ZIP-317 and Orchard). 
 
 
 



<p>Each ECC team has built their OKRs to support these company objectives.</p>

 Intro <p>Panther community,</p><p>As we conclude Testnet Stage 1 with a number of learnings and upgrades, we are thrilled to announce the commencement of Stage 2 of our Testnet.</p><p>This second phase is designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. As Panther’s privacy is built upon unique game-theoretical features fostering user activity, Stage 2 is key for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at Stage 2. It comprises three main categories of reward mechanisms: Rewards, Recharge pool, and Vouchers.</p> 1. Rewards <p>Rewards or protocol reward points (PRPs) are created as an incentive for users to join and continuously use Panther Protocol. This implies converting the ‘Available PRP’ to ZKP which is accomplished via a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps/single-side-automated-market-maker?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">single-sided AMM</a> (automated market maker) pool. It is one-sided because users can only convert their PRP to ZKP and not vice versa. The exchange rate of this conversion is dynamic in nature and depends on several factors, including the amount of ZKP in the pool and the total available PRP held by users at any given point in time, among other factors. For details on how Panther Rewards works, please see <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p><p>There are two types of PRPs:</p>  Available PRPs which can be exchanged to zZKP (ZKP within the MASP) immediately.  Pending PRP is the accrued rewards that are not realized yet because a user has not spent those UTXOs. To make it available, the UTXO's should be included in transactions that a user performs within Panther.<br>   2. Recharge Pool  <p>The Recharge function is the cornerstone of the protocol’s reward system and allows protocol rewards vested on Mainnet to be injected into the reward distribution process on Polygon (viz the one-sided AMM launched in Stage 2). This dynamic interplay with the AMM pool through the Recharge function fosters active user participation while maintaining a responsive and adaptive reward structure within the protocol. </p> 3. Vouchers <p>Vouchers are a reward mechanism that can be used by the Protocol to incentivize certain functions that have to be triggered by Users. We refer to them as Admin functions. Those could include but are not limited to functions such as:</p>  Recharging Reward Pool  Trigger conversion of token&nbsp;  <p>Note: the onboarding reward voucher issued atThe voucher this Stage is only for testing purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When a new account is created and activated successfully, a user gets (a) 100 zZKP onto his zAccount and (b) 1 voucher which is worth 500 PRP. This is valid for all new users and the users who have created accounts during Stage 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: it can take up to a minute to get the voucher screen updated to let a user find his onboarding voucher.</p><p>The voucher has a stable predefined value which can be different depending on the type of performed action (onboarding = PRP 500, triggering recharge the reward pool = PRP 100). The voucher is nominated in PRP.&nbsp; To get those PRP, one should claim a voucher - it is about submitting a transaction “burn a voucher - get the corresponding PRP”.&nbsp;</p><p>Vouchers are grouped per type of action performed. Stage 2 will have two such groups - (1) Onboarding bonus voucher and (2) Recharge bonus voucher. Vouchers can be claimed by group only, which means a user gets the total PRP for all vouchers in a given group. When claiming is completed successfully, a user will see an updated balance on his (a) Dashboard → Panther Rewards Points section → Available PRP amount and (b) Rewards page → Redeem PRP screen → Available PRP section. &nbsp;</p> STAGE 2 TESTING <p>As we progress through our Testnet stages, we want to express our gratitude for your continued support, feedback, and enthusiasm. To start testing Stage 2, please visit Panther docs <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> to get the most updated test link and follow the steps:</p>  New user creates and activates Panther Account (existing users go through the same step but the onboarding process bypasses the KYC verification) - see <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">the Stage 1 functionality and instructions</a>.&nbsp;  <p>Note 1.1: both (a) new accounts and (b) previously created during Stage 1 Panther accounts both are valid.&nbsp;</p><p>When your account is successfully created, you will find a success screen:</p>  Find the first part of your onboarding bonus on your dashboard. This bonus is in the form of Panther Account zZKP which is expected to fuel all types of transactions within Panther such as paying Protocol fees, paying to Relayer for gasless transactions, paying Miner’s fee etc. Users are expected to maintain a sufficient balance of this account in zZKP using transfer functions available in later stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Find the second part of your onboarding bonus - an onboarding voucher,, which equals 500 PRPs. The voucher should be claimed to get the PRPs into your account. To find the second part, please follow the Rewards menu item =&gt; Vouchers screen =&gt; Onboarding Reward Vouchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Note 3.1: It takes time to detect and reflect the corresponding group of vouchers so there can be a case when the screen is empty before the data is updated:</p><p>Note 3.2: It takes time to make your voucher available for claiming, as the zAccount UTXO must be mined in advance. The UI will reflect your bonus voucher. Please be aware that claiming the voucher may take a few minutes in the test environment (due to lower mining activity which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The claim button is disabled until claiming is available.&nbsp;</p>  Claim your voucher via the Vouchers screen functionality. After Voucher is claimed successfully (Voucher screen will go back to the state mentioned in Note 3.1 upon a successfully claimed transaction), you can find the corresponding amount of PRP on the Redeem PRP screen, Available PRP field&nbsp;  <p>Note 4.1: Sometimes, it may take a few minutes to display the PRP available for redeeming (due to lower mining activity in the test environment, which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The button is disabled until Redeem is successful.&nbsp;</p>  Redeem your PRP from the Redeem PRP screen to get your zZKP. This zZKP will now be available in your Private zAssets section and zAssets Summary section balance in the Dashboard screen.  <p>6. Recharge the reward pool of PRP/zZKP AMM:</p><p>Step 1: Go to the Rewards page and click on recharge pool.</p><p>Step 2: Switch to the Goerli network. The recharge triggers the Vesting contract on the Goerli testnet (Ethereum on production). This requires users to switch networks if they are not on Goerli. This can be done using either in-dApp functionality (Switch Network option) or via Network Management modal (when you are already connected to the product), or via MetaMask functionality. </p><p>Step 3: Check available $ZKP for recharge. Checking that there is enough $ZKP for recharge helps make the decision to trigger the function. The Recharge button will be active only when the ‘Recharge size’ field is non-zero, however, it is not recommended to trigger this function for a smaller recharge amount. </p><p>Also, a zero or a low ‘Recharge size’ means that the recharge was done by other users.&nbsp;</p><p>Step 4: Check and top-up your Goerli ETH balance - this is required to pay for gas to trigger this functionality. To get a test Goerli ETH use the faucet e.g. <a href="https://beyondfaucet.com/goerli/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://beyondfaucet.com/goerli/</a>.<br></p><p>Step 5: Complete the recharge-triggering transaction on the Goerli side by pushing the Recharge Reward Pool button.</p><p>Note 6.1: The recharge executes through bridging functionality which moves $tZKP from Goerli (Ethereum) to Mumbai (Polygon). This operation is dependent on the bridge and may take up to 20 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Step 6: Check the updated current recharge ratio field. Recharging the pool means injecting more rewards into the Reward AMM, hence, it impacts the ZKP:PRP ratio. The new ratio can be viewed here: </p><p>Note 6.2: Smaller recharge size value will make an insignificant impact on the rate. Testnet allows for multiple recharge to test functionality and bridging. However, it is advised to propose a maximum of once per day recharge in production which will also have a positive impact on the rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Step 7: Check the Vouchers screen. The protocol rewards users for performing the recharge function. Switch to the Mumbai network to view and claim your Recharge Reward Voucher.</p><p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks not just an advancement in the protocol's capabilities, but gets us a step closer to our v1 release.

  Partnering with Factory: Autonomous AI for All  <p>Matan and Eno are building fully-autonomous programming “Droids” to unlock creativity within and beyond engineering teams.</p>   
	By Shaun Maguire	 



Published November 2, 2023
  



 
<p>Like any VC partner, I get a lot of cold emails. But when Matan Grinberg’s note appeared in my inbox in March, it got my attention right away. Just from the subject line—”Chat with a fellow former hep-th physicist”—I knew we shared a background in the same tiny sub-field of high-energy physics theory. And as I read on and Googled a bit, I discovered that what he humbly described as having “worked with Juan” actually referred to co-authoring a paper with Juan Maldacena—a professor at the elite Institute for Advanced Study and arguably the world’s best-known living physicist—when Matan was still an undergrad.</p>



<p>I wrote back in less than an hour.</p>



<p>A few days later, Matan and I went for a walk. He’d been working at the intersection of physics and AI at Berkeley and pursuing a PhD, but was considering a transition from academia to a start-up—and though he hadn’t yet settled on a specific idea, it was clear that he wanted to build a company. It was also clear that he had a high EQ to match his exceptional background. I encouraged him to take the leap.</p>



<p>He started iterating, and within a week was working on the autonomous coding project&nbsp; that would become <a href="https://www.factory.ai/">Factory</a>—and working with a co-founder who, as it turned out, was in Sequoia’s orbit as well.</p>



<p>Eno Reyes, who grew up in Atlanta and first met Matan at Princeton, had recently accepted a job as an ML engineer at Hugging Face and moved to San Francisco’s Mission District—just a block from where his grandparents had settled down and set up a restaurant after immigrating from Puebla, Mexico. Shortly before he and Matan reunited at a hackathon and started building Factory, the Sequoia team met Eno at AI Ascent, a small gathering of the leading minds in AI that we held in March. Just a year out of college and a few months into his new role, he had already impressed enough to join CEO Clem Delangue at the event.</p>



<p>Matan and Eno’s idea was to build on the historic momentum in AI and unlock even more creativity in software development—and not just among engineers. In the face of a persistent tech talent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/cracking-the-code-on-digital-talent">shortage</a>, with many Fortune 500 companies still running infrastructure built decades ago simply because they don’t have enough people to update it, these two co-founders understood that handing off time-consuming tasks like code review, documentation, testing, project management and debugging to fully autonomous “Droids,” or agents, would indeed be a game-changer for engineering teams. But they also understood that for every software developer, there are another 100 people who don’t have highly technical backgrounds—but do have great ideas that software could bring to life.</p>



<p>It is a next-generation vision for AI, and just a year ago, it would have been too ambitious. But Matan and Eno’s timing is perfect—and they are perfectly suited to the task, not only because of their deep domain expertise in ML, AI and physics, but also because they move at lightning speed. Once they’d landed on an idea, it took them a day to sign a term sheet, incorporate the company and start to build.</p>



<p>Six months later, Factory is delivering value to early customers that include two public companies and two decacorns. Meanwhile, Matan and Eno have more complex functionality on the roadmap, and they are <a href="https://www.factory.ai/careers">growing</a> an amazing team to build it. It has been a joy to welcome them to the Sequoia community, and we look forward to supporting them over the months and years to come as they work toward a world where programming capacity no longer limits our collective creativity.</p>

<p>Brave is also introducing Leo Premium, a paid plan featuring Anthropic’s Claude Instant with faster response times</p>
<p>Three months ago, Brave previewed <a>Leo—the browser-native AI assistant</a>—on its Nightly channel for developers and testers. Since then we’ve seen great adoption, with tens of thousands of users globally. With user feedback, we’ve been able to improve much faster than we’d hoped—on response-times, the quality of responses, even the product UI. Today, we’re excited to announce that Brave Leo is ready for all Brave users, available in desktop release 1.60.</p>
<p>With that testing, we also received requests for new features. The most common one has been to add different AI language models in Leo. To that end, we’re bringing our users advanced conversational AI experiences through <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">Brave Leo Premium</a>—our new paid option featuring Claude Instant, Anthropic’s state-of-the-art AI assistant.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 What is Brave Leo? 
<p>Leo, Brave’s browser AI assistant, can help with all sorts of tasks. It can create real-time summaries of webpages or videos. It can answer questions about content, or generate new content. It can even translate pages, analyze them, rewrite them, and more. Whether you’re looking for information, trying to solve a problem, or creating content, Leo can help.</p>
<p>Leo combines this easy, free access to AI with the privacy focus of Brave. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. With cutting-edge technology and privacy, Brave Leo pushes the boundaries of typical AI chatbot services.</p>
<p>“It is increasingly common today to use AI to ask questions and get assistance. AI can be a powerful tool but it can also present growing concerns for data privacy and there’s a need for a privacy-first solution,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave. “Brave is committed to pairing AI with user privacy, and will provide our users with secure and personalized AI assistance where they already spend their time online. We’re also thrilled to work with Anthropic to bring Claude’s exceptional conversational abilities to the millions of Brave users worldwide.”</p>

 Introducing Leo Premium 
<p>By default, Brave Leo is free for all users, with easy access to the Llama 2 large language model from Meta. For users who want additional models, Brave is also releasing a premium version of Leo for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$15/month</a>. Leo Premium subscribers will get access to Claude Instant, Anthropic’s faster and lighter model that excels at logical reasoning and coding. The current version of Claude produces longer, more structured responses, follows instructions better than previous versions of Instant, and shows improvements in math, coding, multilingual abilities, and question answering. Additional models will be available to Leo Premium users, as well as access to higher rate limits, higher-quality conversations, priority queuing during periods of peak usage, and early access to new features and improvements.</p>
<p>This integration represents a milestone in delivering sophisticated natural language conversations powered by AI directly within the browser environment. With Claude’s advanced capabilities and Brave’s focus on user privacy and control, we hope to set a new standard for helpful, responsible, and context sensitive AI interactions. Anthropic used <a>Brave’s Search API</a> to train their latest model, Claude 2, on high-quality data to help optimize Claude’s outputs for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) queries.</p>
<p>“We’re excited that Brave is going to bring our state-of-the-art large language model Claude Instant directly into their browser. Integrating access to Claude seamlessly within Brave gives users assistance whenever they need it, right in the context of the page they are on,” says Matt Bell, Head of Product Research at Anthropic. “Whether Brave users are analyzing text, editing documents, or writing code, they can now benefit from having personalized help from Claude at any time. This integration unlocks the potential for AI to enhance people’s browsing and productivity in an intuitive, contextual way.”</p>

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo is no different:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymized server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Immediate discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 Accessing Brave Leo 
<p>Leo is now available to Brave desktop users with version 1.60. It will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today. It will be available on mobile (Android and iOS) in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more at <a>brave.com/leo</a>, and see details about Leo’s roadmap <a>here</a>.</p>

<p>A journey that began in the late summer of 2022, has finally come to a joyful end. Third-party Zcash wallets are working again, and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) is exiting Emergency Mode.</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



<p>Before going further, we need to give the hugest THANK YOU to our wallet partners Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



<p>The ECC engineers deserve special recognition —&nbsp;and possibly a vacation — after putting in long hours over many months on complicated discovery and development. Working through the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">ECC restructure</a> and battling tough deadlines, while tackling other crucial emergencies like the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">Halborn disclosure</a>, they delivered groundbreaking technology that elevates ZEC user experience.</p>



 Background 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. These three wallets rely on ECC’s mobile SDKs.</p>



<p>Wallet syncing processes required scanning the entire blockchain before funds were available to be spent. And when the wallets wouldn’t sync, users couldn’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2022, ECC went into Emergency Mode and put aside all other roadmap priorities. From our blog in March 2023:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>
</blockquote>



 Emergency Mode exit criteria 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, and these were our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>With the release of new mobile wallet SDKs 2.0 in September, ECC delivered the final piece in our efforts to mitigate third-party wallet performance issues. Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable quickly implemented the SDKs, and as of today, we are pleased to report that the criteria above have been met.</p>



 What is Spend Before Sync and why is it important? 



<p>Available now in Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable, Spend Before Sync (SBS) introduces non-linear sync, which allows wallets to scan chunks of the blockchain out of order and/or in parallel. This makes it possible for users to spend their existing funds without requiring the wallet to fully sync the entire blockchain.</p>



<p>Separately, but also important, the data structures that enable SBS substantially improve the performance of note commitment tree updates. As an example, Zingo! didn’t adopt SBS, but just by using the updated data structure that wallet got a better than 10x improvement in linear scanning speed.</p>



<p>Aditya Bharadwaj, better known as Adi, founder of Nighthawk, called SBS “a groundbreaking advancement that promises to revolutionize Zcash’s peer-to-peer usage for payments and shielded app interactions.”</p>



 What we learned during Emergency Mode 



 
 Our mobile SDK code did not meet the needs of a typical Zcash user. The syncing UX was confusing and the API design precluded wallets from spending funds until the wallet had fully synced the chain. 



 Before Emergency Mode, and to some extent before the ECC restructure, our team was spread too thin and trying to focus on too many things, which allowed issues like transaction load impact to surface. 



 We knew long ago that a transaction-load issue was possible, but we prioritized other Zcash features and improvements. This challenge of prioritizing new feature improvements versus making the existing system more resilient or robust is always present. In this case we underestimated the likelihood of this problem and the amount of effort it would take to mitigate it. 



 We chose to address the issue in the most thorough manner by making wallets function during high transaction load, rather than the expedient of short-term interventions to lessen the transaction load. We believed those short-term interventions would lead to more complexity without fully resolving the issue in the long run. We still believe our approach was best for the long-term robustness of the Zcash ecosystem, yet we underestimated the time and effort and the overall disruption to Zcash users in the interim. 



 We also learned about comms. It took us too long to define Emergency Mode and communicate a concise explanation and plan, both internally and externally. 



 Having our own wallet in development (Zashi), which uses our SDKs, was key to speeding up the process because it allowed us to test our solutions before deploying and/or sharing with third-party wallets. 
 



<p>With Emergency Mode complete, ECC is turning its attention to our main focus areas: proof-of-stake Zcash, development of the Zashi wallet, continued improvements to SDKs and Zcash Core Libraries, and US Policy work.</p>

      Battling the Trojan Horse in Open Source         
	By Ananya Menon	 



Published November 1, 2023
        Chainguard’s Dan Lorenc is taking on software supply chain security.      



 
<p>Dan Lorenc was at a restaurant in downtown Austin with friends when he received an unusual text. It was the summer of 2021, and the message was from his former coworker, Matt Moore. Lorenc was a software engineer at Google, and he and Moore had worked together on its cyber-security team. The past year had been especially challenging, as the security industry as a whole had faced a reckoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2020, SolarWinds reported that its network monitoring platform had been hacked by operatives suspected of working for Russian intelligence. The attackers had planted malware in SolarWinds’ code, which allowed them to access the data of thousands of SolarWinds’ clients, from Microsoft to the U.S. government. The hack exposed a critical flaw in the security of software supply chains. Just as in real-world manufacturing, software is assembled from components created by developers all over the world. At some point during SolarWinds’ development process, malicious actors inserted malware into two software updates, which were then installed by customers all around the world. SolarWinds’ data breach was a wake-up call. Without verifying the integrity of software at every stage of its lifespan this type of hack could and would happen again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore had left Google earlier in the year, and Lorenc had called him every month since, hoping to convince him to return. Moore was one of the finest software engineers Lorenc knew, and if anyone could find a solution to supply chain security, it was him. That night, Moore’s text to Lorenc said he was ready to get back to work—but not at Google. “Let’s start a new company,” Moore texted. Lorenc didn’t need to think twice. He was in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next day, Lorenc put in notice at Google, bought a new laptop and began work on Chainguard, a company focused on software supply chain security. Although technically the company was born that night in Austin, Lorenc had been preparing for this moment for years.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>The late 2000s ushered in a fundamental shift in the way tech companies approached security, as alarm around new types of digital threats grew. In what became known as Operation Aurora in 2009, Chinese hackers attempted to access and change source code in a series of attacks against companies like Google and Adobe. In the Snowden leaks in 2013, a contracted employee for the NSA hacked its database and leaked classified documents.</p>



<p>Lorenc joined Google in 2012, working on the company’s efforts to secure its own code and protect its databases from external or internal attackers. In 2016, after he and his team had implemented Google’s new, refined security system, Lorenc shifted focus to work on Minikube, a tool for open-source Kubernetes container management. This was Lorenc’s first time working predominantly with open-source code—code that’s freely available for anyone to download, modify and exchange. As Lorenc was building and shipping Minikube to users all over the world, he realized he could have easily slipped malware into the software. The container’s label would read “Minikube,” but few would take time to comb through the thousands of lines of code in every directory of the program to determine exactly what was inside. Proper verification was something that would take an engineer days, weeks or even months to complete—bandwidth they almost certainly didn’t have, and therefore a task that would fall by the wayside.</p>



<p>Lorenc was terrified. Wasn’t it just a matter of time before someone packaged up open-source software that secretly contained code that could put an entire company and its community at risk? “I realized how much damage I myself could do, and how easily,” Lorenc says. “And if I could do that, so could anyone.”</p>



<p>The concern over how to protect software from hidden malware isn’t a new one. In 1984, an engineer named Ken Thompson wrote an article called “Reflections on Trusting Trust” that demonstrated how easy it was to hide Trojan horse viruses in a computer program. Thompson’s point was that you could never fully trust any code you hadn’t written yourself. According to Lorenc, 90-98% of code used today is open source. Most companies focus resources on making sure the tiny amount of code they write themselves is secure, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. “The 2% of proprietary code is the only part you see over the water, but beneath that is the 98% of code you’re not responsible for yourself,” Lorenc says. “In some ways, open-source code is amazing. It’s enabled all this innovation and velocity and reuse. But it’s also scary because that means 98% of your code is written by strangers on the internet. Which is great when people are well-intentioned, but not everyone on the internet is nice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite evidence of the risks open-source code can pose to a company’s security, Lorenc learned that managing these risks wasn’t something widely prioritized. When he spoke with engineers at other software companies, supply chain security wasn’t a top concern. “Being a software engineer is like playing Whac-A-Mole. There are so many issues you have to deal with on a constant basis that you can’t spend time on preventive measures,” Lorenc says. “You only pay attention to a problem when it rears its head. At this point, there hadn’t been large instances of open-source vulnerability being a problem, so no one seemed to think much about it.”</p>



<p>No one but Lorenc. That is, until December 2020.</p>
 



Lorenc with fierce Chainguard mascot, Charlie



 
<p>Lorenc was at home when he received a news alert about the SolarWinds attack. Thousands of companies were reporting their data, networks and systems compromised—exactly what Lorenc had been worried about. He stood and walked to his car. Lorenc’s house in Austin was close to SolarWinds’ headquarters. He drove there and took a picture of himself in front of its sign. It would serve as a reminder of how important it was that he continue to raise a red flag about the software supply chain. But it was also a moment of validation—he had seen this coming, and he felt vindicated that his concern was justified. Maybe now people would take the problem seriously.</p>



<p>Although Google was not affected by the breach, Lorenc and his coworkers were intimately familiar with the type of attack that SolarWinds fell victim to because they had spent years building internal systems at Google to prevent it. Dan and team would end up working closely with engineers from SolarWinds to help them do the same. (The following year, when Chainguard held a conference to announce its launch, a SolarWinds engineer spoke about how instrumental Lorenc’s team had been in designing its new security system.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the question of how to entirely prevent these attacks remained: When programs are built on hundreds of thousands of lines of open-source code, how do you ensure that every line is as advertised and secure? It’s a problem so large in scale that it feels almost impossible to figure out. Luckily, that’s kind of Lorenc’s thing.</p>



 



<p>Lorenc’s love of solving difficult problems began when he was a kid, fixing up damaged stock cars with his grandfather. They’d spend hours after school and on weekends tinkering together in a small garage. Once the cars were up and running, Lorenc’s grandfather (and after he got his license, Lorenc himself) would race them in community events. When the cars would break down, they would take inventory of the problems and fix them up again. This was the part Lorenc loved most—looking at the engine as a system of parts, understanding how each one functioned and then using that knowledge to fix what wasn’t working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In college, Lorenc pursued mechanical engineering. During his junior year he took a programming class and was hooked. “I was building stuff, but it was a lot faster,” Lorenc says. “You didn’t have to order parts and wait a week for them to ship. You could build those components yourself with a laptop, anywhere.” Software engineering offered the same thrill as fixing up old cars. “It’s that loop of trying to solve a problem, and then either seeing it work or seeing it fail miserably and getting to debug it live. You keep going and get real-time feedback until you solve it. That’s why I liked the computer world. I could do more of that in a lot less time.”</p>



<p>One of the first pieces of code he wrote was a program to solve Rubik’s cubes. The program didn’t work—it kept running without ever arriving at a solution. One of his peers laughed when he saw the code and showed Lorenc how to fix it. It was an important moment. “That’s when I realized, with programming, there’s always a solution,” Lorenc says. “It might not be obvious at first, but it’s there. You just have to find it.”</p>



<p>Lorenc began working at Microsoft soon after he graduated college. He remembers the environment as rewarding, but also stressful. There was a weekend when he and his colleagues were working overtime for an upcoming release, and during a particularly tense moment, his manager pantomimed a Monty Python sketch. Lorenc and his team broke into fits of laughter, and the mood instantly brightened. This left an impression on Lorenc: the need for a work environment that balanced hard work with humor.</p>
 



Chainguard founders Kim Lewandowski, Ville Aikas, Dan Lorenc and Matt Moore.



 
<p>“You’re doing what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bogomil Balkansky, Chainguard’s partner at Sequoia, sat across the table from Lorenc and Moore, not sure he was hearing them right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the months since Moore’s initial text to Lorenc at the restaurant in Austin, Chainguard had officially launched, and its founders had begun building its product and seeking out investors. Lorenc says starting a company at the beginning of 2022 wasn’t easy. Inflation was rising and a wave of layoffs at tech companies meant Lorenc would pitch Chainguard to software engineers—potential customers—one day, only to learn the following week that they had been laid off. After months of meetings, they finally gained traction. The need for supply chain security tools was too great, and companies realized they couldn’t handle the job alone.</p>



<p>Lorenc and the Chainguard team first met with Sequoia in the spring of 2022. Balkansky was impressed by Chainguard’s initial product in development, Chainguard Enforce, a program that scans containers and produces an itemized list of the code inside. Engineers can then review the list for malware and loopholes that might make the containers vulnerable to hackers. And so Balkansky was surprised to learn, just days after Sequoia’s partnership with Chainguard was finalized, that, according to Lorenc, Chainguard was in the midst of building out a far more ambitious product: Chainguard Images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In computing, a “container image” refers to a static collection of executable code. Chainguard Images would be a library of these files, made from open-source code that Chainguard engineers would verify, sign, patch and secure. With Chainguard Images, customers would no longer have to opt for open-source code they’d found on the internet and hope for the best. Instead, they could select an image from Chainguard’s library and feel confident that their code was as advertised and could not be edited by bad actors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a massive undertaking, which explained Balkansky’s incredulity when he first learned of it. To execute Chainguard Images, Lorenc and his team would first have to build a Linux distribution, an operating system on which Chainguard Images could run. Balkansky had worked with other companies who had endeavored to do this but hadn’t succeeded; he knew it was an incredibly complex task that could take years to complete, and even then there was no guarantee it would work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky wasn’t the only one who was skeptical. Other software companies with thousands of engineers struggled to believe that Chainguard, with only 25 engineers, could not only build a Linux distribution, but also comb through and verify numerous libraries of code. “Yes, it seemed impossible,” Lorenc says. “Yes, just based on the sheer numbers, the lines of code we would need to pore over and adjust to make secure, it was daunting. Everyone else looked at it and saw it as too hard of a problem, too massive to actually solve. But it seemed obvious it was something we needed to do.” Lorenc shrugs, “To me, it didn’t seem impossible, it just seemed hard. And I’m okay with hard.”</p>



<p>“Hard” paid off. Lorenc and his team spent a year working tirelessly on Chainguard Images. To motivate and energize his team during long days and even longer nights and weekends, Lorenc pulled from the lesson learned at Microsoft, making sure that hours of focus were interspersed with jokes, lighthearted stories and plenty of room for laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky was sitting in a conference room in early 2023 when Lorenc let him know Chainguard Images was live. Balkansky’s first thought: “Pretty damn impressive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Chainguard has rebuilt around 80% of the open-source code most companies use, and because Chainguard is the only company offering access to this type of library, they’re racing to keep up with demand for the remaining 20%. Chainguard also takes custom orders—if a company needs a certain container specific to their product verified, Chainguard will take it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As time consuming and challenging as building out Chainguard Images continues to be, Lorenc recognizes its payoff for users. It’s akin to building a house—yes, you can use cheap and readily available materials for construction and deal with a rickety staircase or a toilet that won’t flush later, but Chainguard’s philosophy is that it’s worth the extra time, money and labor to start with high-quality products. Lorenc believes in taking every measure possible, no matter how complicated it might be, when it comes to keeping software and its users safe.</p>



 



<p>Working in security necessitates a certain amount of paranoia—the fear of what you’ve missed, of an unseen crack or fatal flaw, is relentless. Lorenc’s use of humor to assuage the high-risk, high-anxiety environment has paid off in more ways than one. He regularly makes his own memes, many of which have gone viral within software development communities. One meme shows Ken from the Barbie movie, with the caption “My job is just CVEs.” (CVEs meaning “Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.”) Another depicts Ned Stark from “Game of Thrones,” with a caption that reads “Brace yourselves. VEX is coming.” (VEX is an open platform for sharing information about software vulnerabilities.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lorenc’s goal in creating memes was originally to provide levity and form a community with people working in security, so he was surprised when his social media presence ended up being one of Chainguard’s most successful marketing strategies. Lorenc regularly sees his memes making rounds on LinkedIn and X, formerly Twitter. Chainguard’s TikToks are also popular among engineers, many of which feature Lorenc, in his trademark backward baseball cap, speaking to viewers as though he was guiding a friend through a casual tutorial on software security. Lorenc attributes the love for Chainguard’s social media to his users’ desire for authenticity. He’s not some faceless CEO of a corporation; he’s a software engineer, just like his customers, and he speaks their language. It’s not a traditional avenue for a security company to market itself, but Chainguard has always done things its own way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite his numerous duties as CEO, Lorenc’s favorite part of the job is still working with other engineers to solve complex and granular problems. He thinks Chainguard was able to attract some of the best engineers in the industry precisely because the company has such lofty goals. “The people on our team were drawn to the difficulty of our mission,” he says. “Smart people want to work on hard problems.” Often when people encounter what seems like an impossible series of problems, they get overwhelmed, but not Lorenc. He knows every inch of this engine, and working on it part by part, he’s confident he can get it to run.</p>

 Introducing PIVX Perspectives:<br>Engaging conversations with remarkable contributors to the PIVX community. Get ready for insightful dialogues about PIVX’s journey and future. Stay tuned for inspiring stories from various individuals who have played an important role in the PIVX ecosystem. <p>Our first guest is Jeffrey, PIVX Business Development Lead and a key driving force behind the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Can you tell us a little about yourself please?<br>Hey everyone, my name is Jeffrey, I currently live in South Africa but I have also lived in Indonesia and Singapore. I’m an extremely passionate and energetic person when it comes to digital finance and privacy, advocating for secure and efficient financial solutions in a digital age. My academic journey took me to Singapore where I completed my Bachelors in IT with Distinction. During this time is where I became deeply interested in the world of digital finance, as Singapore is a hub for&nbsp;fintech.</p><p>I’ve been a proud member of the PIVX family since early 2017, joining right around the time of the rebrand. It’s been a fortunate journey, allowing me to witness the remarkable growth of the project and actively contribute to its&nbsp;success.</p><p>When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?<br>My cryptocurrency journey goes quite far back and is actually thanks to a stranger, I was part of a social group where people share discounts or deals on servers. Someone wanted to pay on this particular website for a linux VPS but they wanted PayPal. So in return he sent me my first ever Bitcoin and I paid using PayPal. I believe this was back in late 2012 or early 2013. The wallet at the time I used was called MultiBit if I recall correctly. During this time I also experienced so many issues with online payment methods especially since I am from South Africa and many at the time did not provide their services or had lengthy and often privacy invading verification processes. Bitcoin was so fast, I remember being like wow I received this already and didn’t need to register or provide any of my information. My passion grew and I loved superior technology. Sadly I did end up using it as my main payment method for online goods and services lol so could not really enjoy the extreme growth over the&nbsp;years.</p><p>When and why did you choose to get involved with PIVX?<br>Cryptocurrency was starting to go really viral in 2017, It was at this time myself and some online friends were all looking to invest and buy more. The best way to find new cryptocurrencies to invest in at this time was to browse BitcoinTalk. I was lucky enough to find the PIVX post in 2017 on the forum. I read it was a coin dedicated to privacy which piqued my interest. The forum post also provided a Slack invitation link so PIVX ended up being the first cryptocurrency that I joined the official community for. So I guess initially my first finding out about PIVX was for investment purposes however the community was so helpful. I learned so much in just a week there amongst all the “Purple Rain” showers of PIVX tips flying out to everyone. I dedicated so much time that I ended up assisting with the support team by providing technical assistance as well as hosting calls to show people how to trade&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the market?<br>For me it’s the human touch. PIVX is the only community where anyone can just join in and discuss openly and share ideas with developers, graphics designers, moderators and others from many backgrounds. PIVX may be a privacy coin but it’s extremely human-centric. What I love most is the aim to redefine privacy to its root. That privacy is not for criminals but simply a human right to protect oneself from malicious parties. PIVX makes this privacy option dubbed “SHIELD” completely optional therefore giving the user complete control over how they spend their PIV. PIVX also is a DAO with a treasury guaranteeing constant development and growth therefore PIVX in my opinion has a stable future and is here to secure your digital financial footprint.</p><p>How do you envision PIVX’s role in the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies?<br>PIVX has an ambassador program as well as community members that are introducing PIVX for the first time to many people, many of which will be their first ever crypto and therefore the beginning of their cryptocurrency journey. PIVX sets a benchmark through their meticulous development process that ensures the safety of their blockchain and privacy protocol.</p><p>This unwavering commitment to user safety and the protection of their assets sets a noteworthy example for other cryptocurrencies to follow almost like a benchmark. By establishing such high standards, PIVX contributes to the creation of a safer and more secure environment for newcomers, ultimately fostering increased adoption.</p><p>Can you share any success stories or notable achievements during your time at PIVX?<br>Honestly my biggest achievement in my cryptocurrency career with PIVX is getting feedback from our community on their experiences with PIVX and seeing how positive it is. I work as the lead of business development, I secure new listings and integrations. When I come across fellow Pivians enthusiastically sharing how they’ve started accepting PIVX through platforms like NowPayments, booked flights on Travala using PIVX, or found joy in trading on exchanges such as WhiteBit and LBank, it represents the pinnacle of success for me. More recently, learning how PIVX is enabling our community to make a difference by assisting families in need through the purchase of gift cards on Coinsbee is both humbling and inspiring. It’s not just about me, it’s about the collective impact my decisions make and how they can help others. I hope all my work and achievements combined empowers our community and fellow PIVX holders to explore new possibilities with&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>How do you approach building strong relationships with exchange platforms and integrating PIVX into their trading systems?<br>I begin this first with market research, identifying areas that we lack. For example an exchange that doesn’t require KYC or perhaps provides GBP withdraws to a bank, Once I establish a decent list of exchanges that provide our needs I proceed to contact&nbsp;them.</p><p>The most important thing is a mutual understanding of the objective. Once we establish that we would like a relationship that is more than just trading PIVX but actually engaging with both communities and building together then I can proceed to discuss listings. Exchanges and cryptocurrencies work hand in hand in securing the future of Crypto. Not everyone supports centralised exchanges however it is thanks to them that cryptocurrency is thriving and vice versa. If an exchange wants to foster a relationship that involves us potentially collaborating on future marketing events or conferences then this is a good sign. If an exchange simply wants a listing fee and nothing more then that is a red flag in my&nbsp;book.</p><p>Obviously I will always advise anyone to do their own research on the exchange before trading however if an exchange is positive and wants to highlight the growth of PIVX and be apart of it, I will do my part by making this known to our communities and giving them the thanks they deserve as well as collaboration on any marketing from our&nbsp;side.</p><p>Thank you for reading our PIVX perspectives, stay tuned for more exciting insights and future&nbsp;updates.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/introducing-pivx-perspectives-engaging-conversations-with-remarkable-contributors-to-the-pivx-bcc9f0698ed8">Introducing PIVX Perspectives:

<p>Introduction:<br>In the world of cryptocurrency, liquidity plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth and efficient trading. PIVX has experienced significant improvements in liquidity thanks to the Hummingbot Liquidity Program on Binance. Over the past seven weeks, this program has not only enhanced trading opportunities but also increased the chances of reintroducing a USDT pair on the exchange.</p><p>Enhanced Liquidity on Binance:<br>Since the launch of the <a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/market/76?snapshotTimestamp=1698515760000&amp;interval=1">Hummingbot Liquidity Program, </a>PIVX has witnessed a notable improvement in liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance. The sufficient liquidity provided by HummingBot has allowed for a more stable market that meets the supply and demand of services such as payment gateways that use Binance as an exchange. Sufficient liquidity provides a better market for traders and service providers.</p><p>Positive Results and Future Prospects:<br>During the campaign, Hummingbot miners have traded over $1.5 million worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair. The campaign has consistently ranked among the top three in terms of performance, with an average of 15.5 active bots, $9.93k in open order volume, and $35.1k in daily filled order volume. These figures account for nearly 6% of the total traded volume for PIVX/BTC on&nbsp;Binance.</p><p>The success of the campaign has prompted a proposal to extend it for another eight weeks on the PIVX/BTC pair. If this extension proves fruitful, there are plans to introduce a longer campaign with increased rewards in both PIVX and HBOT tokens, the native crypto of Hummingbot.</p>First 8 weeks of Hummingbot Liquidity Program on&nbsp;Binance.<p>About Hummingbot:<br><a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/">Hummingbot</a>, developed by the Hummingbot Foundation, is an open-source market-making bot that aims to democratize high-frequency trading. It provides a platform for token projects, trading firms, and individual traders to own their liquidity and earn rewards through liquidity mining. Hummingbot has evolved from a simple market-making bot into a powerful platform that allows users to create, backtest, deploy, and manage a fleet of bots running various trading strategies.</p><p>The Importance of Liquidity:<br>Liquidity is a crucial metric for financial assets and trading venues. Traditionally, market making, the provision of liquidity, has been limited to a few participants such as quantitative hedge funds and large financial institutions. However, the Hummingbot Liquidity Program enables anyone to become a market maker and contribute to liquidity provision in the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>A Marketplace-Based Approach:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program takes a marketplace-based approach to promote consistent liquidity provision, improve matching efficiency, and mitigate the risk of manipulative practices. Inspired by successful two-sided digital marketplaces in other industries, this approach tackles the liquidity fragmentation problem in the crypto market, benefiting both exchanges and token&nbsp;issuers.</p><p>Conclusion:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program has proven to be highly beneficial for <a href="http://PIVX.org">PIVX</a>, enhancing liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance and fostering increased trading opportunities. With impressive results and a positive outlook for the future, continuing the program will contribute to the long-term growth and success of PIVX. By leveraging the power of Hummingbot and its marketplace-based approach, PIVX can further strengthen its position in the crypto market and attract more liquidity providers, ultimately supporting a USDT pair too, perhaps with its own Hummingbot Liquidity Program, benefiting all stakeholders involved</p>Miners on Hummingbot have traded over 1.5 million dollars worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair during the first campaign. <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-beneficial-impact-of-the-hummingbot-liquidity-program-on-pivx-b2cd2734b75e">The Beneficial Impact of the Hummingbot Liquidity Program on PIVX</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>While competition fosters innovation, the proliferation of different blockchains has resulted in the fragmentation and isolation of liquidity within each ecosystem. Early attempts to address this issue primarily involved bridges and wrapped assets. Unfortunately, these solutions were often vulnerable to hacks and exploits, and the value of wrapped assets was contingent on the security of the wrapper contract, rather than the underlying asset. Cross-chain swaps of native assets hold the promise of resolving liquidity fragmentation, but numerous technological challenges must be overcome to make them as seamless as same-chain swaps.</p><p>We were joined by Simon Harman, founder of Chainflip, to discuss multi-chain liquidity fragmentation and how Chainflip’s JIT AMM (Just in Time) aims to solve this, by providing cross-chain native swaps.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Simon’s background  (Legacy) Bridging vs. Threshold Signature Scheme  Chainflip’s Just in Time (JIT) AMM vs. Uniswap’s V3/X  Providing liquidity on Chainflip  Slippage and UX  Deciding trading pairs  Chainflip validators  Validator stake auctions  Governance  Roadmap and bootstrapping liquidity  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonAHarman">Simon Harman on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Chainflip">Chainflip on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

<p>We are excited to announce the official mainnet launch of <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/">Horizen EON</a>, Horizen’s fully EVM-compatible sidechain and smart contracting platform. Developed and powered by Horizen, Horizen EON is poised to play a pivotal role in the web3 revolution. Horizen’s goal is to offer a market-leading solution to drive the industry forward – a permissionless, interoperable, customizable multi-chain network with EON being the first of many smart contracting sidechains on Horizen that will onboard the next generation of builders and users to the web3 economy!</p>



 Why Build on Horizen EON? 



<p>Horizen EON (Ethereum Open Network ) is a scalable blockchain platform optimized for streamlined and diverse dapp development. It is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, leveraging Ethereum’s vast resources and community for easy and seamless dapp deployment on Horizen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Ethereum has been driving broad adoption of DeFi ecosystems and smart contracts, Horizen has been developing its ZK-powered cross-chain protocol and horizontal scaling solution, <a href="https://www.horizen.io/zendoo/">Zendoo</a>, that allows a wider adoption of blockchain technology with full customization at the protocol level. With the addition of Horizen EON, Horizen now also opens its fast-growing ecosystem up to more opportunities for efficient development and usage of a wide range of dApps and services than ever before.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZBF_EVM_mainnet-build-on-EON.jpg"></a> 




 Horizen EON’s mission is to empower the next generation of Web3 developers 



<p>Focus: Horizen EON is dedicated to nurturing the next wave of Web3 developers. These are innovators eager to introduce groundbreaking web3 products, but are hindered by the limitations of existing chains, such as inadequate tooling, network congestion, centralization, and lack of growth support.</p>



<p>The EON Ecosystem: Horizen EON is committed to establishing a robust ecosystem tailored for visionaries aiming to challenge and replace the status quo by offering best-in-class launch and growth support including :</p>



 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive toolings that ensure seamless integrations and dapp deployment&nbsp; 



 &nbsp;&nbsp;Business development assistance 



 &nbsp;&nbsp;Access to liquidity, grants, and more. 
 



<p>The EON Identity: Horizen EON also positions itself to be the new hub for consumer dapps aimed at bridging the Web2 – Web3 divide. This ambitious goal is supported by EON’s hands-on approach to crafting an ecosystem optimized for everyday users. The EON platform is designed to provide both the technical infrastructure and a nurturing environment for builders, complete with product support and incubation.</p>



 The EON Launch is Joined by a Vibrant Range of Protocol Integrations and Partnerships 


 
 


<p></p>



<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/ecosystem">The Horizen EON ecosystem </a>welcomes protocols, builders, and dapps that resonate with its<a href="https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/web-assets/eon-litepaper-april-2023.pdf"> core values</a>:&nbsp; Transparency, Accountability,&nbsp; Security, Community Engagement, Continuous Growth, and Social Responsibility. </p>



<p>The EON ecosystem is launched with a wide range of protocols and dapps, providing a vibrant ecosystem for its new users starting day one. These integrations, partners and supporters include developer toolings, bridges, DeFi protocols, liquidity providers, and infrastructure essentials. Some of the integrations and supporters currently live on Horizen EON include LayerZero, Tatum, Pyth, Band Protocol, Ankr, Third web, Stably, and with many more that are forthcoming in the next few days, including SpookySwap, Chainalysis, and Granary.&nbsp;</p>



 Embrace the Web3 Revolution 



<p>Horizen EON’s foundation rests on the belief that the path to web3 adoption involves enhancing the web2 experience. It is not looking to reinvent the wheel but to optimize it, ensuring that the unique features of web3 (like Tokenization, Authentication, and Interoperability) seamlessly integrate into applications that are familiar and user-centric.</p>



<p>Across cutting-edge verticals, EON aims to support innovative application ideas that can bring the next generation of builders and consumers to web3.</p>



<p>As the world has been ushering in a new era of decentralized applications, Horizen invites developers, innovators, and users to join the Horizen EON ecosystem and work together to drive mainstream adoption of web3 technologies, foster a more connected multi-chain world, and create solutions that cater to users at every stage of the Web3 journey.</p>



<p>For more insights into this launch and the future of EON, stay tuned to the upcoming EON Mainnet Launch Summit joined by the teams behind Horizen EON and the launch integrations and partners and ambassadors of the Horizen community. </p>

In fact, a 2021 <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/02/10/cncf-sees-record-kubernetes-and-container-adoption-in-2021-cloud-native-survey/">survey</a> by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) found an impressive 96% of organizations using or evaluating K8s—and as ever-more business-critical apps land on the platform, its uptime and availability have become a top concern for Platform Engineering, SRE and DevOps teams. But some of Kubernetes’ main strengths, its flexibility and its vibrant ecosystem of add-ons, come with a price: complexity. Navigating the multiple configs and tracking intricate dependencies, across multiple layers and multiple add-on solutions, is not for the light-hearted. A typical Kubernetes footprint is not a single platform or product; rather, it is a complex environment built using components from add-ons in the CNCF ecosystem, many of them open source, and some of them commercial products. Each add-on has its own release and upgrade schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The seams between these products are where failures most often occur, and most current tooling is designed to address problems after the fact—meaning devops and SREs get stuck in fire-fighting mode. This reactive troubleshooting is both painful and resource-intensive, with even mundane config changes and upgrades taking a lot of time and effort.</p>



<p>But what if you could add a proactive tool to your toolbelt, to warn you about potential issues—and help you fix them—before they ever lead to downtime? That tantalizing possibility is now a reality with <a href="https://www.chkk.io/">Chkk</a>, a first-of-its-kind platform that allows enterprises to identify and address availability risks and upgrade their Kubernetes deployments safely, quickly and with confidence. Think of it like the X-ray that diagnoses your health issue early on—so it doesn’t land you in the ER.</p>



<p>Chkk co-founders Awais Nemat, Fawad Khaliq and Ali Khayam took inspiration from best practices in cybersecurity, where security vulnerabilities are reported publicly. Similarly, Chkk is building a database of availability risks by tracking the behavior of hundreds of Kubernetes projects. Powered by this innovative Collective Learning technology, the platform then continuously scans your environment to find and prioritize risks and prevent disruptions—and even creates pre-verified plans to reduce upgrade time from weeks to days. Teams learn from other’s mistakes so they don’t repeat them, and developers spend far less of their valuable time putting out fires.</p>



<p>Awais, Fawad and Ali are a founding dream team who worked together for more than a decade, including at AWS and on the team that built Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and they understand the challenges Platform, SRE and DevOps teams are facing firsthand. Now, they’re on a mission to solve those same problems for all developers, and we at Sequoia are thrilled to support them and lead this seed round. With their Kubernetes Availability Platform now in general availability and with more infrastructure teams adopting Kubernetes every day, we believe this is just the beginning—for Chkk’s growing team, and for the indispensable technology they’re building.</p>

 Noir comes to the&nbsp;browser! <p>Today we’re releasing NoirJS- a Javascript package for <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a> developers who want to build real applications that generate zero knowledge proofs in the&nbsp;browser.</p><p>Web development within the Noir ecosystem has historically been, uhm, complex. Practically, that meant Noir developers couldn’t really build applications that ran in the browser. And we want people to build applications with our software!</p> Y u no&nbsp;browser <p>A browser is an application used to access the World Wide Web and interact with Internet applications. It turns out most people like using browsers.</p><p>Before today, Noir didn’t really let you build applications that could run in-browser. Instead, developers were forced to run applications locally in a&nbsp;CLI.</p><p>In simple terms, that meant Noir couldn’t actually support real applications.</p><p>But now Noir does support applications with&nbsp;NoirJS.</p><p>The goals of NoirJS are&nbsp;simple:</p>  Enable Noir applications to work in web&nbsp;browsers  Simplify package management  Improve DevEx from “oh God” to “oh&nbsp;good”   Reminder on what Noir&nbsp;is <p>Noir is a zero knowledge circuit-writing language that works with multiple crypto proving back-ends. That means the front-end (the language) remains the same but Noir can be modularized to support the latest and greatest in zero knowledge proving research.</p><p>We do this through the ACIR (abstract circuit intermediate representation). Learn more about the ACIR&nbsp;<a href="https://noir-lang.org/#whats-new-about-noir">here</a>.</p><p>NoirJS lets developers build around the core concept of client-side compute: the ability to harness user hardware-phones, laptops, tablets-through the browser in order to compute proofs of execution.</p><p>And client-side compute in turn allows for fully private and trustless blockchain systems.</p><p>…sound familiar??</p><p>That’s the core philosophy of Aztec-giving developers the tools to develop programs with private data and compute while remaining fully trustless.</p>  Users download encrypted data  They decrypt and manipulate the data locally (unbeknownst to anyone&nbsp;else)  They furnish a proof of computational correctness  They submit the&nbsp;proof  <p>In English: do blockchain things without anyone knowing! Cool,&nbsp;right?</p><p>And for developers’ convenience, NoirJS is packaged with Barretenberg-the same Plonkish backend used by <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec Labs</a> in the Aztec rollup. No need to go shopping for a proving system unless you like, really want&nbsp;to.</p> Quality of Life Improvements <p>NoirJS does a lot of other things, too! Developers were previously burdened by the need to manage multiple components like `bb.js`, `acvm`, `noirc_abi`, and future components like `noir_wasm`.</p><p>But managing component libraries and balancing version compatibility is not our idea of&nbsp;fun.</p><p>To install NoirJS you simply run `npm i @noir-lang/noir_js` in your Javascript directory</p><p>Install your proving backend of choice (ahem, probably Barretenberg), and you’re good to&nbsp;go.</p><p>NoirJS handles all Noir dependencies, exposing them through one clean interface, allowing you to focus on building rather than fiddling with packages.</p><p>Here are some other advantages:</p><p>Immediate Access: Browser-based applications don’t require additional software, making it easier for developers to reach a wider audience.</p><p>Improved User Experience: By enabling Noir functionality in the browser, users can interact with applications in real-time. That means fast&nbsp;apps.</p><p>Enhanced Security: Operating in the browser allows for client-side cryptography, offering an additional layer of security for applications that require cryptographic proofs.</p><p>Developer Flexibility: NoirJS enables developers to build rich, client-side applications with cryptographic functions, providing a broader toolkit for web development.</p><p>Community Building: Browser-based Noir enables rapid prototyping and sharing among the developer community. This is especially useful for teams who focus on in-browser applications and use-cases.</p><p>In-Browser Tooling: NoirJS fits seamlessly with in-browser IDEs like VSCode for web, allowing for a streamlined development process in which Noir programs can be compiled and proven directly in the&nbsp;browser.</p><p>So to summarize, by bringing Noir to the browser,&nbsp;we’re:</p>  simplifying development  expanding the scope and capabilities of what can be built with&nbsp;Noir  <p>Siiick.</p> Use-Cases and Applications <p>Less development pain means more time for building new applications. Here are some use-cases we’re excited to&nbsp;see:</p>  Pseudonymous identity web apps: Projects like <a href="https://www.noxx.xyz/">Noxx</a> are focused on building pseudonymous identity web&nbsp;apps.  In-browser ZK games: Tonk.gg’s NES emulator <a href="https://tonk-gg.github.io/dappicom-site/">Dappicom</a> can now incorporate Noir functionalities seamlessly.  Proof of solvency: prove solvency or liquidity without exposing the underlying assets or&nbsp;trades  On-chain poker: play poker with its hidden card dynamics without a trusted third&nbsp;party  zkEmail: decentralized e-mail with no trusted&nbsp;servers   Conclusion <p>NoirJS lets you build real Noir applications that run in the browser. It also makes your life easy breezy beautiful CoverGirl.</p><p>If you don’t know what Noir is, read <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge/">this announcement</a>, scan <a href="https://noir-lang.org/">these docs</a>, and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AHsyRkd2is&amp;ab_channel=ETHGlobal">this&nbsp;video</a>.</p><p>If you do know what Noir is, install NoirJS <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">right now</a>. <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">Right now</a>. <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">Right&nbsp;now</a>.</p><p>And if you end up building something cool, <a href="https://aztec.network/grants/">come ask us for&nbsp;money</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="http://aztec.network/blog/announcing-noirjs-noir-applications-in-your-browser">https://aztec.network</a> on October 25,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/announcing-noirjs-privacy-preserving-zk-applications-in-your-browser-d7d78692f15a">Announcing NoirJS: Privacy-Preserving ZK Applications In Your Browser</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Recommitting to open-source security</p><p>Today we’re announcing that as a result of Aztec Labs’ full investigation into a vulnerability in <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/sunsetting-aztec-connect-2/">Aztec Connect</a>, we have paid $450,000 to a whitehat independent security researcher through our Immunefi bug bounty&nbsp;program.</p><p>On September 12th, independent security researcher <a href="https://github.com/lucash-dev">lucash-dev</a> discovered a vulnerability in Aztec Connect, Aztec Labs’ zkRollup system designed to enhance privacy in DeFi operations.</p><p>Recognizing the gravity of the situation, Aztec’s team moved swiftly to mitigate any potential damage, temporarily restricting public access to the affected workflow.</p><p>The team has conducted a full technical postmortem, the result of which you can view&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/claim-proof-bug">https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/claim-proof-bug</a></p><p>We remain extremely committed to open-source software development, and see the treatment of this vulnerability as further evidence of the robustness of the open source community.</p><p>As a reminder, Aztec Labs will no longer support its first-party front-end <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> after March, 2024. Users are reminded and urged to withdraw funds as soon as possible by navigating to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a>.</p><blockquote>💸 Full withdrawal documentation can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/misc/aztec_connect_sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> Summary <p>At the heart of the issue was the computation related to determining a user’s output from an intended DeFi interaction-in other words, the funds a user gets back after initiating a transaction within Aztec Connect. Due to this oversight, a malicious sequencer-and only a malicious sequencer-could exploit this computation via Aztec Connect’s escape hatch, a mechanism for individuals to exit funds directly to L1 Ethereum.</p><p>The primary challenge emanated from the inherent complexities of executing integer arithmetic within ZK circuits. These circuits are designed to operate over finite fields, making integer operations particularly tricky.</p><p>The crux of the problem was tied to the system’s handling of integer division and the subsequent remainders. In the absence of proper constraints, a sequencer could manipulate the `user_output` value, adjusting the remainder to ensure the primary equation still held true. This opened up avenues for multiple valid decompositions for a single value, making it a target for exploitation.</p><p>The remedy involved introducing stringent constraints to ensure a consistent and direct mapping between the original values and their decomposed counterparts. Furthermore, to prevent any undue advantage to the sequencer, the remainder value was also carefully constrained.</p><p>This incident with Aztec Connect serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities and potential pitfalls inherent in developing large-scale projects, even with extensive auditing. It underscores the necessity for continuous scrutiny, highlighting the invaluable role of bug bounty programs in maintaining the security and reliability of such&nbsp;systems.</p> Conclusion <p>Our $450,000 bug bounty payment to <a href="https://github.com/lucash-dev">lucash-dev</a> is our largest ever, and a reiteration of our commitment to open source software development.</p><p>We appreciate him and the broader ZK community for maintaining a high degree of vigilance over complex crypto&nbsp;systems.</p><p>We strongly encourage all users of <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> and third party Aztec Connect products to withdraw funds as soon as possible. Support for <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> will be sunset in March 2024, after which individuals will have to withdraw funds by running their own sequencers.</p>  Navigate to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> to withdraw&nbsp;funds  Read our full technical breakdown <a href="https://hackmd.io/OrsPExbWTJaJAX5A8dCvGw">here</a>  Full withdrawal documentation can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/misc/aztec_connect_sunset">here</a>  <p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/aztec-connect-postmortem/">https://aztec.network</a> on October 24,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-labs-announces-our-largest-ever-bug-bounty-of-450-000-434ab2477b3a">Aztec Labs Announces Our Largest-Ever Bug Bounty Of $450,000</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Stablecoins represent a safe haven against crypto’s volatility, allowing participants to remain in the market, without off-ramping to fiat. While the major stablecoins are centrally issued (e.g. USDT, USDC, BUSD), there is a pressing need for an algorithmic variant or a synthetic dollar asset. (DAI is somewhere in between since approximately 50% of its collateral is USDC). After Luna’s collapse, many jumped to point out its design flaws, yet such a concept would be crucial for crypto’s decentralisation and self-sustainability. Arthur Hayes proposed an interesting concept of NAKA synthetic dollar (NUSD), backed by Bitcoin and its inverse perpetual swap short.

    <p>Q3 2023 was full of growth and exciting milestones for the Horizen ecosystem! The Horizen DAO went live and the core team launched the Alpha version of Horizen’s EVM sidechain, EON on mainnet. This alpha launch has activated increased developer activity and&nbsp; BD partnerships – watch out for more news in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>We look forward to another fruitful and productive quarter!</p>
<p></p>
 Launch of the Horizen DAO 
<p></p>
<p>Last month, the Horizen DAO officially launched, marking the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!<br><br><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">Learn more about the Horizen DAO launch in our blog post.</a></p>
 Horizen EON Alpha Launch&nbsp; 
<p>On August 1st, Horizen EON Alpha was activated on mainnet, marking the beginning of the on-boarding phase for launch partners &amp; early builders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Horizen EON documentation can be found in our <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/">documentation hub</a>, featuring content around different network environments, developing and deploying smart contracts, staking, service providers, and tutorials.</p>
<p>The core team has also worked to release a new software upgrade that adds a new voting power contract for the Horizen DAO governance, improved the node synchronization speed, and enhanced security&nbsp; features.</p>
 Horizen EON Q3 Partnerships and Integrations 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-wanchain-to-expand-cross-chain-interoperability-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Wanchain Expanding Cross-Chain Interoperability for EON</a></p>
<p>Wanchain is an R&amp;D-focused blockchain interoperability project whose mission is to drive blockchain adoption through interoperability by building fully decentralized bridges that connect the world’s many siloed blockchain networks.</p>
<p>This collaboration will enhance Horizen EON’s potential by adding it to the roster of chains that users can bridge their funds to using Wanchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-tatum-to-enabling-blockchain-application-development-and-integrations-on-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Tatum Enabling Blockchain Application Development And Integrations On EON</a></p>
<p>This collaboration aims to make it much easier for developers to build using Horizen ecosystem by integrating Tatum’s easy-to-use blockchain development tools and framework. By leveraging Tatum, Horizen EON will offer developers the ability to seamlessly integrate blockchain functionalities into their applications, coded in JavaScript.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-and-pyth-network-join-forces-to-amplify-decentralized-oracle-services-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Pyth Network Amplifying Decentralized Oracle Services For EON</a></p>
<p>Pyth Network is a specialized oracle solution, to provide decentralized oracle services for EON. This collaboration will bring accurate and trusted on-chain market data to EON, empowering developers to enhance their smart contract capabilities and expand the possibilities for DeFi, gaming, and NFT applications.</p>
 Horizen EON Welcomes NTT DATA, Joining The Network As A Certificate Signer Node To Support The Growth And Security Of The EON Network 
<p>Last month, a leading IT service provider and global innovation partner, NTT DATA, is deploying a Horizen EON blockchain Certificate Signer Node on the NTT DATA infrastructure, which will contribute proactively to the credibility, security, and robustness of the Horizen EON network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen EON chain will have a total of 47 certificate signer nodes. These signer nodes provide credibility to the transactions on the EON chain and ensure decentralization. They are responsible for signing backward transfer requests allowing the flow of ZEN from the EON chain to the Horizen mainchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-welcomes-ntt-data-joining-the-network-as-a-certificate-signer-node/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=marketing+EON">Learn more about this announcement here.&nbsp;</a></p>
 Q3 Core Software Releases 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/new-software-release-eon-1-0-0-is-available-to-download-now/">EON 1.0.0 Release</a></p>
 
 EON 1.0.0 is used for GOBI Testnet nodes and EON Mainnet nodes. Deployment guides can be found at <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/develop_and_deploy_smart_contracts/local_build_and_deploy">EON Documentation</a>. 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">Node Software Upgrade ZEN 4.1.0</a></p>
<p>Learn more about ZEN 4.1.0 in <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">our blog post.&nbsp;</a></p>
 ZenIP 42206 – Redirecting Secure Node Rewards into Horizen EON 
<p></p>
<p>Horizen’s Community Council has recently submitted <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a>, which proposes a redirect of the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund. The purpose is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zendoo has increased the requirements of mainchain nodes so that the Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen chain. Furthermore, with the removal of the shielded pools on the mainchain, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.</p>
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Please join the conversation and make this decision with us. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">Learn more about ZenIP 42206 </a>and let us know what you think by submitting the community survey:</p>

Featuring a proposal for <a href="https://debank.com/proposal/15639">Rabby Wallet to support the EON chain</a>, Tally, a leading DAO tool to join the EON chain, and a request for Phantom Wallet to integrate with EON.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also saw a proposal to deploy Synapse on Horizen EON, this deployment aims to establish connectivity between the Horizen Ecosystem and a wide range of popular Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains connected to the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
