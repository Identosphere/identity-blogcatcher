<p>The maximal extractable value (MEV) problem, if left unchecked, could represent an existential threat to Ethereum’s core values. One might argue that it is a natural result of solving market inefficiencies, but it entices to centralisation and collusion in order to extract the highest amount of value. Additionally, through front-running and back-running, it creates unnecessary overhead, which caused up to 2.4% of the total network congestion back in DeFi summer of 2020 (according to Flashbots’ research). As current infrastructure cannot eliminate MEV altogether, Flashbots and other research groups have tried to come up with solutions to address its aftermath.</p><p>We were joined by Stephane Gosselin, co-founder of Flashbots and Frontier Research, to discuss the MEV landscape, what research breakthroughs have been recorded and how they impact DevEx and UX.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Reflecting on ‘Frontrunning the MEV crisis’  Decentralising the MEV ‘supply chain’  The vision behind Frontier Research  Request-for-Quotation (RFQ) explained  Block building  Uniswap X and how it might impact LPs &amp; block building  Decentralising block building  Proposer-builder separation (PBS)  MEV burn  How MEV influenced different applications’ UX   Intents  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/thegostep">Stephane Gosselin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://frontier.tech/">Frontier Research</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FrontierDotTech">Frontier Research on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Brian Fabian Crain &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p>7 years of experience building blockchain communities. Privacy advocate. Previously at Oasis&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Alyssa (Aztec): Hey Meredith! So the idea of this interview is to get a sense of your career path, your role at Aztec, and what you’re excited about as a new member of our commercial team!</p><p>Can you start by sharing your web2 background and how it helped lead you to&nbsp;web3?</p><blockquote>Hi there, and yes! I was previously working in real estate, and funny enough I was an Assistant Leasing Manager for ~7 apartment complexes here in Baton Rouge. In a way, I was “Community Manager” — doing marketing and other leasing&nbsp;work.</blockquote><blockquote>I wanted to start investing, but wasn’t exactly sure about what to invest in. I started doing copious amounts of research and stumbled upon crypto. I had heard of it like most people, had seen it in the news, and just generally heard all the crazy stories about how crypto was being used back in those days. This was around 2016, and I was young and&nbsp;excited.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: How about what falling down the web3 rabbit hole looked like for&nbsp;you?</p><blockquote>It took me a while to piece together what a smart contract or protocol was, and why these systems made sense for this transparent blockchain context as opposed to what we have in web2 — where everything is off-chain and we don’t have much control or flexibility.</blockquote><blockquote>Once I really started understanding what this technology meant for the future of society, for my children, I was inspired. I was working full time, mom of two, and staying up until 2:00 or 3:00am every single night on Reddit, on Facebook groups, on Twitter. Learning everything that I could — reading white papers. Since then, I’ve remained extremely passionate and&nbsp;curious.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: How do you feel about the industry’s evolution over the past ~8&nbsp;years?</p><blockquote>Of course there’ve been periods when I’ve been disappointed in the industry, and seen the exact behaviors that we wanted to avoid from the traditional finance sector/web2 world replicated in this space that I saw as a shining&nbsp;beacon.</blockquote><blockquote>But I’ve really enjoyed most of it, and now I’ve reached a point where I fully acknowledge that things are shifting rapidly, and people are going to make mistakes. Web3 is a place where we can learn and improve together.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Why did you decide to join&nbsp;Aztec?</p><blockquote>I’m super passionate about privacy in general. I was previously working at another privacy project called <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis</a>. And before that, I did work for <a href="https://pivx.org/">PIVX</a> — also centered around privacy. This has been a major theme in my excitement about what blockchain means.</blockquote><blockquote>There’s this public side of things which is great. But to expand these really cool use cases, some degree of privacy is needed. Having more control over our privacy is an opportunity in&nbsp;web3.</blockquote><blockquote>I’ve been super passionate about projects that are building in this direction and I became involved with the <a href="https://privacyalliance.com/">Universal Privacy Alliance</a> (UPA). That’s how I got Aztec-pilled.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Would love to hear more about how you got Aztec-pilled, what did connecting with the project and team look&nbsp;like?</p><blockquote>I was already very impressed with Aztec when <a href="https://twitter.com/Blulinski">Bruno</a> and I had the opportunity to work on an ETHDenver event together - it was a mini-summit that I organized with about seven other members of the&nbsp;UPA.</blockquote><blockquote>While we were in Denver, I went to the Aztec meetup and got to chat with some of the other teammates. I felt synergy as it was clear to me that this team cared about doing things the right way, not the easy&nbsp;way.</blockquote><blockquote>I’ve always wanted to serve a community actively working towards putting privacy tools in the hands of developers, so that privacy can be leveraged by everyone else. In my core, I want to make sure that I’m a part of that privacy piece, specifically. This is why joining Aztec — where we’re paving the way to programmable privacy — made sense for&nbsp;me.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: What are you focused on as Developer Advocate and what do you enjoy most about the role? Would be great to hear more about your work right&nbsp;now.</p><blockquote>Yea! The title Developer Advocate is a new one for me. I’ve had many different ones, and in web3 we’re often required to wear many&nbsp;hats.</blockquote><blockquote>I’ve been a Community Lead, Social Media Strategist, and Marketing Manager. I’ve also had plenty of different hybrid roles across the projects I’ve been fortunate to be involved&nbsp;with.</blockquote><blockquote>As a Developer Advocate, I believe my core responsibility is to speak up for developers and make sure their feedback is being heard by the internal Aztec&nbsp;team…</blockquote><blockquote>…and also educate developers about what we’re building. We accomplish this through Discord, community events, 1:1 meetings, diving into GitHub — looking far beneath the surface of what people say to try to piece together: Where are we lacking? How can we improve? And conveying that to our&nbsp;team.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: What does a robust, healthy developer community for a project like ours look like? What does it have and what does it need to&nbsp;have?</p><blockquote>We can learn from a book that Bruno recommended to me when I first started at Aztec, it’s called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Producing-Open-Source-Software-Successful/dp/0596007590">Producing Open Source Software</a>. When you look at how this book outlines everything that matters for an open source software project, including building the community, you can learn a&nbsp;lot.</blockquote><blockquote>First of all, you want to have a place where people can openly and freely contribute in a way that make sense for them — not putting the barrier too high on how people can get involved, or the time commitment. If they want to tinker with Noir or Aztec for 30–45 minutes a week — they’re still welcomed in our community. We leave expectations at the&nbsp;door.</blockquote><blockquote>For any developers engaged with our community, of course we want to provide a supportive environment that includes educational content, tooling, funding, listening to their feedback, and connecting them with fellow devs. Also seeding inspiration/ideas.</blockquote><blockquote>If you have a developer community where people feel like they belong, heard, and accepted, that’s&nbsp;key.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Wow, it’s really inspiring to hear you talk about&nbsp;it.</p><p>And what about beyond web3? Just general interests and maybe hobbies. Are they pretty tech focused given you work in blockhain?</p><blockquote>I’m a big time reader. I’ve read 39 books this year, and I’m working on a couple more. It’s my little escape — I read a mix of fiction and non-fiction to balance&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m learning how to garden as well. I live in the south so I’ve been growing okra, peas, tomatoes, and carrots. My garden is flourishing, so I’m happy about&nbsp;that!</blockquote><blockquote>I also very much enjoy cooking, taking care of my family — that’s not necessarily a hobby but definitely my primary interest…taking care of my 3 kiddos and teaching&nbsp;them.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m hoping to foster in them a curiosity about life, so a lot of my newer interests overlap with the stuff they want to&nbsp;do!</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Aw, I bet. That’s awesome. Anything else you want to share? How can people keep up with&nbsp;you?</p><blockquote>Anyone who’s interested in building on Aztec and/or using Noir, don’t be afraid to reach out. Don’t let what is a seemingly steep learning curve deter you from getting your feet&nbsp;wet.</blockquote><blockquote>If anyone is interested in building with us or just joining our developer community, and wants to learn about the resources available, they can reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/merfymerf">Twitter</a> (@merfymerf), on Telegram (@Meredithdarden), via email (meredith@aztecprotocol.com) — all are&nbsp;fine.</blockquote><blockquote>The link to join our Discord server can be found in the <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/">docs</a>, I’m in there as well. I’d love to help out however I&nbsp;can.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Amazing. Thank you so&nbsp;much.</p><blockquote>Thank you!</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/q-a-with-aztec-developer-advocate-meredith-darden-70abe4ca2140">Q&amp;A with Aztec Developer Advocate, Meredith Darden</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As humans age the chances of dying from specific diseases (cancer, coronary, neurological, etc.) increase, where the rate of aging is controlled by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. Although the hallmarks of aging (including several cellular and molecular processes such as genomic instability, telomere attrition, stem cell exhaustion etc.) have been a major focus of research for many decades, the scientific pathways behind reversing aging are complex and remain elusive. Recently several approaches to cell rejuvenation have been based on partial cellular reprogramming (demonstrating that reprogramming cells to pluripotency can reverse age-related cell phenotypes), although there are still many challenges when trying to reprogram cells including the loss of somatic identity&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Clock.Bio is taking a new approach to cellular reprogramming in order to develop novel, anti-ageing therapeutics and drugs with technology developed at Cambridge University. Their initial goal is to identify the entire set of rejuvenation programs in human cells. They will leverage Bit.Bio’s opti-ox technology to screen for rejuvenation biology and identify repair mechanisms that can reverse the hallmarks of aging. In addition to opti-ox the company leverages tools such as CRISPR/a to modulate genes and combinations of genes, attempting to understand the full biology of reversal of&nbsp;aging.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Aging is core to many human ailments and by reversing aging we can potentially cure age related conditions. By leaning on Bit.Bio’s opti-ox technology and by tapping into the company’s screening, synbio stack and customer relationships, Clock.Bio will be able to accelerate data collection and conduct relevant anti-ageing screens, giving them a head start in the race for anti aging solutions. Ultimately we believe that by screening for therapeutic leads (existing and novel small molecules, cell and gene therapies, etc.) and creating specific rejuvenation effects on cells, Clock.Bio are well positioned to bring a number of antiaging assets into the&nbsp;clinic.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the entire Clock.bio team on their longevity mission to extend healthspan by 20 years or even more.

But by the end of 2023, this new interface will allow tokens to be swapped from Ethereum to the Cosmos Nym blockchain directly from the Nym Wallet, empowering NYM holders to contribute more actively to the mixnet by bonding and delegating much more&nbsp;easily.</p><p>Everyone in the ecosystem will be able to effortlessly swap native NYM tokens on Cosmos for Ethereum tokens and vice versa, drastically improving usability for holders, traders, operators, and delegators.</p> Nym Wallet: A ‘one swap&nbsp;shop’ <p>Currently the NYM token is siloed between the ERC-20 token and the native NYM token on Cosmos. Token swaps on Nym Wallet, which will be live and usable by the end of this year, will dissolve these barriers by allowing users to painlessly switch between the two as little or as often as they&nbsp;desire.</p><p>Right now the NYM token exists on the Ethereum chain as an ERC-20 token, as well as on the Cosmos chain as the native NYM&nbsp;token.</p><p>The ERC-20 token is easier to acquire because Ethereum ERC-20 tokens are more readily listed on most exchanges.</p><p>However, an essential component of the Nym token economics is delegating tokens to mix node operators. This measures reputation, but it also incentivises and rewards contributors to the ecosystem for providing good mixes, keeping the mixnet running smoothly.</p><p>See also:<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-is-not-a-blockchain-but-it-is-powered-by-one-4bb16ef16587"> Nym is not a blockchain, but it is powered by&nbsp;one</a></p><p>The Nyx blockchain that powers the Nym mixnet is built on Cosmos, the ecosystem of interoperable blockchains, which is highly efficient and low-latency. For this reason, the native NYM token is minted on Cosmos, and this is what operators receive as their&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>But only native NYM tokens — that is, on Cosmos — can be delegated. While that will remain the case for now, the new token swap interface simplifies converting ERC-20 to&nbsp;Cosmos.</p><p>Swapping between ERC-20 and the native token is currently time-consuming.

<p>Progress for Private&nbsp;Voting</p><p>Private voting is the “real-world” default, and for good reason!

TL;DR:</p>  Is it possible to build a voting system on Ethereum that’s user-friendly, trustless, fair, weighed, and ballot-secret? Yes,&nbsp;very!  If these properties can’t all be met at the same time, which of them are incompatible, and why? All of them can be&nbsp;met.  What is needed to make the full combination of properties available to the Nouns community? Present our findings to date + bring TBD multisig and vote aggregation solutions to production.  <p>You can review the <a href="https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/noir-trie-proofs/">code</a> and <a href="https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html">general report</a> for AZKR’s early roadmap for what is currently called zk-POPVOTE (zk Proof-based On-chain Private Voting), which is a continuation of the project we’ve started together.</p><blockquote>🐦 Join the Twitter Spaces we’ll host on September 5th at 12:00 UTC&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YpJkgBvQgYJj">here</a></blockquote><p>At Aztec Labs, we will continue contributing to the development of the <a href="https://aztec.network/noir">Noir</a> programming language, and we look forward to building privacy-preserving infrastructure to empower private governance.</p> Resource List   <a href="https://research.aragon.org/nouns-tech.html">Read the technical report</a>.  <a href="https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html">Read the general&nbsp;report</a>.  <a href="https://blog.aragon.org/announcing-a-proof-of-concept-for-private-voting-in-nouns-dao/">Read Aragon’s announcement blog</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/noir-trie-proofs/">Check out the code in&nbsp;GitHub.</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YpJkgBvQgYJj">Join the Twitter Space</a> on September 5th at 12:00&nbsp;UTC.  <a href="https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter">Get started with Noir</a> — the universal language of&nbsp;ZK.

<p>As a followup to our <a>February blog post regarding the changes to Brave Rewards</a>, today we are announcing the expected vBAT sunset deadline: October 31, 2023.</p>
<p>If you’re a Brave Rewards user without a custodial account connected, soon you will see vBAT-related notices appear across the Brave Rewards interface that look like this:</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Users in unsupported regions will still have the option to contribute their vBAT balances to <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Verified Creators</a> of their choice before the deadline.  For a refresher, see <a>our original blog post</a>.</p>

 Update on supported regions 
<p>As promised, we’ve been working with our custodial account provider partners to widen regional support for Brave Rewards before saying goodbye to vBAT. Since the announcement in February, we’ve been able to re-enable support for the following regions:</p>
 
 Croatia 
 Greece 
 Slovakia 
 Slovenia 
 Taiwan&nbsp; 
 
<p>You can find the latest <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/6539887971469">list of supported regions for each custodial account provider here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re delighted to confirm that users in India with vBAT will soon be able to connect an account from one of our new custodial partners to Brave Rewards, allowing them to redeem their balances for BAT before the deadline. More information to come!</p>
<p>If you have any questions, join us on the <a href="https://community.brave.com">Brave Community forums</a>.</p>

From the tension between centralization vs. decentralization and the role of platforms in power, we also talk about the importance of financial freedom and American innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/payments-bitcoin-crypto-decentralization-platforms">listen here</a><br>share <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1694008498580021696">on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x8480c8">on Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7099761028321705984">on LinkedIn</a></p> 💎 Resource: On ‘protodanksharding’, ‘danksharding’, and ‘data availability sampling’ … in 30(ish) minutes <p>Valeria Nikolaenko</p><p>In just 36 minutes, a16z crypto research partner Valeria Nikolaenko describes and explains protodanksharding, danksharding, data availability sampling, rollups (how they work, types)… all of which are important for future upgrades to Ethereum, and for understanding networking/ blockchain scalability. Nikolaenko also highlights some of the best data availability schemes so that others can improve on them, incorporate those ideas into their own projects, or do further research.

So she covers the process of pitching from start to finish — before making a deck, before the pitch, during the pitch, and following up after — including especially how to craft a narrative for your product and team. Why is this a big market/ vision/ opportunity? Why are you the right team to bring it to market? And what is the one question Simpson likes to ask every founder? (Hint: the answer will be the key theme throughout your pitch).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/JL0zM7MkDpI?si=Ttx8bQEazrxunSMd">watch this video</a> &nbsp;<br><a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1692693948433608882">share</a></p> 🌐 Trend: On stateless blockchains <p>Miranda Christ and Joe Bonneau</p><p>As blockchains grow to support more users and more frequent transactions, so too grows the amount of information (the “state”) that validators have to store to verify transactions. For example: in Bitcoin, the state consists of a set of unspent transaction outputs; while in Ethereum, the state consists of an account balance for each account, as well as code and storage for each smart contract. These storage burdens will become unwieldy as blockchains grow (given enough accounts or everyday transactions), making it difficult to become a validator — posing a potential threat to decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s tempting to turn to cryptography as a solution — where tools such as Merkle trees and zero-knowledge proofs have previously helped us achieve the implausible — to create “stateless” blockchains, they remain far from practical despite substantial research (e.g., <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1188">Boneh et al</a>, <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal">Buterin</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/599">Srinivasan et al</a>, <a href="https://petertodd.org/2016/delayed-txo-commitments">Todd</a>). In fact, argue the authors of this piece (including a16z crypto research intern &amp; PhD student Christ), stateless blockchains won’t ever be feasible without additional measures to manage the state. But such “impossibility results” shouldn’t be discouraging, because they can direct researchers and builders to pursue more fruitful paths…</p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/on-the-impossibility-of-stateless-blockchains/">read the post</a> “On the impossibility of stateless blockchains”&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/UGcfTkZbjAw?si=rpL-hXcQcDVhNJHd">watch the video</a> “On limits on revocable proof systems, with implications for blockchains”</p>  <p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1478">check out the full paper</a> “Limits on revocable proof systems, with applications to stateless blockchains”</p>  <p>share on <a href="https://twitter.com/miranda__christ/status/1694735693463826856">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0xa76b82">on Farcaster</a></p>   🗞️ News &amp; moves: IRS guidance on staking; crypto &amp; banks; more <p>Our ongoing <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/regulatory-updates-roundups-recaps">regulatory updates</a> — as curated by the a16z crypto regulatory team — cover news, guidance, legislation, and frameworks released by agencies, associations, governments, banks, and other entities around the world as they impact the crypto industry in terms of regulation and policy.

<p>Panther community,</p><p>After a very successful Stage 0, today we are debuting Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet. At this Stage, you’ll test two of Panther’s very anticipated innovations: <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts</a>. </p><p>Stage 1 is public and will have dedicated rewards. It will work only on desktop, not mobile devices. Differently from Stage 0, users will be rewarded for completing the product flow. However, we encourage the community to try to find and submit bugs, as well as to provide feedback. This process ensures that the Testnet returns a bug-free protocol, ultimately improving the protocol and its users’ experience.</p><p>Let’s dive deep into Stage 1:</p><p>(Note: For this Stage, the Panther Miner used in Stage 0 will be shut off for two days. We’ll put out an announcement when it is back to activity).</p> Why Stage 1 matters <p>At this stage, you’ll be testing two features that allow Panther to combine privacy-preserving DeFi access with compliance capabilities:</p> Third-party compliance integrations <p>Panther has built a system that retains neutrality by plugging directly into compliance providers and integrating them into the application’s flow. These systems can capture certain types of user data and issue a zero-knowledge proof attesting that users have been verified without the protocol learning any information from them.</p><p>The Panther DAO has been commissioned to select a compliance vendor that aligns with its interests, a discussion taking place in <a href="http://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s forum</a>. For the sake of this Testing exercise, an integration has been built that uses <a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi’s</a> system. PureFi is a multi-vendor compliance provider that has demonstrated interest in partnering with Panther through the DAO discussions.</p><p>Registering using these integrations is a multi-step process that connects a user’s Panther Account with the verification performed by PureFi.</p><p>It consists of:<br><br>a. Creating a Panther Account by connecting your wallet (e.g., Metamask).<br>b. Undergoing a basic verification on PureFi’s site (opened in a pop-up tab).<br>c. Completing the verification process in the Panther dApp by providing the created proof of verification. This process involves downloading files on your browser (around 30MB), which can sometimes take 2-3 minutes (depending on IPFS’ responsivity at the time. In case of trouble, reloading may help.)</p><p>The above activates the user’s Panther account created in step (a) above, and issues account creation rewards to the user.</p> Panther Accounts <p>Within Panther, users are identified through their Panther Account (which has a corresponding zAddress), a concept similar to a bank account in that it englobes all of a user’s transactions within a single reference point. Accounts attest to users’ compliance verification while retaining zero-knowledge properties. In other words, they prove that a user has passed verification (as well as the type of verification passed), but they do not store any private information about users.</p><p>We posted an article further expanding on the rationale behind both of these components, as well as Panther’s compliance focus. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">Check it out here!</a></p> Testing and providing feedback <p>As we mentioned, Testnet rewards are automated, and as such, the Testnet itself will reward users for going through the Account creation flow. However, the goal for the Testnet is to debug and enhance the protocol before v1’s launch. </p><p>Our expectation is that users submit bugs and share ideas to enhance end-to-end functioning, interaction and usage of wallets, UI/UX flows, and let us know about any component that doesn’t look or feel as expected. We have created the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">spreadsheet</a> containing all the details that users can test, which includes functional and visual components. Note that every testing case is numbered to facilitate the process of providing feedback.</p><p>Spotting and fixing any possible bugs within the Testnet will make the first version of the protocol more sustainable in the middle term while allowing users to receive their earned rewards.</p> How to test <p>Users can visit the Testnet link for Stage 1 found <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">in the info repository on our docs</a> to test the onboarding functionality. This involves creating a Panther Account, undergoing a simple verification process (name and email required, ID NOT required) with PureFi, and activating their Account. We recommend that you test along with reviewing the testing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">spreadsheet</a> so that you can keep track of everything you need to test.</p><p>To share feedback, testers will be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a dedicated form</a> as the only accepted procedure. The steps mentioned in the form’s description are needed to make this interaction both efficient and productive.</p><p>Users will be rewarded with 100 $tzZKP (test $zZKP) sent to their wallet as soon as they complete the onboarding process and successfully activate their Panther account. tZKP tokens will be used to interact with the protocol during later stages. Interactions with the protocol also accrue rewards for users in the form of tPRP, which will be used in the second stage. As such, testers will receive 500 tPRP.</p><p>Remember that, to test, you will need to use the Mumbai Polygon Testnet. To use this network, you may also use a faucet (such as <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">this one</a>) to obtain test MATIC to pay for transactions.</p> Important note (do not skip this!) <p>It’s possible that, during testing, you might encounter a set of RPC errors derived from the Mumbai testnet network itself. These errors are due to infrastructural challenges and outside Panther’s control. <br><br>If at some point (such as while logging in or trying to switch networks) you encounter an error that prevents you from signing transactions (which might even cause your wallet extension to crash needing a browser or PC restart), please: </p>  Visit <a href="https://chainlist.org/chain/80001/to?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://chainlist.org/chain/80001/</a> to see a list of Mumbai network working nodes.  Identify a working node. Note that, since this is a Testnet product, privacy is non-essential.  Access your wallet’s Network settings, and edit the Mumbai network to use the working RPC’s server address.  If needed, change the Chain ID to “80001”.  Re-start the product flow.  <p>If the problem persists even after trying a new valid RPC, please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">the official form</a> to fill out a bug report.</p> Thank you for testing!<br> <p>The Panther community has done a great job testing Stage 0. We’re sure this will be a constant as we progress through the different stages of our Testnet leading up to v1. </p><p>We’re looking forward to receiving your feedback. If you have any further questions, please reach out through our official channels below!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases.

<p>Due to abnormal metabolism, certain diseased tissues, most notably solid tumors, produce an acidic extracellular microenvironment that is still little understood. Nevertheless, today all drugs in oncology are developed by R&amp;D teams using the same classic textbook definition of tumor acidity which leads to (among other issues) poor tumor targeting and specificity, resulting in a paradoxical situation: despite an increasing number of promising oncology treatments, most cancer therapeutics or chemotherapy agents still have significant toxicity issues and severe side effects, mainly due to off-target effects, ie. where drugs kill healthy&nbsp;cells.</p><p>The <a href="https://cytosolix.com/">Cytosolix</a> team has spearheaded a decade-long research program at the Engelman Lab at Yale that recently resulted in a paradigm shift in our understanding of tumor acidity by discovering that the tumor micro-environment is much more acidic than previously thought, opening up the possibility to create better acid-targeting cancer therapeutics. Based on this discovery, Cytosolix has developed a platform focused on small molecules, called TAP (tumor-activated permeability), and has developed a unique chemical library over the past decade as part of its goal to make order of magnitude better cancer therapeutics.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>In an era when a single blockbuster therapeutic for cancer can be worth billions of dollars in annual revenue, we believe Cytosolix’s TAP platform has the potential to be applied to nrealy all solid tumor targeting small molecules that are already approved and in development, meaning that Cytosolix could receive a part of the upside from a number of existing drugs if TAP is genuinely effective. Moreover, the company’s first oral lead small molecule has been shown to enhance in vivo biodistribution to tumor cells by several orders of magnitude, compared to the original drug, which could translate to a significant efficacy benefit and the company’s own best-in-class drug. Cytosolix will pursue several more candidates during the seed&nbsp;phase.</p><p>We look forward to joining <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinjohnfoster/">Colin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-deacon-cytosolix/">John</a> and the <a href="https://cytosolix.com/">Cytosolix</a> team on their&nbsp;journey.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, Cosmos set out to provide an alternative to the monolithic blockchain architecture proposed by Ethereum. Cosmos SDK was the cornerstone of this vision, as it allowed developers to spin up blockchains effortlessly. Its modularity enabled custom, self-sovereign chains to become a reality. And, instead of being a jack of all trades, those chains were centred around a sole purpose, thus transforming them into appchains. In turn, as the ecosystem grew, appchains had to be interoperable with one another, but this was already a core feature of Cosmos, via IBC. Before Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap, appchains were thought to be a much-needed scaling solution. However, with the advancements of zero knowledge technology, the Cosmos SDK now faces another set of challenges as it navigates the market demand for L2 scaling solutions.</p><p>We were joined by Marko Baricevic, Cosmos SDK product lead, to discuss the development philosophy behind the Cosmos Hub and how appchains evolved over time.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Marko’s background  Cosmos SDK’s history and high-level overview  Cosmos SDK modules and VMs  Ethereum’s &amp; Cosmos’ development philosophies  Cosmos SDK value prop and use cases  Cosmos SDK vs. other frameworks (e.g. Substrate)  Token value accrual and the fragmentation dilemma  Using the Cosmos SDK to build rollups  Cosmos SDK vs. Avalanche’s HyperSDK  Adoption of fraud proofs and validity proofs by the Cosmos SDK  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/mark0baricevic">Marko Baricevic on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmos">Cosmos on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmos_sdk">Cosmos SDK on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/interchain_io">Interchain Foundation on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/binary_builders">Binary Builders on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Meher Roy &amp; Felix Lutsch.

 Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) — Provable, Decentralized Cross-chain Communication  Written by Mike Toutonghi, lead developer of the Verus Protocol.  How it&nbsp;started <p>Bitcoin proved that decentralized, secure, permissionless and provable agreement on a worldwide blockchain network of participants is possible.</p> How it’s&nbsp;going <p>Beyond Bitcoin, most leading blockchain networks today were initially centralized through ICOs or large pre-mines, rather than a fairly launched protocol. In some cases, the ICO or pre-mined share of ownership was further entrenched by switching from proof of work, as a way for anyone to earn, to pure proof of stake, where owning the network currency is required to earn and those with the most earn the most. As part of prioritizing early growth to capture maximum crypto market share, these platforms generally abdicated the hard work of designing or implementing core protocol primitives, such as currencies or identities, beyond one native currency, as originally conceived in&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Instead, the popular VM model of many blockchains today, which generally provide a shared “computer” or VM on top of a decentralized blockchain, leaves building critical primitives as someone else’s problem, usually companies and app designers, basically writing centralized apps. Instead of a secure set of underlying rules for currencies, we get best practices and the evolutionary legacy of thousands of “dApps”, which ironically, are mostly just partial or full re-implementations of the secure primitives missing in the consensus-based L1 protocols themselves.</p><p>As a result of the focus on pumping and market capture vs. evolving what we could learn from Bitcoin with sustainable, decentralized, more secure primitives and better protocol design, billions of dollars of value has been lost or transferred from naive early users who bought into the pumped crypto hype to hackers, scammers, VCs, centralized exits, and MEV-exploiters who all leveraged the mass of weaknesses they either failed to protect against or in some cases created and obscured themselves on systems that don’t define or enforce even the most common core primitives, currencies or identities. A great deal of loss has been due to obviously poor cross-chain “bridge” design, with the most common problem being bugs in complex smart contract workflow, followed by stolen or compromised private keys of contract owners / controllers, and in some cases, outright theft by contract controllers.</p><p>The lack of agreement on basic primitives and how to represent them in a globally resolvable way has held back general, robust solutions to the fundamental problem of interoperability between blockchains and other financial networks today. To complicate our collective challenges, adding full primitive support in the protocols is hard work, especially in an industry where just a year of development is considered a massive investment that must be rewarded by timely exit liquidity. Consequently, an abundance of shortcuts and heavily marketed yet hastily built solutions still dominate the popular narrative, as hacks, rugpulls, and losses continue to pile&nbsp;up.</p> The solution <p>Verus was founded by technology veterans and others who believe humanity can do better than being exploited by the technology these same veterans had been building for corporations over decades. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed, built, and tested over more than 5 years by a self-selected and often volunteer group of technology, finance, legal, operations, or just life veterans and newbies alike. Early Verusians shared a common vision and made it reality, achieving a fairly launched, community driven project without VCs or ICO participants who may want to exit and a truly decentralized unlimited scale network that all humanity can use and build upon without paying rent to&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>It has taken exactly as long as it has to realize the vision laid out 5 years ago, which is more clearly relevant today than ever. Along the way, that vision has grown and evolved as new community members contributed their own vision to help us improve, making the Verus PBaaS protocol, of which VIP is a small part, a major milestone for the crypto industry and a move back to the original intent of decentralized networks that was pioneered, if not fully realized by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin. Verus has taken Nakamoto consensus to the next level with consensus driven functional protocols for network primitives that are needed in any network hoping to securely enable financial applications.</p><p>To ensure maximum decentralization, the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) takes a maximally decentralized, validator driven approach to its multi-network bridging by incorporating and accounting for currencies, identities, namespaces, and the concept of connected networks themselves in the L0 and L1 consensus protocols. The Verus Internet Protocol provides just enough structure to interoperate with any system that can control funds based on logic and exposes a provable representation of currencies and/or identities.</p><p>By grounding interoperability in a cryptographically provable, hierarchical namespace of self-sovereign, worldwide resolvable identities, VIP enables the first high-throughput, unlimited scale, decentralized, multi-protocol, non-custodial, auditable and transparent, currency and identity aware cross-blockchain communications protocol.</p> A cross-chain protocol with same chain properties <p>VIP can be seen as a cross-chain protocol that operates on proof of proof of consensus (PoPoC). VIP has the following properties:</p>  Transactions that include cross-chain operations, cross-system currency transfers, or new currency and identity definitions, are standardized in the protocol, as are the semantics of their cross-chain use, fee models, cross-system, name-centric provable routing, and MEV-resistant bundling and rollup properties. These characteristics can be and have been implemented on UTXO, VM-based, and transparently centralized networks.  VIP supports direct or indirect system&lt;-&gt;system communication, including cross-system export and import of currency and identity definitions, as well as revocation, recovery, and controlling keys. All cross-chain or DeFi functions in the protocol are accessible to full or lite node clients and applications by simply creating standard transaction inputs and outputs that specify the operations. Available APIs on every node or FOSS API server simplify the creation of transactions with cross-chain outputs in response to command requests or JSON RPC&nbsp;calls.  Transactions with Identity, DeFi, or cross-chain operations, including all inputs and outputs, even exports and imports of all currencies, are checked for validity by miners and stakers with network consensus, just as single currency inputs and outputs are in today’s single currency blockchain networks.  Cross-chain protocols operate in the same way as on-chain DeFi protocols and are processed on chain by miners and stakers with a bundle-&gt;export-&gt;import workflow, enabling high-throughput DeFi and cross-chain operations.  In PBaaS, exports, imports, and DeFi operations are all solved simultaneously and processed with at per-block or larger granularity in an MEV-resistant manner as part of the core protocol, recognizing and enabling the need for beneficial arbitrage, while eliminating toxic MEV such as front-running and sandwiching once and for&nbsp;all.  All cross-chain operations are proven based on one of the following proof models, which are configurable on a per system/chain basis:    Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness enhanced, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (auto-notarization)  Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (notary dependent notarization)  Semi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway&nbsp;proofs  <p>Full auto-notarization is only available between Verus and PBaaS chains, and operates faster with but is not dependent on notary witnesses. When auto-notarization is applied to other gateway connections, the protocol will fall back to the closest it can come between auto-notarization and notary dependent, which may evolve towards less dependence on the notaries in future versions. Whether you auto-notarize or depend on notary witness confirmation, all forms of notarization operate similarly. We’ll start with the basic workflow, then highlight differences:</p>  “Earned” and “Accepted” notarizations — VIP broadly defines two types of cross-system notarizations, earned and accepted.    Generally, one side of a connection will create “earned” notarizations, which on PBaaS chains or for the Ethereum bridge, are created by miners and stakers adding a notarization output to the coinbase. Earned notarizations, which can only be created by Verus or PBaaS chain miners and stakers, include a way to agree or disagree with specific past notarizations, and are subject to further “confirmation” rules, which may vary depending on if the rules are “auto”, centralized, or “notary confirm”.  Once a new, earned notarization is confirmed, the proof of confirmation is sent to the “notary” system, which is typically a launch chain, and in the case of the ETH bridge, is Ethereum, along with any notary signatures necessary to prove confirmation, which are typically present. The new, confirmed, earned notarization is entered on the notary chain as an “accepted” notarization, and is entered as “agreeing” with a prior accepted notarization along with proof of the agreement. If the prior accepted notarization it agrees with is not yet confirmed, then it may be considered newly confirmed.  <p>2. Once an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, alternating between PoW and PoS blocks to help further decentralized requirements for agreement, and by following all notarization rules, notary witnesses may sign signifying they agree with the notarization as well. Although they can disagree with a signature, no signature is also a valid way to disagree.</p><p>3. After validators and notary witnesses have agreed, or in the case of auto-notarization, a longer validation period with more agreement has passed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement, is confirmed. Once that happens, the blockchain is considered final up to the point of that confirmation and will resist reorganizations to any point&nbsp;behind.</p><p>The primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization. Most notably, “notary confirm” always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence in the face of randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs and disagreements. Fully centralized gateways still operate on cryptographic proofs, but they only need notaries to agree on the cryptographic roots in order to consider them true and do not need cryptographic proof to establish the notarization proof&nbsp;root.</p><p>Once a proof root has been established by notarization, this root is used to cryptographically prove bundles of transactions exported from one chain or system and imported to another. Even Ethereum transactions are proven in both directions using the same workflow, although Ethereum transactions are validated using <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">PATRICIA Trie</a> proofs, while PBaaS chains use the Verus <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range (MMR)</a> method, both being cryptographically sound. Cross-chain bundles of transactions follow the same bundling protocol when sourced from Verus or PBaaS chains as is followed in DeFi to prevent&nbsp;MEV.</p><p>Transactions are always delivered to the destination network with bundles in the order they were created on the source network and according to the enforceable rules of the source network. Since a relayer may add arbitrage transactions when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but may not affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle from one network to another, no restriction is placed on who relays a valid bundle of transactions. Since validators who relay and mine or stake transaction bundles into a block may earn a validation fee from the import transaction itself, validators or notaries will generally shuttle transaction bundles between chains and networks out of self interest, while having no ability whatsoever to censor or modify protocol level&nbsp;bundles.</p> What witness / notaries do NOT&nbsp;do <p>Witnesses / notaries have no control over what transactions are or are not included or the order in which they arrive from one system to another, as all of that is dictated by the protocol. By default, notaries cannot create notarizations and can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.</p><p>Witness notaries’ primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators’ earned notarizations, which are earned on one blockchain and accepted on another chain or system. As long as validators enter valid notarizations as part of the merge mining or staking process, confirm other notarizations entered by past validators, and a majority of notaries sign and witness their recognition of those events, a proof root that can be used by anyone to prove committed bundles of cross-chain transactions is established on both systems for the other. As the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform, which relies on the proof established in relation to a confirmed, notarized proof&nbsp;root.</p> Do auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations? <p>Yes. Proper planning and selection of options and witness ID structure during the launch of a blockchain network or gateway can ensure that security levels meet network demands. There are security tradeoffs between auto-notarization and notary-confirm options, which basically are a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, auto-notarization vs. a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses, which can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs, allowing for further decentralization, even while requiring participation of a&nbsp;quorum.</p><p>Determining which option to choose, how many and what notaries to choose, what other safeguards can further enhance security, and then understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices, is important when launching a blockchain or gateway. The following outlines the current high-level security considerations when configuring a new chain or&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>Currently, Verus VIP supports 2 proof models for interchain communication, the Verus PBaaS Merkle Mountain Range proofs, which also assume the Verus Proof of Power protocol, and Ethereum PATRICIA Trie proofs that enable interfacing with VIP between any PBaaS chain, and any Ethereum VM + PATRICIA Trie compatible network.</p><p>Since Verus PBaaS is the only interface to fully support notarization finalization using full auto-notarization, it is important to understand the differences between PBaaS and Ethereum proof protocols. At present, there is no objective proof protocol implementation for Ethereum that is known and implemented, which can operate without dependence on some set of notary witnesses. At this time, auto-notarization, when applied to Ethereum, is more similar to notary-confirm, with additional revocation safeguards that could address more edge-case threat&nbsp;models.</p><p>As new proof algorithms evolve for Ethereum, enabling trustworthy cross-chain proof models in both directions that are both timely and do not need to be backed by witness signatures, it will be possible to update the protocols to remove dependence on witnesses over time. To ensure maximum decentralization on the Ethereum bridge, the network itself can permissionlessly propose contract upgrades, and if affirmatively voted on by Verus validators, an upgrade and new contracts can eventually change the cross-chain proof conditions.</p><p>Auto-notarization of one PBaaS chain on another (PBAAS_AN) differs from and Ethereum interface or notary-confirm (NC) in that, if there are enough validated blocks, both mined and staked, as well as validator agreed notarizations, PBAAS_AN allows validators to finalize a notarization and submit it to the alternate chain. If there are disagreements about the correct notarization, the process becomes an on-chain proof competition, requiring each party to represent a growing, actual chain with both proof of work and proof of stake with an eventual winner. NC still has the miners and stakers create and earn from earned notarizations, but it also must have agreement from specified notaries to finalize any notarization and cannot finalize cross-chain proof roots without that agreement.</p> Improvement over common cross-chain protocols <p>Since Verus VIP does not ever have any identity, multisig or otherwise, hold custody over any funds when crossing from one decentralized network to another, even in the context of the Verus Ethereum contracts, threats caused by malicious notaries or stolen keys to drain funds on decentralized bridges or currencies are simply not viable against the Verus VIP protocol.</p><p>Cross-chain notarizations must first be entered by an earning validator, either PoW or PoS, and must also be agreed to by another validator, alternating between work and stake in eligibility. Only after that happens can notary witnesses apply their signature and agree to make that a confirmed notarization candidate. Still, what happens if a majority of notaries are malicious and colluding, or if some entity was able to somehow steal a majority of the notary private&nbsp;keys?</p><p>If the majority of notary witnesses are honest and operate their witnessing nodes according to the protocol, the security of such a model should be sufficient for any level of cross-chain transaction proof. If, however, a majority of the notaries were colluding and malicious or if their keys were stolen, Verus VIP still provides ways to ensure that the protocol responds to such a situation without risk of loss. Although there are ways to mitigate such a form of attack, even if no mitigation were available, such malicious or fraudulent notary witnesses would need the following in order to attack a PBaaS cross-chain connection:</p>  Colluding, malicious notaries  Fake validators with more combined hash + stake power than the publicly validated chain making earned notarizations  Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow&nbsp;chain  <p>While you may recognize these requirements as very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain, the Verus VIP protocol provides a way to even defend against such an unlikely scenario. VIP provides for revocation of all VerusIDs, including notary IDs, even those that are used for Ethereum protocol bridges. Furthermore, each PBaaS chain, including Verus, has a network agreed multisig chain oracle that can separately pause cross-chain notarizations or transactions temporarily, which also can be overridden by network validators.</p><p>To enable yet another layer of safeguards, the Verus VIP protocol does not confirm any notarization that has first been agreed to by validators, then agreed to and signed by all notaries on either the earned or the accepted chain, until a second such notarization confirms the first. This ensures that every notarization on any chain is first made public, given a period of time before confirmation, and finally, if nothing stops it, confirmed.</p><p>Meanwhile, with basic monitoring by witnesses to see if their own identities have signed for anything they do not actually agree with, meaning their keys were stolen, notaries can auto-revoke their own identities and prevent stolen key attacks from being anything more than an inconvenience. Additional monitoring by chain oracle controllers to look for clear discrepancies between soon to be confirmed notarizations and chains that they monitor can also use the oracle notification network to pause cross-chain transactions, providing yet another line of defense for each chain on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>While there are numerous capabilities and safeguards built into the Verus VIP protocol beyond those described in this document, by separating the proof root notarization process and using cryptographic proof as the foundation of a provable, high throughput, cross-chain export/import protocol, VIP enables the most secure, scalable, decentralized and multi-modal cross-chain protocol ever designed for blockchains and the Internet of&nbsp;Value.</p> Try the Verus Protocol Yourself! ✅ <p>Look up <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a> to use many API commands (e.g. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">launching currencies, tokens &amp; liquidity pools</a>).</p><p>Or look up the <a href="https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-02_verus_commands.md">complete command list&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Join the community.

<p>The chain-agnostic Nym mixnet solves the transport layer privacy problem for any Layer 1 chain or Layer 2 dApp, wallet or&nbsp;app</p><p>Every single internet application and service whether Web 2.0 or Web3 suffers from the same common issue: network traffic is exposed. This is an underlying problem in the design of the internet itself. But Nym, with its mission of complete privacy online for everyone, everywhere, solves this ‘transport layer privacy problem’ by obscuring network traffic for any web service, chain, dApp, wallet or app. Read on to learn why Nym is the ‘Layer 0’ privacy stack for the whole internet:</p> What is Layer 0 — and where does the Nym mixnet fit&nbsp;in? <p>The internet is split into different layers with different functions, and the underlying network infrastructure layer is Layer&nbsp;0.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/nbe0921ed80d9">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nym-i%CC%87nternetin-tamam%C4%B1-i%C3%A7in-katman-0-gizlilik-altyap%C4%B1s%C4%B1-24605d2d72e1">Türkçe</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/nym-%E6%95%B4%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E7%9A%840%E5%B1%82%E9%9A%90%E7%A7%81%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E8%AE%BE%E6%96%BD-4bdbfbb29ba3">中文</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/nym-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8F-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0-24de3615d4ba">Русский</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/nym-infrastructure-de-confidentialit%C3%A9-de-couche-0-pour-lensemble-d-internet-70e3d1997626">Française</a></p><p>The Nym Mixnet is also Layer 0. It addresses the network layer, or transport layer of the internet: think of this as the roads and highways of the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Just like in the physical world, these roads and highways are all completely visible.</p><p>Now imagine looking at all these roads and highways from above. While it might be difficult to identify drivers, concealed in their vehicles, there are plenty of other identifiers that could help an observer paint a revealing profile of that motorist.</p><p>Even if this observer couldn’t see inside the car, they can see how big the car is, the colour of the vehicle, where it’s going, time of departure, and time of arrival. Together, this information can reveal a lot about that drivers’ relationships, state of mind, habits, career, and&nbsp;life.</p><p>These roads and highways are essentially the core communication protocols of the internet, like TCP and&nbsp;UDP.</p><p>As data packets speed along these highways, the behaviour of this data can be monitored and information built around how they travel along it, just like the example of a driver on a real road. This is called metadata, in other words, data about the&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Layer 0 Nym mixnet solves this by obfuscating the metadata. The Nym mixnet encrypts internet traffic into identically sized packets, mixed with ‘dummy’ packets of data that contain nothing whatsoever. These are all then sent through three layers or ‘hops’ into mix ‘nodes’ that are distributed around the world, at randomised times and intervals, before they are reassembled and decrypted on the receiving side. This makes network traffic observation near-impossible.</p><p>To return to the highways analogy: imagine if all cars travelling on a packed highway looked exactly the same. They travel through tunnels at random intervals, and it’s impossible to see when they departed or where they were going or when and where they ended their destination. Unique identifiers, like their colour or type of car, are stripped away. Suddenly, it would be a lot more difficult to make any inferences or guesses about the habits of that driver or their relationship to&nbsp;others.</p><p>By obfuscating metadata at the network layer — Layer 0 — this is what the Nym mixnet achieves.</p> What is Layer 1 and why does it need L-0 privacy protection? <p>Web3 promised to jettison the centralisation that plagued Web 2.0, where power is concentrated into the hands of governments and corporate monopolies. Transparency is a core part of this proposition, but transparency runs both ways and currently, traffic is visible and vulnerable to analysis.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-is-not-a-blockchain-but-it-is-powered-by-one-4bb16ef16587">Nym mixnet is not a blockchain — but it is powered by&nbsp;one</a></p><p>The Web3 world of blockchains, decentralisation and distributed apps is split into various&nbsp;layers.</p><p>To use another metaphor, think of a building. Before anything can be built on top of this structure, it needs foundations at the very&nbsp;bottom.</p><p>Right at the bottom of this stack is Layer 0, the foundational, network layer for&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Blockchains are Layer 1. These distributed ledgers are the systems on which other apps and services or blockchains are built. Right now, these are vulnerable to traffic analysis and attacks at the network layer, Layer&nbsp;0.</p><p>In order for a blockchain to function, they need peer to peer transactions as well as broadcasts to signal that these transactions are taking place. They also need coordination between validators, which confirm (or validate) transactions.</p><p>Even if the blockchain itself is designed with security in mind, currently, traffic between peer to peer transactions and coordination between validators is&nbsp;exposed.</p><p>The Layer 0 Nym mixnet provides cover. Again, it protects metadata information from leaking by obscuring network&nbsp;traffic.</p><p>Without Layer 0 privacy infrastructure, blockchain traffic can be analysed, opening the infrastructure to attack, whether that is from DDoS attacks, targeted censorship, or exposing the behaviour of validators or end-user transactions.</p><p>Nym is chain-agnostic, so Nym can be integrated with any blockchain to obfuscate the traffic on it. In short: the Nym mixnet provides network-level, Layer 0 privacy for any Layer 1 blockchain.</p> What is Layer 2, and why does it need L-0 privacy protection? <p>Layer 2 means the tokens, other blockchains, and dApps that run via smart contracts hosted on the Layer 1 blockchain.</p><p>No changes are needed to the Layer 1 blockchain to build these applications or services, they simply nestle on top of the layer beneath&nbsp;them.</p><p>For example: Bitcoin is a Layer 1 blockchain, but the Lightning Network payment protocol layered on top of Bitcoin is Layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-breakdown-of-the-smart-contracts-that-run-the-nym-token-economics-3a61b4139f95">A breakdown of the smart contracts that run the Nym token economics</a></p><p>Integrating Nym obscures traffic to and from Layer 2 applications or tokens or services.</p><p>Additionally, developers can privacy-enhance existing apps or build new privacy-enhanced apps with the Nym Layer 0&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>This means that when users run an application, no matter where it lies or what blockchain it’s hosted on, the traffic will be run through the Nym mixnet, offering Layer 0 protections to both the Layer 1 blockchain and the Layer 2 application, protecting metadata across the whole&nbsp;stack.</p> A holistic approach to&nbsp;privacy <p>The internet is fundamentally broken and does not preserve privacy. By design, traffic data is visible, and powerful interests like governments and corporations take advantage of this fact. They monitor traffic, collect metadata, and build detailed profiles based on it — which can be<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJ4PfebyW8"> more exposing than the contents of a&nbsp;message</a>.</p><p>Because Nym addresses the network layer of the internet, the Nym mixnet is a holistic approach to privacy for Web 2.0 and&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>The aim of Nym is to protect network traffic for all of the internet.</p><p>Learn more about how Nym supports interoperability from Head of PR at Nym, Candice&nbsp;Teo:</p><p>Builders: strengthen the foundations of your project by integrating the Layer 0 Nym mixnet today.

  Today we're excited to announce that Leo, the AI assistant built natively in the Brave browser, is now available for testing and feedback in the Nightly desktop channel (starting with version 1.59).

<p>Today we’re excited to announce that Leo, the AI assistant built natively in the Brave browser, is now available for testing and feedback in the Nightly desktop channel (starting with version 1.59).</p>
<p>Building on the success of the <a>Brave Search AI Summarizer</a>, we’ve made Leo available as a companion in the browser sidebar. Leo allows users to interact with the web pages they’re visiting—for example, by asking for video transcripts or interactive article summaries—without leaving the page itself. Leo can also suggest follow-up questions, augment original content, and even help with reading comprehension. Leo can answer questions just like other AI-powered chatbots, but directly within the experience of a web page.</p>

 What is Brave Leo? 
<p>Brave Leo is a chat assistant hosted by Brave without the use of third-party AI services, available to Brave users on the desktop Nightly channel. The model behind Leo is Llama 2, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/">a source-available large language model released by Meta</a> with a special focus on safety. We’ve made sure that user inputs are always submitted anonymously through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse-proxy</a> to our inference infrastructure. In this way, Brave can offer an AI experience with unparalleled privacy.</p>
<p>We’ve specifically tuned the model prompt to adhere to Brave’s core values. However, as with any other LLM, the outputs of the model should be treated with care for potential inaccuracies or errors.</p>

 How to try Leo and share feedback 
<p>Leo is available today for all users of the Brave browser desktop <a>Nightly channel</a>. Nightly desktop users can access Leo via the  button in Brave Sidebar.</p>
<p>Are you a Brave Nightly user? <a href="https://community.brave.com/c/new-feature-feedback/141">Please tell us what you think of Leo</a>!</p>

 A note on anonymity 
<p>Leo is free to use for any desktop Nightly user, and no user login or account is required. Chats in Leo cannot be used for training purposes, and no one can review those conversations, as they’re not persisted on Brave’s servers—conversations are discarded immediately after the reply is generated. For this reason, there’s no way to review past conversations or delete that data—it isn’t stored in the first place.</p>

 What data does the Brave browser send? 
<p>If you use Leo, the browser shares with the server your latest query, your ongoing conversation history and, when the use case calls for it, only the necessary context from the page you’re actively viewing (e.g. the article’s text, or the YouTube video transcript).</p>

 How can I get better results out of Leo? 
<p>As with any AI, the more specific you are with your prompts and context, the better the results Leo can provide. Remember to give Leo clear, detailed instructions and, if you don’t get exactly the answer you’re looking for, to try wording your query/prompt a different way.</p>

 Does Leo have access to live information? 
<p>For now, Leo does not have access to live information. However, in future releases we do plan to offer a version of Leo with some level of access to current information. This will be powered by our own independent <a>Brave Search</a>.</p>

 What’s next for Brave Leo? 
<p>In addition to incorporating live information, we’ll be making improvements to Leo’s accuracy and user experience. We hope to release Leo to all Brave browser users in the coming months.</p>

							<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://zfnd.org/launching-the-zcash-minor-grants-program/">launched the Zcash Minor Grants program</a>. Ten minor grant applications were <a href="https://zfnd.org/minor-grants-applications-april-2023/">submitted to a poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (ZCAP), and <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcash-minor-grants-april-2023/">four grants were approved</a>.</p><p>Feedback from the community was overwhelmingly positive. Therefore, we are today opening applications for a second round of the Minor Grants program. </p><p>The maximum grant size is $25,000, and the total budget for this round is $75,000. We will again be engaging the Zcash community, and taking advantage of the “wisdom of the crowd” by polling ZCAP regarding which grants should be funded.</p><p>If you are interested in submitting a Minor Grant application, please read this blog post carefully. </p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 The Application Process 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Applications must be submitted via the <a href="https://zcashgrants.org/submit">ZF grants platform</a>, and applicants must agree to sign ZF’s <a href="https://zfnd.org/terms-and-conditions/">grant agreement</a>, and undergo <a href="https://zfnd.org/aml-kyc-requirements/">the ZF KYC process</a> if their application is successful. </p><p>The deadline to submit a grant application is 20:00 UTC on Monday 18th September. </p><p>ZF will review all applications, and will reject any grant applications that are deemed unsuitable (see the FAQs section below for examples of why ZF may judge a grant application to be unsuitable under this program). Suitable applications will then be submitted to a poll of ZCAP to determine which should be funded. Applicants who are members of ZCAP will not be eligible to participate in this poll.&nbsp;</p><p>Applicants should feel free to submit a grant application in their native language. ZF will translate it to English (likely using an online tool, such as Google Translate) and make both the original and translated application available to ZCAP.&nbsp;</p><p>We aim to publish the list of suitable grant applications, and open the ZCAP poll by 2nd October. The ZCAP poll will remain open for approximately two weeks, and we plan to announce the results on 16th October. We will keep applicants and the community apprised of any changes or delays to this timeline via the Zcash Community Forum.&nbsp;</p><p>To be eligible for funding, a grant application must receive greater than 50% approval from the participants in the ZCAP poll. Eligible grants will then be funded in order of priority determined by the level of ZCAP’s approval, and as the total budget permits. There will be no partial funding of grants.&nbsp;</p><p>Grant payments will be made in the form of shielded ZEC. Successful applicants will be required to provide a z-address or u-address. Approved grantees will also be required to submit <a href="https://zfnd.org/kyc-policy-abbreviated/">KYC documents</a> before receiving payment.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Example of how the ZCAP poll will work 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>In the example below, ten suitable grant applications for varying amounts were voted on in a ZCAP poll that had a turnout of 134 with a $75,000 USD total budget. </p>

							<p>In this example, the approval threshold to be eligible for funding would be 68 votes.&nbsp;</p><p>The Zeta and Kappa grants would not be funded because there would be insufficient funding remaining in the budget (after funding grants with higher approval ratings) to fund those grants.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the Theta grant would be funded because, while it achieved a lower approval rating than Zeta, it is small enough that it could be funded out of the remaining budget.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sigma and Omega grants would not be eligible for funding because they failed to achieve a greater-than-50% approval rating in the ZCAP poll.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Frequently Asked Questions 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>What is the Zcash Foundation’s mission?</p><p>Our mission at the Zcash Foundation is to build financial privacy infrastructure for the public good, by helping sustain and improve open financial networks that allow anyone and everyone to protect their own privacy, on their own terms. While our primary focus is the Zcash protocol and blockchain, we also support broader applications of zero knowledge proofs, as well as other approaches to financial privacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do grant applications have to be Zcash-related?&nbsp;</p><p>No. Any project that aligns with the Zcash Foundation’s mission is suitable for the Minor Grants program. We would especially like to attract grant applications that are not directly Zcash-related but explore broader applications of zero knowledge proofs or other approaches to financial privacy, in line with our charitable purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How does the Minor Grants program relate to Zcash Community Grants?</p><p>The Minor Grants program is entirely separate from the Zcash Community Grants program (ZCG). ZCG is intended to fund Major Grants for teams that are carrying out large-scale, long-term projects. By contrast, the Minor Grants program is intended to provide a source of funding for smaller, more short-term grants for both teams and individuals. We also hope that the Minor Grants program can provide an opportunity for teams to demonstrate their ability to deliver on a Minor Grant before applying for a Major Grant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Under what circumstances would ZF reject a grant application as unsuitable?</p><p>Here are some examples of why ZF may reject a grant application:</p>  The grant’s purpose is not congruent with the Foundation’s mission.  The grant does not, in our estimation, represent value for money.  We have reason to believe that the applicant is not capable of delivering on the grant.  The purpose of the grant would violate U.S. law or contravene the Zcash Foundation’s obligations under <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations">U.S. IRS 501(c)(3)</a>.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can applicants remain pseudonymous?</p><p>Applicants can keep their identity private but they must undergo <a href="https://zfnd.org/aml-kyc-requirements/">the ZF KYC process</a> if their application is successful, which includes disclosing and verifying their identity to ZF.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Where is the funding for this program coming from?</p><p>This program is being funded by the Zcash Foundation, from its slice of <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014">the Dev Fund.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My application to the ZCG program was rejected. Can I re-apply to the Minor Grants program?</p><p>Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can current and former recipients of ZCG grants apply for a Minor Grant?</p><p>Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can I submit multiple Minor Grant applications?</p><p>You may only submit one Minor Grant application at a time (i.e. per round).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can I specify multiple milestones as part of my grant?</p><p>No. There is no “milestone” option for Minor Grants. Grant payouts will either be paid upon award of the grant (i.e. up-front) or upon completion of the grant. Note that members of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel may look less favorably on applications that request up-front funding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have a question that’s not answered here.</p><p>You can post questions to <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/opening-applications-for-the-second-round-of-zf-minor-grants/45463">this topic on the Zcash Community Forum</a>. Alternatively, you can email minorgrants@zfnd.org</p>

<p>Iraq recently blocked (and then un-blocked) Telegram in the country. Here’s how citizens can connect to Telegram via the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>This is a Nym Community post by privacy researcher Saliveja.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/comment-utiliser-telegram-en-irak-avec-nymconnect-5846d2ae0989">Française</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%81%D1%8F-telegram-%D0%B2-%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5-%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7-nymconnect-344f304ade3c">Русский</a></p><p>Earlier this month, the telecoms ministry of Iraq <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/iraq-blocks-telegram-app-cites-personal-data-violations-2023-08-06/">blocked Telegram</a>, claiming that it violated the integrity of Iraqi citizens’ data by allowing private information to remain on the platform without their&nbsp;consent.</p><p>This week the service <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/iraq-unblock-telegram-app-platform-responded-security-requirements-statement-2023-08-12/">was restored</a> following conversations with Telegram, which complied with the ministry’s requests.</p><p>The situation in Iraq demonstrated just how quickly the basic web services people rely on can be switched off and on, stifling communication. With NymConnect, citizens can always access Telegram via the Nym mixnet no matter the state of the political situation. Here’s&nbsp;how:</p> Privacy-enhanced Telegram <p>This was not the first time Iraq has banned applications or cut the internet. During the 2019 protests, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/03/internet-down-across-iraq-third-day-protests">Iraq banned applications such as Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp, while internet access was also shut down to curtail organisation and prevent reporting</a>. The Iraqi government has advanced its technological capabilities over the years, and this has been used to <a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/study-shows-extent-of-iraq-internet-shutdown-and-social-media-restrictions-during-protests-zPyXjzAE">suppress&nbsp;dissent</a>.</p><p>The purpose of the following manual is not to promote Telegram but so citizens can use it with the Nym mixnet if they wish to, should a situation like this occur&nbsp;again.</p><p>NymConnect is a one-click interface enabling you to privacy-enhance everyday applications by running them through the Nym mixnet. This privacy-enhances Telegram at the network level and allows users to access the application from locations like&nbsp;Iraq.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/element-matrix-over-the-nym-mixnet-private-decentralised-and-secure-messaging-ac7f47bc47af">Element (Matrix) over the Nym mixnet: private, decentralised and secure messaging</a></p> Configure Telegram with NymConnect on&nbsp;desktop:   Download and install <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>. For more releases, check out <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tags">Github</a>. NymConnect is available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS. On Linux make sure NymConnect is executable. To do this, open a terminal in the same directory and&nbsp;run:   chmod +x ./&lt;YOUR-NYM-CONNECT-VERSION&gt;.AppImage    Start NymConnect  <p>Telegram is added to NymConnect by&nbsp;default.</p>  Click connect — the host and port will now be displayed.  Open Telegram’s proxy settings.  <p>Linux: Telegram -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Connection type -&gt; Use custom&nbsp;proxy</p><p>MacOS: Telegram -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Data &amp; Storage -&gt; Connection Type -&gt; Use custom&nbsp;Proxy</p><p>Windows: Telegram -&gt; Settings -&gt; Data and Storage -&gt; Use&nbsp;proxy</p>  Add a proxy with the Add proxy&nbsp;button.  Select SOCKS5 and make sure the port details are the same as those generated by NymConnect. Alternatively, follow this link: <a href="https://t.me/socks?server=127.0.0.1&amp;port=1080">https://t.me/socks?server=127.0.0.1&amp;port=1080</a>  Save the proxy settings in Telegram.  <p>Telegram is now running through the Nym mixnet and is privacy-enhanced!</p><p>This allows you to connect from regions which have blocked Telegram.</p><p>Note: if you remain idle on Telegram for a while you might lose connectivity and your messages might not get through via the SOCKS5 proxy. If that happens, reconnect NymConnect and reset the proxy&nbsp;again.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/how-to-use-telegram-in-iraq-with-nymconnect-106a3b8dd050">How to use Telegram in Iraq with NymConnect</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Key takeaways 



 
 NFTs derive their value from the utility they provide, rather than having an inherent value 



 Utility in NFTs can come in many forms, such as digital art and collectibles, memberships and access, loyalty rewards, asset ownership, and more 



 The value of an NFT is affected by (changes) in the value of the underlying utility. As the utility evolves, the value of the NFT may fluctuate, emphasising the importance of assessing long-term viability and potential growth 



 The ecosystem in which an NFT resides is a key contributor to its success or failure 
 



<p>In the ever-changing world of digital assets, there’s a simple truth: NFTs without a purpose are basically worthless. As NFTs continue to make waves and redefine ownership, one key factor sets apart the impactful from the forgettable – utility. Just like a strong foundation supports a tall building, utility gives NFTs a solid footing, turning them from a short-lived hype into powerful tools for creativity, connection, and progress.</p>



<p>In this article we will take a look at the different types of utility an NFT can have and how this contributes to the value of an NFT.</p>



 Understanding NFTs and their characteristics  



<p>To understand what gives an NFT value it is important to first take a look at what NFTs are exactly. In essence, an NFT is nothing more than a certain token on a certain blockchain that holds some data. This token can be sold, held, and traded, and whatever data it holds is up to its creator. This should make it obvious that the NFT itself has no inherent value. Its value comes from the utility the creator or community attaches to it.</p>



<p>But what does utility mean in this context? It means that the NFT should give the holder the ability to do something with it in a specific ecosystem, ranging from utility in a big metaverse to utility in a small restaurant. And the specific utility can be very broad as well, ranging from the ability to use a tokenised in-game item in a certain game, to gaining exclusive access to a certain event. And since everything is easily verifiable and accessible on a blockchain, anybody or any ecosystem can add utility to (a certain set of) NFTs at any time. Tomorrowland NFT holders could for example get special discounts on Lollapalooza tickets. This ability to add a diverse range of utilities to an NFT, along with easily verifiable ownership and their transparent nature has opened up many opportunities.</p>



<p>Now you have a better understanding of what gives an NFT value and what utility in an NFT context means, let’s take a look at different kinds of utility that can be attached to an NFT.</p>







 Different types of NFT utility  



<p>As already mentioned, NFTs can get their value from a variety of different types of utility. We have summarised the 4 main types of NFT utility and will describe each of them below:</p>



 
 Ability to collect  



 Providing access 



 Rewarding loyalty  



 Asset tokenisation 
 



 Ability to collect 



<p>One of the key ways NFTs gain value is through collecting and owning digital art and collectibles. It’s a lot like the joy people get from collecting physical things, whether it’s art, cards, or other treasures. But with NFTs, there’s a modern twist – they live on the blockchain. Think of it like owning a piece of digital art that’s securely stored online. This similarity brings a similar kind of fun – the excitement of collecting, the satisfaction of completing a set, or having something really unique. Plus, NFTs can also be seen as investments, with their prices going up and down over time. And, there’s a social aspect too. Collectors can connect with each other, just like people who share a love for collecting physical items.</p>



<p>The blockchain part makes digital collecting even cooler. Even though you can’t hold NFTs like physical objects (although you can display your NFTs in a digital frame!), you can easily prove they’re real, trade them with others from anywhere in the world, and even use them in different online places, like games. Furthermore, the digital world opens up new opportunities. It gives you a chance to do things with your collectibles that would not be possible in the ‘real world’, like combining and staking your collectibles.</p>



<p>In some cases, an NFT can also represent a digital twin of a physical and tangible item, further blurring the boundaries between the digital and physical worlds. However, we will explain this further in the asset tokenisation section below.</p>



 Providing access 



<p>Another way NFTs bring value is by providing access. This can be access to anything, ranging from access to a certain membership, to a certain subscription, or perhaps access to exclusive events or experiences.</p>



<p>These kinds of NFTs come in various shapes and sizes, ranging from membership <a href="https://nft.tomorrowland.com/membersclub">NFTs offered by the famous Tomorrowland festival</a>, which give holders access to exclusive raffles, tours, festival tickets, and more, to <a href="https://www.nftboxes.io/">NFT subscription boxes which give holders special NFTs </a>on a monthly basis. Another great example are the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which essentially serve as entry tickets to the BAYC ecosystem.</p>



<p>Within this category of NFTs the specific utility that an NFT offers varies a lot depending on the party offering the NFT. However, it always boils down to specific access in a certain way.</p>



 Rewarding loyalty 



<p>Unlike NFTs focused on providing utility by providing certain access that are typically bought, loyalty reward NFTs are earned, typically through ongoing engagement. The utility lies in the added value they bring to holders’ experiences, creating a sense of exclusivity and pride among the loyal community. And for businesses, it is an innovative way to <a href="https://zaisan.io/web3-improve-customer-loyalty-travel-industry/">leverage web3 technologies to increase customer loyalty</a>.</p>



<p>The adoption of NFTs for loyalty rewards introduces numerous advantages over traditional loyalty programs. Unlike conventional loyalty schemes that are often limited to a single company, NFT-based loyalty programs have the potential to facilitate collaborations between multiple businesses. For example, multiple businesses in a certain area, or various businesses in the same industry. This opens the door to more diverse and appealing rewards that can be redeemed within a broader ecosystem, further enhancing customer loyalty and satisfaction.</p>



<p>Moreover, NFT loyalty rewards bring a higher level of flexibility. Unlike traditional loyalty points or perks, NFTs are tradable assets, enabling customers to access a marketplace where they can buy, sell, or exchange rewards. This feature empowers customers to maximise the value of their loyalty programme participation. Unwanted or duplicate rewards can be converted into money or points, granting customers greater control over their loyalty benefits.</p>



<p>With increased adoption of NFTs in loyalty programs, customers are set to enjoy richer, more personalised experiences, while companies benefit from heightened brand loyalty and deeper customer relationships. And in terms of utility, the better the rewards, the greater the utility of loyalty reward NFTs for customers and companies alike.</p>



 Asset tokenisation 



<p>The last type of utility is by far the broadest category and it refers to the ability to tokenise any asset, either physical or digital, and tangible or intangible. This asset usually already has a certain type of utility, but by using NFTs to tokenise them they get even greater utility.</p>



<p>We will take a deeper look at how that works and what is possible. It is important to first understand the difference between the tokenisation of an asset using fungible tokens, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Let’s take a hotel as an example. Let’s say you want to tokenise the hotel rooms of a hotel, and want token holders to receive part of the revenue that these hotel rooms generate. One of the ways in which that could be done is using fungible tokens. In this case you could create a certain amount of tokens, for example 1000, and then every token would receive 1/1000 of the total revenue from the hotel rooms. This is an example of using fungible tokens to tokenise something.</p>



<p>Another way in which this could be done is by tokenising each specific room. In this case, every token would be unique and represent a specific room in the hotel. Each token would then earn (part of) the revenue generated by the room represented by the NFT they hold. This is an example of using non-fungible tokens to tokenise something, and what we will focus on in this section.</p>



<p>The utility of tokenised assets extends far beyond their non-tokenised counterparts. By leveraging NFTs, these assets can unlock numerous advantages, such as fractional ownership, granting more people access to valuable assets, increased liquidity as they can be easily traded on various marketplaces. As well as heightened transparency through the immutable nature of the blockchain, and reduced transaction costs compared to traditional intermediaries. And in addition to these points, the underlying asset, as well as any rights or claims tied to the NFT, are of course key in determining its value and utility.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>NFTs have emerged as a game-changer in the digital world, thanks to their wide applicability. Furthermore, their value lies in their utility, and this utility can be anything, ranging from the ability to collect to providing access to a wide range of experiences, subscriptions, and memberships.</p>



<p>In the ever-evolving NFT landscape, the value of these digital assets hinges on the ecosystem in which they reside. A focus on tangible utility and long-term viability is critical to weather market fluctuations and ensure sustained success. As the market matures, NFTs continue to expand into new industries, creating unique opportunities for creators, collectors, and businesses.</p>



<p>The transformative potential of NFTs is boundless, offering novel ways to interact with and monetise digital content, democratise ownership of valuable assets, and to foster deeper connections between brands and their customers. As time moves forward, the fusion of creativity, technology, and utility in the NFT space promises to reshape ownership paradigms and unlock endless possibilities in the digital age. Embracing this transformative potential, we step into an era where NFTs redefine value, ownership, and the way we engage with the digital world.</p>

By utilizing blockchain technology, DeSci seeks to improve scientific institutions and processes.</p> <p>The conversation with pioneers Boris Dyakov and Mikey Fischer sheds light on the vast potential of DeSci and its ability to transform scientific progress. It goes beyond mere improvement, presenting a paradigm shift in the way science is conducted. The second conversation with Alok Tayi of VibeBio illustrates a fascinating use case for using DeSci to solve diseases that are underserved in TradSci.</p> <p>DeSci envisions open and modular scientific data, akin to the accessibility of financial tools in the blockchain world. Additionally, the emergence of DAOs in DeSci brings opportunities for capital allocation and funding clinical trials. Join us on this exploration of the frontier of Scientific Progress, where traditional and decentralized science collide.</p> <p>------ Timestamps</p> <p>0:00 Intro 1:30 Scientific Progress</p> <p>5:30 BORIS &amp; MIKEY 8:50 Overcoming TradSci 13:00 Open Science 16:25 VitaDAO 19:00 What is DeSci? 23:23 Bullish on Science 28:30 Onboarding Scientists 34:00 The New Infrastructure 35:00 AI and Science</p> <p>43:00 ALOK TAYI 44:10 Vibe Bio 47:00 The Long Tail of Disease 52:00 Inflection Points 54:00 Solving Disease 59:45 The Power of DAOs 1:07:45 Governance and Structure 1:11:30 The Crypto Value Add 1:14:00 Regulation 1:19:00 A New Primitive</p> <p>------ Resources</p> <p>Boris Dyakov https://twitter.com/BJ_Dyakov?s=20</p> <p>Mikey Fischer https://twitter.com/0xMikeyF?s=20</p> <p>Alok Tayi https://twitter.com/aloktayi?s=20</p> <p>DeSci Ethereum Foundation https://ethereum.org/en/desci/</p> <p>Gitcoin DeSci Fund https://bounties.gitcoin.co/grants/5105/the-decentralized-science-community-fund</p> <p>Vibe Bio https://www.vibebio.com/</p> <p>------ Not financial or tax advice.

<p>The Web3 ecosystem almost unanimously agrees on the benefit of users <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/is-privacy-a-human-right-philosophy-economics-legality/">preserving their privacy</a> while retaining permissionless access to distributed ledger technology. </p><p>This shared understanding, however, tends to face an equally strong pushback (particularly from regulatory authorities) when we are reminded that privacy, without checks and balances, can become a shield for illicit activities. Indeed, the purpose of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency is not to enable criminal actors to surpass Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) regulations or to find a way around sanctions. Rather, permissionless tools are preferred by the Web3 ecosystem based on its initial ideology, centered on the pursuit of individual freedoms and the attempt to decentralize currency and eliminate intermediaries on the Web.</p><p>For most people, privacy and compliance seem to be at odds. However, the latest technological advances, such as zero-knowledge proofs, are paving the way for innovation. Combining these technologies with an approach based on <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ZK disclosures</a> and decentralizing access to compliance, Panther is pioneering privacy-preserving access to DeFi while enabling new compliance mechanisms. </p><p>Here's how.</p> Understanding risks and challenges<br> <p>To avoid a scenario where a malicious actor can exploit the protocol to commit crimes, it's important to first understand the different regulations, their purpose, and the risks a privacy-preserving solution needs to address.</p><p>Some of the most important regulations are:</p> Conceptualizing a solution<br> <p>Considering the difficulties in developing a decentralized solution that preserves privacy and enables compliance, Panther designed an approach that utilizes three essential components. These elements collectively form a pathway to achieve compliance by leveraging the protocol's zero-knowledge characteristics.</p><p>Panther's solution is based on:</p> Third-party compliance vendor integrations <p>Panther has built a system that retains neutrality by integrating compliance providers that accept multiple types of verification. These systems are called "multi-compliance vendors" as they allow users to choose from various compliance providers while retaining a decentralized approach. </p>At v1, there will be just one verification level available for all users.<p>The <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/dao-and-decentralization/panther-dao?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther DAO</a> has been commissioned to select a multi-compliance vendor that aligns with its interests, a discussion taking place in Panther's <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">forum</a>. When integrating these providers, the following requirements are taken into consideration:</p>  Ability to blacklist PEPs or newly flagged individuals based on unverified identities.  Blacklists for verified EoAs.  Ability to perform checks to create an "allowlist" that works on- and off-chain.  Preferably, maintaining an on-chain verification list through oracles/smart contracts.  Performing validations at deposit and withdrawal.  Optionally, allowing users to register multiple addresses. This is suggested so that users can break the on-chain link between their transactions by withdrawing and depositing from different addresses.  Optionally, using a zero-knowledge proof to allow users to create new accounts once they have passed verification.  <p>Within Panther's solution, compliance providers need to be able to process users' data without the protocol learning it, proving a user's ownership of their wallet and giving them a zero-knowledge proof that attests to the validity of their statements. This allows users to access Panther but maintains the protocol's neutrality. The diagram below exemplifies this process: </p>Panther's flow for user verifications. zAccounts<br> Once they complete the verification process with a multi-compliance vendor, users can create a zero-knowledge zAccount.<p>Within Panther, users are identified through their <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/zaccounts?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAccount</a>, a concept similar to a bank account in that it englobes all of a user's transactions within a single reference point. zAccounts attest to users' compliance verification while retaining zero-knowledge properties. In other words, they prove that a user has passed verification (and the type of verification passed), but they do not store any private information about users.<br></p><p>As you saw in the diagram above, Panther is interested in allowing users to have multiple accounts for withdrawals and depositing, all of which would be connected to their zAccount. This would prevent users from creating obvious, observable on-chain links between their public wallets and zAccounts.</p> Zones <br> When creating a zAccount, users are onboarded onto a Zone with particular specifications.<p>Although they primarily serve a different purpose (which will be covered in an upcoming article), <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zones</a> also play a part in the design of Panther's compliance integrations.</p><p>This is because Panther's overall compliance solution covers multiple Zones. Zones are logical partitions of liquidity within Shielded Pools, each managed by a different ZM (<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/zone-managers?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zone Manager</a>). ZMs can determine what compliance information their Zones require from users and control the integration of specific compliance vendors into their Zones to fit their particular goals.</p><p>The requirements ZMs set for users, the types of verifications these users undergo, and other factors related to Zones also influence users' transaction limits, the types of movements they're allowed to do, and other variables. As such, Zones are also vital in Panther's design to enable compliance.</p> Conclusion <br> <p>With a first-of-its-kind approach to zero-knowledge DeFi access with enabled compliance, Panther attempts to create a new approach to DeFi <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/start-here/who-is-panther-for?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">for institutions and retail users alike</a>. The protocol's unique architecture offers a comprehensive solution for regulated entities to function in the DeFi space while remaining neutral at a protocol level.</p><p>Panther has also given much thought to flexibility, enhancing the possibilities for users and Zone Managers. The protocol is committed to aligning the needs of users, regulators, and institutions in the DeFi space. Its vision puts users in control of who views their data while remaining able to comply with regulations, two characteristics previously never combined in the DeFi space.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

Each component of the Ethereum roadmap has deeper frontiers than what you may be familiar with. 4844, PBS, these are just the first stops on a longer track of Ethereum’s Sci-Fi roadmap.&nbsp;</p> <p>Other areas Justin, Tim, and David explore statelessness, how VCs are subsidizing Ethereum L1 R&amp;D efforts, enshrined rollups, how all of this stuff leads to Ethereum needing fewer and fewer honest actors to work trustlessly, what quantum computing has to do with the Ethereum roadmap, trustless mempools and so much more.&nbsp;</p> <p>----- 🏹 Airdrop Hunter is HERE, join your first HUNT today <a href="https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT">https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT</a></p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE <a>⁠https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2</a>&nbsp; ⁠</p> <p>🦊METAMASK PORTFOLIO | MANAGE YOUR WEB3 EVERYTHING ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/MetaMask">https://bankless.cc/MetaMask</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a>&nbsp; ⁠</p> <p>🛞MANTLE | MODULAR LAYER 2 NETWORK <a href="https://bankless.cc/Mantle">https://bankless.cc/Mantle</a>&nbsp; ⁠</p> <p>👾POLYGON | VALUE LAYER OF THE INTERNET <a href="https://polygon.technology/roadmap">https://polygon.technology/roadmap</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/Toku">https://bankless.cc/Toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 5:50 Ethereum Roadmap Completion 8:30 Immediate Dev Priorities&nbsp; 9:50 Danksharding &amp; Rollups as 1st Class Citizens &nbsp; 11:50 Why Prioritize L2s&nbsp; 14:50 Snarkifying the EVM&nbsp; 17:39 Enshrined Rollup Use Cases &nbsp; 20:00 EVM to zkEVM 24:48 Summary So Far&nbsp; 27:15 EIP-4844&nbsp; 28:25 Proposer-Builder Separation 37:37 MEV Burn 40:38 Statelessness&nbsp; 43:33 Cryptography vs. Crypto Economics&nbsp; 45:00 Quantum Mechanics 50:25 Statelessness Ethereum Unlock 53:10 Cryptography &amp; Sustainability&nbsp; 55:55 Closing &amp; Disclaimers&nbsp;</p> <p>----- RESOURCES</p> <p>Justin Drake&nbsp; <a href="https://twitter.com/drakefjustin">https://twitter.com/drakefjustin</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Tim Beiko <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko">https://twitter.com/TimBeiko</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>Ethereum Discord&nbsp; <a href="https://discord.gg/CetY6Y4">https://discord.gg/CetY6Y4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

 The Last 12 Months of Aztec&nbsp;Grants <p>It has been almost a year since Aztec Labs formally announced the first iteration of the Aztec Grants program, and since then, a lot has happened.</p><p>Aztec Labs has been running full-steam ahead towards building the Aztec rollup, a programmable zkRollup supporting both public and private smart contract execution. The Noir programming language has continued to improve on tooling, developer experience, and functionality. And the developer community around our ecosystem has grown significantly — in fact, we were named the fastest growing developer community earlier this year by Electric Capital’s <a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork/status/1655558182302007296">Developer Report</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, the Aztec Grants program has funded over 50 independent contributors across our ecosystem. Before announcing the next wave of grants, we wanted to celebrate some of the grantees who have been working alongside us for the last 9 months and the projects they have been building&nbsp;towards.</p> Celebrating Some Recent Aztec&nbsp;Grantees <p>Many grantees are independent developers or small teams of independent devs. Here are some of the projects that they’ve been working&nbsp;on:</p><p>Halo2 Backend for&nbsp;Noir</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/Mach-34">Mach34</a> team and <a href="https://github.com/Ethan-000">Ethan000</a> are developing an additional proving <a href="https://github.com/Ethan-000/halo2_backend">backend for Noir</a>. As a reminder, Noir is proof system agnostic, so this backend will allow for the verification of Noir circuits using the Halo2 proving backend. The version that is being worked on is the Axiom and PSE version — not to be confused with the original Halo2 proving system developed by the zCash&nbsp;team.</p><p>One additional thing to note is that some of you may recognize the Mach34 team from their work on <a href="https://github.com/Ian-Bright">BattleZips</a>! BattleZips is a set of implementations of the game Battleship in various ZK languages, intended to demonstrate how a web3 app can be built in a way that’s comparable in usability/performance to a web2 application. If you’re interested, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWACGbvIsEgnR2aUCr9i-PpmTVhF5Zuik">BattleZips-Noir video tutorial&nbsp;series</a>.</p><p>DarkSafe Module</p><p><a href="https://github.com/colinnielsen">Colin Nielsen</a> is building DarkSafe, a Gnosis Safe module which allows for private multi-sigs using Noir’s secp256K1 signature verification, Merkle Tree membership proofs, and Gelato&nbsp;relays.</p><p>This Dark Safe module is intended as a proof-of-concept, but this signature verifier could be a simple module in Gnosis’ API — any Safe could install this module as a plug-in, and have this as a way to sign transactions from their&nbsp;Safes.</p><p>Ethereum Storage&nbsp;Proofs</p><p>Aragon ZK Research (AZKR) and Aztec Labs jointly participated in <a href="https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint/3954">the NounsDAO proposal</a> and won the proposal to implement a <a href="https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/noir-trie-proofs">private voting MVP</a> for <a href="https://nouns.wtf/">NounsDAO</a> using Storage Proofs. While Aztec led the research to unlock these proofs in Noir, AZKR focused on designing and implementing the voting solution using the&nbsp;proofs.</p><p>Aztec donated Aztec’s portion of the winnings to the <a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork/status/1654471030310834179?s=20">Gitcoin ZK round</a>, and we ultimately funded AZKR with an additional grant to generalize the work that’s being done around private voting for NounsDAO (detailed above) into <a href="https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/noir-trie-proofs">more general libraries</a> that can be used by other projects.</p><p>Dark Forest Circuits in&nbsp;Noir</p><p>The <a href="https://zkga.me/">Dark Forest</a> strategy game, developed by 0xParc, is one of the most well-known zero-knowledge projects that exists today. Originally written in Circom, it’s a major Schelling Point for early ZK enthusiasts.</p><p>Aztec has funded <a href="https://github.com/SleepingShell/darkforest-noir">SleepingShell</a>, an independent developer within the Noir community, to complete the re-write of Dark Forest circuits in&nbsp;Noir.</p><p>Noir Implementation of Semaphore</p><p><a href="https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/">Semaphore</a> is a proof-of-membership protocol developed by the Ethereum Foundation’s PSE group. Semaphore can be used to anonymously prove that individuals are part of a group. Semaphore is used across the ZK landscape for projects building private identity, authentication, governance, and social applications. The goal for this project is to reach feature-parity with the Semaphore CLI.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/siosw">Simon Oswald</a> and <a href="https://github.com/velkoskis">Stefan Velkoski</a> were formerly part of the <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-nightfall-mainnet-decentralized-private-transactions-for-enterprise">Polygon Nightfall</a> team. They have extensive Circom experience from their time at Polygon, where Simon was a core contributor to Polygon Nightfall’s zero-knowledge circuit infrastructure.</p><p>Noir Puzzles</p><p><a href="https://www.rareskills.io/">RareSkills</a> provides educational bootcamps to help teach programming languages related to crypto. The company has <a href="https://github.com/RareSkills/noir-puzzles">applied its puzzle format to&nbsp;Noir</a>.</p><p>Other Grants</p><p>Finally, since the mentions above are a non-exhaustive list of projects built over the last few months, we also wanted to share the repositories of some other projects from our recent wave of grants. This list is also by no means inclusive of all projects we’ve funded over the last 9 months but should still give you an idea of the types of projects we are aiming to&nbsp;fund.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/shuklaayush/noir-bigint">BigInt library</a>  <a href="https://github.com/0xrishabh/zkPic">zkPic</a> (inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@boneh/using-zk-proofs-to-fight-disinformation-17e7d57fe52f">Using ZK Proofs to Fight Disinformation</a>)  <a href="https://github.com/seugu/Noir-MiMCsponge/tree/main">Noir MIMC-Sponge implementation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/onurinanc/noir-bn254">BN254 pairings&nbsp;library</a>  <a href="https://github.com/tsujp/tsujp">Fog of War&nbsp;Chess</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hhamud/tree-sitter-noir">Treesitter Noir</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hhamud/noir-mode">Emacs syntax highlighting</a>   Introducing Aztec Grants Wave&nbsp;3 <p>Now, as our community has gotten larger, we’re seeing more people organically contribute to the language without grants as a motivating factor — <a href="https://github.com/resurgencelabs/signed_int">useful</a> <a href="https://github.com/colinnielsen/ecrecover-noir">libraries</a> are being built for the benefit of the Noir community, <a href="https://hackmd.io/XZX9_pZ8Q1aa_ySDPeQopg">explanatory materials</a> are being written to educate and expand the ecosystem of developers interested in Noir, and projects are springing up in places we <a href="https://github.com/storswiftlabs/python2noir">didn’t expect</a> led by teams we didn’t know&nbsp;about!</p><p>With the third wave of our grants program, we want to keep attracting developers interested in contributing to the Noir language, and we want to provide an avenue for independent developers to get rewarded for work in Noir already in progress or completed. Importantly, we want to make the process as easy and painless as possible.</p><blockquote>In this Grants wave, we are funding retroactive grants for completed and in-progress libraries that benefit the Noir ecosystem and projects built using Noir. This Aztec Grants funding wave is open through the end of the 2023 calendar&nbsp;year.</blockquote><p>If you are a maintainer of a non-Noir-specific project that our developer community uses frequently — like the <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky">Chumsky parser tool</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p">js-libp2p library</a> — a grant could make sense for you. But some more Noir-specific ideas that might be good for a retroactive funding application can be found <a href="https://www.notion.so/aztecnetwork/Aztec-Grants-Wave-3-RFPs-acba57016db048868e5ed07cbf549979?pvs=4">here</a>, including:</p>  JSON Parser — Spec out, design, and/or implement a JSON parser that can handle Noir’s data&nbsp;types.  zkPatreon — Trustlessly and privately unlock token-gated content using Ethereum Storage Proofs in&nbsp;Noir.  Noir Mutator Tool — A mutation testing tool that generates mutated code of Noir programs with injected bugs and verifies if existing tests catch the&nbsp;issues.  KZG Verification Libraries — A library for verifying Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg polynomial commitments in&nbsp;Noir.

<p>Following conversations at Zcon4 in Barcelona, the Zcash Foundation (ZF) and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) are excited to announce that we’ve agreed to move core Zcash protocol work from zcashd to Zebra! 🦓🛡️</p>



<p>Zebra is a brand new Zcash full node implementation written from the ground up in Rust. Both the ECC and ZF teams believe the modern architecture and good engineering in Zebra will provide a safer and more efficient implementation of the Zcash core protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zebra was created by ZF with significant support and assistance from ECC developers, and relies on Zcash core libraries authored at ECC. Both organizations’ teams will collaborate to identify what functionality needs to be added to Zebra to address the necessary use cases, and to encourage and support key users to migrate to Zebra. Zcashd will continue to be supported during the transition, which will take an undetermined amount of time. ECC plans to continue independently supporting core Zcash protocol upgrades, such as its planned implementation of proof of stake, using Zebra.</p>



<p>ECC engineers built the original Zcash full node (“zcashd”) and have maintained and supported it through 69 releases and 6 network upgrades since 2016. This original implementation inherits the Bitcoin codebase and has grown challenging to maintain. Today’s announced transition will reduce the time it will take to deploy new features for Zcash, and allow more engineering time toward wallet SDKs and a transition away from PoW consensus. For ECC, this is part of its strategy of “Decentralize Zcash and Focus ECC”. For ZF, this marks a significant milestone for the Zebra project.</p>



<p>As part of this transition, Zooko at the Electric Coin Company has gifted a zebra suit previously seen on stage at Zcon1, to Jack Gavigan of ZF.</p>

<p>Zebra can now generate block templates, so mining pool operators can use it as a backend for their mining operations. We have successfully mined blocks on Testnet using block templates generated by Zebra (with a <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/s-nomp">fork of s-nomp</a> acting as a mining pool) but didn’t have any hash power to mine blocks on Mainnet. We would therefore like to invite any mining pool operators or solo miners to try Zebra and let us know on <a href="https://discord.gg/na6QZNd">our Discord</a> or the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/adding-mining-related-functionality-to-zebra-getblocktemplate/42619">Zcash Community Forums</a> about how it performs (and whether their profits have increased!).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Brief Technical Background 

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Zebra implements the <a href="https://zcash.github.io/rpc/getblocktemplate.html">getblocktemplate</a> RPC together with its associated RPCs. You can find the instructions for mining in <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/mining.html">The Zebra Book</a>. In a nutshell, you need to compile Zebra with the getblocktemplate-rpcs feature flag and adjust the config file to suit your setup. You can find the recommended system requirements <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/requirements.html">here</a>. The Zebra Book also contains other useful details. For example, you can enable <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/metrics.html">metrics</a> via Prometheus and Grafana.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>With each Zebra release, along with our regular <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/zfnd/zebra/tags">Docker images</a>, we also publish ones that have the .experimental suffix in their name. These images let you instantly run Zebra with mining support enabled. You can read more about them in the docs <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/mining-docker.html">here</a>. If you’re compiling Zebra yourself, you can enable freshly implemented terminal-based <a href="https://zfnd.org/experimental-zebra-progress-bars/">progress bars</a> that will let you easily see Zebra’s syncing status and a bunch of other metrics directly from the terminal.</p>

<p>In this video, we delve into the frontier of longevity and the pursuit of living forever. The discussion of longevity sparks different reactions among people, with some rejecting the idea outright, deeming it unnatural or immoral.</p> <p>At Zuzalu, two distinct groups emerged—the Health and Wellness tribe, focused on healthy lifestyles, and the longevity tribe, resembling crypto enthusiasts, passionately researching the silver bullet for eternal life.</p> <p>We explore the two conversations of slowing down aging and accelerating rejuvenation, with a particular focus on the latter. Interviews with Patrick Linden, author of "The Case Against Death," Sergio Ruiz, an epigenetic reprogramming expert, and Michael Greer, founder of the Humanity app, shed light on the socio-cultural reactions, DNA reprogramming, and AI-driven longevity scoring.</p> <p>While the pursuit of longevity faces regulatory challenges, its potential to eliminate diseases and revolutionize healthcare holds transformative power. The quest for extended health spans offers tremendous benefits for humanity's future.</p> <p>------ 🚀Join Ryan &amp; David at Permissionless II in September. <a href="https://bankless.cc/GoToPermissionless">https://bankless.cc/GoToPermissionless</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 STADER LABS | ETHX LIQUID STAKING <a href="https://bankless.cc/Stader">https://bankless.cc/Stader</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE ⁠https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2&nbsp;</p> <p>🦊METAMASK PORTFOLIO | MANAGE YOUR WEB3 EVERYTHING ⁠https://bankless.cc/MetaMask&nbsp;</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum&nbsp;</p> <p>🛞MANTLE | MODULAR LAYER 2 NETWORK <a href="https://bankless.cc/Mantle">https://bankless.cc/Mantle</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>👾POLYGON | VALUE LAYER OF THE INTERNET <a href="https://polygon.technology/roadmap">https://polygon.technology/roadmap</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/Toku">https://bankless.cc/Toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS:</p> <p>0:00 Intro 1:30 Wellness vs Longevity</p> <p>7:00 PATRICK LINDEN 9:30 The Pursuit of Immortality 12:30 We Want Choice 16:30 How Long Would You Live? 23:20 Now is the Time 27:00 Health is Longevity 33:30 Increasing Healthspan 36:30 The Case Against Death 41:40 How to Not Die</p> <p>46:00 SERGIO RUIZ 48:45 Healthspan and Lifespan 52:50 Longevity Research 57:45 Epigenetic Reprogramming 1:05:30 Feeling Young 1:09:30 Longevity Escape Velocity 1:14:30 Challenges and Obstacles 1:18:30 The Economic Case</p> <p>1:28:00 MICHAEL GEER 1:31:50 A Billion Years of Health 1:38:45 Utilizing Technology 1:43:45 Using AI for Health 1:46:15 Good Metrics to Track 1:52:00 Defining Health 1:55:00 The Humanity App 2:01:30 More Users, More Wearables 2:08:45 Get Healthier</p> <p> ------ RESOURCES:</p> <p>Patrick Linden <a href="https://twitter.com/DrPatrickLinden?s=20">https://twitter.com/DrPatrickLinden?s=20</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sergio Ruiz <a href="https://twitter.com/Sergio_A_Ruiz?s=20">https://twitter.com/Sergio_A_Ruiz?s=20</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Michael Geer <a href="https://twitter.com/Geeria?s=20">https://twitter.com/Geeria?s=20</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Case Against Death <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262543163/the-case-against-death/">https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262543163/the-case-against-death/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>VitaDAO <a href="https://www.vitadao.com/">https://www.vitadao.com/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Animal Free Precision Medicine <a href="https://www.afpm.bio/">https://www.afpm.bio/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Humanity App <a href="https://www.humanity.health/">https://www.humanity.health/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p> ------ Not financial or tax advice.

 1. Feature: Making SNARKs more accessible, more auditable, and more widely usable for more developers <p>with Justin Thaler, Sam Ragsdale, Michael Zhu et al </p><p>We recently released two new innovations that can significantly speed up scaling and building applications in web3: Lasso and Jolt, which together represent a fundamentally new approach to SNARK design.&nbsp;</p><p>Why does this matter? So much work over the past few years has gone into increasing the efficiency and usability of <a href="https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.pdf">verifiable computing</a> in general, and SNARKS specifically, to deliver on the promise of trustless distributed systems.&nbsp;At a very high level, <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/snarks">SNARKs</a> — which have many applications both in web3 and beyond — compress arbitrary computations so that anyone can quickly verify that they were done correctly. For crypto and web3, they move expensive computations off-chain and only carry out verification on-chain. </p><p>Lasso and Jolt represent <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/introducing-lasso-and-jolt/">a new paradigm</a> for implementing streamlined zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines) because they avoid the need for circuits that have to be optimized tediously by hand. Until now, building with SNARKs required specialized expertise that very few developers have. But Lasso accomplishes a much more streamlined approach by performing “lookups” [see more on lookup arguments in the posts below] against massive structured tables with less computational waste. This was previously impossible because prior lookup arguments required (super)linear preprocessing or prover time. Meanwhile, Jolt-based VMs are simpler, faster, and more easily auditable.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, Lasso and Jolt help unlock more compute-intensive applications —  allowing many more kinds of applications to be built than are possible now. Importantly, this approach helps make SNARK design more widely usable, and the SNARK toolchain much more accessible to more developers, by allowing SNARKs for existing popular programming languages (not only those designed for the task). Many instructions across different instruction sets are similar, allowing significant code re-use… a hallmark of web3 and open source.&nbsp;</p><p>An analogy here might be to the early days of semiconductor engineering: Before chip design was accelerated and democratized through CAD and a broader ecosystem of tooling, many circuit designs were hand-coded and optimized in a bespoke manner; we are in a similar moment with SNARKs today. And while there is a long way to go to get there, Lasso and Jolt could help set us on that path. Right now, Lasso is 10x faster than existing approaches and should get to 40x once optimized (and beyond, once Jolt is further built). To that end, we welcome more developers and builders to contribute to this body of open source work, which is available to anyone!

Trends: AI &amp; crypto <p>with Ali Yahya, Dan Boneh, Sonal Chokshi</p><p>This week's all-new episode of “web3 with a16z” covers the convergence of two top of mind trends: artificial intelligence/machine learning, and blockchains/crypto. The conversation covers topics ranging from deep fakes, bots, and the need for proof-of-humanity in a world of AI; to big data, large language models like ChatGPT, user control, governance, privacy and security, zero knowledge and zkML; to MEV, media, art, and more. </p><p>The first half is about how AI could benefit from crypto, and the second half on how crypto could benefit from AI — but the thread throughout is the tension between centralization vs. decentralization.&nbsp;We also discuss where the intersection of crypto and AI can bring about things that aren't possible by either one of them alone. Together, the fields of AI and crypto have major implications for how we all live our lives everyday; so this episode is for anyone just curious about, or already building in the space.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/ai-crypto-centralization-decentralization">listen here</a><br><br><br><a href="https://twitter.com/moodlezoup/status/1689761274320637952">builder of worlds</a><br><br>--Sonal Chokshi and a16z crypto teams</p><p>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

 Better utilizing Horizen block rewards to enhance the security of EON network and drive greater growth for the Horizen ecosystem 



<p>HCC has recently submitted ZenIP 42206 which proposes redirecting the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network.&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">Read the full ZenIP 42206</a> 
 



 &nbsp; 
 Why Should We Make This Change? 
<p>The Horizen main blockchain currently has a block reward that’s paid toward 4 different entities:</p>
 
 Miners (60%) 
 Horizen Treasury (20%) 
 Super Nodes (10%) 
 Secure Nodes (10%) 
 
<p>Secure Nodes are No Longer Needed and Currently Causing A Burden</p>
<p>This allocation structure was created prior to Zendoo’s implementation. Zendoo has increased the requirements of mainchain nodes so that the Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen chain. Furthermore, with the <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/upcoming-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">removal of the shielded pools on mainchain</a>, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.</p>
<p>There is a Strong Need for Forger Nodes in EON</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is a strong need for forger nodes in Horizen sidechains for enhancing the security of the network, and for decentralization. The current Secure Node operators are well-equipped to provide this type of support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Timing is Right to Optimize the Allocation of Horizen’s Block Reward</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s necessary to update and optimize the allocation of Horizen’s block reward to reflect and better support recent developments of the project – the current Secure Node reward can be put to better use securing and supporting the EON network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What Will This Change Entail? 
<p>A number of things will happen:</p>
 
 There will be a DAO-controlled address called “EON Forger Subsidies” set up on both EON and the Horizen blockchains.&nbsp; 
 The 10% of the block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes will be redirected to the “EON Forger Subsidies” address on the Horizen mainchain, and held there until both of the following are true:&nbsp;
 
 Forging on EON becomes open to the public 
 A mechanism to automatically forward transfer 10% of the block reward to the EON chain’s “EON Forger Subsidies” address has been added to the mainchain 
 
 
 After the automated forward transfer is set up, there will be an automated distribution of funds based on block forging, with an equal amount of ZEN paid out for each EON chain block forged. 
 All block subsidies will be distributed at the end of each Sidechain Consensus Epoch. 
 The Secure Node tracking service will be deprecated 
 Secure Nodes operators will no longer be eligible to receive block reward allocations but will have the option to choose to migrate to EON to be eligible for forging subsidies. 
 



 The following are more FAQs to address the questions we have received from the community 
<p>Q: Why redirect Secure Nodes instead of Super Nodes?</p>
<p>A: We’ve said from the early days of Horizen that we wanted to dedicate Super Nodes to a special purpose in the Horizen ecosystem. We want to maintain that goal and reserve Super Nodes for a higher value potential use in the future. Furthermore, unlike Super Nodes, the Secure Node hardware requirements are no longer sufficient to support their function on the Horizen mainchain and are causing a burden to the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Will Secure Node operators be able to become node forgers for EON and continue to earn rewards?</p>
<p>A: Yes! Anyone who wants to support the EON network and get rewarded can participate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: How do I become an EON node forger and what are the requirements?</p>
<p>A: Participants who want to run EON forger nodes would have to set them up. Instructions on how to do so and the requirements are forthcoming.</p>
<p>Q: How much reward the EON forgers will be able to earn?</p>
<p>A: We cannot estimate the exact reward amount at this moment. </p>



 What’s Next? 
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Please join the conversation and make this decision with us. We will be hosting a series of town halls on Discord to have live conversations about this decision, but we recognize that it can be difficult to match global time zones. So to ensure that we can include everyone, we will be recording a new episode of the Beyond the Horizen podcast with our co-founder Rob Viglione. We will collect your questions and feedback for the podcast in the coming days. There will also be a community poll to collect votes from the community, please stay tuned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We highly encourage you to read the full <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP on GitHub</a> to get a complete understanding of what this means.

<p>After a 2021 frothy bull market, NFTs are currently experiencing the depression phase of the market cycle. However, despite the fact that only NFT art has truly found its product-market fit, NFTs in general represented the consumerist moment for crypto. In addition, they also provided a solution for tokenising real world assets (RWA) and intangibles, potentially penetrating markets worth hundreds of trillions of dollars.

This article will go over the architecture of Nym and Nyx to clarify what each of these do and how, in combination, they solve some of the hardest problems for providing people with actual privacy — even in the age of&nbsp;AI.</p> Nym: the decentralised, incentivised privacy&nbsp;mixnet <p>The Nym ‘mixnet’ is a decentralised global privacy system that solves one of the core problems of the internet: that traffic patterns are entirely&nbsp;visible.</p><p>Translations: <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82-nym-%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D1%8F%D0%B2%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D1%8F-%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC-%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B5%D1%82-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5-e65794695db1">Русский</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/n4c7e1297de30">日本</a></p><p>Governments and large tech companies able to observe large parts of network traffic can record and analyse traffic patterns, which often reveal more than <a href="https://youtu.be/vaJ4PfebyW8">even the content of a message</a>. These small bits of information are like digital footprints left behind after every online interaction. They don’t mean much in their own right but when collated, they are used to build up revealing user patterns and profiles that can be exploited and deanonymise people.</p><p>To solve this problem, the Nym mixnet encrypts internet traffic into identically looking packets. These packets are sent through three layers of what are called mix ‘nodes’ in a series of ‘hops’ at randomised times and intervals, before finally being reassembled and decrypted on the receiving end.</p><p>The mixnet thereby protects almost any type of internet traffic as it is routed through open networks, making tracking near-impossible for adversaries. The mixnet protects people’s IP addresses and metadata about their given location, the timing of messages, and the kinds of device they are using, as well as communication patterns from observers.</p><p>The Nym mixnet is trustless, decentralised and permissionless.</p><p>‘Trustless’ means that you do not need to trust any aspect of the infrastructure with your data. All content is encrypted in several layers. Each node only knows the next hop in the network and never holds any information that can deanonymise people.</p><p>‘Decentralised’ means that the mixnet is operated independently and collaboratively by node operators and token holders all over the&nbsp;world.</p><p>‘Permissionless’ means anyone can join as an operator or token staker and participate in running the network. Permissionlessness is essential for the network to be truly decentralised as it means there is no centralised authority that can determine who joins as a node operator.</p><p>Although in theory a mixnet could run without a blockchain, it would run into a major problem: in order to know which ‘nodes’ are operating in the network so that it can send traffic through them, something called a ‘directory authority’ is needed. This directory authority helps systems understand which nodes are operational and where traffic can be distributed. But if this information is stored in a single centralised location, it becomes more vulnerable to attack or compromise, and for observers of the network to monitor&nbsp;traffic.</p><p>Achieving a decentralised and permissionless mixnet is no small feat and this is where the Nyx blockchain comes&nbsp;in.</p> What is the Nyx blockchain? <p>With her black robe studded with colourful stars, the ancient Greeks saw the goddess of the nighttime, Nyx, as the precursor to life itself. It’s this celestial deity of umbra and shadows that the Nyx blockchain is named for. And this Nyx blockchain solves a set of key problems for the Nym&nbsp;mixnet:</p>  Ensuring that the mixnet network directory is decentralised and permissionless.  Operating the token economics of the mixnet to incentivise and reward operators for providing privacy instead of grabbing user&nbsp;data.  Facilitating the vesting of the NYM&nbsp;token.  <p>Nyx is a general purpose layer-1 production-ready blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK. It is written to Rust, and compiled to WebAssembly, and mints all NYM tokens. Like Ethereum addresses begin with ‘0x’, all Nyx addresses begin with&nbsp;‘n’.</p><p>The Nyx blockchain is integral to ensuring the Nym mixnet is decentralised and permissionless. And it does so through clever token economic&nbsp;design.</p><p>The Nyx blockchain provides the decentralised directory authority of Nym mix nodes via smart contracts that keep tabs on which mix nodes have bonded to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Read more: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-breakdown-of-the-smart-contracts-that-run-the-nym-token-economics-3a61b4139f95">A breakdown of the smart contracts that run the Nym token economics</a></p><p>Here’s what the process looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>When operators spin up the Nym mixnet code, the software will remain inactive until the operator ‘bonds’ NYM utility tokens via their Nym wallet or CLI. Operators must bond these tokens to actually join the network, route traffic, and ultimately earn&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This ‘bond’ signals a smart contract on the Nyx blockchain that the operator is live on the mixnet. They will then have the chance to be selected to perform work in the mixnet through a selection algorithm that hourly checks the node’s reputation and performance and changes the topology of the mixnet ‘active’ set accordingly. This means the pathways of the mixnet are continuously changing, making it near impossible for an attacker to establish a malicious path of&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>Operators are then rewarded in NYM tokens for the amount of work they have performed. In order to increase their chances of being in the active set, node operators can increase their reputation by attracting stake from NYM token holders, who in return will earn a share of operator&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>No user data ever touches the blockchain. The Nyx blockchain only manages the directory of nodes and their delegations and&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>In summary:</p>  Nym is a mixnet that mixes up and obfuscates user traffic. It is operated by a global system of mix nodes, which route this&nbsp;traffic.  Nyx is a blockchain that runs the smart contracts that manage the Nym token and token economics. The token economics serve as a reputation and reward system and enables a fully decentralised and permissionless directory authority.

And usually the provider has access to your browsing habits, location, and payment details and are prone to data breaches just like any other company, or worse, might sell your information in open data&nbsp;markets.</p><p>The economic pressure to sell people’s data means that the majority of apps, including many VPNs, continue to run a surveillance business model. It is hard to say exactly how big the global market is for personal data. But with the digital ad market worth over 200bn USD, and technology providers like <a href="https://stackdiary.com/zoom-terms-now-allow-training-ai-on-user-content-with-no-opt-out/">Zoom now also selling your data for training AI models</a>, it is safe to say the economic temptation to track you and sell your online behaviour, relationships and profile continues to hold sway over the majority of apps and services.</p><p>The first step towards a VPN that provides actual privacy is therefore to ensure the economic incentives rewards privacy rather than tempting operators to pry. This is the primary function of the <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-cryptoecon-paper.pdf">NYM token economics</a> — to establish an anti-surveillance business model. And soon, the NYM token economic rails will also support a Nym VPN so that consumers will have access to actual&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The Nym core team is working on four remaining steps to launch the first major consumer product to run on the Nym mixnet: a high speed, trustless and decentralised VPN, paid for via the <a href="https://nymtech.net/token/">NYM token</a>. Read on for a behind the scenes look on the development work that is under&nbsp;way.</p> 1 Project&nbsp;smoosh <p>Growing decentralised infrastructure</p><p>So far, <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">the Nym mixnet</a> has been kept fairly small to ensure highest possible returns for early node operators. But with the launch of the Nym VPN app, the mixnet will require strong coverage of mix nodes all over the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Project smoosh is a nick-name by CTO <a href="mailto:dave@nymtech.net">Dave Hrycyszyn</a> and Chief Scientist Claudia Diaz for the work they are currently doing to “smoosh” Nym nodes so that the same operator can serve alternately as mix node, gateway or VPN node. This requires careful calibration of the Nym token economics, for example, only nodes with the highest reputation for good quality service will be in the VPN set and have the chance to earn higher&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>By simplifying the components, adding VPN features and supporting new node operators, the aim is to widen the geographical coverage of nodes and have significant redundancy, meaning plenty of operators to be able to meet demand. This requires strong token economic incentives as well as training and <a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">support for new node operators</a>.</p><p>In order to support this rapid scaling, Nym is launching Shipyard Academy later this autumn, followed by a second <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-delegations-program-c5ecf320ed12">delegators programme</a>. You can already get involved by <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/nodes/setup-guides.html">setting up a node</a> or <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/how-to-stake-in-the-nym-mixnet-15a28d687e56">staking your NYM tokens</a> on well-performing nodes to earn&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>More information on smoosh token economics coming&nbsp;soon.</p> 2 Speedy&nbsp;mode <p>Control the trade-off between speed and&nbsp;privacy</p><p>One of the primary blockers to adoption of strong privacy infrastructures like Tor is usability and more specifically latency. Unfortunately, there is a very real tradeoff between speed and strong security and privacy. But there is plenty that can be done to optimise in this&nbsp;area.</p><p>Speedy Mode will allow users to control the level of trade-off between speed and privacy they are willing to make. The user will be able to choose whether they want the best possible anonymity the Nym mixnet can offer (at the cost of latency and speed), less privacy but more speed, or a super high-speed option, using the two-hop VPN instead of the full protections offered by the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Speedy mode is currently being tested in the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a> app in preparation for integration into the market-ready VPN&nbsp;product.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Nym R&amp;D and product teams are working heavily on scientific breakthroughs in mixnet optimisation through carefully designed geo-routing, new encryption formats (such as a new, more efficient packet format to potentially replace <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/sphinx-tl-dr-the-data-packet-that-can-anonymize-bitcoin-and-the-internet-18d152c6e4dc">Sphinx</a>) and parameterisation.</p> 3 Anonymous e-cash <p>Pay with tokens, not with your&nbsp;identity</p><p>Another major problem of VPNs, and in fact most digital goods and services, is that the moment you pay for them, you are handing over your name, credit card details and other identifying information. But there is no reason why payments online should be any different from using <a href="https://youtu.be/MsSA1W0B3TE">physical cash</a>. The person in the shop should not have to know your full name, address and financial details, and indeed, a payment provider or bank should not have to know your spending&nbsp;habits.</p><p>The Nym R&amp;D team has made significant progress developing an<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08221"> anonymous offline e-cash</a> system that does exactly this, extending zk-nym work to cover e-cash. And the first use case of this scheme is the Nym VPN and mixnet. You will be able to spend your NYM tokens on bandwidth credentials, which will ensure that your use of the Nym VPN is not connected to your wallet or any other payment&nbsp;method.</p><p>Over the next months, there will be a Sandbox for these offline bandwidth credentials where developers can try out the scheme themselves.</p><p>Meanwhile read up on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08221">anonymous e-cash paper</a> or watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/A92LVO5RxsY">panel presentation</a> with Nym cryptographer Alfredo Rial presenting the scheme to European regulators, lawyers and technologists in Brussels earlier this&nbsp;year.</p> 4 Censorship resistance <p>Censorship is an attack on basic human rights. Controlling or blocking access to information is to stagnate the ability for people and societies to develop and grow. (The Nym Russian community recently highlighted Russia censoring OpenVPN/ Wireguard from mobile operators and this is just the latest example of what seems to be a growing trend towards censorship). The client-side scanning that is being proposed in the UK and EU also presents a danger of mission-creep towards censorship. Censorship resistance is therefore likely to be one of the key selling points for a VPN — to provide continued access for ordinary people to information and services.</p><p>The Nym R&amp;D team is currently working closely with the global Nym Community to <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/CensorshipMeasurements">measure what parts of the world the Nym mixnet is facing censorship</a>. This is a key step in the overall censorship resistance R&amp;D track to ensure global access to the strong privacy protections offered by the mixnet and VPN products.</p><p>To find out more how to contribute to censorship measurements, join the Nym Community channels on <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nym-community:nymtech.chat">Element</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>.</p> The NymVPN&nbsp;app <p>VPN usage was once synonymous with oppressive regimes that stymied or blocked open internet access. But with Apple, Signal and WhatsApp <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/08/whatsapp-could-disappear-uk-over-privacy-concerns-ministers-told">threatening to pull out of the UK</a> in response to <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-cop-in-every-pocket-client-side-scanning-in-the-uk-and-europe-7eeac45e82b5">the possibility of client-side scanning</a>, the demand for VPNs in the UK and the western world is likely to rise rapidly as <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-cop-in-every-pocket-client-side-scanning-in-the-uk-and-europe-7eeac45e82b5">governments continue to undermine privacy and security</a> and companies continue to undermine people’s trust by selling their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The end-game is to have a Nym VPN app that is fast, trustless and decentralised, that can meet the privacy demands of people in these rapidly changing circumstances. And to do so in a way that is economically viable without tempting people to pry. The Nym surveillance-proof business model will enable you&nbsp;to:</p>  use the VPN without fear of your browsing habits being sold behind your&nbsp;back;  pay for the VPN service without compromising your payment details and identity, which in turn rewards operators and stakers to continue providing strong&nbsp;privacy;  take part in the infrastructure itself either as a professional node operator, or simply by staking NYM tokens to operators and earn a share of&nbsp;rewards.   Beyond the VPN — mixnet for any app or&nbsp;service <p>The mission of Nym is to provide digital privacy to all of humanity. The Nym VPN app is the fastest way to achieve this for ordinary people. Meanwhile, the privacy protections of the mixnet are also being made available for integration with other service providers.</p><p>The mixnet addresses a problem that extends across the entire internet: exposed traffic patterns. The Nym SDKs make it as easy as possible to integrate with the Nym mixnet and enable software developers to route their app traffic over the Nym mixnet to provide stronger privacy for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>The aim of Nym is nothing less than protecting the network traffic for all of the internet.</p><p>Be the first to find out about updates and opportunities.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/what-does-it-take-to-build-the-worlds-most-powerful-vpn-d351a76ec4e6">What does it take to build the world’s most powerful VPN?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 V8 Menger — Mainnet  Introduction <p>The Scala community is buzzing with excitement as the countdown begins for the much-anticipated release of V8&nbsp;Menger.</p><p>This upcoming version promises to bring a slew of new features and enhancements that will elevate the user experience and bolster the network’s security and sustainability.</p> Unveiling V8&nbsp;Menger <p>V8 Menger is set to introduce a range of innovative features that will shape the future of the Scala ecosystem. Let’s delve into some of the key highlights.</p> Diardi V2: Enhancing Network Security and Decentralization <p>At the heart of V8 Menger lies Diardi V2, a powerful upgrade that introduces 32 notary miners. These miners are poised to play a pivotal role in fortifying the network’s security and decentralization.</p><p>By harnessing the collective power of these notary miners, Scala aims to ensure the robustness of its infrastructure and the integrity of its transactions.</p> Introducing “Felidae”: Multi Proof-of-Work Algorithm <p>Scala is also proud to unveil a groundbreaking addition to its arsenal: the “Felidae” PoW algorithm.</p><p>This new in-house proof-of-work algorithm is still heavily optimized for mobile/ARM devices while being lighter and faster. It should also help prevent the centralization caused by some&nbsp;miners.</p><p>For those eager to dive into the technical intricacies, a comprehensive overview of “Felidae” is available on the official GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/scala-network/felidae">here</a>.</p> Revamped Block&nbsp;Rewards <p>The approach to block rewards takes a transformative turn with the V8 Menger release. Inspired by the practices of prominent projects like Monero, Scala is implementing an eroding curve for block&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This strategic move aligns with the project’s long-term sustainability goals, ensuring that rewards are distributed in a manner that supports both miners and the overall health of the ecosystem.</p><p>For an in-depth exploration of these features and their significance, readers can refer to the official Medium post&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/menger-v8-specifications-75a8abb9a3c5">here</a>.</p> Mark Your Calendars: Important Dates <p>We have meticulously planned the rollout of V8 Menger, and here are the key dates to remember.</p> August 14, 2023: Official Release of New Executables <p>On this date, users will have the opportunity to access the new executables, marking the commencement of a new era for Scala. Mining, sending, and receiving XLA will be powered by the latest advancements introduced in V8&nbsp;Menger.</p> September 14, 2023: Hardfork and&nbsp;mainnet <p>We understand the importance of a seamless transition. To ensure a smooth upgrade process, the community, exchanges, and mining pools will have one month to migrate to the V8 daemons and applications. The Scala team will be actively engaging with these stakeholders, providing guidance and assistance to facilitate the&nbsp;switch.</p> Your Burning Questions Answered <p>To address common queries, we have compiled a brief&nbsp;FAQ.</p> Is V8 Menger a hardfork? <p>Yes, V8 Menger represents a hardfork. Users are required to install the new executables to access the upgraded&nbsp;network.</p> Do I need to create a new&nbsp;wallet? <p>No, there’s no need to generate a new wallet. Existing wallet addresses and seed words can be seamlessly used to access your&nbsp;coins.</p> What if I don’t upgrade during the transition period? <p>Don’t worry, you won’t lose access to your wallet or coins. However, installing the new executables is essential to regain access to the&nbsp;network.</p> Embracing a Bright&nbsp;Future <p>The Scala community is eagerly awaiting the dawn of the V8 Menger era. These enhancements symbolize a pivotal step forward in the evolution of the network, and the community’s role is integral to its success. As we embark on this journey together, stay tuned for further updates, insights, and exciting developments.</p><p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated community for their unwavering support and enthusiasm. Your commitment fuels our determination to push boundaries, elevate experiences, and carve a remarkable path for&nbsp;Scala.</p><p>Let’s celebrate the upcoming release and collectively shape the future of blockchain technology. Stay engaged, stay informed, and stay empowered. Together, we’re building something extraordinary.</p><p>Thank you for being an indispensable part of the Scala&nbsp;journey!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/v8-menger-mainnet-bca35aa69d63">V8 Menger — Mainnet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Ethereum scaling solutions often resort to tradeoffs, sacrificing security or decentralisation in favour of scalability. However, zk rollups hold the potential of increasing throughput, while also inheriting the layer 1’s security.

<p>In this article, we explore the key concepts and considerations for implementing a DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation) in your organisation. As the DAO landscape evolves, new business models and innovative structures emerge, offering exciting opportunities and unique challenges. We drew insights from experts in the field, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivierrikken/">Olivier Rikken</a>, DAO and Governance Expert, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandreprate/">Alex Prate</a>, co-founder of HyphaDAO, as they shared their knowledge and experience in the LeDg webinar episode: Unleashing the Power of a DAO.</p>



<p>Organisations can explore innovative ways of governance and collaboration. Understanding the core principles and considerations of implementing a DAO is crucial for harnessing its true potential.</p>



 1. Understanding DAOs: a new form of collaboration 



<p>DAOs represent a paradigm shift in organisational structures, enabling collective governance around a shared treasury. Unlike traditional organisations, DAOs empower members with voting power proportional to their contributions, fostering a sense of ownership and shared entrepreneurship. Whether it’s a startup, community, or a political party, DAOs can take various forms, promoting transparency, autonomy, and purpose-driven decision-making.</p>



 

 



 2. Tailoring Your DAO’s Purpose 



<p>Before embarking on the DAO journey, clearly define your organisation’s mission and vision. Assess whether a DAO structure aligns with your goals and values. Consider if you seek collaborative decision-making or quick and efficient top-down governance. As Olivier highlighted, it is important to choose a governance model that suits your organisation’s needs, be it equal voting, reputation-based, or token-weighted.</p>



 

 



 3. Designing the Governance Structure 



<p>Crafting an effective governance structure is paramount to a successful DAO. Determine how members can join the DAO and earn their place, or whether participation requires buying tokens. Address the decision-making process: should it involve the entire community or specialised circles? Assemble a core team responsible for leading the DAO and collaborating with the wider community.</p>



 4. Defining Use Cases for DAOs 



<p>DAOs serve a diverse range of use cases. They can facilitate collective investment in blockchain projects, political movements, social and economic innovations, cultural preservation, education initiatives, and even regenerative projects. The flexibility of DAOs allows organisations to harness collective intelligence, enabling them to thrive in various domains.</p>



 

 



 5. Integrating DAOs with Existing Organisations 



<p>Olivier discussed examples of how DAOs can complement existing organisations and empower their employees. Consider integrating DAOs to foster employee motivation, community engagement, or innovation. Implementing DAOs can also streamline decision-making processes and facilitate global scaling of products and services, attracting talents and ambassadors to your organisation.</p>

 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, implementing a DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation) can revolutionise organisational structures, fostering collective governance and shared entrepreneurship. Integrating DAOs with existing organisations empowers employees, streamlines decision-making, and facilitates global scaling, offering exciting opportunities for innovation and collaboration in various domains. Embracing DAOs can lead to a more dynamic and efficient organisational ecosystem, marking a new era of decentralised collaboration and decision-making. We would name it the era of Organisation 3.0.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>It's the end of the month again. Within this past month, we’ve updated our one-pager and successfully launched our Mining Testnet, among various other initiatives.</p><p>Let’s take a look at everything that happened in the month of July.</p> Tech Updates  Our v1 Testnet is Live! <p>This month, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage0-live/">we announced the official launch of Panther’s Testnet</a>. This major milestone brings us one step closer to our Mainnet release.</p><p>Testing Stage 0 is ongoing, with Stage 1 coming up very soon. Panther will be releasing information on each stage in our <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Testnet stages documentation</a> similarly, on the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Testnet documentation</a> itself we will be compiling all relevant info. For each stage, we will provide users with a series of test cases to execute on the Testnet. Testers are also expected to report on bugs and potential UI/UX improvements.</p><p>Testnet rewards are automated, so the protocol itself will reward users for executing on the provided use cases.</p><p>The following are the different stages of testing that users will undertake:</p><p>Starting from Stage1, testers will be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a dedicated form</a> to provide feedback. Specific steps will be provided in due time.</p> Mining Testnet: Stage 0 Panther's Testnet is now officially live!<p>We've released Stage 0: ZK Batching, the first testing instance directed at miners, a key role in the Panther ecosystem. In this Stage, we’re launching the Panther Miner, a specialized miner designed to interact with a blockchain network. Along with this, we provided more information on the role of Miners, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">which can be found in our documentation</a>.</p><p>Both regular end-users and a tech-savvy group of profoundly involved community members have engaged with this stage. The latter has gone above and beyond, &nbsp;interacting with the docker image and even updating it to circumvent some limitations (well done!)</p><p>So far:</p>  175 addresses have received miner rewards.  10930 batches have been added to the Bus tree (numBatchesInBusTree).  219628 UTXOs were processed in these batches (numUtxosInBusTree).  <p>(Ongoing data from &nbsp;<a href="https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x678D34aA4fc546bA806287a8289FfdAA84681a03?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#readProxyContract">https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x678D34aA4fc546bA806287a8289FfdAA84681a03#readProxyContract</a>)</p>Fetch the latest data from the Mumbai network yourself!<p>Over the first few days of Stage 0 testing, we accumulated data equivalent to what the protocol would typically generate in a few weeks under our projected workload.</p><p>With our data flow target achieved, we switched to mining reward mechanics and sets of parameters that aim to optimize reward distribution and how queues are mined.</p><p>We also updated the Panther Miner to address a bug that prevented the in-browser Miner client from iterating through batches. Here’s a dedicated blog post explaining the update:</p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/introducing-testnet-stage-0-updates/">https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/introducing-testnet-stage-0-updates/</a></p><p>Again, thanks to all for your help in testing!</p> Preparing for Stage 1 <p>With thorough testing from the community on Stage 0, we are getting ready to release Stage 1.</p><p>Some key deliverables pending to launch as soon as they’re done are:</p>  Core circuits for handling UTXOs and zk-proofs.  Final touches to the visual layer.  Final touches to smart contracts.   Shielded Pools: The cornerstone of our protocol <p>Last week, we published an article diving deep onto <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-shielded-pools-the-cornerstone-of-panther-protocol/">Shielded Pools</a> and their relevance to Panther.</p><p>We covered everything from Pools’ reward mechanics, shared protection and liquidity to logic partitions, internal transactions, DeFi access, cross-chain functionalities, and more.

      Keeping an Open-Source Mind         
	By Natalie So	 



Photography: Andrew White



Published August 3, 2023
        After teaching himself to code (and to speak English) online, Colombia native Sebastián Ramírez is building open-source tools to make coding more accessible for anyone, anywhere.      



 
<p>At seven years old, Sebastián Ramírez became a Catholic school dropout. Not because he wasn’t engaged, or didn’t care to learn. It was the opposite: According to his teachers, Ramírez was asking too many questions. As was the case for most Catholic schools in Medellín, Colombia, religion was a large component of the education. To the ceaselessly inquisitive Ramírez, faith was fertile ground for interrogation; unfortunately, his teachers did not think the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day, the director of the school called Ramírez’s parents in for a meeting to inform them that he was being difficult. When his parents got home, instead of reprimanding Ramírez, they congratulated him. “You’re doing great,” they told him. “Keep following your curiosity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 30 years later, this same appetite for digging deeper and seeking answers ultimately led Ramírez to create a tool that he hoped would help make software development easier and more efficient. He built a framework called FastAPI that allows developers to create applications quickly and maintain them easily—and it’s open source, meaning that anyone can use or modify it for free. Today, that “anyone” includes everyone from indie developers, to hobbyist coders using Python for the first time, to engineering teams at Uber, Netflix and Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Ramírez’s original ambition for the framework was much simpler: “I made it to please myself,” he says. FastAPI was the software equivalent of an answer to the burning questions he’d been asking himself in different contexts his entire life: Why is this the way it is? How can I make this simpler? How can I make this faster? How can I accomplish more?&nbsp;</p>



<p>How can I make things better, for me and for others?&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Shortly after parting ways with Catholic school, Ramírez moved with his family to a modest farm in Santa Elena, a small village about 45 minutes outside of Medellín. His parents had decided that homeschooling was a better fit for Ramírez and his younger sister, Estefania.</p>



<p>The farm in Santa Elena was surrounded by mountains and forests. The family kept a vegetable garden, as well as five Weimaraners, a few cats and two goats, one of which belonged to Ramírez and was his responsibility to wrangle at the end of each day. Ramírez’s parents wanted his education to be holistic, practical and hands-on. In addition to their coursework, Ramírez and Estefania learned how to plant trees, build dog houses and fences and install lightbulbs. This upbringing “fostered a curiosity and interest in how things work,” says Ramírez.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a young age, Sebastián had a penchant for making everyday tasks more efficient. He recalls at five years old feeling annoyed while assembling a puzzle with his classmates. They would randomly pick up pieces, trying each one until they found a fit. Ramírez proposed that they evenly distribute the pieces among all the children for systematic testing. Mundane chores like washing dishes or feeding the dogs became opportunities for optimization. The impulse, Ramírez says, largely came from a dislike of routine and boredom. It’s “almost like a phobia,” he says. “If I feel I’m doing something simple, mechanical and repetitive, I just want to make it faster, or automate it.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If I feel I’m doing something simple, mechanical and repetitive, I just want to make it faster, or automate it.”</p>
Sebastián Ramírez</blockquote>



<p>In 1997, when Ramírez was eight years old, he started helping his parents make sales calls for their business, a consulting company that offered personal development courses for business leaders. By the time he was a teenager, the family business, aptly named Grupo Una Familia, had evolved. They hired themselves out for corporate team-building events, where they combined music, jokes and stories into productions that revolved around a company’s core values. Ramírez threw himself into the music production and graphic design, spending hours in a recording studio with their sound engineer, Chengo, peppering him with dozens of questions as he worked. “He used to call me Spongebob because I would always be ‘absorbing’ as much information as I could,” says Ramírez.</p>



<p>By 15, Ramírez decided that Grupo Una Familia deserved its own website. And given his parents’ lack of tech savvy—they still managed clients on paper and communicated via telephone—he’d be the one to build it. And it wouldn’t just be another GeoCities page; he wanted to build out an entire client management system with photo-uploading functionality and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ramírez’s crash course in web design started with free online tutorials. But before long the instructions started to feel limiting—he didn’t want to just copy and paste code. He wanted to understand the way things worked, and he intuited that there was a whole universe of better tools at his disposal. That’s when he discovered open standards, like HTML, CSS, Javascript and XML, and began devouring them (he taught himself English along the way). The possibilities felt endless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studying the standards took time, but Ramírez spent most of his days roaming around the countryside and in the mountains. So he found an old PalmPilot that belonged to his dad and figured out a way to download the standards to the handheld device, hacking together a proto-Kindle of sorts so that he could study wherever and whenever he wanted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At first, the world of open source—code that’s free for anyone to use and modify—sounded too good to be true: “At that point I didn’t know that 90% of all systems in the world were running on open source,” he says. As he learned more, Ramírez became enamored by the philosophy behind open source—the concept of people helping other people. This was something he had been trying to do all his life, helping his parents, his neighbors and his friends be more efficient in what they do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ramírez eventually built the website for his parents. It was as intricate and multi-functional as he had intended. But looking back, Ramírez sees that he failed in one fundamental way: The website wasn’t actually solving the problems that his parents cared about. Using it wasn’t intuitive for them, and it didn’t fit into their workflow. That’s when Ramírez realized that innovation and disruption are not themselves valid raisons d’etre. “They are merely the side effects or results of solving people’s actual problems,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
	
							
			
	 

<blockquote>
<p>“At that point I didn’t know that 90% of all systems in the world were running on open source.”</p>
</blockquote>

 
 



<p>In 2009, when Ramírez was 20 years old, he started experiencing a mysterious pain on his right side. After some scans, the doctors told him he had a cancerous growth the size of a papaya in his chest. Not only that, but the tumor was crushing an entire lung and putting pressure on nearly half of his heart. Ramírez was rushed to the emergency room and started on an aggressive form of chemotherapy. On his 21st birthday, Ramírez asked a nurse to sing him happy birthday while she administered the chemo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cancer diagnosis reconfigured Ramírez’s priorities. Up until then, he had continued to work for his parents’ company, but after months of being tired all the time, struggling to eat and drink and really just surviving, he wanted his problems to be “actually important, and to have an impact on something useful for society.”</p>



<p>Shortly after Ramírez finished treatment, his sister introduced him to a new website for online learning called Coursera. After a year of recovering, Ramírez was invigorated by the idea that someone like him in Colombia could take a course from a top university on the other side of the world. He signed up for classes on algorithms, machine learning, cryptography and artificial intelligence, among others—at one point, he was taking eight courses at a time. Without realizing it, the serial autodidact had created his own college curriculum (an overzealous one, he later admits).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around that time, his brother-in-law asked him to join his machine learning company. Now 23, and despite being armed with a new trove of knowledge from his online courses, Ramírez was reluctant to accept. With no formal education and no college diploma, he says, “I felt a bit lost. I was just some random kid in Colombia.” But ultimately his brother-in-law’s persistence won him over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To his surprise, Ramírez quickly found his place. As always, he was adept at solving problems and eager to help those around him, and he became a go-to resource for his fellow co-workers for his breadth and depth of knowledge. Before long, Ramírez worked his way up to become the director of software development. It was in this new managerial role that the idea for FastAPI started to germinate. He observed the developers he supervised struggling to write code properly and needing to iterate from scratch for every new project. “I was always trying to come up with better ways to structure code, better tools to use,” he says. As had been his modus operandi since childhood, Ramírez took it upon himself to improve this process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the next few years—first in Colombia, and then at a new venture with his brother-in-law in Dubai starting in 2017—Ramírez studied databases, frameworks and various development tools. Each had its strengths, but no single one solved all his problems. Ramírez concluded he had no other choice but to build that tool himself, a realization that brought on a new wave of self-doubt. Despite all of his accomplishments, he still saw himself as “just a nobody from a corner of the world, just a weirdo.” But through his uncertainty, a simple thought persisted: Whatever, I might just try and see what happens.</p>



<p>So Ramírez doubled down on his studies, digging into the structures and connections between relevant web standards, like OpenAPI and the JSON Schema—it was his teenage years redux. Then gradually, Ramírez started building the framework that would become FastAPI.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I just kept thinking I need to do this. I need to build this.”</p>
Sebastián Ramírez</blockquote>



<p>He was still working for his brother-in-law full-time, with nights and weekends devoted to this passion project. “I was just working like crazy,” he recalled later, so much so that he developed a twitch in his eye, and one of his fingers went completely numb. But maladies and all, an intense excitement unlike anything that he’d ever felt kept him completely focused. “I just kept thinking I need to do this,” he remembers. “I need to build this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Christmas Eve 2018, in what he hoped would be a gift to developers around the world, Ramírez hit publish on the first release of his new framework on GitHub.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re waiting in a long line at the bank, maybe the DMV—somewhere reeking of bureaucracy. You fill out a long form while you wait, but halfway through you realize you’ve made a mistake and have to start all over again. When it’s finally your turn, the clerk behind the desk is sleepy and distracted as they check your form—by hand, of course. Ramírez says that this is what building software typically feels like: It’s inefficient, laborious and easy to make mistakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ramírez created FastAPI to simplify and streamline that process. “In FastAPI, you probably wouldn’t be standing in line,” he says. “You would be sitting with a ticket number, the line would go much faster, and the person helping you would be very supportive and attentive. And the form that you’d have to fill out would be very clear.”</p>



<p>This is the analogy that Ramírez uses to explain FastAPI to his parents (and to anyone who needs to Google what API stands for—application programming interface). In essence, it’s a faster, simpler framework for building APIs using Python, the most popular programming language for data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before FastAPI, most of the existing Python frameworks for building software applications were created in the language’s earliest days, before Python introduced a series of new features including “async and await,” which reduced the computing power needed to run an application, and “type annotations,” which enabled code auto-completion. FastAPI leveraged these and other advancements to create a more streamlined developer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike with his parents’ website, this time Ramírez was the end user. He created FastAPI to address the issues that most irked him in his years of building cloud software, prioritizing features of code editors like auto-completion, and in-line error notifications to reduce the amount of text developers need to write and to help them identify bugs before deploying their code.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I wanted things to be explained the way I wished they were explained to me when I was starting.”</p>
Sebastián Ramírez</blockquote>



<p>Typically, technical documentation for tools like FastAPI is sparse, opaque and excruciatingly technical, putting the burden on the individual developer to figure things out. But in a nod to his days learning English from open-source protocols, Ramírez made sure to include extensive documentation for his tool—an in-depth instruction manual for how to use, develop and deploy the framework. “I wanted to explain all the concepts that were necessary, even if they weren’t strictly related to FastAPI itself, because I wanted to teach people everything they needed to know to be able to use FastAPI,” says Ramírez. He even hired a designer to create graphics to help explain some of the tool’s more complex aspects. FastAPI would be intelligible to anyone, even someone in a rural corner of the world without easy access to a technical education who might benefit from a little extra explanation. “I wanted things to be explained the way I wished they were explained to me when I was starting,” he says, recalling an idea once articulated by Guido van Rossum, the inventor of Python: that you primarily write code to communicate with other coders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ramírez’s efforts to make FastAPI accessible and effective have paid off. The technology underpins tools for galaxy simulations and drug discovery, Red Cross disaster management and COVID tracking, human resources management and quantum cloud services, airplane manufacturing and self-driving car applications. Its users include established tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Netflix, as well as early-stage startups. Even the Space Telescope Science Institute, which handles the Webb Space Telescope, uses FastAPI to speed up access to their scientific data. As of 2023, FastAPI is downloaded roughly 800,000 times per day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia partner Lauren Reeder says, “We heard about FastAPI everywhere, from our biggest portfolio companies like Rippling to weekend hackathons. It really spans the gamut.” When she and fellow partner Bogomil Balkansky were thinking about starting a Sequoia Open Source Fellowship, Ramírez was the first name that came to mind. In January 2023, they invited him to be the program’s first fellow.</p>



<p>The fellowship means that, for the first time in his life, Ramirez can focus full-time on his open-source work. At the moment this includes completing an integration with Pydantic v2 (rewritten in Rust for added performance benefits and reduced energy consumption), building in Typer, SQLModel and Asyncer functionality, and writing even more robust documentation for his system. These individual improvements ultimately serve his greater purpose of “building tools that help others build things as easily as possible and that benefit their communities and society in general,” he says. “I want to improve, and keep improving that.”&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Shortly after he first learned about algorithms, Ramírez walked into his mom’s office one day to find her surrounded by stacks of paper. She was at a loss, attempting to sort the hundreds, if not thousands, of sheets alphabetically. Ramírez realized at that moment that the principles behind algorithms didn’t only apply to digital realms; here was his opportunity to use them in the physical world. He decided to help his mom using an analog “merge sort” algorithm, first sorting the papers into smaller, less overwhelming stacks and categorizing those before eventually merging them back into a final pile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was strange for my mom,” he recalls, “but she followed along.” He timed the entire process from start to finish. Within 30 minutes, the papers were stacked in one neat, alphabetized bundle. “At that moment I felt that the things I was learning were very powerful in unexpected ways,” he says. The power lay in being able to create something that helps people achieve their goals, which is the very thing that Ramírez has accomplished with FastAPI. “When you build something that others can use and it’s helping them, that just feels amazing, you know?” says the 34-year-old with a smile. “That’s just the best feeling.”</p>

    <p>Our pursuit for greater accessibility, scalability, and reliability within the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> ecosystem continues to lead us into strategic partnerships. Today, we are thrilled to announce our partnership with <a href="https://wanchain.org">Wanchain</a>, an R&amp;D-focused blockchain interoperability project whose mission is to drive blockchain adoption through interoperability by building fully decentralized bridges that connect the world’s many siloed blockchain networks.</p>
<p>This collaboration will enhance EON’s potential by adding it to the roster of chains that users can bridge their funds to using Wanchain. Wanchain, maker of the blockchain industry’s first public decentralized cross-chain bridge, consists of a sustainable Layer 1 EVM-compatible blockchain and a network of decentralized blockchain bridges connecting nearly 30 public networks, including both EVMs and non-EVM blockchains.</p>
<p>Horizen’s EON chain is a fully EVM-compatible smart contracting platform and the first of many smart contract sidechains on the Horizen ecosystem. By partnering with Wanchain, EON will offer its users seamless cross-chain transactions and interoperability, enhancing the user experience and offering a broader range of functionality. EON’s scalability, interoperability, and Wanchain’s ability to process cross-chain transactions between different public and private chains will create a dynamic, efficient, and inclusive blockchain ecosystem for developers and users.</p>
<p>You can use the following routes to bridge coins to and from EON <a href="https://bridge.wanchain.org">using Wanchain</a>:</p>
 
 EON &lt;&gt; Wanchain (WAN, BTC, LTC, USDC, USDT, XRP) 
 EON &lt;&gt; Bitcoin (BTC) 
 EON &lt;&gt; Litecoin (LTC) 
 EON &lt;&gt; XRPL (XRP) 
 
<blockquote>
<p>“We are excited about our collaboration with Wanchain. As we continue to expand our ecosystem, this partnership will create a plethora of opportunities for users, enabling more fluid transactions across different chains. This step forward perfectly aligns with our mission to facilitate the growth of a permissionless, interoperable, and customizable blockchain ecosystem.”</p>
<p>– Lucy Wang, VP of Marketing at Horizen&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wanchain’s technology will bridge the gap between EON and other chains, creating an interconnected ecosystem. The capacity to perform transactions not only between public chains but also private ones will significantly boost the versatility and utility of the EON platform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Integrating EON into Wanchain’s secure cross-chain infrastructure providea substantial value to developers and users, fostering an inclusive Web3 ecosystem where the next wave of blockchain innovation can prosper. Our work with Horizen is a testament to both projects’ commitment to building secure, interoperable systems.”</p>
<p>– Temujin Louie, VP of Marketing, Wanchain</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/status/eon">EON Alpha</a> is currently live on mainnet and on its public testnet, <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/status/gobi">Gobi</a>. Wanchain’s cross-chain functionality is available on both environments. This partnership is a significant stride towards establishing a diverse and robust Web3 ecosystem, as we anticipate the integration of a wealth of dApps and services in the upcoming months.&nbsp;</p>

 Summary 
<p>Every image and video result in Brave Search is now served by Brave. Users no longer need to choose between Bing and Google for image and video search.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>After several months of development, Brave Search is releasing its own privacy-preserving image and video search that is independent from Big Tech search engines. Users will no longer need to leave Brave Search for image and video search results. Now any Brave Search query can be served directly from Brave’s own index, enabling users to benefit from a fully independent search engine that protects their privacy and is censorship-resistant. Our recently released <a>Brave Search API</a> will also imminently include these image/video results.</p>
<p>This comes on the heels of <a>removing calls to Bing</a>’s search API for images and videos this past May. To bridge the gap between the removal of Bing (which accounted for only 7% of results) and providing our own solution today, we temporarily gave our users the option of an alternate image/video search via redirect to Bing or Google, allowing us to maintain convenient and familiar search habits from within Brave Search. We realize that the redirect option was not popular with some of our users, and thank them for their patience during this transition. This was a temporary decision to help users find results with minimum hassle, while we worked to offer a sustainable, privacy-preserving, and independent image and video search option.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 Context 
<p>Web content searches make up the majority of all search engine results, while image/video search has become fragmented, due to the exponential growth of visual content on the Internet. Increasingly, users are using their favorite social and content platforms to discover visual content—but this comes at a significant cost to user privacy.</p>
<p>Brave Search is private and anonymous, which sets a high bar for image/video search to meet. Whether it’s a matter of personal safety or personal preference, users should be able to discover content without their search engine reporting and profiling those results to a Big Tech company.</p>

 What this means for Brave Search and users 
<p>Image and video search makes Brave Search a more comprehensive search engine while protecting user privacy. With the ability to search for crucial vertical categories such as images and videos directly within Brave, users can now access even more content than before. Additionally, by keeping all searches within the Brave ecosystem, users benefit from increased speed and privacy when compared with the multiple search engines that rely on third-party providers.</p>

 The importance of independence 
<p>Two years ago, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-bing-raises-concerns-over-lack-image-results-tiananmen-tank-man-2021-06-04/">Microsoft Bing was found to serve zero image results for the Tiananmen Square “tank man”</a>. This obviously affected third-party services—such as DuckDuckGo—that rely entirely on Bing’s API for their search results. But it also affected Brave Search because—at the time—we were relying on Bing for image search results. This created both a technical dependency, and also an unintended extension of Big Tech’s censorship.</p>
<p>By serving image/video results directly from Brave Search’s independent index, we can ensure a better check on Big Tech censorship and put our users in charge of their browsing experience.</p>
<p>Technical note: For all search results—text, image, and video—our goal is to offer a great alternative to Big Tech, one that can compete on both quality and independence and serve the right results all the time. However, if we can’t deliver the right result, we also strive to make it easy and intuitive to continue a search elsewhere. Functionally, this means that certain capabilities (such as advanced filters like license type or aspect ratio) will not be immediately available (but will be soon). For now, we believe offering a clear alternative is more important than complete feature parity.</p>

 Brave’s ongoing mission to improve search 
<p>Brave is on a mission to build a user-first Web. That mission starts with the Brave browser and Brave Search. With the release of image and video search, we’re continuing to innovate within the search industry, providing viable and preferable products for users who want choice and transparency in their search for information online. Users can help us by sharing their <a href="https://community.brave.com/c/brave-search/">feedback</a> or by anonymously opting into our <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-">Web Discovery Project</a> to contribute to our search index.</p>
<p>Brave Search is available to everyone at <a href="https://search.brave.com/">search.brave.com</a>, and is also the default search engine in the Brave browser.</p>

 Nym core team returns from EthCC, Nebular and&nbsp;Build Eden Block founder Lior Messika and Nym CEO Harry Halpin at BUILD: Paris. Photo: <a href="https://twitter.com/lior_eth/status/1681717393586896896">Lior&nbsp;Messika</a><p>Most blockchains and dApps, by virtue of being decentralised, suffer from the same layer-0 vulnerabilities: traffic is entirely exposed, leaking metadata that can be exploited.</p><p>The Nym mixnet, however, is a chain-agnostic layer-0 privacy network. This means it can be integrated into any blockchain ecosystem in order to protect peer-to-peer traffic, whether wallets and consensus clients, L2 dApps and L1 chains, or between validators. For this reason, the Nym core team was in Paris for some of Europe’s most important gatherings for the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.</p><p>The Ethereum ecosystem is a Solarpunk ecosystem. And Solarpunks need their Lunarpunk brothers and sisters to ensure the security and refuge offered by the rich depths and shadows of the forest, suggested Nym Devrel Serinko at EthCC. Serinko spoke about what Lunarpunk infrastructures can offer Solarpunk ecosystems, and emphasised that powerful privacy protections are the preconditions, rather than the opposites, to openness and collaboration — before giving a technical breakdown on how to run Ethereum validators over the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>The Cosmos ecosystem is the home of the Nyx blockchain that operates the Nym <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-breakdown-of-the-smart-contracts-that-run-the-nym-token-economics-3a61b4139f95">mixnet smart contracts</a>. Head of PR and Communications Candice Teo presented on why Nym should be the privacy layer for inter-blockchain communications and the success of <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a>. Senior DevRel Max Hampshire was at the Cosmos builders summit, <a href="https://nebular.builders/">Nebular</a>, where he presented how Cosmos projects can build on Nym with the Nym Rust SDK along with a broadcaster for Cosmos chains to use the mixnet. Candice hosted a full day of talks at Nebular and ran a much-needed workshop on improving gender diversity in Web3. And at <a href="https://www.buildoi.xyz/">Build: Paris</a>, CEO Harry Halpin joined a fireside chat with<a href="https://www.edenblock.com/"> Eden Block</a> founder<a href="https://twitter.com/lior_eth"> Lior Messika</a> on the history of the cypherpunk movement, privacy, and where Nym fits&nbsp;in.</p><p>Read on for all the juicy&nbsp;details.</p> <a href="https://www.buildoi.xyz/">BUILD: Paris</a> <p>As part of the BUILD series between VC Eden Block and Novel Labs, Eden Block founder and Nym investor Lior Messika hosted a fireside chat on privacy with Nym CEO Harry Halpin. To an audience of Builders, the two discussed privacy, mixnet, how Nym came about, and the history of the cypherpunk movement.</p> <a href="https://www.ethcc.io/">EthCC</a> Serinko at the Status side event during EthCC. Image courtesy of Adrien Thibault (<a href="https://twitter.com/adrienthibault">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/adrienthibault/?hl=en">Instagram</a>)<p>Despite the bear market, the Ethereum Community Conference was packed to the brim with participants attending a mixture of technical and non-technical content covering everything from security to open finance and privacy. In fact, there were over 20 sessions focused on privacy, demonstrating a real thirst in Web3 ecosystems to resolve the surveillance economy problems of Web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Serinko, developer relations at the Nym core team, presented a well-attended talk at a side event hosted by <a href="https://status.im/">Status</a>. Delving into the philosophical distinctions between the Solarpunk ecosystem of Ethereum and the anonymity of Lunarpunk, he suggested that the privacy Nym offers bridges the two, and discussed how the Nym mixnet can secure Ethereum validators who are vulnerable to surveillance.</p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-lunarpunk-infrastructure-for-securing-the-solarpunk-ecosystem-413916c98123">Check out the full video and write-up&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Serinko also joined the ‘Importance of Privacy and Security of Autonomous Communities’ panel, along with Corey from <a href="https://logos.co/">Logos</a> and Spencer from <a href="https://spearbit.com/">Spearbit</a>. The wide-ranging conversation covered a lot of ground but among the talking points, Serinko outlined the difference between projects that merely talk up privacy as part of their marketing hype and those that live it as their ethos. The internet is broken and, in times when surveillance is hegemonic (hint: right now), history shows that healthy communities need anonymity and privacy to protect themselves and progress freely without&nbsp;fear.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCCKVfNm-WE">Check out the discussion in full&nbsp;here</a>.</p>Candice speaking at the Cosmos on y va side event at&nbsp;EthCC<p>Meanwhile: Head of PR and Communications at the Nym core team, Candice Teo, was on stage to illuminate the audience about the importance of cross-chain functionalities for the success of Cosmos and Web3 in general, at the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cosmos-on-y-va-tickets-666926072837">‘Cosmos on y va’</a> side event. There, Teo discussed Nym integrations, and how cross-chain interactions can occur on the Nym mixnet, bringing metadata privacy to cross-chain functionality.</p><p>Nym can and should be the privacy network layer for inter-blockchain communication, Teo added. Developers will increasingly be conscious of privacy by design as cross-chain transactions drive users and demand, and privacy portability will be key to making this happen. Cross-chain interactions need to be more secure and private, especially for DeFi, and this is where Nym can make it happen. Watch the video <a href="https://youtu.be/fXvu5z29-gU">here</a>.&nbsp;👀</p><p>Teo also joined other Cosmos projects to chat about key takeaways from EthCC and side events in a<a href="https://twitter.com/akashnet_/status/1681635363746467845"> live Twitter Spaces session</a> with Akash&nbsp;Network.</p> <a href="https://nebular.builders/">Nebular</a> Max Hampshire presenting at the Nebular&nbsp;event<p>Cosmos builders and interchain entrepreneurs gathered at the Nebular summit which promised “no boring panels, no shilling” — just technical talks to achieve “Cosmos gigabrain status”. Nym Senior DevRel Max Hampshire delivered on that promise when he gave his Nym + Cosmos: Introduction To Building Privacy-Enhancing Services’ presentation.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/GFnz5tN9zwo?feature=share&amp;t=9025"> Click here to view the video</a> and see how easy it is for Cosmos projects to build on Nym with the Nym Rust SDK. Keep your eyes peeled for a full write-up this&nbsp;week.</p><p>Nym Head of PR &amp; Comms Candice Teo was also not only in attendance but emcee for day two, as well as running and speaking at a workshop titled ‘Moving the needle for women in Web3 and Cosmos’. There, she discussed the representation of women in Cosmos and next steps to take action and close the gender gap in the space. BCG<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-to-unravel-lack-of-gender-diversity-web3"> stats show that Web3 has a gender diversity problem</a>, and the workshop discussed how gender equality is important not only for the philosophy of the ecosystem, but also to envisage a new world in the crypto industry that’s inclusive of the strengths and skills of everyone.<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqBZmUgNSjWB64hLRYft01lUJCbHzT7Qt1KVc_YqoGFNaqUg/viewform"> The Cosmos Cartel, a collective of women working in Cosmos, crafted a commitment declaration which was launched at Nebular</a>, created for projects in the Cosmos ecosystem to&nbsp;sign.</p><p>And that’s a wrap.

<p>The explosion in computing resources over the last decade has made it possible for the extremely complex systems of molecular biology to be simulated in high enough fidelity to begin to produce new materials, new drugs and other important substances. However even with increasingly accurate simulation, chemical development today still remains a highly complex process that requires weeks (or months) of lab effort and millions of dollars to achieve any reasonable results. Moreover, although computational chemistry promises to unlock a new wave of innovation and value, there is still no standardized platform for delivering chemistry, with most companies invested in a fragmented patchwork of various legacy technologies and no one software language to “rule them&nbsp;all.”</p><p><a href="https://www.chemify.io/">Chemify</a> is a programmable chemistry paradigm that runs code on a standard ‘Turing complete’ hardware to make almost any material with a unique robotic system to digitally synthesize any complex organic molecule. This is the concept of ‘Chemputation’ — think computation for chemistry, meaning that a universal chemical programming language to make all of chemistry reproducible is now possible. By turning code into molecules to reproduce all of chemistry, Chemify is analogous to what transistors did for computers — with the potential to be 10–100x cheaper than even today’s state-of-the art chemistry automation. Chemify’s approach is now fully developed and today’s funding will be earmarked for commercially addressing the entire chemical manufacturing and research market, as well as the entire pharma product market, with a number of high value use cases and applications.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>We’re excited about Chemify’s potential to significantly reduce the workload and expense of creating complex organic molecules (for drug discovery automation etc), as well as novel materials, and to allow any company to make any known molecule or material on demand. We believe their technology could also accelerate the discovery of new high value molecules, with many potential use cases (for example the creation of mini-labs capable of making any antibiotic, retroviral, or anti-cancer medication for on-demand custom medications in remote locations). Finally, if their programming language and IDE gains traction among everyday chemists, Chemify’s approach to programmable chemistry, chemputation, could significantly reduce the noise of standards in predictive chemistry and autonomous synthesis.</p><p>We are excited to be backing <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/leecronin">Lee Cronin</a> and the entire Chemify team on their mission to digitize chemistry.

 4.1.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of ZEN 4.1.0 to Mainnet later this September. 
 Pre-release 4.1.0-rc1 will perform network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1313400 which will occur August 8th, 2023 at approximately 10:00 UTC.
 
 Related to <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42204.md">ZenIP-42204</a> to remove shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen Mainchain
 
 Shielding of coinbase transactions will not be possible anymore once the hard fork activates. 
 Coinbase Transactions continue to mature after 100 confirmations of blocks. 
 
 
 The Community Fund, Secure Node and Super Node addresses will be rotated with this Hard Fork. 
 
 
 Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated. 
 An update of s-nomp for mining pools using it will be required for compatibility with 4.1.0-rc1.
 
 requireShielding in the coin configuration will have to be set to false once the Hard Fork activates 
 Coinbase reward addresses for Community Fund, Secure Node and Super Node will change with the Hard Fork 
 
 
 If you are not using s-nomp as your mining pool software please refer to <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/s-nomp/pull/12">this example pull request</a> for the required changes 
 Updated wallets incorporating changes for compatibility will be provided with the Mainnet release in September.<br>

And it’s looking like both the EU and UK will plough ahead with ‘client-side scanning’, endangering the basic right to private communications.</p><p>The encryption-busting legislation in the UK’s <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137">Online Safety Bill</a> is proceeding completely<a href="https://haddadi.github.io/UKOSBOpenletter.pdf"> against the advice of academia</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66028773">business</a>, and <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/news/2023/june/uk-must-protect-global-digital-security-and-safeguard-private-communication/">civil society groups</a>. There is no silver bullet technical solution to prevent harms to children but, as it turns out, client side scanning is highly prone to errors and will do very little to stop the spread of harmful material online. What this technology will do is decrease security on everyone’s devices.</p><p>In response, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/20/uk-surveillance-law-changes-could-force-apple-to-withdraw-security-features">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/whatsapp-signal-threaten-leave-uk-online-safety-bill/">Signal and WhatsApp</a> threatened to withdraw services from the UK, bringing to mind repressive regimes where people have to use VPNs in order to access information and services needed in their daily&nbsp;lives.</p><p>The proposed laws underscore how easily security in the realm of global digital infrastructures is misunderstood: opening a backdoor to authorities is to open a backdoor full stop, one that can and will be abused. In contrast, stronger privacy ensures stronger security overall, as it prevents profiling, targeting, misinformation and disinformation.</p><p>The internet should be a public, safe utility where the government helps to secure our infrastructure rather than forcing it to become less secure. Unfortunately the UK is not alone, and the EU has floated a similar proposal.</p><p>Nym stands for privacy by default and always&nbsp;will.</p><p>Read on to learn more about client-side scanning, the proposed laws, and where Nym fits&nbsp;in:</p> Online Safety Bill: What is client-side scanning? <p>Things were less complicated back in 2003 when CSS either stood for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">Cascading Style Sheets</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_(band)">Cansei de Ser Sexy</a>. A couple of decades later and we now have ‘<a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2020/fact-sheet-client-side-scanning/">client-side scanning</a>’ to contend with, a technology that automatically mines messages for illegal content (the scanning part) on the user’s device (that’s the client-side part).</p><p>The long-running saga of the Online Safety Bill has evolved and swelled over the years from the <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8743/">Online Harms whitepaper released in 2019</a>. Part of the wide-reaching Bill now proposes granting new powers to UK telecoms regulator Ofcom, which would allow the body to mandate tech companies to install CSS on laptops, tablets, and smartphones, effectively creating a backdoor into each device should the regulator use its&nbsp;powers.</p><p>When a user uploads an image on their smartphone, client-side scanning software compares it against a database of prohibited content. This database doesn’t actually contain images but something called neural hashes — a bit like digital fingerprints, as the <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/how-the-online-safety-bill-puts-a-spy-in-your-pocket/">Open Rights Group explains</a> — and if there’s a match, the system removes or reports the upload to authorities.</p><p>While the system of encryption itself is not tampered with, the Open Rights Group notes that it does break the premise of encryption that communications shouldn’t be interfered with.</p><p>“The scale of the deployment means this is a mass surveillance tool,” said the Open Rights Group. “It would be on every smartphone in the country, operating 24/7, checking for matches against all of our content. It is a vastly disproportionate measure, and given the uncertainties around the technology, should be approached by policy-makers with caution.”</p><p>With the ever-increasing sophistication of cyber crime gangs, many of which have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/14/conti-ransomware-leak-shows-group-operates-like-normal-tech-company.html">their own HR departments and complicated tech stacks</a>, the criminals the Bill claims to target will continue to exist and grow more savvy in their evasion capabilities, but the rights of ordinary people will be severely&nbsp;eroded.</p><p>In addition to the disregard for the rights of citizens there are operational difficulties with implementing the technology. Quite an obvious problem is creating the technology to actually match hashes accurately and differentiate between illegal content and everyday communications.</p><p>In fact, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/apples-neuralhash-how-it-works-and-ways-to-break-it-577d1edc9838">researchers have already demonstrated weaknesses in Apple’s NeuralHash scanning technology</a>, which checks hashes against those in known Child Sexual Abuse Material. By using machine-learning algorithms to add ‘adversarial noise’ to an image, the hash distribution of that image can be changed dramatically, but look essentially the same. Or by using ‘hash collision’, it’s possible to create entirely new images with this ‘noise’ that register the same hashes as the original image, tricking the scanning technology.</p> Online Safety Bill encryption-busting: Can it be&nbsp;stopped? <p>In the upper chambers of Parliament, members of the House of Lords failed to pass any amendments that would protect the premise of encryption, while one that would force Ofcom to consult with the Information Commissioner’s Office before using its powers also failed. This was the last stage where the Online Safety Bill was likely to face significant challenges or roadblocks in government.</p><p>Lord Parkinson introduced an amendment but this was a government proposal. This ‘chickens secure in barn, says fox’ amendment states that Ofcom will have to consult an external ‘skilled person’ before issuing a mandate, but details are thin and fail to address the fundamental security problem of intrusive backdoors on citizens’ devices.</p><p>The Online Safety Bill is not far from being enshrined in law. In September, it will go to the ‘third reading’ in the House of Lords, followed by the penultimate stage in the House of Commons before it’s finally put in front of the UK’s brand new King where his signature will make it law (‘Royal Assent’).</p><p>Ofcom has said it will only issue a mandate in extreme circumstances, but the history of extraordinary powers suggests that more often than not their use is normalised rather&nbsp;quickly.</p><p>Civil society groups will continue to agitate against the Bill but it is unlikely they will have much luck against a government determined to break encryption and an opposition with seemingly little interest in opposing it. Legal action from civil society groups can reasonably be expected should Ofcom try to use its newfound&nbsp;powers.</p><p>And if all that wasn’t enough, the UK followed up with new proposed changes to the Investigatory Powers Act (colloquially known as the Snoopers’ Charter) which would allow the government to secretly demand any messaging app security features be disabled without the knowledge of&nbsp;users.</p><p>WhatsApp, Apple, and Signal have all threatened to pull their operations from the UK should the encryption-busting sections of the Online Safety Bill be written into law. This would threaten to hobble overnight the social and economic fabric of Britain plus complicate the free flow of data and business communications.</p><p>For a country that often boasts of its commitment to the values of free speech and democracy it’s not without some irony that everyday WhatsApp users in the UK could need to connect to VPNs in order to access basic messaging services, just as they would in authoritarian regimes decried by the British government.</p><p>If you’re in Britain and want to access basic services like WhatsApp, Signal, and the Apple portfolio, the decentralised NymVPN will be available for you to use securely with a zero-knowledge framework, without having to entrust paid VPN companies to guard against data breaches nor tolerating free VPNs selling your&nbsp;data.</p> EU’ll never walk&nbsp;alone <p>Sadly, the UK is not a rogue state flying solo in its anti-privacy mission.</p><p>Hundreds of experts, academics, and researchers including Nym Chief Scientist Claudia Diaz, cryptographer at KU Leuven and Nym Advisors Bart Preneel at KU Leuven and Carmela Troncoso of EPFL as well as Nym Chief Strategy Officer Jaya Brekke <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/protecting-digital-rights-and-freedoms-in-the-legislation-to-effectively-tackle-child-abuse/">have warned of the European Union’s plans to introduce CSS&nbsp;too</a>.</p><p>Upcoming European Union legislation, the Child Sexual Abuse regulation, aims to stop the spread of child sexual abuse material and the grooming of children online. A worthy cause, but the means to achieve it are misguided: app or online service providers would be empowered to scan messages, pictures, emails, voicemail or any other user activities, as well as introducing client-side scanning to get around encryption on users’&nbsp;devices.</p><p>The experts point out that existing scanning technologies, as well as those on the horizon, are deeply flawed. Client-side scanning will not only be ineffective but actively dangerous when taken in the global context, risking rippling effects that will create wider harms for people online and making the internet more dangerous, not&nbsp;safer.</p><p>“It is not feasible or tenable to require private companies to use technologies in ways that we already know cannot be done safely — or even at all,” the letter states. “Given the horrific nature of child sexual abuse, it is understandable, and indeed tempting, to hope that there is a technological intervention that can eradicate it. Yet, looking at the issue holistically, we cannot escape the conclusion that the current proposal is not such an intervention.”</p><p>In response, international advocacy group EDRi <a href="https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EDRi-principles-on-CSAM-measures.pdf">has published a set of principles</a> that would help defend children in the digital age without compromising the rights of EU citizens.</p><p>In its current state, the <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/european-commissions-online-csam-proposal-fails-to-find-right-solutions-to-tackle-child-sexual-abuse/">Child Sexual Abuse regulation would join Britain in setting a global precedent for the filtering of the internet and controlling its access</a>, as well as removing the few tools that are available for people to protect their right to a private life in the digital realm, ultimately creating a chilling effect on&nbsp;society.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH2E_WEXtys">Bart Preneel previously said</a>, the EU has ‘two faces’ — one that’s pro-privacy with regulations like the GDPR, and the other working to undermine privacy with extreme data retention and law enforcement or intelligence-led snooping. The <a href="https://www.diplomacy.edu/blog/un-declares-internet-access-human-right-did-it-really/">UN has recognised that internet access is essential to freedom of expression</a>, while the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">UN Declaration of Human Rights states that people have a right to privacy in correspondence</a>. Proposals like the Online Safety Bill and the Child Sexual Abuse regulation would threaten&nbsp;both.</p> Anti-privacy hell and how to fight&nbsp;it <p>Governments have historically traded on consumer ignorance and fear, and in an increasingly surveillance-saturated world post-9/11, the mantra that if people had nothing to hide, they had nothing to fear was widely repeated.</p><p>Until relatively recently, the internet was seen as a separate realm to our everyday existence. But that’s not true today. Just as we wouldn’t accept government agents leaping from the bushes to pull down our pants for on-the-spot safety inspections, we don’t want them reading all of our private messages or combing through our smartphones for some abstract, unprovable guarantee of security.</p><p>Nym cannot solve client-side scanning as the Nym network protects your traffic in transit rather than on the actual device. What Nym can offer for an eventual future with CSS is the powerful NymVPN, to enable continued open access to services and information.</p><p>Privacy and openness go hand in hand. Once you compromise privacy, you have started down the slippery slope of repression and control. Make your voice heard and get <a href="https://edri.org/take-action/our-campaigns/keep-it-secure/">involved in campaigns to pressure policymakers to protect democratic rights like&nbsp;privacy</a>.</p><p>Support the friends of Nym who are organising to protect everyone’s privacy, security, and integrity:</p>  <a href="https://action.openrightsgroup.org/dont-scan-me">Open Rights Group: Don’t Scan&nbsp;Me</a>  <a href="https://edri.org/take-action/our-campaigns/keep-it-secure/">EDRi: Keep It&nbsp;Secure</a>  <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/get-involved/">AccessNow</a>  <a href="https://act.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>   Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> The internet is global and so is Nym: join the Nym Community wherever you are and help build the private internet&nbsp;today. <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorean">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-cop-in-every-pocket-client-side-scanning-in-the-uk-and-europe-7eeac45e82b5">A cop in every pocket: client-side scanning in the UK and Europe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Brave strongly opposes Google's "Web Environment Integrity" proposal, the latest in Google's efforts to prevent users from being in control of how they use the Web.

<p>by Peter Snyder, VP of Privacy Engineering and Senior Privacy Researcher</p>
<p>Brave strongly opposes Google’s “<a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md">Web Environment Integrity</a>” (WEI) proposal. As with many of Google’s recent changes and proposals regarding the Web, “Web Environment Integrity” would move power away from users, and toward large websites, including the websites Google itself runs. Though Brave uses Chromium, Brave browsers do not (and will not) include WEI.<a>1</a> Further, some browsers have introduced other features similar to, though more limited than, WEI (e.g., certain parts of WebAuthn and Privacy Keys); Brave is considering how to best restrict these features without breaking benign uses.</p>
<p>Google’s WEI proposal is frustrating, but it’s not surprising. WEI is simply the latest in Google’s ongoing efforts to prevent browser users from being in control of how they read, interact with, and use the Web. Google’s <a>WebBundles proposal</a> makes it more difficult for users to block or filter out unwanted page content, <a>Google’s First Party Sets feature</a> makes it more difficult for users to make decisions around which sites can track users, and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening">Google’s weakening of browser extensions</a> straightforwardly makes it harder for users to be in control of their Web experience by crippling top ad-and-tracker-blocking extensions such as <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>.<a>2</a> This is unfortunately far from a complete list of recent, similar user-harming Web proposals from Google. Again, Brave <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Deviations-from-Chromium-%28features-we-disable-or-remove%29">disables or modifies</a> all of these features in Brave’s browsers.</p>
<p>The Web is the world’s most popular, and therefore most important, open system for sharing information and distributing applications. It is critical that users stay in control of how they interact with the Web, and for the Web not to be reduced to a series of take-it-or-leave-it black-boxes that users can’t inspect, can’t understand, and can’t modify. Google’s WEI proposal (like many other Google proposals) intentionally shifts power away from users, and towards large websites and advertisers.</p>
<p>WEI is the latest step in a <a>terrible</a> <a>direction</a> Google is pushing for the Web. Web users deserve a browser that doesn’t treat them as enemies that need to be restricted and controlled.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>We remove or disable Chromium features that harm users’ privacy or convenience. You can find a running list of these changes here: <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Deviations-from-Chromium-%28features-we-disable-or-remove%29">https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Deviations-from-Chromium-(features-we-disable-or-remove)</a>.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Brave browser on desktop <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/28367">maintains support</a> for certain popular and user-serving Manifest v2 extensions.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

 1. Moves &amp; news: Financial innovation &amp; technology for the 21st century <p>This week, the House <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/wCqqBLMboOc">Financial Services</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ngRV7ve7F4">Agricultural</a> Committees made history when they held “legislative markups” — a step in the lawmaking process where bills are debated and amended before consideration by the full House of Representatives — <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408921">on the</a> Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (HR 4763). For the first time ever, two standing Congressional Committees passed landmark legislation out of committee that would provide a federal regulatory structure for the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Why is this so significant? It is the first, but very important step, towards a bill becoming law. The next step is for the bill to move to a vote on the House of Representatives floor with bipartisan support (as this week’s events indicated it is indeed a bipartisan issue). And while there is still a long way to go to make this bill a law — it still needs to pass the House, Senate, and be signed by the President — it could significantly decrease regulatory confusion in the crypto industry.</p><p>share:&nbsp;<br><a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1684236396956127233">https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1684236396956127233</a><br><a href="https://twitter.com/Collin_McCune/status/1684378228272635904">https://twitter.com/Collin_McCune/status/1684378228272635904</a></p><p>related reading:</p>  <p>“Crypto bill passes congressional committee in victory for industry” / <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-congressional-committee-set-weigh-crypto-bills-2023-07-26/">Reuters</a></p>  <p>“Crypto regulatory bill advances to floor” / <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/07/27/crypto-regulatory-bill-house-fit21">Axios</a></p>  <p>other resources:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGcMLZw_mb4">Engaging Policymakers</a> 101 with Collin McCune / a16z crypto Startup School</p>  <p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/policy-crypto-regulation-overview-pulse-check-mindsets-myths-frameworks-domains">Crypto Policy &amp; Regulation: What's Going On?</a> with Miles Jennings, Brian Quintenz, Collin McCune, Sonal Chokshi / web3 with a16z podcast</p>  <p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/crypto-regulations-sanctions-compliance-aml-ofac-news-explained">Crypto Regulations, Illicit Finance, Privacy and Beyond</a> with Michele Korver, Jai Ramaswamy, Sonal Chokshi / web3 with a16z podcast</p>  <p>see also: <br>Be sure to check out the <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/crypto-news-and-regulatory-update-july-14-2023-july-28-2023/">latest installment</a> (released just yesterday) in our <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/regulatory-updates-roundups-recaps">ongoing regulatory recaps series</a> — where the a16z crypto regulatory team shares useful agency-specific, as well as regional, news &amp; moves.&nbsp;</p> 2. Op-ed: It’s time to move crypto from chaos to order (in Fortune) <p>Miles Jennings and Brian Quintenz</p><p>Many believe blockchains and crypto are a groundbreaking technology that enable creativity and entrepreneurship, while some regard these tools as just another internet fad. Regardless of where you stand, it’s indisputable that consumers and entrepreneurs alike in the burgeoning crypto and web3 sector face tremendous regulatory uncertainty — which holds the legitimate industry back, and allows bad actors to flourish.</p><p>This tension was on full display as a federal district court recently issued a much-anticipated summary judgment in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs and two of its founders. While it was a potentially significant win for crypto (and a rebuff to the SEC’s ongoing war against it), the ruling results in a confusing set of outcomes that highlights the long standing uncertainty plaguing an industry clamoring for stability. So what are entrepreneurs to make of the decision? </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/its-time-to-move-crypto-from-chaos-to-order/">read more</a> <br>share <a href="https://twitter.com/milesjennings/status/1680920624087302145">here</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianQuintenz/status/1680209339217326081">here</a></p> 3. Resources: 17 misconceptions about SNARKs — and why they hold us back <p>Justin Thaler</p><p>An important cryptographic tool that opens up exciting new possibilities in system design, “SNARKs” (Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge) have several applications in blockchains — and beyond — because they facilitate trust where it otherwise may not exist. And if a SNARK satisfies the property of <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/zkps-zero-knowledge-proofs-systems-more">zero-knowledge</a>, then it can also be useful for privacy in all sorts of applications (by allowing people to only disclose what they want to, and nothing else) — which is especially useful for <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/achieving-crypto-privacy-and-regulatory-compliance/">privacy-preserving compliance</a>.<br><br>But as <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/zero-knowledge-canon/">advances</a> in SNARKs have rapidly accelerated in the past few years, it has also led to confusing terminology, and errors, that slow down progress. So in this article, a16z crypto research partner Justin Thaler outlines 17 misconceptions about <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/snarks">SNARKs</a> and how developers, designers, and users can address them.<br><br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/17-misconceptions-about-snarks/">read more</a> <br>share <a href="https://twitter.com/SuccinctJT/status/1679168005949865994">on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x4ad5f9">on Farcaster</a></p><p></p><p><br>-- Sonal Chokshi, Paul Cafiero, and a16z crypto teams<br><br>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

   The recent history of L2s has shown that there doesn’t need to be ‘one chain to rule them all’ or an ‘ETH killer’.

<p>The recent history of L2s has shown that there doesn’t need to be ‘one chain to rule them all’ or an ‘ETH killer’. Instead, a healthier approach would be to find the best solution for a specific need, taking into consideration any potential tradeoffs. Avalanche has done just that, focusing from the get-go on delivering high transaction throughput, using their unique subnet architecture, consensus protocol and warp messaging. HyperSDK continues this conviction, offering a framework for developers to spin up customisable, high performance virtual machines.</p><p>We were joined by Patrick O’Grady, VP of Engineering at Ava Labs, to discuss HyperSDK and how it enables building customisable, high performance VMs on Avalanche subnets.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Patrick’s background  Avalanche’s consensus protocol  Subnets  AvalancheGo design concepts  Warp messaging  Staking and subnet validators  HyperSDK  HyperSDK vs. Cosmos SDK  Avalanche throughput parameters  Custom solutions for developers  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/_patrickogrady">Patrick O'Grady on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/AvaLabsOfficial">Ava Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/avax">Avalanche on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Meher Roy &amp; Felix Lutsch.

The visibility in this most Solarpunk of all terrain runs two ways: you can see everyone else, but they can see you&nbsp;too.</p><p>Perhaps ‘Lunarpunk,’ with its aesthetics of dense forested thickets, has something to teach Solarpunk. Lunarpunk doesn’t avoid the smouldering rays of the sun, but proposes a forested environment where life can thrive, with added dens, dugouts and hollows in which to conceal oneself, should prying eyes wish to monitor or cause you&nbsp;harm.</p><p>This is where the Nym mixnet comes in: dropping mighty Lunarpunk redwoods in the sandy desertscape dunes and, with the new Libp2p integration, securing Ethereum in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>There is no opposition between night and day, just <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/20/what-are-solarpunk-and-lunarpunk-anyway/">as there is no opposition between Lunarpunk and Solarpunk</a>. Privacy and security is the basis of openness and freedom, not its opposition.</p><p>Read on to learn&nbsp;more:</p> What does Nym mean for Ethereum and&nbsp;privacy? <p>Autonomous, free and decentralised communities will not happen without anonymity and privacy at their core. But this is not how Ethereum is designed, especially following the move to its Proof of Stake consensus algorithms last&nbsp;year.</p><p>The new algorithms mean that validators must coordinate on who creates the next block in the blockchain, and that means more traffic between validators. All of this traffic can be analysed, compromising validator privacy and opening the infrastructure up to attacks, from MEV Bots and DDoS attacks to targeted censorship.</p><p>Privacy on the internet is broken by design. This is because, at the network level, all traffic is at the mercy of powerful adversaries, or overseers with practically endless compute power and energy capable of monitoring any activity on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Projects like Signal or Monero still suffer from metadata leaks at the network level, and VPNs aren’t the answer, because IP addresses are only concealed rather than protecting traffic and metadata. (Not to mention that the traffic is collected and centralised by VPN providers.) Even Tor falls short in the face of traffic analysis from powerful adversaries such as the NSA, which are capable of performing time correlation attacks.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-libp2p-how-to-solve-the-ethereum-privacy-crisis-with-public-goods-e2a4972bdf1c">Nym + Libp2p: how to solve the Ethereum privacy crisis with public&nbsp;goods</a></p><p>The solution is to create a privacy layer by default for all internet traffic. The Nym mixnet routes traffic through multiple nodes, unlinking origin and destination, like Tor. But unlike Tor, Nym gives additional cover too, including by adding ‘dummy’ traffic to fool snoopers. Packets are re-ordered at each hop, preventing de-anonymisation, while unlike blockchains, the Nym mixnet is designed for horizontal scalability.</p><p>While Ethereum 2.0 aims to separate validator identity from network identity, researchers have shown Nym that it’s easy to connect the two by essentially looking at a batch of&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Because the Ethereum algorithm is fundamentally deterministic, it’s possible to predict which validators will be working on the next block. And if you have this information, you can then DDoS that validator and knock them offline. Another issue is that full transparency on Ethereum also means revealing IP address and therefore your geographic location — i.e. where you&nbsp;live.</p> Nym mixnet: securing&nbsp;Ethereum <p>The <a href="https://chainsafe.io/">ChainSafe</a> team has integrated Nym for Libp2p into their Lighthouse rust implementation of the Ethereum consensus client. The code is<a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/rust-libp2p-nym"> fully open source and available right now on GitHub — try it&nbsp;out!</a></p><p>Nym pluggable transports into their stacks via Lighthouse, the Rust implementation of the Ethereum consensus client. You simply plug Nym into Libp2p, turn it on, and the Nym mixnet is immediately available, obfuscating network traffic on-chain. In short: this makes integrating a privacy layer into any Libp2p stack&nbsp;simple.</p><p>Right now, the Nym mixnet speed is 300–400 milliseconds, which is fast enough to mix data packets and fit into the Ethereum block production. With upcoming Sphinx packet upgrades, thanks to cryptographer Daniel Bernstein who works on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519">Curve25519</a>, this will most likely become two to four times faster in&nbsp;future.</p><p>The Nym SDK team is now working on a general Libp2p integration, using the Nym Rust SDK. Libp2p is an integration module designed by <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> that can run across different network protocols: a peer-to-peer networking framework that has been groundbreaking for decentralised networking, and is used in major blockchain ecosystems like IPFS Polkadot and Ethereum.</p><p>To learn more about protecting the Ethereum ecosystem with the Nym mixnet, why Nym adds Lunarpunk infrastructure to the Solarpunk scene — as well as what’s next for Nym and Ethereum with Aztec —<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAlAnTRqEuA"> watch Serinko’s talk in full&nbsp;below</a>:</p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> The internet is global and so is Nym: join the Nym Community wherever you are and help build the private internet&nbsp;today. <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorean">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-lunarpunk-infrastructure-for-securing-the-solarpunk-ecosystem-413916c98123">Nym: Lunarpunk Infrastructure for securing the Solarpunk Ecosystem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Partnering with Cobot: Builders at Heart  <p>Brad and his team are designing collaborative robots that work alongside and adapt to humans—not the other way around.</p>   
	By Alfred Lin	 



Published July 26, 2023
  







 
<p>By the end of Brad Porter’s tenure at Amazon in 2020, he led a powerhouse robotics organization of over 10,000 people with a diverse portfolio that included warehouse programs, drone delivery and more. When he joined the company in 2007, he hadn’t worked in robotics at all.</p>



<p>Brad did have a deep—and long-held—interest in the field. When he was a kid, his parents gave him a Radio Shack Armatron robotic arm, and he spent hours learning to control it. He was fascinated by radio-controlled planes and helicopters. But he also loved computer science, and started his career at Netscape after earning a B.S. and M.S. from MIT. The two of us met when he was in his next role, at Tellme Networks, where he was recruited as a founding engineer. From there, he joined Amazon, working first on the website platform and the e-commerce stack, and later taking leadership roles in Prime Day tech readiness and Prime Air, as VP and Distinguished Engineer.</p>



<p>At every company and in every role, Brad focused on finding the biggest, most interesting problems his team needed to solve and figuring out how he could help solve them. So when the opportunity arose in 2017 to lead Amazon Robotics, naturally, he raised his hand.</p>



<p>Three successful years and 500,000 robots later, Brad, a company-builder at heart, was ready for a return to the startup world, and joined ScaleAI for a stint as CTO. And now, he’s building a company of his own: Collaborative Robotics, or <a href="https://co.bot/">Cobot</a>.</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/hand-laborers-and-material-movers.htm">more than six million</a> hand laborers and material movers in the U.S., not to mention millions of hospital, delivery and airport employees who also spend most of their time getting things from point A to point B. It is difficult, physical work, and an aging population and labor shortages mean these workers are increasingly difficult to find—at the same moment that the rise of e-commerce makes them increasingly in-demand.</p>



<p>Automation has the potential to fill this vast and growing gap and allow employees to focus on less physically demanding work—which is where Cobot comes in. Brad and his team are designing robots that can work alongside humans, moving boxes, totes and carts not just in restricted, purpose-built spaces like warehouses, but through a stadium, in the back of a truck, and down the halls of a 100-year-old hospital. They are machines built to adapt and react to us—not the other way around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these collaborative robots have the potential to transform operations in biotech, health care, logistics and beyond, the first step is understanding as deeply as possible what those customers need. That’s why, in addition to building novel new robots, the Cobot team is launching its Flywheel Program, a consulting service that helps customers define their automation and robotics strategy and navigate the transition smoothly. A shipping company can figure out how to automate transloading docks. A pharmaceutical development company can learn to move supplies from warehouses to labs. And Mayo Clinic, the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/worlds-best-hospitals-2022">top</a> hospital in the world and now a Cobot partner, can take robots beyond the operating room to move gloves, food, linens and more.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia are thrilled to partner with Cobot and lead this Series A round, and we look forward to supporting them as they grow. Brad is a special founder, with deep technical expertise as well as a rare and valuable history of success in both hardware and software, and across every stage. Now, he is building a special team to match, with a vision for seamless, adaptable technology and a smarter, more sustainable future—and we’re excited to help them build toward it.</p>

 Introduction <p>In the fast-paced evolution of finance, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have emerged as a game-changer. These are fundamentally shifting our perceptions and use of money. But they also ignite pressing concerns about personal financial privacy. In this piece, I will dive into these issues and present an unexpected hero — the PIVX cryptocurrency — as a promising answer to the privacy question.</p> The Rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) <p>CBDCs, the digital versions of a country’s regular currency, are making waves globally. CBDCs, backed by the central bank, aim to make finance more inclusive, simplify monetary policy enforcement, and securely bring the economy into the digital age. With the potential for faster transactions, lower costs, and easier tracking, CBDCs are a tempting proposition. And countries like China and the Bahamas have <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/20/china-to-extend-cbdc-trial-to-most-populous-province-guangdong-three-others-report/">already started using them</a>, with others, like the U.S., <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/central-bank-digital-currency.htm">not far&nbsp;behind.</a></p><p>However, as we lean into this digital transition, we must also examine its implications for financial privacy. So, let’s consider the privacy impact of CBDCs and explore how PIVX may hold the key to a solution.</p> The Challenges of&nbsp;CBDCs <p>However exciting the world of CBDCs might seem, it’s not without challenges. Privacy is a significant concern. CBDCs, given their centralized nature, could expose individual financial privacy to potential threats. In a CBDC system, transactions can be traced back to individuals, offering authorities an in-depth look into private financial lives — a scenario that could compromise personal freedoms.</p><p>Moreover, the emergence of CBDCs could disrupt the traditional role of commercial banks and centralize power over monetary policy. This could potentially destabilize the financial system and raise worries about the misuse of authority.</p><p>And then there’s cybersecurity. A centralized digital currency could be an irresistible target for hackers, posing serious threats to financial security. Ensuring robust cybersecurity measures, therefore, is non-negotiable.</p> Cryptocurrencies, CBDCs, and&nbsp;Privacy <p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have shown the world a new way of financial transactions. But <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/794684/bitcoin-is-not-private-your-transaction-history-is-public/">Bitcoin is not private</a>. While identities are hidden behind cryptographic addresses, transaction data&nbsp;isn’t.</p><p>On the flip side, CBDCs could be designed to be shielded from the public, but the central authority would have full insight into transactions. This potential breach of privacy underscores the urgent need for a financial tool that offers both the benefits of digital currencies and strong privacy protections.</p> The Role of PIVX in Financial Privacy <p>Here enters PIVX, or Private Instant Verified Transaction. With its robust <a href="https://pivx.org/">focus on privacy</a>, PIVX represents a beacon of hope in the digital finance landscape. It melds the advantages of digital currencies while addressing the privacy worries that shadow both traditional cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;CBDCs.</p><p>PIVX leverages advanced privacy protocols, <a href="https://pivx.org/privacy-protocol">like zk-SNARKs</a>, to ensure transaction confidentiality. Plus, it has introduced SHIELD, a custom privacy protocol that protects user identities and transaction details. In other words, PIVX creates a fortress of privacy around financial transactions without compromising on the benefits of digitization.</p><p>As CBDCs continue to gain ground, the importance of privacy-focused alternatives like PIVX cannot be overstated. As the financial landscape continues to evolve, the need for solutions like PIVX will only become more apparent.</p> Conclusion <p>As we stand on the precipice of the CBDC era, the conversation around personal financial privacy becomes more relevant than ever. While digital finance brings many benefits, we cannot overlook the tug-of-war between convenience and privacy. The introduction of CBDCs, while potentially beneficial, also raises serious concerns around privacy, security, and centralisation of&nbsp;power.</p><p>PIVX, with its laser focus on privacy and security, offers a compelling alternative. By using advanced cryptographic techniques, PIVX offers a safe harbour in the stormy seas of digital finance. As we navigate these uncharted waters, the importance of such privacy-centric solutions is becoming increasingly clear.</p><p>As the digital world continues its relentless march forward, our discussions around privacy and security need to keep pace. This conversation is only the beginning. Whether you’re a casual user, a financial expert, or a policy-maker, the call for secure, efficient financial systems that respect privacy is universal. We must continue to probe, question, and demand systems that safeguard our privacy in a digital economy. Now is the perfect time to <a href="https://pivx.org">learn more about PIVX</a> and how it can be part of the solution.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/navigating-financial-privacy-in-the-age-of-cbdcs-f0cb95e57599">Navigating Financial Privacy in the Age of CBDCs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Verus Protocol lead developer Mike Toutonghi explains the differences between Verus smart transactions and smart contracts. <p>The following was written by Mike Toutonghi, lead developer on the Verus Protocol, on <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discord</a>👇</p> Application Programming Model <p>The way to understand smart transactions vs. smart contracts is to think about the application programming model, and how each of them work in&nbsp;context.</p><p>There is no 1:1 correlation, but smart transactions are much easier to use in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, in a decentralized fashion.</p> Smart Contracts <p>Basically, the current model on Ethereum&nbsp;is:</p>  You run on a blockchain where the only currency where accounting is enforced by the blockchain protocol is ETH. To launch, or materialize a token, an account abstraction, or any other form of currency or identity-like structure (NFTs, liquidity pools, etc), you write an executable program/contract, according to accepted conventions, but with no actual checks that you follow any form of math accuracy, interface adherence, or accounting rules whatsoever.  The differentiation of these contracts, which are akin to stored procedures in a database, but carry with them the DB schema as well as the interface, is in the way they enable differences of implementation of those accepted conventions.  Consensus across all of Ethereum is applied to ensuring that the shared, serialized, worldwide computer that is the EVM executes its low level instructions accurately, with no accounting of currencies, exchanges, enablement of efficient, actual IDs, zk-privacy, etc. The currencies that run above the single native security currency, run by arbitrary rules, often opaque or containing unexpected behaviors, and everyone must create their version of these contracts to build a&nbsp;dApp.   Verus Smart Transactions <p>In Verus, it’s a new model as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Your dApp can run on a client or on a broad range of resource types, and it communicates via the same RPC API as the CLI commands (optionally without wallet or control functions) with a fully functional, decentralized backend, which is the Internet of Value, including all its unlimited scale, connected systems and&nbsp;chains.  Unlike a single currency blockchain, Verus smart transactions natively support an unlimited number of friendly name currencies directly via protocol and an unlimited number of blockchains for currency launches, simple sends, currency conversions, or cross-chain operations. All inputs, outputs, cross-chain imports, and even conversions are validated and in/out values of all currencies accounted for by consensus, just as native currency ins and outs are on single-currency blockchains.  Identities are a first class concept in the primitives available for dApps. They all support fully available, open, decentralized, user controlled authentication and authorization protocols, enabled by QR code or deep links and supportive of permission granting, ID provisioning/sale by the dApp, private/attested KYC and other services. These protocols can easily be bridged to OAuth or OpenID Connect via servers like Hydra, but used natively, they require no service provider between the service actually authenticating the user and the user themselves.  Every identity is multisig and has revocation and recovery capabilities. They are also transferable and can have rights bound into them in a provable manner via the contentmultimap. All of this is supported as primitives in the core RPC/CLI api/command line and in the core protocol.  IDs enable their holders to launch like-named currencies, blockchains, and single NFT-like tokens that have a super power over the ID, which is very useful for an ID that may live across multiple&nbsp;chains.  IDs and currencies may be created and launched on one chain, leveraging all of that chains capabilities (Verus includes many variations in currency, including conditional crowdfunding, liquidity pools, blockchains, etc.), and exported to other chains to be used everywhere across the network. For example, if you launch a currency on Verus or any PBaaS chain, including the native PBaaS chain’s currency. All of those currency definitions can be exported to Ethereum, and they will emerge on Ethereum as an automatically created and functional ERC20 contract, enabling the currency to be sent back and forth via protocol from then&nbsp;on.  All identities and currencies are resolvable worldwide, meaning that you can determine a network path to the nodes of the blockchain where they were defined via their friendly name, or usually via their i-address, if they have been exported cross-chain. This enables apps to scale over any number of decentralized blockchains worldwide and leave the management of user databases and user data, as well as settings, signals, endpoints, etc. to the users themselves and the client apps they use to help them&nbsp;manage.  Because the currency and liquidity pool support is in the L1 protocol, we have been able to actually solve for and provide MEV-resistant (both intra and inter-block) AMMs as a primitive, available to all applications and&nbsp;users.  <p>People don’t have to write basic liquidity and conversion protocols, which are just primitives, not apps. Real apps can use all of these primitives to deliver the next level of function. Payments, currency conversions, earning systems, polls, voting, multi-chain world scale social networks using provable streams in provable IDs, crowdfunding, independent economies. All primitives, such as IDs, currencies, blockchains, and liquidity baskets have very rich capabilities from launch to continued operation.</p> Extending Verus Smart Transactions <p>If someone wants to extend smart transactions, that is an option, but they either don’t have to, or if they really have a reason to do so, they can do it on their PBaaS chain, share or not share back (lots of reasons to do so), and now that we have the core primitive framework as a foundation, we can certainly collaborate on a kind of protocol extension that is likely to include forms of VM and/or ZKVM extension points in the current protocol, to work within the framework of the core primitives that are fundamental to Verus and that we believe are crucial for safe financial infrastructure, yet generally missing in other&nbsp;systems.</p> Try Yourself! ✅ <p>Look up <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a> to use many API commands (e.g. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">launching currencies, tokens &amp; liquidity pools</a>).</p><p>Or look up the <a href="https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-02_verus_commands.md">complete command list&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Join the community.

<p>In an increasingly complex DeFi environment, preserving privacy while enabling regulatory compliance has become both a challenge and a necessity. <br></p><p>This article’ll delve deeper into the linchpin of Panther Protocol’s architecture –<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/multi-asset-shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Multi-Asset Shielded Pools</a> (MASPs). Shielded Pools, as we call them in Panther, are sets of smart contracts where users can deposit various tokens, safeguarded by cutting-edge cryptographic techniques such as <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/cryptographic-primitives/zk-snarks?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zk-SNARKs</a> and <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/cryptographic-primitives/zero-knowledge-proofs?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)</a>. This renders the transactions within these pools untraceable while providing users with the flexibility to selectively disclose information, thus enabling a pathway to compliance.<br></p><p>Throughout this article, we will explore the intricate mechanics and far-reaching implications of MASPs within Panther’s ecosystem. We will also talk about Panther’s significance for the DeFi landscape and delve into the unique incentives system created by our design.<br></p> Diverse Pool Privacy (or “Why multiple assets?”)<br> <p>By allowing users of multiple kinds of assets to enter the Pool (e.g., different tokens types supported within a given chain, such as ERC-20, non-fungible, and other standards of tokens), users of every compatible token can access the same privacy, regardless of the liquidity of their assets. While a single-asset Pool for rarely-used tokens would struggle to find much security due to the relatively low volume of transactions, MASPs can leverage popular assets to quickly build critical speed and provide much-needed privacy to the long tail of crypto assets.<br></p><p>The fact that different types of assets can co-exist in the same Pool is called Diverse Pool Privacy. Thanks to it, Pools can get large enough to preserve data heterogeneity, i.e., have so many transactions happening within them that it becomes impossible to track and deanonymize users. <br></p> How do Shielded Pools work?<br> <p>In their technical build, Shielded Pools are essentially a collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Append-only?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">append-only</a> <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/merkle-tree/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Merkle trees</a>, where each leaf is a commitment to a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utxo.asp?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">UTXO</a> representing a number of <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/zassets?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAssets</a> (or zNFTs) –essentially an IOU for the corresponding collateral deposited by a user and locked in the Panther Vault.<br></p><p>At v1, Panther’s Pools will support the following activities:</p> Registering and activating zAccounts and zero-knowledge compliance checks<br> <p>Within Panther, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/zaccounts?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAccounts</a> are akin to bank accounts. All transactions done by a given user are linked to the same zAccount. Panther developed this novel mechanism to support compliance, decentralized identity, and selective disclosures. Using <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/zero-knowledge-proofs/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zero-knowledge</a> technology, Panther safeguards users’ on-chain data privacy and ownership.</p><p>zAccounts are implemented using a particular type of <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output-utxo?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">UTXO</a> inside the UTXOs Merkle Tree. Every zAccount UTXO contains important values at a user/account level, such as the zAccount’s ID, ZKP balance, PRP balance, ZoneID, etc.<br></p> Depositing, transferring, and withdrawing assets in Shielded Pools <br> <p>The core functionality of the MASP is to allow users to safely deposit assets and transfer them to others within the system. Additionally, it lets users prove their balance in a private setup or withdraw their assets to a publicly owned wallet.</p><p>The MASP assigns every UTXO an exact “owner” or recipient, the only person able to spend it. This is achieved by including a public (spending) key in generating the UTXO commitment, for which only the recipient knows the corresponding private (spending) key.</p><p>However, rather than using a single fully public spending key for each recipient, known to the whole world, a new spending <a href="https://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/key-pair?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=In%20public%20key%20cryptography%2C%20a,is%20known%20as%20asymmetric%20encryption.">keypair</a> is derived. This pair is guaranteed to be unique for each UTXO and strengthens the system’s privacy while offering greater flexibility to disclosure schemes. </p><p>To begin with, Panther’s Shielded Pools will support only 10 assets, with the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/dao-and-decentralization/panther-dao?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther DAO</a> deciding when and how to expand this list.<br></p> Managing a Zone and its criteria<br> <p>Shielded Pools are infinitely divisible into <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zones</a>. Zones are logical partitions of liquidity used to create Access Control Lists within the Pool. There is no finite number of Zones a Pool can contain, and, being within the same Pool, they all share the same zero-knowledge protection.<br></p><p>Every Zone is identified by a Zone-ID, and every Zone-ID is attached to a Zone Manager. A Zone Manager configures the parameters of the Zone, its allowed users, and gatekeeping/compliance-related requirements. Zone-IDs’ associated functionalities to manage Zones and their parameters make them a powerful tool that provides enhanced risk management features for regulated entities to function in the DeFi space.<br></p><p>For example, there can be two separate Zones that whitelist the wETH token:<br></p>  Zone A, run by InstitutionX, with very strict compliance requirements.  Zone B, run by the Panther DAO.<br>  <p>Since InstitutionX’s requirements are very strict, every UTXO belonging to it will have its Zone-ID, plus some metadata. This UTXO can be transferred only within the same Zone-ID if InstitutionX decides it. In this case, no one from outside this ID would be able to do deposits or withdraw to/from it. Similarly, users of this Zone-ID could only exchange UTXOs inside it.<br></p><p>Panther is also implementing zAccount-blacklisting for wallets associated with illicit wallet activity and other sanctioned users. Zone Managers can manage and control this depending on their preferences and what rules govern the operation of each specific Zone. For this, Panther uses a zAccountBlackListRecord MerkleTree, which is incremental and updateable but without saved root history. This tree can backlist a zAccount-ID from using the whole Panther protocol. <br></p> Rewarding users <br> <p>Panther’s incentive mechanics allow the protocol to issue rewards to users in the form of units called <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PRPs (Panther Reward Points)</a> within the Pool. Users receive rewards whenever they conduct an activity beneficial to the protocol’s privacy set, such as depositing assets, triggering internal transactions, using <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DeFi Adaptors</a>, etc. </p><p>Rewards being distributed in PRPs allow for a distribution model between PRP holders and total rewards in the Reward Pool at any given time. PRPs are stored as a balance in each zAccount’s UTXO and are updated upon Spend transactions.<br></p> Exchanging PRPs to $zZKP <p>Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/single-side-automated-market-maker?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">single-sided Automated Market Maker (AMM)</a> allows users to redeem their PRPs for <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/zkp/usdzkp?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP</a> within the Pool ($zZKP). Users top up the $ZKP pool within the AMM while earning additional rewards to facilitate this exchange.<br></p><p>Panther’s AMM functions by allowing users to redeem at a fluctuating rate. Exchange rates in this system are proportional to $ZKP in the pool and the total PRPs available. Through this mechanism, Panther creates a game-theoretical way to price privacy. The protocol will initially only charge fees (denominated in $zZKP) from users aiming to withdraw their assets. These fees eventually circle back to being distributed as rewards.<br></p><p>The diagram below explains the workings of the rewards mechanism, from the vesting of reward tokens to users exchanging their PRPs for $ZKP.</p>Rewards issuance mechanism.<p>Furthermore, the single-sided AMM itself is represented in the diagram below:</p>Rewards AMM breakdown. Interacting with DeFi dApps and protocols<br> <p>Shielded Pools are connected to DeFi through custom plugins called “DeFi Adaptors.” The first use case for Panther’s DeFi Adaptors, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors/zswap?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zSwap</a>, allows users to execute swaps on the most liquid DEXs without publicly revealing their identity. <br></p><p>The ability for users to send assets to DeFi protocols serves a double purpose: allowing users to access DeFi while decreasing the likelihood of an external observer tracking users’ assets and activity. In other words, users can swap assets, interact with DeFi, and trade with one another, but no one can link assets within the pool to specific users. This applies even when deposits/withdrawals to/from the Pool itself are viewable by observers. <br></p><p>As an example, thanks to Adaptors, even if Alice deposited 1000 USDC into the Pool, no one can be fully sure whether a given 1000 USDC withdrawal is Alice’s, as she could have easily swapped them for ETH, LINK, MATIC, or another asset on an external DEX. To learn more about DeFi Adaptors, go to <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zswap-and-defi-adaptors-unlocking-private-defi-usage/">our dedicated blog post.</a></p>Panther’s integration with DeFi dApps and protocols. zTrade: Orderbook trades at fixed rates <br> <p>Within Panther, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=An%20over%2Dthe%2Dcounter%20market%20is%20not%20centralized%20and%20occurs,equities%2C%20commodities%2C%20and%20derivatives.">OTC trades</a> are enabled by a component known as the “MASP plugin.” This is an extension to the MASP’s smart contracts that aims to enhance its base system with extra functionalities.<br></p><p>In the case of <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ztrade-otc-trading?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zTrade</a>, the additional functionalities provided are <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/atomic-swaps-explained?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">atomic swaps</a>. An atomic swap is an asset swap between two parties in a single transaction. zTrade is a MASP Internal atomic swap —a transaction that swaps UTXOs inside a Pool. <br></p><p>Note: While sometimes “atomic swaps” <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09515?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">is used to refer to cross-chain transfers</a>, the internal mechanism used for zTrade is identical; it just happens within the MASP.<br></p><p>This has significant advantages over centralized or decentralized swap mechanisms, such as:</p>  Zero <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/advanced-trade/slippage?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">slippage</a> on large trades.  Low fees.  Instant settlements with data protection.  Possibly, earning rewards (to be defined by the community).<br>   Shielded Pools’ cross-chain functionalities<br> <p>To realize the protocol’s vision of cross-chain zero-knowledge access to DeFi, Panther will deploy its Shielded Pools onto multiple blockchains (L1s and L2s). <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/zbridges?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zBridges</a> will connect these Pools on different blockchain networks, enabling cross-chain transactions and compounding the difficulty of tracking user activity.<br></p><p>In the future, we’ll publish more information on zBridges through our blog and documentation.<br></p> In conclusion<br> <p>Beyond mere privacy preservation, Panther is transforming the DeFi landscape by offering unique incentives and aligning different needs towards an improved user experience. <br></p><p>As you have learned, a key milestone for Panther is to deploy Shielded Pools onto multiple blockchains, further strengthening the ecosystem and diversifying access to DeFi. This vision, which puts users in control of who views their data while retaining compliance, constitutes a first-of-its-kind approach that leverages existing <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/cryptocurrency/liquidity-in-cryptocurrency/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">liquidity</a>, increases connectivity, and can attract institutions and retail users alike.<br></p><p>Shielded Pools are one of the core components of this vision, but there are many more. In future articles, we’ll expand over zBridges, Zones, zTrade, and much more!<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther’s zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="http://docs.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Documentation·</a> <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

 Understanding Your Digital Footprint <p>Every interaction you have with the digital world leaves a mark. This is known as your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_footprint">digital footprint</a>. It encompasses not only your social media posts and online purchases but also your browsing history, app usage, and even metadata attached to your digital files. In the wrong hands, this footprint can be exploited to gather personal information, infringing on your privacy and potentially leading to identity theft or targeted advertising. However, managing your digital footprint isn’t as daunting as it seems. By being mindful of what you share online, regularly updating your privacy settings, and deleting obsolete accounts, you’re already making significant strides in taking control of your digital presence.</p><p>In this article, I will explore practical strategies and tools to help you protect your privacy and manage your digital footprint effectively. I’ll discuss privacy-focused email services, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), private browsing options, and the Tor network, all of which can enhance your online privacy and safeguard your personal information. Additionally, I will introduce PIVX (Private Instant Verified Transaction), a cryptocurrency that offers a unique blend of transparency and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>By implementing the recommendations and understanding the tools below, you can gain greater control over your digital presence, minimise your exposure to privacy risks, and confidently navigate the digital landscape. Let’s dive in and explore how you can safeguard your privacy and protect your personal information online.</p> Privacy-Focused Email <p>Conventional email services like Gmail or Yahoo, despite their convenience, have privacy pitfalls. These platforms often scan your emails to deliver tailored ads, and in extreme cases, they may even share your data with third parties. This compromises the confidentiality of your communications. However, <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/email/secure/">privacy-focused email</a> services such as ProtonMail and Tutanota provide a more secure alternative. These services offer end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the sender and receiver can read the content of the emails. Additionally, with a strict no-logs policy, these platforms assure your data isn’t tracked or used for advertising purposes. Transitioning to a privacy-focused email service involves creating a new account, importing your contacts, and updating your email address in your other online accounts to maintain continuity.</p> Virtual Private Networks&nbsp;(VPN) <p>In our ever-connected lives, the risk of personal data exposure has also magnified. A <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/how-does-a-vpn-protect-your-privacy-and-anonymity">Virtual Private Network</a> (VPN) acts as a protective shield for your online activities. By creating a private network from your public internet connection, VPNs conceal your IP address, making it difficult for third parties to trace your online actions and track your location. Trusted providers like ExpressVPN and NordVPN offer robust protection, encrypting your internet traffic and adding an extra layer of security. Getting started with a VPN is as simple as downloading the app, selecting a server location, and hitting connect. With a VPN, you can browse the web anonymously and securely, even while using public Wi-Fi networks.</p> Private Browsing <p>Web browsers can reveal more about you than you might expect. Every search you make, every website you visit, and even your geographical location contribute to a substantial part of your digital footprint. Privacy-focused browsers like Brave and Tor provide a solution to mitigate this risk. These browsers limit the amount of information shared with the websites you visit by blocking third-party trackers and invasive advertisements. Additionally, they offer features like “incognito mode” for additional protection, preventing your browsing history from being stored on your device. By using a <a href="https://beencrypted.com/privacy/anonymous-browsing/private-browsers/">privacy-focused browser</a>, you can significantly reduce the data collected about your online activities and enhance your digital&nbsp;privacy.</p> The Tor&nbsp;Network <p>For those who prioritise high levels of online anonymity, the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/empowering-human-rights-defenders/">Tor network</a> is an excellent tool. Tor safeguards your privacy by routing your internet connection through a series of servers worldwide, making it exceedingly difficult for anyone to trace your online activities back to your original IP address. This network anonymises your web traffic, encrypting it at each step, and ensures that your online identity remains hidden. While using Tor may require some technical know-how and can sometimes be slower due to the routing process, the benefits it offers for digital privacy are significant.</p> Privacy in Digital Transactions <p>In the digital age, financial transactions are increasingly moving online. While this shift provides convenience, it also introduces privacy risks. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum brought the idea of decentralised, peer-to-peer transactions. However, their public ledgers can expose transaction details to anyone who cares to look. That’s where PIVX (Private Instant Verified Transaction) steps&nbsp;in.</p> Private Financial Transactions with&nbsp;PIVX <p>PIVX stands out in the realm of cryptocurrencies with its unique blend of transparency and privacy. It offers <a href="https://pivx.org/news/optional-privacy">optional financial privacy</a>, allowing users to choose between transparent and shielded transactions. Transparent transactions are similar to traditional cryptocurrencies, with details visible on the blockchain. PIVX’s <a href="https://pivx.org/privacy-protocol">Shielded transactions</a>, on the other hand, leverage zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic techniques to provide complete privacy by hiding transaction amounts, sender and recipient addresses, and other metadata. By using PIVX, users can leverage the benefits of digital transactions without compromising their financial privacy.</p> Conclusion <p>In our increasingly digital world, privacy is not a luxury; it’s a necessity. Whether you’re sending an email, browsing the web, or making a financial transaction, you have a choice in how much information you share. With the right tools and strategies, you can control your digital footprint, protect your personal information, and maintain online anonymity. Privacy-focused email services, VPNs, privacy-focused browsers, and tools like the Tor network and <a href="https://pivx.org/">PIVX</a> provide valuable options to enhance your digital privacy and security. By being proactive and conscious about your digital footprint, you can navigate the digital landscape with confidence, ensuring that your online activities align with your privacy preferences.</p><p>Remember, privacy matters, and it starts with&nbsp;you.</p> Useful links: <p>Privacy-focused Email Providers — <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/email/secure/">https://restoreprivacy.com/email/secure/</a></p><p>Using a VPN for Digital Privacy — <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/how-does-a-vpn-protect-your-privacy-and-anonymity">https://www.tomsguide.com/features/how-does-a-vpn-protect-your-privacy-and-anonymity</a></p><p>Start With Private Browsing — <a href="https://beencrypted.com/privacy/anonymous-browsing/private-browsers/">https://beencrypted.com/privacy/anonymous-browsing/private-browsers/</a></p><p>Why use Tor for Digital Privacy — <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/empowering-human-rights-defenders/">https://blog.torproject.org/empowering-human-rights-defenders/</a></p><p>Optional Financial Privacy — <a href="https://pivx.org/news/optional-privacy">https://pivx.org/news/optional-privacy</a></p><p>PIVX Shield Protocol— <a href="https://pivx.org/privacy-protocol">https://pivx.org/privacy-protocol</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/a-guide-to-digital-privacy-securing-your-digital-footprint-7b7065ceac8b">A Guide to Digital Privacy: Securing Your Digital Footprint</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Introduction 



<p>Web3’s technological innovation promises to deliver a new way to experience the web. Web3 uses decentralisation, open source, and transparency to transform the web journey as we know it in entertainment, gaming, social platforms in the metaverse, marketing, and so much more.</p>



<p>And speaking of journeys, the travel industry may soon embrace all that web3 has to offer to create more efficient, diverse, and richer experiences. In this article, we explore the best ways to use web3 technologies in the travel industry, such as:</p>



 
 Loyalty programs and tokenisation 



 More secure and privacy-focused travel data 



 Peer-to-peer travel marketplaces 
 



<p>Let’s start with using web3 to launch better loyalty programs!</p>



 Tokenised loyalty programs  



<p>Just a mere 40 years ago, the Holiday Inn chain introduced the very first customer loyalty program for the hospitality industry in 1983. Originally dubbed ‘Priority Club’, the idea was to keep customers coming back to Holiday Inn establishments by offering rewards and perks for returning customers. The idea took off, big time. Soon, all hotel chains introduced similar programs.</p>



<p>Since those pioneering days, <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-hotels-customer-loyalty/">customer loyalty programs</a> haven’t changed much. People get air miles exchangeable for discounted flights or other perks in the case of airlines, and hotel users get upgraded rooms, vouchers, discounts, etc. The mechanics and rewards remain much the same, and therein lie missed opportunities. Society has changed and evolved quite dramatically since the early days of customer loyalty programs. Particularly following the advent of the modern internet. In the era of streaming services and social media, customers have come to expect more personalised, engaging, and rich experiences. This is exactly web3’s purview.</p>



<p>Web3 technologies, particularly tokenisation, can drive much-enhanced customer loyalty programs in multiple ways. For example, traditional programs yield rewards that can only be redeemed in the issuer’s framework, they cannot be ported over anywhere else. This has some drawbacks. Airline Customer A may have earned a certain reward, which may or may not be suitable for different reasons. If Customer A cannot (or doesn’t want to) redeem this reward, they may lose it, as it may be time-sensitive, like a special offer. But this particular reward might just be what Customer B wants at this point in time! In a <a href="https://zaisan.io/web3-improve-customer-loyalty-travel-industry/">web3-enabled customer loyalty program</a>, that reward could be tokenised and traded between Customer A and Customer B. Such a system would facilitate customers to get the rewards that are better suited to them.</p>



<p>But reward tokenisation would go much further than that, of course. Imagine the possibility of redeeming tokenised rewards in a metaverse, for example. Not only would blockchain technology (one of the pillars of web3) allow redeeming rewards easily. It would enable their portability and interoperability between travel service providers operating in the metaverse.</p>



<p>All in all, the possibilities are endless with web3 enabling new ways of rewarding customers. As well as fostering collaboration between competitors, bringing benefits to the whole industry.</p>



 Secure and privacy-focused travel data  



<p>But what about all the personal data that gets thrown around during all stages of travelling? Travelling, especially across borders, requires the provision and handling of a lot of personal information. Passports contain extremely sensitive information. The same with ID cards. Credit card details when booking travel, accommodation, short trips, etc. People give airports, private companies, etc., a lot of data, which is often handled by third parties, as most companies, hotels, and tour operators in particular, wouldn’t have the expertise or capacity to handle cyber security.</p>



<p>The crux of the problem lies in the fact that most of these entities store vast amounts of data in centralised locations, often a database, which becomes a honeypot for adversaries to tap into. Airlines EasyJet and British Airways have been the target of hacking incidents in recent years, compromising the personal information of millions of customers. Prestigious hotel chain Marriott also suffered a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/6/23196805/marriott-hotels-maryland-data-breach-credit-cards">high-profile cyberattack</a> that, once again, exposed the personal information of millions of past guests. These incidents are unfortunately the result of doing business in the internet era, amplified by data centralisation.</p>



<p>Web3 offers a secure alternative through decentralisation and the use of self-sovereign identity (SSI). By decentralising data with blockchain, adversaries no longer have one singular target (that honeypot).</p>



<p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a revolutionary concept that is gaining traction in the world of digital identity management. In simple terms, SSI is a way for individuals to control their digital identity and personal information. And use it to interact with the world around them. This benefits users by providing them with a safe way to manage and share their personal information. It also takes away the burden from companies to manage and store this sensitive data.</p>



<p>In addition to the aforementioned benefits, it can also streamline the overall information-sharing process. This is done by having more easily accessible and verifiable credentials. And lastly, this can of course lead to cost reductions as travel companies have to spend less money and time on cyber security. All in all, <a href="https://zaisan.io/how-self-sovereign-identity-revolutionises-travel/">self-sovereign identity in the travel industry</a> is a great match.</p>



 Peer-to-Peer marketplaces for accommodations and experiences 



<p>Peer-to-peer marketplaces for accommodations and experiences have gained significant popularity within the travel industry. While platforms like Airbnb, Vrbo, HomeExchange, and Tripobox are well-known examples, numerous others exist. The defining characteristic of these platforms is their peer-to-peer nature, enabling direct communication between individuals worldwide. However, establishing trust among peers can be challenging due to the anonymity provided by intermediary platforms and the internet itself. The lack of transparency often leaves individuals uncertain about the legitimacy and trustworthiness of the accommodation or experience providers.</p>



<p>This is where web3 technology brings unique advantages that go beyond what traditional centralised approaches can offer. Web3 is built upon principles of decentralisation and transparency, with its foundation in blockchain technology. Unlike centralised systems that rely on intermediaries to facilitate transactions, web3 reduces the need for middlemen, resulting in a more cost-effective ecosystem.</p>



<p>By removing intermediaries, web3-powered marketplaces reduce the financial burden for both providers and consumers. In traditional platforms, intermediaries often charge substantial commissions or fees for their services, driving up the overall cost of accommodations and experiences. In contrast, web3-powered marketplaces cut out these intermediaries, resulting in significantly reduced costs. Participants can directly engage with one another, transact peer-to-peer, and eliminate the need for excessive fees. This cost reduction is a direct result of the decentralised nature of web3, where transactions occur directly between peers without intermediaries taking a significant cut.</p>



<p>Furthermore, thanks to web3’s transparency and immutability, all transactions are recorded and transparently available for anyone to verify. This increased transparency reduces the need for extensive auditing processes and provides a higher level of trust among participants. Consequently, the costs associated with verifying and ensuring transaction integrity are significantly reduced.</p>



<p>In addition to cost benefits, web3 technology offers enhanced security and trust. Blockchain-based smart contracts, an integral part of web3, provide automated and secure execution of agreements. These self-executing contracts reduce the need for intermediaries to enforce terms and conditions. By leveraging the power of smart contracts, participants can have greater confidence in the integrity of their transactions knowing that the agreed-upon terms will be automatically enforced without the risk of manipulation or fraud.</p>



<p>Web3’s decentralised nature and transparent infrastructure offer a unique combination of cost reduction, increased security, and enhanced trust within peer-to-peer marketplaces. By leveraging blockchain technology and eliminating intermediaries, web3-powered marketplaces create a more efficient and cost-effective ecosystem for travel-related transactions. The inherent advantages of web3 make it an ideal solution for revolutionising how accommodations, experiences, and other travel-related services are exchanged, benefiting providers and consumers alike.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The possibilities of web3-powered travel ecosystems remain largely unexplored, but the possibilities are certainly tantalising. This is far from the only application of web3 to the travel industry, however, as this article explores. Cost reduction thanks to the reduction of middlemen, higher security through SSI and decentralisation, and a richer travel experience mean that web3 may be the greatest thing ever happening to this industry since commercial aviation went mainstream.</p>

<p>At Electric Coin Co. (ECC) we’re exploring a transition in Zcash from the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. We are proposing a step on this path that we call the Trailing Finality Layer (TFL). If deployed, this would be combined with Zcash’s existing consensus; the resulting consensus protocol at that point would be a hybrid of PoW and PoS.</p>



<p>The overall goal is to enable finality and PoS on Zcash in a minimally disruptive manner. Finality is a guarantee that once a block is finalized, that block and the transactions it contains cannot be rolled back. Finality can reduce delays for some use cases (such as centralized exchange deposit wait times) and enable new improvements such as safer cross-chain bridges.</p>



<p>If the TFL approach is adopted by the Zcash community, it could enable some new use cases, such as staking ZEC to earn protocol rewards, while minimizing disruption to existing use cases. Mining is an example of a process that would be impacted in a hybrid model, as mining rewards would be reduced while the rest of mining infrastructure and processes would remain unchanged.</p>



<p>We also aim to minimize disruption to analysis of consensus security, as many of the existing consensus properties remain intact in a hybrid model.</p>



<p>We’ve only begun to define the design of this PoW/PoS hybrid protocol. Many key details remain open questions, as we expand on below. By sharing our approach early in this process, we’re aiming to gather and incorporate feedback as we go, find potential collaborators, and stimulate discussion about this approach.</p>



 Get involved 



<p>If you’re interested in providing feedback or collaborating on this project, please get in touch! A good opportunity to learn more and join the conversation is to attend (in person or virtually) the <a href="https://whova.com/embedded/session/6W6CVuwNSO8o7hBUa0XP4cZfCTJZ3XtLyV1Q8NcE00w%3D/3208452/?widget=primary">Interactive Design of a Zcash Trailing Finality Layer</a> workshop I’m leading at <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcon4/">Zcon4</a>. Also feel free to email me, <a href="mailto:nathan@electriccoin.co">nathan@electriccoin.co</a>, about your interest. We’re looking for contributors from a wide range of backgrounds, including technical, product, community, and any Zcash users who want to weigh in as the proposal evolves.</p>



 PoS transition background 



<p>ECC previously shared our rationale for why we believe it’s in the best interest of current and future ZEC users to transition the protocol to proof of stake in the blog post <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/should-zcash-switch-from-proof-of-work-to-proof-of-stake/">Should Zcash transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake?</a> and the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcon3-3/">Zcon3</a> presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB9Vh1kEeWs&amp;list=PL40dyJ0UYTLJm-Cl7ez3UXp8R4IuUNDfb&amp;index=23">Motivations of Proof of Stake</a>. In 2022, we published a high-level overview of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRZkqGD5kFg&amp;list=PL40dyJ0UYTLJm-Cl7ez3UXp8R4IuUNDfb&amp;index=24">Proof-of-Stake Research</a> approach, a more detailed <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/proof-of-stake-research-overview-1/">Approach, Focus, and Next Steps</a> companion post, and gave a Zcon3 presentation about high-level design challenges in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRZkqGD5kFg&amp;list=PL40dyJ0UYTLJm-Cl7ez3UXp8R4IuUNDfb&amp;index=24">Proof of Stake</a>.</p>



 A proof-of-stake transition path 



<p>Our vision for a transition to proof of stake includes at least two major milestones:</p>



 
 Moving Zcash from its current proof-of-work model to a hybrid PoW/PoS system. 



 Moving Zcash from a hybrid PoW/PoS system to pure PoS. 
 



<p>Our primary motivation for proposing (at least) two steps is to minimize disruption of usability, safety, security, and the ecosystem during each step.</p>



<p>This approach of transitioning from PoW to hybrid to PoS was executed by Ethereum with the deployment of the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/beacon-chain/">Beacon Chain</a> (hybrid) then <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/">The Merge</a> (pure PoS).&nbsp;</p>



 Design goals for a hybrid PoW/PoS system 



<p>ECC is refining the design of TFL with several goals in mind, and we’ll potentially be adding more as we continue to develop this proposal. Currently:</p>



 
 We want to minimize disruption to existing wallet use cases and UX. For example, nothing should change in the user flows for storing or transferring funds, the format of addresses, etc. 



 We want to minimize complexity of security analyses by preserving existing analysis results where possible. 



 We want to enable new PoS use cases that allow mobile shielded wallet users to earn a return on delegated ZEC. 



 We want to enable trust-minimized bridges and other benefits by providing a protocol with finality. 



 We want to improve the modularity of the consensus protocol. Modularity has several loosely defined and related meanings, e.g., it’s possible to understand some consensus properties only given knowledge of a component of the protocol, and it’s possible to implement consensus rules in modular code components with clean interfaces. 
 



 Trailing Finality Layer in a nutshell 



<p>The hybrid PoW/PoS protocol we envision at ECC is structured like today’s Zcash NU5 protocol with a new Trailing Finality Layer. We describe it as a layer, because the existing nodes and most of their logic will continue to operate largely as-is with minimal changes, while much of the new functionality will be provided by new, supplementary components and network protocols.</p>



<a href="https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pow-tfl-1.png"></a>The left diagram shows the current Zcash network, with a detail that illustrates how two nodes are connected to each other within the context of the entire network. The right shows the addition of the TFL after deployment: Each node continues to have its original PoW component, but now has an additional TFL component. The PoW components still connect to each other, as before, and TFL components use distinct connections to other TFL components.



<p>This new layer provides the blockchain with a trailing finality guarantee: after blocks are mined they can be finalized meaning they may not be rolled back. This guarantee extends to any of the transactions within the blocks. It is trailing because this finality property follows the PoW mining system “trailing behind it.”</p>



<p>Because this hybrid design relies fully on PoW for producing new blocks, this protocol is resistant to halting in the same way Bitcoin or current Zcash is — although the finality guarantee may stall, as we describe next.This design paradigm has both a theoretical and practical track record: It is analyzed in a research paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04987">Ebb-and-Flow Protocols</a>, and it is the same paradigm used by Ethereum both in the pre-Merge hybrid design of the Beacon chain as well as in current day Ethereum.</p>



 Why finality matters 



<p>Nakamoto PoW consensus, introduced with Bitcoin and inherited by Zcash, provides probabilistic finality. This means the chance that a block can be rolled back falls as more blocks are mined.</p>



<p>In our view, the primary challenge with this kind of finality is that different participants independently react to rollbacks. For example, probably most participants anticipate 1-block rollbacks (which are relatively common), but as the size of rollbacks grow larger, three challenges emerge:</p>



 
 Larger rollbacks become more rare, so some participants may not have a process or policy for handling that situation. 



 Different participants may have different policies, so in the event of a large rollback, the ecosystem may fracture as different participants disagree on how to recover. 



 When counterparties require a sufficiently low tolerance for rollbacks, their interaction must incur a substantial delay. 
 



<p>Example: trust-minimized bridge</p>



<p>To drive this point home, consider the valuable use case of a trust-minimized bridge: ZEC sent into a bridge must be locked up while an equivalent number of proxy tokens are issued on another network.</p>



<p>If a rollback reverts a bridge deposit after the proxy tokens are issued elsewhere, those ZEC are no longer locked in the bridge, and the proxy tokens are now unbacked. This breaks the peg of the bridge, and many bridge users will simultaneously lose funds. If the bridge designers decide to require enough PoW blocks to make the probability of this event astronomically small, then issuing the proxy tokens on the other network will have an extremely large delay.</p>



<p>Example: exchange deposits</p>



<p>If a user deposits ZEC on a centralized exchange, their account on the exchange is credited the appropriate amount. If a rollback of this deposit occurs, the exchange accounting now has more ZEC liabilities than actual ZEC held.</p>



<p>Exchanges seek to address this by requiring more PoW blocks to reach a sufficiently low probability of this event. However, this is a balancing act: If an exchange imposes a delay of n hours, the probability is still not “astronomically small,” so users are inconvenienced by n hours and the exchange still carries a practical risk of a liability overhang event.</p>



<p>Additionally, because of challenge number 2 above, different exchanges require different deposit delays, which potentially confuses users and puts exchanges into competition to take on more risk by accepting fewer block confirmations.</p>



 Finality 



<p>In contrast to probabilistic finality, a consensus protocol may provide a finality guarantee. Protocols that do this ensure that all participants agree on which set of blocks and transactions are final. The trade-off is that finality may fail to make progress in the event of network disruptions. Once the network recovers, the trailing finality can “catch up” to the PoW blocks which were produced in the interim.<a>1</a></p>



<p>Practically, this means if participants are waiting for a transaction to become final, sometimes they may need to wait an arbitrarily long amount of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finality addresses all three challenges to some degree:</p>



 
 Participants now no longer need to anticipate rollbacks of varying probabilities when designing their procedures and policies. Instead, they must anticipate the risk that sometimes finality fails to progress in a timely fashion. 



 All participants agree exactly which blocks and transactions are final, though they may disagree on how to react if finality is stalled for long periods of time. 



 Participants may now rely on the finality guarantee to ensure they only react to some transactions when there is zero chance of the transaction being reverted. 
 



<p>In the examples above:</p>



 
 A trust-minimized bridge can rely on finality for issuing proxy tokens. This ensures the bridge will never be under-collateralized. The trade-off is that as long as finality stalls, cross-bridge transfers will also be stalled. 



 All exchanges can use the same finality guarantee, so users can expect the same deposit delay everywhere (and it is likely to be notably lower than the status quo). The trade-off is that if finality stalls, new deposits will also be stalled, though all exchanges will behave consistently in this regard. 
 



<p>The end result for users is that some high-value interactions (such as bridging or exchange deposits) will now be faster and safer most of the time. Sometimes finality may stall. When finality resumes, it will “catch up” to the PoW chain, so users who don’t need the finality guarantee can continue using this hybrid protocol, similarly to how they use Zcash today, and be unaffected if finality stalls.</p>



 Status and open questions 



<p>This blog post introduction covers most of our R&amp;D, so far, on the TFL design. There are still many open issues that need to be resolved with collaboration and input from the Zcash community before a TFL design is ready as a proposal for a Zcash upgrade.</p>



<p>An incomplete list of issues that still need to be resolved include:</p>



 
 Is this general approach acceptable to the Zcash community? 



 How will new ZEC issuance be distributed between PoW, PoS, and any potential Dev Fund successor? This is a key concern for both miners and potential stakers or delegators.
 
 How can we integrate any other changes to issuance mechanics, such as the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/the-zcash-posterity-fund/42703/58">Zcash Sustainability Fund</a>? 
 
 



 All of the PoS accounting mechanics, such as how bonding works, how delegation works, what kinds of slashing may occur, withdrawal delays and mechanics, etc. 



 How would PoS operations interact with all other Zcash ledger activities, such as shielded pools, etc.? This will be a key area for understanding how privacy and staking interact. 



 Should the chain tip ever stall in order to bound the gap between the finalized block and the chain tip? 



 Detailed security analyses, including economic security, a case analysis of PoW capture, PoS capture, network security (esp. given two separate network protocols/layers). 



 How can we ensure mobile shielded wallets are first-class participants? For example, can we ensure they can safely and efficiently delegate stake and manage stake-delegation positions? This includes both UX issues, like delegation UI flows, as well as implementation, such as lightwalletd protocol changes. 



 How to integrate any TFL protocol changes with other proposed protocol changes in a safe and timely manner. Examples: <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/the-zcash-posterity-fund/42703/58">Zcash Sustainability Fund</a>, <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/grant-update-zcash-shielded-assets-monthly-updates/41153">Zcash Shielded Assets</a>, <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/proposed-architecture-for-a-zcash-namada-ibc-ecosystem-ethereum-ecosystem-non-custodial-bridge-using-frost-multisignatures/42749">bridging efforts</a>, <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/rfc-proposal-for-a-strategic-alliance-between-namada-and-zcash/44372">Namada integrations</a>, etc. 



 Selection of a specific finalizing PoS protocol. We are currently focusing on using Tendermint and ABCI as a way to rapidly prototype and validate the design. 



 Prototypes, testnets, code architecture, etc. 
 



<p>As we address the open issues above, especially the interaction with other protocol features and coordination with those teams on timing, we can begin to refine a deployment timeline.</p>



 Next steps 



<p>Our next steps for this TFL R&amp;D initiative are to get community feedback on this blog, host a workshop at Zcon4, and produce R&amp;D updates on the open issues above.</p>



<p>As we collaborate with other protocol development teams, we’d like to create a tentative deployment timeline that incorporates all of the other protocol feature efforts such as the Zcash Sustainability Fund, Zcash Shielded Assets, and potential cross-chain bridge efforts.</p>



<p>Finally, we’re seeking out other teams or individuals who are interested in collaborating on this TFL project, so if you’re interested, please see the <a>Get involved</a> section above.</p>



 



<p>1 In a pure finalizing PoS protocol, the equivalent “stalls” are actually network-wide halts. One strength of this hybrid design is that PoW need not halt, and if it doesn’t then users who do not depend on finality can continue using the network.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in recent years, particularly with the rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). These innovations have sparked our collective imagination, turning once fictional concepts into tangible products used by companies at scale. However, the process of training these models is both resource-intensive and expensive. Traditional cloud service providers can charge thousands of dollars per day for a single server instance, and demand for machine learning is rapidly increasing. In fact, the Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) market was valued at $5.7 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow to $31 billion in the next five&nbsp;years.</p><p>Interestingly, the computing power used for mining cryptocurrencies is more than 2.5 times larger than that of AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure combined. This begs the question: what if cryptocurrency mining could be used to train machine learning&nbsp;models?</p><p><a href="https://tromero.org/">Tromero</a> has developed an innovative Proof of Useful Work consensus mechanism that allows distributed, decentralized computers to earn block rewards and fees by successfully training machine learning models. Unlike traditional proof of work systems such as Bitcoin, which rely on computationally expensive math problems for miners to solve in order to secure the network, Tromero’s approach replaces this process with useful machine learning model training.</p><p>Overall, Tromero’s technology offers a promising solution to the resource-intensive and expensive process of training machine learning models. By using their Proof of Useful Work consensus mechanism, companies can reduce computing costs and even generate revenue by contributing their computing power to train&nbsp;models.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>To anyone watching technology news, it’s clear that we are currently in a (well deserved) bubble of hype and excitement around artificial intelligence. But, regardless of how the immediate crop of projects turns out, it is certain that the demand for training and fine-tuning ML models will continue to rise, all while compute costs remain&nbsp;high.</p><p>Tromero provides a solution to these cost and supply pressures by supplying compute providers and miners a stream of revenue to optimize their return on capital. Given the industry’s inability to keep up with demand for machine learning hardware, a compute network using crypto-economic incentives to drive utilization should result in a more balanced, democratized, and efficient network of machine learning resources.</p>

      AI and the Frontier Paradox         
	By Konstantine Buhler	 



Animation: James Buckhouse



Published July 18, 2023
        We’ve been calling many different technologies AI for more than half a century. What we think of as AI is going to change again. And again.      



 
<p>Sequoia founder Don Valentine would ask founders two questions: “why now?” and “so what?” At the heart of these questions is the combination of curiosity and rigor that asks what has changed in the world (why now?) and what will this mean (so what?).&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI has a compelling “why now?” with the development of large language models (LLMs) trained with the Transformer architecture. Transformers are well-suited to GPUs, making it practical to marshall immense amounts of data and compute to train AI models with billions and trillions of parameters.</p>



<p>We also now have a persuasive “so what?” These technologies have enabled a whole new user interface for computers: human language. Just like the graphical user interface made the personal computer accessible to millions of customers in the 1980s, so too have the new natural language interfaces made AI accessible to hundreds of millions of users worldwide in the past year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence has endured many up and down cycles. When AI is in ascent, as it is now, the term is overused to include not only the leading edge of predictive technology but also any software that is in some sense “smart.” During previous AI Winters, however, researchers retreated to safer terms like machine learning.</p>



 The AI effect 



<p>John McCarthy coined the term AI in the 1950s to distinguish his research from his older rival Norbert Wiener’s cybernetics. Yet McCarthy himself became disenchanted with the term, complaining, “As soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.” McCarthy called the tendency of people to rename past AI efforts with more functional descriptions as soon as they were sufficiently solved the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect">AI effect</a>” and it affects us to this day. The history of AI is littered with accomplishments that have worked well enough to no longer be considered sufficiently intelligent to earn the aspirational monniker.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a quick refresher, consider computer vision which underpins current advances in image generation. For a long time, detecting objects in images or videos was cutting edge AI, now it’s just one of many technologies that allow you to order an autonomous vehicle ride from Waymo in San Francisco. We no longer call it AI. Soon we’ll just call it a car. Similarly, object detection on ImageNet was a major breakthrough of deep learning in 2012 and is now on every smartphone. No longer AI.</p>



<p>On the natural language side, there’s a long history before ChatGPT, Claude and Bard burst on the scene. I remember using Dragon Speech-To-Text circa 2002 to type emails when I had a broken arm. What was once called AI is now just “dictation” and is on every phone and computer. Language translation and sentiment analysis, once hard problems in NLP, are now mostly table stakes. Not AI.</p>



<p>It’s also easy to forget how much of what we take for granted on the cloud emerged from previous AI disciplines like recommendation systems (Netflix and Amazon) and path optimization (Google Maps and UPS). The more everyday a thing becomes, the less likely we are to call it AI.</p>



 The trough of disillusionment 



<p>What is considered AI and what is not is important to founders because in the long run it’s always better to underpromise and overdeliver. In what Gartner has described over decades of technological hype cycles, the wild enthusiasm is invariably followed by disappointment—the trough of disillusionment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founders benefit in the short term from the buzzy marketing, but at a cost. Arthur C. Clark famously wrote, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” But he was a science fiction writer. Machine Learning practitioners are scientists and engineers and yet at first blush their efforts always appear to be magic—until one day it’s not.</p>



<p>The current AI paradigm is like chasing a carrot on a stick while running on a treadmill. For today’s founders I think it’s time to break this cycle by understanding what’s really going on.</p>



 A more precise vocabulary 



<p>There is a linguistic reason we keep making the same mistakes. If we use the Oxford English Dictionary to recursively dissect the term “Artificial Intelligence” we find:</p>



 
 Artificial: made or produced by human beings rather than occurring naturally, especially as a copy of something natural. 



 Intelligence:the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.
 
 Knowledge: facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. 



 Skills: the ability to do something well. 
 
 
 



<p>Each branch of this recursive definition hinges on either “human beings” or “a person.” So by definition we think of AI as imitative of humans. Think of the Turing test. But as soon as a capacity is firmly in the realm of machines, we lose the human reference point and we cease to think of it as AI.</p>



<p>Part of this is human exceptionalism. Over the centuries we have elevated the aspects of intelligence that seem uniquely human: language, imagination, creativity and logic. We reserve certain words for ourselves. Humans think and reason, computers calculate. Humans make art, computers generate it. Humans swim, boats and submarines do not. And yet “computer” was once a 17th century job title for a human that calculated, and we employed rooms full of them before we formalized mechanical and electronic computers.</p>



<p>The AI effect is actually part of a larger human phenomenon we call the frontier paradox. Because we ascribe to humans the frontier beyond our technological mastery, that frontier will always be ill-defined. Intelligence is not a thing that we can capture but an ever-approaching horizon that we turn into useful tools. Technology is the artifice of intelligence forged over millennia of human collaboration and competition.</p>



<p>Back in 2018, I was inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intelligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7">a post</a> from Berkeley Statistics and Computer Science professor Michael Jordan. “Whether or not we come to understand ‘intelligence’ any time soon,” he wrote, “we do have a major challenge on our hands in bringing together computers and humans in ways that enhance human life. While this challenge is viewed by some as subservient to the creation of ‘artificial intelligence,’ it can also be viewed more prosaically—but with no less reverence—as the creation of a new branch of engineering.”</p>



<p>This led me to write <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-rose-any-other-name-konstantine-buhler/">my own post</a> questioning the usefulness of calling this endeavor AI at all.&nbsp; Five years later, are we any closer to Jordan’s vision of a practical infrastructure for human augmentation? I believe we are, but we need a more precise vocabulary to harness the computational opportunity ahead.</p>

 Why now? 



<p>The amazing effectiveness of LLMs to generate coherent and believable language has taken almost everyone by surprise. The ability of diffusion models to generate highly-detailed and aesthetically appealing images from text descriptions has also surpassed conventional assumptions. And there’s much more on the horizon in terms of further improvements in language and images, generalization to video, and new innovations in robotics, autonomous vehicles, biology, chemistry and medicine.</p>



<p>All of these advances benefit from the infrastructure for distributed computing that the last wave of hyper-scaled tech companies built in the cloud. They also benefit from the sheer scale of data that has accumulated on the internet, particularly thanks to the ubiquity of highly usable mobile devices with their cameras, sensors and ease of data entry.</p>



<p>But calling all of these things AI confuses the public and founders about what really needs to be built and how to bring it all together in safe and moral ways that encourage both experimentation and responsible behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given all of this amazing infrastructure, AI as a science project at the intersection of computer science, physics, cognitive and neuroscience will surely advance along the frontier of understanding. It will continue to contribute useful applications as well, but if we call all of them AI, the term will quickly lose its meaning and its novelty.</p>



 So what? 



<p>Experts estimate that even with information retrieval, LLMs are accurate ~90% of the time. There is still a lot of research and scaling to get to 99%. However, once they reach that 99% they will no longer be AI, they will be “language interfaces” or simply LLMs. You will be able to write code on the fly, communicate with people in other languages, learn or teach anything we are interested in, and more. The impact will be real. But we will not call it AI. These new capabilities will become invisible to us, additional parts of our extended minds along with our search engines and smartphones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the frontier paradox in action. AI is accelerating so quickly that it will soon simply be technology and a new frontier will be AI. Graduating to technology should be seen as a badge of honor for an idea that previously was on the cutting edge of possible. The frontier paradox means AI will perpetually refer to aspirational approaches, while technology will refer to what can be put to work today. It is our belief that we need both.&nbsp;</p>



 What’s next? 



<p>At Sequoia we have tried to become more precise about how we discuss AI internally and with founders. We focus on specific technologies that can be put to work, like transformers for large language models or diffusion for image generation. This makes our ability to evaluate a venture much more explicit, tangible and real.</p>



<p>The entrepreneurial journey starts with language. It is only through language that companies can express the uniqueness of their product and its benefit to customers long before it is ready to ship. The precision of language is the key to category creation, company design and market leadership—the components that make enduring companies.</p>



<p>This precision is even more important as founders surf the rising waves of AI to stay right on the frontier. The founders who can define language as this frontier turns into everyday technology will have a distinct advantage.</p>



 



<p>If you’re founding a company pushing the frontier of AI into useful technology, we’d love to hear from you. Ambitious founders can increase their odds of success by applying to Arc, our catalyst for pre-seed and seed stage companies.

<p>Dear community,</p><p>Stage 0 of our Testnet is live, and we are more than happy with how the testing process is going. So far:</p>  136 addresses have received miner rewards.  4223 batches have been added to the Bus tree (numBatchesInBusTree).  67862 UTXOs were processed in these batches (numUtxosInBusTree).  <p>(Ongoing data from &nbsp;<a href="https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x678D34aA4fc546bA806287a8289FfdAA84681a03?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#readProxyContract">https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x678D34aA4fc546bA806287a8289FfdAA84681a03#readProxyContract</a>) <br></p>Fetch the latest data from the Mumbai network yourself!<p>Other preliminary results from this testing phase tell us that: </p>  The iteration algorithm (one-run Miner client usage with a cold start) works as expected.  We have validated the number of miners needed to support the protocol at a projected (optimistic) capacity. According to data, 5-10 permanently-online miners are enough resources to support the protocol’s users.  Possible optimization areas are available and will be addressed.  <p>Both regular end-users and a tech-savvy group of profoundly involved community members have engaged with this stage. The latter has gone above and beyond, &nbsp;interacting with the docker image and even updating it to circumvent some limitations (well done!) &nbsp;</p><p>The past few days of Stage 0 testing generated as much data as the protocol is expected to generate during a few weeks with our projected workload. </p><p>Now that our target is achieved in terms of data flow, we are switching to mining reward mechanics and sets of parameters that aim to optimize how rewards are distributed and queues are mined.</p> Links and details of the new version  <p>The new version aims to address a bug in which the in-browser Miner client isn’t able to iterate through batches, fetching them from a graph. </p><p>The smart contracts were also updated to limit the mining of semi-empty queues. To limit semi-empty queue mining, this commit introduces a requirement of "maturity" for queues:</p>  A partially populated queue must remain pending processing for a number of blocks, which declines linearly with the number of UTXOs in the queue (fully populated queues are processable immediately).  The above number of blocks (every block on Mumbai is ~2 sec) that a partially populated queue is disabled for mining, counted from the block when the 1st UTXO was added to the queue, is now computed as follows (rounded down): <br>  <blockquote>N = 100 * (64 - number_of_UTXOs) / 64</blockquote><p>Note that “100” above is an adjustable parameter that might be tweaked further.</p><p>You can find the updated versions of the following:</p>  The browser-based Panther Miner Client at: <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmae7K54pW8uzHZcnisym6F5gTrcjQDci8w5Z4XKyDQ7Tk?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmae7K54pW8uzHZcnisym6F5gTrcjQDci8w5Z4XKyDQ7Tk</a> (This option is no longer available).  The docker image via the existing link at: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pantherprotocol/miner-client?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://hub.docker.com/r/pantherprotocol/miner-client</a>.   <p>Note that: </p>  Only ~20 new queues per hour are available for mining. This and other parameters influencing rewards may be tweaked this week as a part of the test program.  The new Miner will have significantly higher chances of mining a queue than the previous one.   Digging into the Panther Miner <p>The current code of the Miner aims to test features (SDK) that will support two particular cases in Panther's v1:<br><br>1. To mine a particular queue (for which the user is a pending UTXO owner) when miners are unavailable as a service for whatever reason. Once Panther’s v1 is released, you will be able to mine the queue containing your UTXO yourself.</p><p>2. To run in-browser while the user has the dApp open (for a short time relative to a dedicated node Miner). This will be optional and triggered by the users themselves.</p><p>It should be noted that the current Miner implementation is not about continuous usage and supporting a high load; its goal is to test iterative flows and non-standard/less expected use cases (e.g., miners not being available). </p><p>At a later stage, the next version of the Miner client will be released to satisfy the protocol mining needs at a multi-network stage. Besides the existing features, this version, known as the Panther Node, will also support data indexing and inter-chain transactions, running for a long time without the need for restarts.</p><p>It’s been great to see your support for this first Testnet phase. Keep going, keep testing –and thank you, Panthers!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther’s zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services. </p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="http://docs.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Documentation·</a> <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

    <p>Q2 was a quarter full of growth and exciting new milestones for the Horizen ecosystem, including the launch of our EVM-compatible sidechain EON on permanent public testnet Gobi, bringing an influx of developer activity onto Horizen, as well as some exciting new partnerships and integrations!</p>
<p>We launched several new products and upgrades, grew the team, welcomed our EVM sidechain, EON, to permanent public testnet Gobi, and more! We are excited to continue meeting new milestones with our growing community.</p>
<p></p>
 Horizen EON Q2 Review&nbsp; 
 EON Permanent Testnet – Gobi&nbsp; 
<p>In April, Horizen EON launched on our permanent public testnet, Gobi! Gobi testnet has many improvements and new features since the previous testnets, it is the final beta stage before the EON mainnet activation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-is-now-live-on-gobi-testnet-with-bug-bounties/">See here</a> for detailed information about the above new features on Gobi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A ton of work was done on the infrastructure as well, both by improving the Node Gateway (our public RPC, available on Chainlist) and by building and integrating the Secure Enclave for certifiers that won’t have to worry about their signing keys, given they are stored in a secure remote environment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have made improvements to our networking layer, enhancing overall performance. This optimization translates into faster and more reliable communication within our ecosystem. Our dedication to security has led us to engage in rigorous theoretical analysis. This in-depth evaluation has allowed us to fine-tune our consensus mechanism, ensuring optimal parameters.</p>
<p>Interoperability is one of many capabilities the team focused on in Q2:</p>
 
 Native &lt;&gt; traditional smart contracts interoperability 
 Sidechain-to-sidechain full workflow with real circuits completed and circuits were audited with success. This crucial interoperability protocol allows for seamless communication between different sidechains within the Horizen ecosystem. 
 
<p>First Sidechain Hardfork&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Gobi, we successfully conducted the <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/eon-updates-upcoming-gobi-testnet-upgrade/">first hardfork on a Horizen sidechain</a>! The team has revised the fork manager to handle optional fork points, and this is a feature of the underlying Sidechains-SDK. </p>
 EON Developer Tools and Resources 
<p>We have extensive documentation and tutorials for our EON users, be sure to check out some of the links below to start building, and be sure to reach out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord</a> with any questions!</p>

 EON Partnerships and Integrations 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230426005549/en/Horizen-Integrates-Covalent-for-EON-the-New-Public-EVM-Compatible-Sidechain-on-Horizen-to-Bring-Data-Visibility-and-Unified-Data-Points-to-Developers">Horizen Integrates Covalent for EON, the New Public EVM-Compatible Sidechain on Horizen, to Bring Data Visibility and Unified Data Points to Developers</a></p>
<p>In April we announced a partnership with <a href="https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/horizen-gobi-testnet/">Covalent</a>, a Web3 data provider trusted by over 40,000 developers. The partnership will bring about massive data accessibility and transparency to Horizen’s EVM-compatible smart contracting platform, EON, and provide its developers billions of data points and comprehensive insights into on-chain data. This integration will accelerate the process of achieving a permissionless, interoperable, customizable sidechain network on Horizen, as well as allow developers to leverage an increasingly accelerated volume of blockchain data points to efficiently build and deploy dApps on Horizen EON.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-band-protocol-to-deliver-decentralized-oracle-services-for-eon">Horizen Integrates Band Protocol</a></p>
<p>Horizen has also integrated Band Protocol, a cross-chain data oracle platform, that will provide real-time price feeds and reliable data for Horizen EON. This integration allows developers to enhance and extend their smart contract capabilities on Horizen’s EON.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-ankr-as-one-of-the-first-rpc-providers-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform">Horizen Partners with Ankr</a></p>
<p>Horizen added <a href="https://www.ankr.com/rpc/horizen/">Ankr</a>, a leading web3 infrastructure provider to its ecosystem. This collaboration will make Ankr one of the first Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers for EON – unlocking additional access, scalability, and reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-auros-to-enhance-liquidity-for-its-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform-eon">Horizen Partners with Auros to Enhance Liquidity for EON</a></p>
<p>In June, we announced a partnership with Auros, a global arithmetic trading, and market-making firm that will increase widespread access to $ZEN in preparation for the launch of the EON ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership is set to drive significant growth for the EON ecosystem. Enhanced liquidity for the $ZEN token across centralized and decentralized exchanges, underpinning many functionalities of the EON ecosystem, will increase opportunities for traders, DeFi users, and builders to participate in one of the fastest growing layer-0. Besides instant liquidity provision, this long-term partnership will extend beyond the $ZEN token to future projects building on EON, providing bespoke support based on the unique needs of each project.</p>

 Upcoming Deprecation of the Horizen Mainchain Shielded Pools 
<p>The Horizen community recently approved <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204</a> for the deprecation of the Horizen mainchain shielded pools – the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, which will prevent shielded transaction (T addresses to Z addresses) support at the consensus level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the deprecation of mainchain shielded pools, all privacy features will be removed from Horizen main blockchain at the consensus level. This also means ZEN will no longer be a privacy coin after this change.</p>
<p>The purpose of the deprecation is to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risks. It proposes a solution to eliminate technical debt and avoid regulatory threats that can prevent the greater Horizen community from fully and freely participating in our ecosystem.</p>
<p>The deprecation of the Horizen mainchain shielded pools will be implemented as part of the upcoming mandatory software upgrade of ZEN 4.1. The target release windows are as follows:</p>
<p>Testnet – August 2023</p>
<p>Mainnet – September 2023</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/upcoming-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">Learn more about the upcoming deprecation in our blog post.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoinDesk also featured this news in an article – <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/horizen-scraps-privacy-coin-moniker-amid-regulatory-scrutiny/">“Horizen Scraps Privacy Coin Moniker Amid Regulatory Scrutiny”</a>, including <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/video/horizen-sheds-privacy-coin-moniker-amid-global-regulatory-scrutiny/">an interview</a> discussing the move with Horizen co-founder and CEO of Horizen Labs, Rob Viglione.</p>
 Cryptography Research 
<p>The Horizen Labs cryptography team has been busy during Q2 – participating in many different research projects and initiatives!</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@horizenlabs-tech/introducing-poseidon2-559c1b33b102">Introducing Poseidon2</a></p>
<p>The upgraded hash function is optimized for speed and ease of use in zero-knowledge applications. Efficient hash functions play a major role in modern zero-knowledge (ZK) settings. One of these hash functions, Poseidon, has found use in many of the currently used protocols, including Zcash and Mina. However, improvements can be made to its performance, functionality, and usability to adopt it for a wider range of applications. We identify those improvements and present Poseidon2, a faster version of Poseidon.</p>
<p>To advance the application and adoption of zero-knowledge technology, Horizen Labs collaborated with Ethereum Foundation and Ponos Technology on Poseidon2. For more details, we refer to the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/323.pdf">full paper.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@horizenlabs-tech/the-best-of-both-worlds-how-to-transform-zk-proofs-951c9b3d3bcd">The Best of Both Worlds: How to Transform ZK Proofs</a></p>
<p>Plonky2 is an efficient ZKP system for constructing succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge. Groth16 is a widely used ZKP system based on bilinear pairings, known for its strong security and efficiency in generating zk-SNARKs. In this article, discover how Horizen Labs’ research aims to revolutionize both worlds to make them more decentralized and scalable.</p>
<p>At Horizen Labs, we have a strong cryptography team specializing in the usage of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Two types of ZKPs used in blockchain are STARKs and SNARKs. STARKs are transparent and fast, while SNARKs have smaller proofs. While these two types of ZKPs are often used separately, our team has recently discovered how to transform STARK (Plonky2) to a SNARK (Groth16) in order to reduce proof size and increase speed.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will delve into the significance of this transformation and explain how Horizen users will benefit from it.</p>

<p>Blockchains are secured through the economic incentives offered to their validators/miners. The more robust the network effect among validators, the more difficult it is for that blockchain to be compromised. However, building a truly decentralised and reliable validator set is not a trivial task. As a result, hub and spoke ecosystem designs like Cosmos’ (and even Polkadot’s), aim to share the main hub’s validator set and security to their ‘consumer’ chains (parachains in Polkadot’s case). Neutron relies on interchain queries, interchain accounts and interchain (replicated) security to deliver the most secure CosmWasm smart contract platform in the Cosmos ecosystem. </p><p>We were joined by Avril Dutheil, GM at Neutron, to discuss Neutron’s smart contract platform and how it leverages replicated security (ICS) and interchain accounts (ICA).</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Avril’s background and the value prop behind Neutron  Practical examples  Interchain accounts and different use cases  Interchain security  Atom hub vs. Polkadot relay chain. Onboarding and security models  Offboarding Cosmos consumer chains  Replicated security vs. Modular blockchains  Neutron’s token utility and governance  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/0xSpaydh">Avril Dutheil</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Neutron_org">Neutron on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch &amp; Meher Roy.

It’s goal is to enshrine MEV into the protocol in order to maximise the value capture of the network and to tackle the centralising forces that arise from PBS head on. Enshrining an MEV auction forces builders to take part in a first price auction onchain for profitable blocks.</p><p>In each iteration, a proposer can submit a commitment to transactions within a block, as well as the percentage of block rewards (fees) that will be distributed amongst the proving network, and a amount of native network tokens to be&nbsp;burned.</p><p>Staked provers will then vote on which blocks they would like to work on, where rational provers will vote in the direction of maximizing their profits. These votes will be then used to calculate the block’s score, and the block with the highest rated score that gets published via a rollup and validated on L1 will become the canonical head of the&nbsp;chain.</p><blockquote><a href="https://hackmd.io/VIeqkDnMScG1B-DIVIyPLg">Here is an updated version of&nbsp;B52</a></blockquote> Fernet <p>Author: Santiago Palladino @ Aztec&nbsp;Labs</p><p>Fair Election Randomized Natively on Ethereum Trustlessly (Fernet) is a protocol for random sequencer selection. In each iteration, it relies on a VRF to assign a random secret score to each sequencer in order to rank them; each sequencer can then decide to propose a block or not based on their expected rank. Each sequencer proposes just an ordering for transactions.</p><p>After the initial phase where sequencers can reveal their scores and block proposals, provers choose which proposal they want to construct a proof for. In the event of multiple submissions, the one from the sequencer with the highest score (i.e. VRF) wins, so provers are expected to flock to the submission with the highest rank, avoiding redundant work.</p><p>Block proposals provide early confirmations in the happy path, whereas finality is only achieved at the end of a proving&nbsp;phase.</p><p>Contributions/acknowledgments: Mike Conner @ Aztec Labs, Espresso&nbsp;Systems</p><blockquote><a href="https://hackmd.io/0FwyoEjKSUiHQsmowXnJPw">Here is an updated version of&nbsp;Fernet</a></blockquote> Retroactive Grants <p>We are excited to award <a href="https://www.espressosys.com/">Espresso Systems</a> two retroactive grants for their proposals <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/proposal-sequencer-selection-irish-coffee/483">Irish Coffee</a> and <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/proposal-sequencer-selection-espresso-martini/486">Espresso Martini</a>. These were both incredibly thorough, and shaped key decisions within Santiago’s Fernet protocol.</p><p>It is also worth acknowledging that Espresso Martini is extendable to most, if not all, other proposals, and could be considered in the future as an optional dependency in the Aztec block building lifecycle, providing users fast and efficienct pre-confirmations. However this was not included today as we do not wish to co-mingle timelines and block any potential engineering efforts.</p><p>We are also awarding smaller retroactive grants to the authors of the proposals suggesting we should use EigenLayer and a Based&nbsp;Rollup.</p> Next steps <p>Now that we have identified the two final candidates for a sequencer selection protocol, we are beginning the next phase of further analysis with <a href="https://block.science/">BlockScience</a> to provide an independent 3rd party perspective. This will result in a public report from the BlockScience team. Currently we expect this report to be published in&nbsp;Q3.</p><p>Example questions that BlockScience might be considering include:</p>  What happens if the block builder is the same on L1 &amp;&nbsp;L2?  What is the expected network revenue for blockrewards, fees and&nbsp;MEV?  What happens when block commitments are witheld till the last possible&nbsp;moment?  <p>We also have an active <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-upgrade-mechanisms/605">request for proposals on upgrade mechanisms</a>, which includes how should new versions of the network be released, and further, how are those new releases enforced.

<p>Electric Coin Co. (ECC)&nbsp; manages a number of Zcash-focused digital properties, i.e., the <a href="https://z.cash/">z.cash website</a>, the <a href="https://zcash.readthedocs.io">Zcash technical documentation</a> hub, the <a href="https://twitter.com/zcash">Zcash Twitter account</a>, and the <a href="https://halo.electriccoin.co/">Cypherpunk Zero site</a> and <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cypherpunk-zero">assets</a>. Stewardship of these projects is a multidisciplinary endeavor involving content strategy, digital marketing, web development, design, copywriting, community engagement, and more.</p>



<p>In June, as part of our efforts to improve the digital footprint of the Zcash ecosystem and lay a foundation for greater community involvement, we launched a redesigned and refined Z.cash. Here’s what <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-z-cash-website-launches-built-to-grow/">we wrote about it</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This website relaunch is a milestone, but it’s also simply a start — a patch of land to grow a garden. In the coming months, we’ll begin working toward fostering greater community involvement with the ultimate goal of transitioning this site and other Zcash digital properties into shared public goods.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As a follow-up to this launch announcement, and Josh Swihart’s <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/update-ecc-proposals-and-plans-for-decentralizing-zcash-and-future-focus/">recent blog</a> about ECC’s proposals and plans for decentralizing Zcash, the post you are reading now is meant to outline a process (at least the start of one) to reimagine governance of z.cash and other Zcash-focused digital properties.</p>



<p>Our hope is that, together with the larger Zcash community, we can build and enact a model of communal ownership and increased collaboration — transitioning these digital assets and tools into shared public goods, with a greater diversity of contributors and a more representative voice for Zcashers everywhere.</p>



<p></p>



 Sounds cool, but why? 



<p>We believe creating a decentralized ownership structure, jointly managed by ECC and qualified, independent people and teams is important for several reasons, including:</p>



 
 Ensuring the long-term sustainability and resilience of the Zcash project 



 Encouraging diversity and innovation in the ecosystem 



 Enabling more content, more collaboration, and a greater reach 
 



 Scope of proposal 



<p>This proposal encompasses the following digital properties currently managed day-to-day by ECC. For a full breakdown of constituent parts, corresponding tools/platforms and important dependencies, please see the addendum.&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="http://z.cash">z.cash domain and website</a> 



 <a href="https://zcash.readthedocs.io">Zcash Technical Documentation</a> (ReadTheDocs/Gitbook) 



 <a href="https://twitter.com/zcash">Zcash Twitter account</a> 



 <a href="https://halo.electriccoin.co/">Cypherpunk Zero site</a> and <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cypherpunk-zero">assets</a>&nbsp; 
 



 Proposed decentralization process 



<p>Broadly speaking, we believe the path to decentralization should be incremental and structured as follows. This is a draft, meant to spur discussion, and we welcome community input on the process and timeline(s) detailed below.</p>



<p>Phase 1 (Aug-Oct 2023)</p>



<p>Establish a transition task force composed of ECC representatives and qualified community members.</p>



<p>Beginning with a formal community application process, ECC will create a transition task force to contribute ideas and guide and oversee the transition. The task force should be comprised of representatives from ECC and up to three key members of the Zcash community. This group of unpaid volunteers will be responsible for prioritizing projects, developing the transition plans, engaging with the community, due diligence on trademark and legal implications, and ensuring a smooth and orderly transfer of responsibilities as appropriate. The task force should reflect the diversity of the Zcash community, ensuring that a broad range of perspectives, geographies, and expertise are represented, if feasible.</p>



<p><a href="https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Task-Force-proposal-ECC.pdf">See task force selection process proposal</a></p>



<p>Phase 2 (Nov 2023-Jan 2024)</p>



<p>Develop criteria for evaluating potential new ownership structures.</p>



<p>Based on the assessment and desired characteristics outlined in this post, the transition task force should develop clear criteria for evaluating potential new ownership structures for z.cash, the Zcash technical documentation hub, the Zcash Twitter account, and the Cypherpunk Zero site and assets. These criteria will serve as a basis for selecting the most suitable candidate(s), ensuring the chosen structure(s) aligns with community values, goals, and long-term vision. By establishing these criteria upfront, the task force ensures a transparent and objective selection process that is rooted in the best interests of the Zcash community.</p>



<p>Phase 3 (Feb-March 2024)</p>



<p>Engage the Zcash community regarding structure(s).</p>



<p>To encourage community involvement and input in the transition process, the task force will clearly communicate the desired characteristics of the new ownership structure(s). By providing a mechanism for open dialogue and exchange of ideas, ECC can gather valuable feedback and insights from various stakeholders, ensuring diverse perspectives are considered in the decision-making process.</p>



<p>Phase 4 (April 2024 onward)</p>



<p>New structure is finalized; transitioning and monitoring begin.</p>



<p>The new joint management structure(s) is finalized and transitioning begins. To guide the process, the task force and new owner(s) should develop a clear roadmap outlining expectations and responsibilities, including transition milestones. This roadmap should include key tasks such as the handover or opening up of technical infrastructure and the establishment of new governance mechanisms. By providing a structured framework for the transition, the roadmap can help ensure all aspects of the process are carefully considered and managed.</p>



<p>Once the transition process is complete, the task force should formally conclude its work, acknowledging the successful transfer of responsibilities and assets to the new co-owner(s). Following this, a post-transition review may be conducted to assess the overall success of the process, identify lessons learned, and document insights for future reference. This review could provide valuable feedback for both ECC and the new co-owner(s), helping to inform future decentralization initiatives and ensure the ongoing resilience of the Zcash project.</p>



 ECC’s recommendations on structure 



<p>z.cash domain and website:</p>



<p>The recently redesigned z.cash experience has been modularized to allow for multiple teams to manage various content sections of the website. The associated WordPress CMS, tools, and analytics platforms can be flexibly permissioned according to the needs of the community.</p>



<p>We would ideally like to see individuals or entities collaborate with ECC to manage the content within certain modules, such as the <a href="https://z.cash/learn/">Learn</a> and <a href="https://z.cash/ecosystem/">Ecosystem</a> hubs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Example A: Entity X could manage content for the Learn section of the site, while Entity Y could separately manage content for the Ecosystem section. ECC could continue maintaining the overall site experience, site security, associated analytics, and web development. Representatives from all entities could jointly sit on an editorial board to ensure cohesive content strategy and consistent quality. Funding could come in the form of Zcash Community Grants, a renewed Zcash Development Fund, or some combination of the two.</p>



<p>Example B: Entity X could work with ECC to develop translations for z.cash content in languages other than English. Funding could come in the form of Zcash Community Grants.</p>



<p>Ongoing costs:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Web development and design currently costs ~$2,500 per month through outside agencies. 



 Web hosting and application security cost ~$20,000 per year. 



 Hotjar currently costs ~$250 per month. 



 Ahrefs currently costs ~$199 per month. 



 WordPress plugins cost in aggregate ~$250 per year. 



 Google Analytics is free. 
 



 



<p>Zcash technical documentation management:</p>



<p>The existing Zcash technical documentation is hosted via ReadTheDocs and is in need of updates. Ideally, a separate entity could oversee the platform, independently or in conjunction with ECC, with funding from Zcash Community Grants.</p>



<p>Ongoing costs:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Copywriting and community management resources costs TBD. 



 Hosting costs ~$50 per month. 
 



 



<p>@Zcash Twitter account</p>



<p>We would like to see an entity or individual (other than ECC) assume social media management responsibilities (inclusive of content strategy and production) for the @Zcash Twitter handle. Funding could come in the form of Zcash Community Grants.</p>



<p>Ongoing costs:&nbsp;</p>



 
 ~$250/mo for Sprout Social. 



 The cost to design visual assets (ie. animated GIFs and videos). 



 Copywriting and community management resources. 
 



 



<p>Cypherpunk Zero site and NFT assets</p>



<p>Ideally, the Cypherpunk Zero world could be transitioned to an independent team who could facilitate wider community participation and contributions. Perhaps this could follow a transition and ownership model similar to the proposal for z.cash. In addition to the site and NFT collection (~2,000 pieces), ECC has three completed comic book scripts that need to be illustrated and packaged. This project was put on hold in 2022 for budget considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ongoing costs:</p>



 
 Web development and design currently costs TBD (ECC is currently spending $0 per month). 



 Web hosting and application security cost ~$4,000 per year. 



 Gas fees for transfer of NFTs ~10 per asset. 
 



 



<p>Disclaimer: Any estimated costs are based on current ECC infrastructure and configurations. There are other hosting and support service options that could cause the operational costs to be higher or lower.</p>



 



 Current questions, realities, and constraints 



<p>There are a number of known (and unknown) issues that we would need to address with the help of the community. Notably:</p>



 
 The ideal funding source(s) for entities that help manage Zcash digital properties is to be determined. Funding could come from Zcash Community Grants, a revised Zcash Development Fund, or some combination of the two. We are open to suggestions from the community. 



 The existing <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zcash_Trademark_Donation_and_License_Agreement_20191106.pdf">Zcash Trademark Agreement</a> and License Agreement may need to be amended to accommodate individuals or entities other than ECC. 



 Some other projects (such as Ethereum.org) have the luxury of relying on large communities to crowdsource much of the day-to-day management of their digital properties. By virtue of the Zcash community’s small size, we believe a narrower, more controlled management approach is needed while the project is in its infancy. 



 The ideal governance structure is to be determined and may require experimentation. 



 The ideal role of third parties (and the community’s ability to hold them accountable) is something that would need to be explored and codified by the proposed task force. 



 A shared Digital Property Roadmap, Style Guide, and Design Principles (including content and brand guidelines) will need to be developed and agreed upon to ensure Zcash is represented in a consistent and appropriate manner. 
 



<p>Other important considerations:</p>



<p>ECC currently relies on the z.cash domain as its Google Cloud Provider primary network for a number of pieces of critical infrastructure (e.g., nodes and build procedures). Any change of domain management must account for a ~6 month grace period to allow ECC to transition off the z.cash domain.</p>



 Next steps 



<p>In March, we requested that the Zcash Foundation provide ECC with time and space for community engagement on this topic at Zcon4, with an intent to begin approach and planning efforts in August. That request was officially denied in June (and again earlier this month), so ECC is planning to host a side event, during the Zcon4 dates, and we invite the community to participate. Stay tuned for details on time and venue. If you want to be sure you don’t miss this conversation, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:chris@electriccoin.co">chris@electriccoin.co</a>, and I’ll keep you in the loop. We are excited to hear from you directly and to work with qualified members of the community on these efforts!&nbsp;</p>



<p>After this workshop, our hope is to kick off the task force selection process mentioned above and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Task-Force-proposal-ECC.pdf">detailed here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Panther community,<br><br>As we announced this Friday, we’re rolling out Panther’s Testnet today, starting with Stage 0: ZK Batching. In this Stage, we’re launching the Panther Miner, a specialized miner designed to interact with a blockchain network.<br><br>This testing stage (and activity in production) is directed towards miners, a key role in the Panther ecosystem, as opposed to DeFi users. However, anyone can become a miner and test during Stage 0. As announced previously, Stage 0 will have dedicated rewards for this kind of testers.<br><br>Here’s everything you need to know about Stage 0 and how to participate.</p> Basic concepts <p>Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) or “Shielded Pool” for brevity, is essentially a collection of append-only Merkle trees. It includes the following trees:</p>  “Bus” processes UTXOs collectively by batching them (see below).  “Taxi” processes UTXOs individually and will be tested at Stage 5.  “Ferry” will manage UTXO data in the multi-chain Panther ecosystem.  <p>Within the “Bus” tree, each leaf is a commitment to:</p>  Either an “asset” UTXO representing a number of zAssets (or zNFTs) (essentially an “IOU” for the corresponding underlying collateral locked on the Panther Vault); or  a “zAccount” UTXO, a record that keeps information about the owner of a zAccount.  <p>The name ”'Bus Tree'' comes from UTXOs getting on the tree in batches of up to 64 UTXOs at once, rather than individually. To get on the “bus”, a UTXO needs to be put on a queue and wait until a miner (known as “Bus operator”) processes it and the other UTXOs on the queue.</p><p>The “bus” approach makes the process cost-efficient as all UTXOs in a queue share processing costs. As such, the individual cost for a transaction per user is much lower. On the other hand, users become dependent on the “Bus operator” who decides which queue to process and when to process it. Just like users of a blockchain incentivize miners to pick up their transactions by defining how much they are willing to pay for “gas”, Panther Protocol users define the reward (denominated in $ZKP) that they are willing to pay to the miner who processes their UTXOs.</p> Testnet Stage 0 implementation <p>Within Panther, miners are responsible for running a piece of code that fetches the pending mining queue. They then compute updates to the Merkle trees needed to append the UTXOs of the queue to the trees, create a SNARK-proof that proves the correctness of the updates, and submit these updates to be written on-chain together with the proof to smart contracts. As such, the Panther Miner software acts as the “Bus operator” on behalf of a user.<br><br>In this implementation, the algorithm to reward miners is fairly simple. Eventually, the Panther community may want to implement a more sophisticated algorithm after some initial usage statistics are collected.</p><p>As mentioned, the user transacting defines the reward per UTXOs he/she puts in the BusQueue. The initial value for Stage 0 is 0.1 ZKP per UTXO.</p><p>The total amount of rewards for all UTXOs in a queue (“assigned rewards”) is split in two parts:</p>  A “guaranteed” reward, set at 80% initially, which the miner who processes the queue gets in any case.  A “contribution to reserves” used to pay for bonuses (explained below).  <p>Should there be reserves to permit it, in addition to the “guaranteed” reward, the miner who mines a queue may get a premium. Premiums are calculated proportionally to the number of blocks that have passed without the queue getting processed, counting from the creation of the earliest UTXO in the queue. The bonus will be calculated through accrual at a fixed factor, initially set at 0.1% of the “assigned reward” for every pending block.</p> How to test <p>To test at this stage, follow the steps below.</p> Testing on a browser   Visit the miner test page at <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmae7K54pW8uzHZcnisym6F5gTrcjQDci8w5Z4XKyDQ7Tk?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmae7K54pW8uzHZcnisym6F5gTrcjQDci8w5Z4XKyDQ7Tk</a>  Fill in the following three variables:    Interval (in seconds): the designated pause between iterations produced automatically by the miner. An iteration includes:  <p>1) Checking the BusTree contract for a queue expecting processing and selecting the most profitable one to process.</p><p>2) Generating a zk-proof by processing the chosen queue.</p><p>3) Submitting the zk-proof to the blockchain.</p>  Private Key: the private key of the wallet used to sign batch transactions and receive rewards.  <p>There are two options for this field:</p>  Use an existing key, e.g., <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=On%20the%20account%20page%2C%20click,click%20%E2%80%9CConfirm%E2%80%9D%20to%20proceed.">exported from your MetaMask</a>; or  Generate a new key pair. &nbsp;Click “Generate private key using MetaMask” and get a new private key inserted into the corresponding field. &nbsp;You can <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-How-to-import-an-account?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=Click%20the%20circle%20icon%20at,key%20and%20click%20%E2%80%9CImport%E2%80%9D.">add the new address to your MetaMask</a> (click “Show Private Key” to unveil and copy the data) afterward.  <p>A new public key (address) will be reflected as soon as you start mining. Find it in the “Mining statistics” section.</p>  RPC URL: use any RPC you prefer, as long as it’s valid for the Mumbai network.  <p>3. Ensure you have a positive balance of MATIC in your wallet to interact with the product. You can visit <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">faucet_1</a> or <a href="https://mumbaifaucet.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">faucet_2</a> to get test MATIC tokens.</p><p>4. (Optional) <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-display-tokens-in-MetaMask?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#h_01FWH492CHY60HWPC28RW0872H">Add the tZKP token to your wallet</a> using the following contract address &nbsp;0x4004C49aBb96B11D89A52DeCCa2D1522da7f3089 (it is reflected within the “Mining Statistics section”/”Reward” field). You will see your ZKP balance increasing as soon as you start mining queues. Your reward balance is also available on the UI (see below).</p><p>5. Click the “Start Mining” button to start the process.</p><p>6. Check that the “Logs” section is updating.</p><p>7. Check that the “Mining Statistics” section is updating.</p><p>Please, note:</p>  The “Generated Proof” amount can be bigger than “Submitted Proof,” meaning other miners submitted a generated proof earlier than you.  “Mining Success” = “Submitted Proof”(s).  Your Balance (of MATIC) will decline over time because the miner client generates UTXOs to let you interact with them to test the functionality. Submitting UTXOs incurs a cost.  “Reward” ($ZKP balance) will grow over time if your mining activity is successful. Rewards are distributed as soon as data is processed.   <p>8. Check that you’re receiving rewards correctly.</p><p>9. Stop mining. (Note: the miner will finish the ongoing iteration before entirely stopping).</p> Using a docker image <p>For users interested in running the Panther Miner themselves instead of using a browser version, the dockerized version has the same functionalities and logic outlined above.<br><br>Here’s the link to the docker image page: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pantherprotocol/miner-client?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://hub.docker.com/r/pantherprotocol/miner-client</a><br><br>Smart contract details (on Mumbai)</p>  BusTree: 0x678D34aA4fc546bA806287a8289FfdAA84681a03  tZKP Token (test token on Mumbai, replica of Polygon version of ZKP): 0x4004C49aBb96B11D89A52DeCCa2D1522da7f3089  VPool: 0xCd85e3E918F1A36F939281d3ca707EE262a364c6  test DAO multisig: 0xfB474a7FeCDaFBD412ebF0d60A0C32794F82d3dD  PantherVerifier: 0xeeAfce13506847a19141A4513718df17383f4f7b  PantherPool: 0xfDfD920F2152565E9D7b589e4e9faeE6699AD4bd  Vault: 0x9619bd59411a8387a4119e548017C5b86c7bCec5  FXPortalBridge: 0x542c2c3e6BBfD5979E5FEC6708764B93Ba210c51  Test ZKP Token (replica of ZKP on Ethereum Mainnet for e2e simulation purposes): 0xfD466eF2c700E2f66b2d05D92896b95d541e66e5   My transaction failed. Is that a bug? <p>If your Miner logs “Mining error: Error: transaction failed,” this likely means that other miners have been luckier than you and already mined your target queue.</p><p>Here are some common error messages, how to find them, and their associated causes.</p> Finding the error message <p>To view the smart contract error message:</p>  Copy the ‘transactionHash’ on your Miner’s Logs report<br>(similar to “0x8df373d7f9dd0c89fa42fc769f91a7153a1e983000916677c588b78d88a32f0f”)  Open <a href="https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/</a> and paste the copied ‘transactionHash’ to the search filter.  Note the “status” field. It contains the smart contract error message.   Error: BT:FAILED_PROOF<br> <p>If this message shows, check the following:</p>  Your miner’s failed “onboard queue” transaction follows immediately (or a few seconds) after another transaction.   A successful “Simulate Add Utxos To Bus Queue” transaction was sent from another address.  The “queueId” of your miner’s failed transaction (you can find it on the block explorer’s “input data” section for your transaction) is the same as for the preceding transaction (you can find this amongst the parameters of the “UtxoBusQueued” event shown on the “Logs” page for the preceding transaction).  <p>If both of the above are true, this is not a bug. Your Miner tried to mine a queue that was not fully populated. The preceding transaction has added another UTXO to the queue, which your Miner did not account for.</p> Error: BQ:EMPTY_QUEUE<br> <p>If this message shows, check the following:</p>  There is another successful “onboard queue” transaction that precedes your Miner’s failed “onboard queue” transaction.  Your transaction and another transaction both have the same “queueId” param (you can find it on the block explorer’s “input data” section for a transaction).  <p>If both of the above are true, this is not a bug. Both you and another user were trying to mine the same queue, but they were lucky to mine it before you.</p> Submitting feedback <p>If none of the cases above apply to you, please share your found bug with the Panther team. To share feedback, testers will be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a dedicated form</a> as the only accepted procedure. The steps mentioned in the form’s description are needed to make this interaction both efficient and productive.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs.

<p>Nanotechnology, core to the $200Bn value-added materials market, has for decades been heralded as one of the most promising areas of science and industry. However, we are yet to discover even 1% of what is possible in nanomaterial design because of the challenges in unlocking the unique properties of elements at the nanoscale. Exploiting the unique synergistic effects embodied in novel nanoscale composites has, until now, been almost impossible at a large scale. <a href="https://vsparticle.com/">VSParticle</a>, a TU Delft spin out, has created a quantum-enhanced 3D nano-printer for the high throughput scaling of nanomaterials with broad applicability for scientific, engineering and manufacturing applications.</p><p>The nano-printer uses spark ablation technology (an aerosol-based generation method invented by one of the company’s co-founders) that can uniquely combine different materials into single nanoparticles with controllable sizes and chemical compositions, at low cost and in an environmentally friendly way. One of VSParticle’s first applications significantly improves membrane efficiency to help accelerate the large-scale deployment of green hydrogen production.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Achieving high-throughput design and test cycles for inorganic nanomaterials is considered the holy grail for a step-change in the inorganic chemicals industry and to propel us to a more sustainable future. By shortening the time to commercialize new value-added materials from 20 to 2 years for high value applications (including solar cells, electro-catalysts, bioelectronics, batteries, sensors and more), VSParticle could play a key role in tackling some of the planet’s outsized challenges including solving for material scarcity in green hydrogen production, decarbonizing the petrochemical industry, and driving a step-change in energy generation, conversion and storage. Finally, as a general purpose technology, VSParticle has the potential to become a global nanofoundry for the discovery and production of advanced materials — akin to becoming the Gingko Bioworks of the inorganic materials world.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the VSParticle team on their mission.

<p>Panther community,</p><p>We are debuting our v1’s Testnet this Monday. Through it, you’ll be able to test the different protocol functionalities in different stages, leading to our protocol’s release.</p><p>In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know about the Testnet itself, its incremental release, rewards for testers, and the different stages of the testing.</p> What is expected from testers? <p>Voluntary testers are expected to go through a predefined set of test cases to cover the whole range of product functionalities. Besides trying out v1, testers are expected to report on bugs or potential UI/UX improvements. Your feedback will be used to enhance the protocol before the official launch.</p><p>Furthermore, the Testnet can be used to test further versions of the protocol upon the community's request.</p> How will Panther’s Testnet work? <p>Each Testnet Stage will now have its own testing link. All links will be hosted on our <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">official information repository</a>.</p><p>The Testnet will be deployed first on the Mumbai Testnet and then the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/polygon-integration-annouced-for-panther-protocol/">Polygon network.</a> Mumbai, a Polygon Testnet, will only be used to test stages 0-6, while Mainnet Polygon testing will take place starting from the 7th stage. At this time, a canary deployment will be used to test the protocol in an environment as close to full production as possible (see “Scope to test” below).</p><p>Test tokens created for testing purposes, including “test” versions of $ZKP, will be deployed to both networks. Testnet ZKP tokens will be exchangeable for Polygon ZKP tokens (see “Incentivization” below).</p><p>Panther will provide users with a series of test cases to execute on the Testnet. These are specific to each testing stage and will be communicated via our official channels prior to the launch of each stage.</p> Sharing feedback <p>Testnet rewards are automatized, and as such, the Testnet itself will reward users for executing on the provided use cases. However, the goal for the Testnet is to debug and enhance the protocol before v1’s launch. As such, our expectation is that users submit bugs and share ideas to enhance the UI/UX based on their practical experience.</p><p>Spotting and fixing any possible bugs within the Testnet will make the production (released) version of the protocol more sustainable in the middle-term, while allowing users to proceed with testing, therefore earning rewards.</p><p>To share feedback, testers will be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a dedicated form</a> as the only accepted procedure. The steps mentioned in the form’s description are needed to make this interaction both efficient and productive.<br></p> Testing scope and stages <p>The following are the different stages of testing that users will undertake.</p><p>As mentioned, specific testing guides for each step will be released along with them.</p> How to test <p>Information regarding Stage 0 will go live on July 10th.</p><p>Once Stage 1 is set up, users should visit the Testnet link (<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">hosted here</a>) and join to test the onboarding functionality. This involves creating a zAccount, passing a simple <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">KYC</a> flow (name and email required, ID not required), and activating the zAccount.</p><p>Each newly-onboarded user will receive tZKP tokens and tPRP (test PRP). tZKP tokens will be used to interact with the protocol during later stages. Interactions with the protocol accrue rewards for users in the form of tPRP, which will be used in the second stage.</p><p>More information about Stage 1 will be published at due time.<br></p> Panther’s Testnet incentivization<br> <p>As mentioned above, the use cases for testing will trigger rewards. These are meant to incentivize users to provide feedback.</p><p>At the end of Testing, users will be left with $tZKP balances proportional to the number of tests they performed. At this stage, $tZKP will be used to redeem real $ZKP 1:1 on Polygon. The method to do this will be described at the time.</p> On Test tokens <p>The Test tokens created to support the testing process will be:</p>  tZKP tokens. Test ZKP tokens deployed on <a href="https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Mumbai</a> and Polygon, as two separate tokens. The proportion of tokens in each chain will be determined in time.  <p>tZKP tokens have a limited supply, which is equal to the reward pool size (see “Amount” below) to maintain a 1:1 ratio for tZKP-ZKP. All tZKP tokens can be exchanged into $ZKP on the Polygon network at a 1:1 ratio at the end of the testing period and, as such, have value.</p>  Additional test tokens (as required for Testing). These tokens will have no monetary value and will be used to test diverse protocol functions.<br>  tPRP. Test PRP granted to all users who successfully onboard to Panther. The goal of these tokens is merely to test PRP/ZKP conversion in Stage 2.   Amounts and sources <p>The total amount of Testnet rewards is proposed to be set on a level of 1.5M $ZKP, with an additional 0.5M $ZKP in reserve to cover additional rewards if needed.</p><p>Testnet rewards are proposed to be taken from the Foundation-General pool. The allocation and transfer of funds to a newly created incentivized Testnet pool can be done by the Panther Foundation. &nbsp;<br></p> tZKP Distribution <p>tZKP will be distributed using the following ratios. Note that distributions can be adjusted during the testing period.<br></p>  Welcome bonus – 20%. This will help users receive tZKP in their zAccount. These tokens are used for paying fees and incentivize users to sign up.  Miner Rewards pool - 10%. Rewards set aside for miners who run a node to execute a batch of on-chain transactions. Miners will be rewarded based on their batch size, i.e. the number of UTXOs included in the batch.  AMM Rewards pool - 60%. This pool will hold the majority of rewards destined to users performing tests.  Third-party service providers - 10%. For third-parties acting as relayers and compliance providers.   About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther’s zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="http://docs.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Documentation·</a> <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

 Introduction 



<p>Web3, the latest iteration of the internet, is a very hot and current topic of discussion. While still not fully implemented, Web3 is starting to show its potential to disrupt existing trends and systems and create brand new ones.</p>



<p>When it comes to the travel industry, and more specifically,<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-hotels-customer-loyalty/"> customer loyalty programs</a>, things have been pretty stagnant over the past couple of decades. Air miles and frequent flyer programs are standard fares but haven’t evolved or improved meaningfully. These programs remain highly restricted and centralised, and customers enjoy little or no flexibility.</p>



<p>Web3, with its underlying power to decentralise, tokenise, diversify, and empower the individual/customer thanks to blockchain and other novel technologies, does have a great potential to disrupt customer loyalty programs as we have known them for a very long time.</p>



<p>This article explores the possible applications of web3 to the travel industry, and how web3’s technological traits can improve customer loyalty.</p>



 Customer loyalty programs: historical background 



<p>The Holiday Inn chain introduced the very first customer loyalty program for the hospitality industry in 1983. Originally dubbed ‘Priority Club’, the idea was to keep customers coming back to Holiday Inn establishments by offering rewards and perks for returning customers (the Priority Club was rebranded as IHG Rewards Club in 2013 when the Holiday Inn chain became InterContinental Hotel Group). The idea took off, big time. Soon, all hotel chains introduced similar programs. (Marriott opened its own loyalty program the same year).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same goes for the travel industry. United Airlines implemented what can be considered the first ‘modern’ frequent-flyer program in 1972. This early iteration awarded flyers commemorative plaques and promotional material. It wouldn’t be until 1979 with Texas International Airlines’s program that actual mileage flown would be used as the basis for a rewards system for travellers.</p>



 Customer loyalty programs: the current state of play 



<p>The short historical background above clearly highlights one fact: <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-hotels-customer-loyalty/">customer loyalty programs</a> in the travel industry have been around for a long time, and apart from cosmetic and administrative alterations, the core mechanics have changed little, if at all. Over five decades since their inception, they’re overdue for a quantum evolutionary leap.</p>



<p>Apart from revealing how easily a medical emergency can spread around the world (and how unprepared said world was to deal with it), the covid-19 pandemic caused a tectonic shift for many things. From the way people work, to how travel is perceived, there’s a clear before/after. The travel industry collapsed, for starters, with many airlines and travel companies going out of business entirely. In the wake of such era-defining events, customer attitudes changed dramatically, and consequently, existing and long-standing customer loyalty programs became almost obsolete in a relatively short period of time.</p>



<p>The world has now come out at the other end of the pandemic, but brands need to recognise that this is a new era and that they need to adapt and evolve their customer loyalty strategy if they’re to retain/expand their customer base.</p>



<p>This is where web3 can become the key factor.</p>



 How can web3 improve customer loyalty in the travel industry? 



<p>The web is evolving. Now arguably in its third iteration (web3), the new web is decentralised. Powered by technologies such as blockchain, and leveraging the power of cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and self-sovereign identity (SSI), <a href="https://zaisan.io/web3-explained/">web3</a> opens up a whole new constellation of possibilities.</p>



<p>Web3 is all-encompassing, meaning all aspects of the web experience will be enhanced in one way or another. When it comes to customer loyalty programs, web3 can become a great disruptor and innovator. The very nature of blockchain as a secure, transparent, and immutable technology can establish the basis for a far more efficient and customer-centric experience.</p>



<p>Blockchain-based customer loyalty programs benefit in multiple ways:</p>



 
 Better security: Blockchain technology features cryptographic security, which is way stronger and more robust than security methods found in previous iterations of the web. Furthermore, the native permission management systems found in most blockchains allow for better management of access. 



 Transparency: In traditional customer loyalty programs, the customer might not have always been able to view or track their rewards in real-time or at all. This may lead to reduced trust in the brand and the program itself. Blockchain enables real-time tracking and visualisation of rewards. 



 Reward portability: Customer loyalty programs have, for decades, worked in siloed form. In other words, the rewards accrued in any given program are only good for that program. The customer cannot move them elsewhere. This restricts freedom of choice and prevents the customer from accessing other ecosystems where their rewards may also yield benefits. Web3 disrupts this paradigm by enabling reward portability, maybe in the form of NFTs, which could be utilised and redeemed across multiple systems. This portability adds an immense amount of value to the rewards, and the brand itself. 



 Reduced costs: Smart contracts enable secure, traceable, and transparent transactions that are much cheaper than current bank-based transactions. Blockchain technology eliminates all middlemen, which means the elimination of all the fees taken by all the middlemen along the transaction’s path. 



 Frictionless environment: The web3 wallet becomes the centrepiece of the rewards experience. Rewards are credited and redeemed from the same wallet, which creates a very streamlined and efficient rewards journey. 



 Freedom to exit the program at any time: Current loyalty programs tend to ‘lock’ the customer into one single provider. This usually means that the customer cannot dispose of the rewards until a certain period of time has elapsed, or certain conditions are met, or both. Within a web3 rewards ecosystem, the customer may be able to sell or trade rewards at any time. 
 



 The challenges of implementing web3 in the travel industry 



<p>Web3 is a relatively new concept, as are the technologies underpinning it. Consequently, development and implementation are far from standard or battle-tested. There remain many unanswered questions about data privacy, regulatory issues, and of course, adoption.</p>







<p>Let’s look at some of these yet unanswered questions, and some lingering challenges.</p>



 Data privacy 



<p>The handling of personal information is presently the subject of thorough scrutiny, following several high-profile incidents over the last couple of decades that saw millions of personal accounts become compromised. Data is the lifeblood of the digital age, and so companies must ensure they protect their users’ privacy and comply with all existing regulations.</p>



<p>Web3’s based on the decentralisation and transparency afforded by blockchain technology. But these two factors, while they enable protection against major hacking events, do spark concerns about the privacy of the data being handled. For example, the very nature of blockchain technology means that information cannot be altered or destroyed, once it becomes immutable on-chain. Because of decentralisation, no single authority exists to even take on the responsibility of erasing data, should this become necessary due to legal issues, for example. Such conflict may lead to compliance problems across one or many jurisdictions.</p>



 Regulatory issues 



<p>While web3 is likely to disrupt many paradigms, the new web must still remain a lawful environment. Any companies, either startups or long-established firms embracing web3 concepts and technologies, must be compliant if they’re to thrive, evolve, and remain in business!</p>



<p>The responsibility to establish a lawful web3 environment is two-pronged: on one side, regulators must create clearly defined frameworks for digital asset management entities, startups, and entrepreneurs to follow and abide by. On the other side, these same entities, startups, and entrepreneurs must implement the necessary measures to comply with regulations. This may require hiring specialised lawyers or firms with a proven track record in the field. <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/">Zaisan</a> is one such company, for example.</p>



 Adoption 



<p>Customer loyalty programs have existed for a long time, as we have seen. Because of this, practices, systems, and sentiments may have become deeply rooted, and the desire to change may be weak, or legacy systems may be hard or expensive to upgrade.</p>



<p>Still, as mentioned above, the covid-19 pandemic did signify a seismic shift in many aspects of life, with travel habits being particularly impacted. Web3’s new technologies may introduce a far more efficient way to manage customer loyalty.</p>



 Fierce competition 



<p>Following the lead of Holiday Inn, most other hotel chains followed suit and created their own versions. Same goes for the air miles/frequent flyer. Because most hotel chains/airlines use these programs, competition is intense, which means it’s harder for the business to gain new customers or retain existing ones, and it’s even harder for the actual customers to decide which loyalty program to sign up for.</p>



 Shifting customer preferences 



<p>Another considerable challenge is the always-changing customer preferences. Times change, and so do market trends, and consequently, customer behaviour. The pandemic only accelerated these issues, but this evolution is largely unavoidable, so it’s up to the brands themselves to adapt their programs to new trends, choices, and needs. For example, customers may want experiences tailored to them based on the personal information provided. Customers may choose one brand over another if said brand is able to offer personalised experiences and rewards, for example, rather than a ‘one-reward-fits-all’ approach.</p>



 Examples of real-life Web3 cases in the travel industry 



<p>Though web3 is still an evolving concept, some companies actively embrace its potential and make significant strides in integrating web3 technologies into the travel industry. Here are a few real-life examples of companies that are leveraging web3 in travel environments:</p>



 
 Chain4travel: <a href="https://chain4travel.com/">Chain4travel</a> has developed Camino, a web3-powered travel ecosystem that utilises blockchain technology. Camino aims to create a decentralised marketplace where travellers can book flights, accommodations, and other travel services directly with providers, cutting out intermediaries and reducing costs. 



 WindingTree: <a href="https://windingtree.com/">WindingTree</a> is a blockchain-based platform that builds decentralised solutions specifically for the travel industry. By leveraging web3 technologies, WindingTree aims to facilitate direct connections between travel suppliers (such as hotels and airlines) and consumers, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries and reducing fees. 



 TravelIX: TravelIX focuses on tokenising airline tickets, providing a web3-based system for digitising and managing flight bookings. By tokenising airline tickets, TravelIX aims to enhance the travel industry’s transparency, security, and efficiency. This approach allows for seamless ticket transactions and provides travellers with greater control over their bookings. 
 



<p>These companies exemplify the growing interest and exploration of web3 technologies in the travel industry, demonstrating the potential for enhanced efficiency, transparency, and customer experiences through the adoption of web3 principles.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The web is evolving, and will probably keep evolving for as long as the web exists. Web3 is the next iteration, bringing blockchain-based technologies and decentralisation to the ecosystem.</p>



<p>The travel industry (and by extension, customer loyalty programs) may benefit greatly from these technological advances. Web3 can improve customer loyalty by giving customers greater control over their data, more personalised experiences, and enhanced rewards programs, for instance.</p>



<p>But these are just some of web3’s potential applications for the travel industry. Blockchain remains a relatively new technology, and its adoption is still far from widespread in this particular sector. Future use cases may involve blockchain-based digital passports or tokenised rewards. The bottom line is that web3 is here. The technology is happening, and the travel industry can only become better because of it. </p>

<p>In May, <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">Zooko announced that ECC had restructured</a> to better serve the interests of Zcash while reducing costs and increasing sustainability of the organization. In that post, he summarized two categories of our efforts moving forward: further increasing Zcash decentralization and focusing ECC. This post is intended to provide more detail and an update on our current plans. We welcome the community’s feedback.&nbsp;</p>



 Increasing Zcash decentralization 



<p>Our objective in the further decentralization of Zcash is to meaningfully improve Zcash’s resilience without unduly increasing centralization risk. An example of a change that would not improve resilience would be transferring responsibility to the Zcash Foundation (ZF). Because ZF manages the Zcash trademark, its Zcash Community Advisory Panel, and the Zcash Community Forum, and because they now offer their own consensus node (Zebra), adding more reliance on ZF would not make Zcash more resilient against single points of failure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transitioning some of the work ECC owns, or has owned in the past, to others in the community will:</p>



 
 Increase Zcash sustainability and resilience, through a greater distribution of responsibility 



 Increase goodwill and accountability with the community 



 Increase opportunities for others who have demonstrated reliable participation in the ecosystem 



 Free ECC to focus on improvements to the project that we are uniquely qualified to deliver 
 



<p>This process will take time, as ECC develops and rolls out mechanisms to ensure functions transition smoothly and safely to trusted members in the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transitioning some responsibilities may seem counterintuitive, as ECC’s existence depends on Zcash community funding. However, it is precisely because our funding comes from the community that we are bound to honor the best interests of ZEC holders with good stewardship and leadership.</p>



 Focusing ECC 



<p>Our mission is to empower all people with economic freedom, and our “North Star” is delivering a world class UX for ZEC. In the near to mid term, <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">as announced,</a> we are focused on empowering ZEC holders and giving them a voice.</p>



<p>This specifically includes the following objectives:</p>



 
 Create an excellent user experience for proof-of-stake ZEC 



 Build and support a commercial wallet — built by and for Zcashers — that is easy to use and accessible for anyone 



 Build and support a mobile-wallet SDK that is useful to other Zcash builders 



 Ensure ZEC, self-custody, and staking remain viable in the USA through focused policy work 
 



 Timeline and specifics 



<p>ECC uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR process</a> for prioritizing and delivering measurable work on four-month cycles. Typically, our terms are: February – May (Term 1), June – September (Term 2), and October – January (Term 3). Due to ECC’s restructuring and our focus on exiting emergency mode, we moved the kickoff date of Term 2 to July 10. Term 3 will kick off, as usual, in October.</p>



 Term 2, 2023 



<p>The priorities set for the remainder of Term 2 are:</p>



<p>Before the end of July</p>



 
 Exit emergency mode 



 Release the <a href="https://z.cash/">Z.cash</a> website, version 3.0 (completed) 



 Release the new ECC SDKs (iOS and Android), version 1.0 



 Release the new ECC commercial wallet, version 1.0 



 Release version 0.1 of our proof-of-stake design recommendations 
 



<p>The lionshare of our immediate focus remains on <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/update-addressing-zcash-wallet-performance-issues/">exiting “emergency mode,”</a> which we anticipate will be possible this month, depending on how quickly wallets are able to integrate with our new SDK.</p>



<p>The new ECC SDKs will support pre-sync fund availability.</p>



<p>ECC’s wallet will be announced and made available for early testing. This release will be a professional, but no-frills, basic wallet that will serve as the foundation on which to meet the specific needs and wants of Zcashers. We will drive feature development based on ZEC user feedback. Future wallet features might include such things as ZEC holder polling and staking functions, for example.</p>



<p>Our research team will publish a top-level roadmap and proposed timeline to move Zcash from proof of work to a hybrid solution, and then potentially pure proof of stake. We’ll publish this information this month and then host a workshop at Zcon4 to continue the discussion. This version 0.1 proposal is an early step in the design process, published specifically to garner feedback and collaboration across the Zcash ecosystem, and to ensure this significant transition proposal is well understood and addresses community needs.</p>



<p>August – September (Remainder of Term 2)</p>



<p>We intend to pause new development efforts on PoS research and commercial wallet and SDK development in order to focus on decentralization activities. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR</a> planning for the remainder of Term 2 will be focused on:</p>



 
 Clearly defining the specific use cases where ECC will focus 



 Identifying use cases well suited for decentralization, to improve resilience and sustainability 



 Mapping out the transition between ECC support and end-of-support for specific use cases (i.e., Do we stop working on these things completely, wrap them up, and/or transition them to others?) 



 Meta transition planning where appropriate, including how to identify and safely transition responsibilities to other Zcash contributors 



 Beginning the transitions 
 



<p>Some efforts will be relatively swift, as is the case with ending ECC support for global regulatory relations. Others will take more time, including the transition of some functions currently supported by ECC in Zcashd (pending final determination of which use cases ECC will continue to support). Others may take significant planning and time, due to complexities and in order to minimize any disruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One such complex decentralization effort referenced in the restructuring announcement is the management of digital properties. This includes the z.cash website, the Zcash Twitter account, Zcash.readthedocs.io, and the Cypherpunk Zero assets. Our objective is to empower the community to contribute to, help steward, and better utilize these assets over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stewardship of these digital properties, platforms, and assets are incredibly important and complex, so transition efforts will take considerable time and diligence to execute safely and in a way that will foster the best possible outcomes. In these cases, we believe “meta transition planning” is most appropriate. We have been studying this for many months and will provide a recommended approach to the community in a blog post next week. We have requested that the Zcash Foundation provide ECC with time and space for community engagement on this topic at Zcon4, with an intent to begin approach and planning efforts in August. We look forward to working with qualified members of the community on this effort and will provide more detail soon.</p>



 October – January (Term 3, 2023/24) 



<p>Much of the decentralization efforts, formalized in Term 2, will occur during these months. As we are able to wind down and transition work, we will turn our attention back to new research and development on the ECC defined focus areas. As previously stated, some transitions may be quick, and some may require months to years.</p>



 February and beyond (Term 1, 2024 – ) 



<p>While we focus our research and development efforts as stated above, we will roll out updated roadmaps and plans based on the funding available to ECC under the current development fund, which ends in November 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The community is currently discussing the possibility of a new development fund and possible structures. When we gain clarity on the effort and time needed to decentralize core capabilities, we intend to provide a proposal to the community on what we plan to accomplish and at what level of funding over another term.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Further decentralizing Zcash by focusing ECC’s efforts on fewer things is a meaningful contribution to the project and ZEC holders in support of our mission. It will result in a more diverse group of contributors and set up ECC to iterate on new innovation, more quickly and less expensively, by focusing on those areas we are uniquely qualified to deliver.</p>



<p>I look forward to seeing you at Zcon4! Please grab me for some time there if you’d like to explore any of this in more detail.</p>
