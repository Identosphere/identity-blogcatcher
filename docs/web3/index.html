 The Verus community’s presence at Consensus 2025 marked what many attendees described as the most impactful conference appearance in the project’s history. For those of us who were there — and for the broader community who made it possible — this event demonstrated a shift in how the blockchain industry understands and values what the community has&nbsp;built.  When Complex Ideas Finally&nbsp;Click <p>Throughout the conference, we witnessed something special: moment after moment where visitors to our booth suddenly understood concepts that had previously seemed abstract or unclear. One community member described these as “lightbulb moments” — that instant when someone grasps not just what Verus does, but why it&nbsp;matters.</p><p>The phrase that seemed to catalyze these moments? “DeFi is not an&nbsp;app.”</p><p>This simple statement opened doors to deeper conversations about what we’ve always known: that DeFi should be a foundational primitive built into blockchain protocols, not bolted on top through vulnerable smart contracts. Marketing professionals and developers alike found themselves nodding along as we explained that smart contracts are essentially stored procedures in a shared global database — useful, but hardly the revolutionary construct they’re often portrayed to&nbsp;be.</p> Real Conversations About Real&nbsp;Problems <p>What set this conference apart wasn’t just theoretical discussions. Attendees brought real concerns about security vulnerabilities they’re facing today. When we talked about the recent DNS redirection attacks on platforms like Curve, heads nodded knowingly. When we asked, “How will anyone solve phishing if users have to give smart contracts direct access to their wallets?” — the silence was&nbsp;telling.</p><p>These weren’t gotcha moments. They were honest technical discussions about fundamental challenges in blockchain architecture. And we had answers that resonated.</p> The Presentation That Changed Perspectives <p>The recorded presentation “Own or be Owned: How Verus Secures Ownership in a Digital World” at the Protocol Village by Michael J. Toutonghi, lead developer, became a focal point of our conference presence. Following the talk, booth traffic surged with attendees wanting to dive deeper into the concepts presented.</p><p>In the presentation we announced Commons Powered Apps. More on that in a future&nbsp;article.</p> “Wait, This Isn’t a Company?” <p>Perhaps the most gratifying reactions came when visitors learned about Verus’s structure. The disbelief was palpable: How could something this technically sophisticated, this well-organized, this professional, not be backed by venture capital or run by a corporation?</p><p>“It’s entirely community-driven,” we’d explain. No ICO. No pre-mine. No company behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>The authenticity of that message — backed by the reality of what the community has built — changed conversations immediately. Suddenly, we weren’t just another blockchain project. We were proof that communities can build world-class technology without traditional corporate structures.</p> Building Bridges to the&nbsp;Future <p>The conference generated exactly the kind of connections we hoped for. Our booth became a hub for substantive technical discussions with projects and companies exploring blockchain solutions for their real-world challenges.</p><p>These weren’t casual meetups. These were in-depth conversations with organizations that immediately understood the limitations of current blockchain approaches and were actively seeking alternatives. The technical depth of these discussions — and the genuine interest in Verus’s architectural differences — has resulted in a list of follow-ups.</p><p>What struck us most was the quality of these interactions. Rather than the typical conference small talk, we found ourselves in detailed technical discussions about specific implementation challenges and use&nbsp;cases.</p> A Community Effort in Every&nbsp;Sense <p>None of this would have been possible without the Verus community members who funded the Consensus presence. Every donation, large or small, contributed to putting our best foot forward at this critical industry event. The booth &amp; the ability to have a presentation — all of it came from community support.</p><p>For those who couldn’t attend but contributed: you were there in spirit, and your support directly enabled every conversation, every connection, and every breakthrough moment we experienced.</p> Looking Forward <p>As we process the connections made and opportunities identified at Consensus 2025, one thing is clear: the industry is ready for what Verus offers. The questions we’re answering aren’t theoretical anymore — they’re practical, pressing problems that developers and organizations need solved&nbsp;today.</p><p>The shift we experienced at this conference wasn’t just about better messaging or a nicer booth. It was about the broader blockchain ecosystem reaching a level of maturity where the foundational questions we’ve been addressing for years are now front and center for everyone.</p><p>For the Verus community, Consensus 2025 wasn’t just another conference. It was validation that our patient, principled approach to building better blockchain infrastructure is exactly what the industry needs. And we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>Thank you to every community member who made our Consensus 2025 presence possible. The impact of your support continues to ripple through every new connection and opportunity that emerged from this&nbsp;event.</p> 🛠️ Build dApps with&nbsp;Verus <p>Look up the <a href="https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-02_verus_commands.md">complete command list here</a>.

<p>In a landmark ruling delivered last Wednesday, the Brussels Court of Appeal ruled that tracking-based online advertising was illegal, directly challenging the pervasive practices of tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and X across the European&nbsp;Union.</p><p>The decision pivots on the finding that the widely adopted consent mechanisms for this type of advertising fail to meet the rigorous standards set by the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><p>The court’s judgment specifically targets the Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF), a ubiquitous standard within the online advertising ecosystem. The TCF is designed to solicit user consent for the processing of their personal data for targeted advertising through a system known as Real-Time Bidding (RTB). In RTB, advertisers engage in lightning-fast auctions to display ads to specific users based on their digital footprint and inferred interests.</p><p>The court’s decision echoes the prior conclusions of the Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) from 2022, which determined that the technology underpinning tracking-based ads contravenes several core tenets of the GDPR. The fundamental issue, as the court affirmed, lies in the absence of genuine and informed consent from users. The prevalent pop-up consent requests, the court reasoned, fall short of providing adequate transparency or control regarding the collection and dissemination of user data among the myriad companies involved in the RTB&nbsp;process.</p><p>Hannah Storey, Amnesty International’s Policy Advisor on Technology and Human Rights, lauded the ruling as “a major win for the right to privacy and a clear message that the tech industry should move away from surveillance-based advertising to a more rights-respecting model.” She asserted that the current practice of amassing and processing personal data via the TCF is incompatible with the fundamental right to&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Dr. Johnny Ryan, Director of Enforce at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, a key figure in the legal battle against the ad tech industry, asserted that the court’s decision “shows that the consent system used by Google, Amazon, X, Microsoft, deceives hundreds of millions of Europeans.” He contended that the tech industry has sought to mask a “vast data breach behind sham consent popups,” effectively turning the GDPR into an inconvenience rather than a safeguard for individuals.</p><p>While the EU court’s ruling marks a crucial victory for privacy advocates, the practical implementation and the response from the tech industry remain to be&nbsp;seen.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>FROST, which stands for Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold, is an advanced cryptographic protocol designed to improve threshold signature schemes. Unlike traditional single-party signatures, FROST enables a group of participants to collaboratively generate digital signatures using shares of a private key, so that only a specified threshold of participants is needed to authorize a transaction. This approach boosts both security and resilience against key loss or compromise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>FROST is notable for reducing network overhead during signing operations, supporting efficient two-round (or even single-round, with preprocessing) signing without sacrificing security or concurrency. These features make FROST especially suitable for Zcash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 What is FROST for Zcash? 

<p><a href="https://zfnd.org/announcing-a-new-version-of-frost/">Our rationale from the onset of this project</a> was that “Zcash transactions should be publicly indistinguishable (i.e. an adversary observing the blockchain should not be able to gain any information about who the payment is for, how much the payment is, or who authorized the payment). Zcash previously did not have a good mechanism to achieve this goal in a multi-party setting, where a group of users want to jointly control funds and authorize transactions. Prior to FROST, the best protocols to perform this signing process required either undesirable implementation complexity, high network overheads to perform signing operations, the inability to support a threshold number of signers, or undesirable privacy leaks such as exposing the number of signers. Consequently, our decision to design a new threshold scheme stemmed from the desire to improve the state of threshold signature research to match the needs of Zcash users today.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to advancing privacy and security in digital transactions, the FROST for Zcash implementation we developed stands out with several important features. Notably, it is designed to keep the same security guarantees of RedDSA, in particular unlinkability, which is required by the Zcash protocol. This prevents attackers from linking two FROST-generated signatures to the same person. This makes integration straightforward for developers and organizations without the need for major infrastructure changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To support adoption, Zcash Foundation (ZF) provides <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/">user-friendly libraries</a>, <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">demo applications</a> and <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/tutorial.html">tutorials</a>, making it easy for anyone to incorporate FROST for Zcash into their projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Why did we develop FROST for Zcash? 

<p>ZF committed to building FROST for Zcash to address several important needs within the Zcash ecosystem. One of these primary motivations was to develop a secure, privacy-preserving multisignature implementation for shielded transactions, a functionality that was previously missing. The goal from the onset was to ensure seamless compatibility with existing Zcash standards and protocols, like RedDSA. This allows developers and projects to integrate FROST for Zcash into their systems without having to overhaul their infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ZF also wanted to make advanced cryptographic tools more accessible through user-friendly libraries, demo applications, and tutorials to help developers adopt FROST quickly and easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 What is the current state of FROST for Zcash? 

<p>We have now concluded our development work on the FROST reference implementation, <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost"><code>frost-core</code></a>, along with the ciphersuite crates. To help with deployment, we have also developed tools to help participants communicate with each other: <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost-zcash-demo/">a frost server, <code>frostd</code>, and the command line tool <code>frost-client</code></a> whose purpose is to work as a standalone tool but also as reference for wallets to integrate FROST.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 What Happens Next? 

<p>The next step is for wallets to integrate FROST using those tools directly or as reference, knowing that ZF is willing to provide guidance as needed. If wallet developers are hesitant to run their own <code>frostd</code> servers, the team is open to deploying a production version. Importantly, the frostd server doesn’t need to be trusted, as all messages are end-to-end encrypted; it only relays information, similar to lightwalletd, and leaks minimal metadata that can be further protected with tools like Tor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some existing concerns about the lack of a standardized key generation specification for FROST, which currently limits interoperability; progress on this front is ongoing, and we hope to complete that soon with guidance from ECC engineers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 FAQs 

<p>Why does Zcash require its own implementation? Why isn’t there one FROST implementation for all protocols?</p>

<p>Zcash requires a custom FROST implementation to maintain its privacy guarantees and protocol-specific needs, as generic FROST variants lack critical features like rerandomized signatures (ensuring threshold-signed transactions mirror single-party ones for anonymity) and compatibility with Zcash’s shielded transaction systems (Sapling/Orchard). Additionally, Zcash integrates share recovery mechanisms, identifiable aborts, and safeguards against concurrency attacks-adaptations unnecessary for non-privacy chains. Since blockchain protocols prioritize divergent tradeoffs (e.g., Bitcoin’s simplicity vs. Zcash’s unlinkability), a universal FROST standard is impractical due to cryptographic nuances (curves, serialization) and ecosystem-specific security requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does FROST for Zcash have commercial applications outside of Zcash?</p>

<p>No, this reference implementation was created specifically for the Zcash ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Has FROST for Zcash been audited?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, there have been two audits: the first one by NCC audited the core crates which implement the cryptographic part of FROST; <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/us/research-blog/public-report-zcash-frost-security-assessment/">check the complete report</a>. The second audit covered the <code>frostd</code> and <code>frost-client</code> helper tools and was done by Least Authority; the complete report is available <a href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/zcash-frost-demo/">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why is a FROST server needed? What is the risk of using it?</p>

<p>The FROST server simply helps participants to communicate with each other; most devices today are behind firewalls or routers which make direct peer-to-peer communication difficult. Technically the server is not even aware that it is being used for FROST!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the <code>frost-client </code>tool we have developed (which also serves as reference for other implementations and also works as a library) does end-to-end encryption of all messages. This means that the server does not need to be trusted and won’t be able to see the content of the messages. The server is able to gather metadata though (e.g. who is talking to who at what times), but that risk can be mitigated by using e.g. Tor. The risk is very similar to the risk that wallets take by using lightwallet servers.</p>

<p>Also note that using the FROST server is optional. We believe that it’s the easiest path forward until a better solution is developed, but wallets are free to handle user communication as they wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is missing for a regular Zcash user to be able to use FROST?</p>

<p>The missing piece is for wallets to integrate FROST. The required tooling to make that happen has already been completed by ZF (though of course wallets are free to use the implementation and design they wish to). Technical-inclined users can use FROST with Zcash today using our <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">frost-client command line tool</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is this reference implementation of FROST capable of being included in NU 6.1?</p>

<p>Due to the way FROST works, it’s not required to change the protocol in order to use FROST with Zcash. Therefore, yes, FROST can be used in NU 6.1, or even now with NU 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is the best way for wallet developers to contact ZF with questions?</p>

<p>Open an issue or discussion in the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost">repo</a> and reach out on the #frost channel of the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcash-r-d-chat-server-launch/38616">R&amp;D Discord</a>.</p>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO–May 20th, 2025: In a major step forward for digital identity and internet decentralization, Brave has become the first browser to launch its own on-chain top-level domain. In partnership with Unstoppable Domains, the new .brave domain is now available to Brave’s over 85 million monthly active users—offering a seamless way to own digital identity, send crypto, and navigate Web3. Minted on the Polygon blockchain, .brave domains will resolve across multiple networks—including Base, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Sonic, and more—making them widely compatible in the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>The launch of .brave marks a defining moment in the evolution of the internet, bridging the mainstream browser experience with the permissionless power of Web3.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to put privacy, ownership, and control back in the hands of users,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave. “.brave is more than a domain—it’s a user-owned identity layer, native to the Brave ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Through Unstoppable Domains, Brave users can now claim personalized .brave domains that unlock a full suite of decentralized tools. .brave domains can be used in the Brave Wallet, allowing for crypto payment in a simplified way. They can host censorship-resistant websites on IPFS, which are directly accessible within the Brave browser without traditional hosting fees. .brave domains will be directly resolvable within the Brave browser and the Brave Wallet starting in version 1.81 which will be available in Nightly, and targeted to Release on August 5th, 2025.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency payments become simpler and more human with .brave names replacing long wallet addresses. Users can also build a verifiable on-chain identity through UD.me, showcasing their digital assets, wallet connections, and public credentials within the broader Brave community.</p>
<p>The .brave domain integrates with Unstoppable’s broader ecosystem, offering secure, badge-gated messaging, domain trading through the Unstoppable Marketplace, and frictionless access to dApps, games, and metaverses via Login with Unstoppable.</p>
<p>“This is a bold leap toward an open internet,” said Sandy Carter, COO of Unstoppable Domains. “.brave puts digital identity in the hands of everyday users, not platforms.”</p>
<p>As part of the rollout, Unstoppable Domains will join Brave’s <a>Rewards 3.0 Partner Program</a>, further expanding the reach of the Basic Attention Token (BAT). With over 99% of BAT’s 1.5 billion supply in circulation, BAT now ranks as the 14th most held token on Ethereum and is accepted by 1.5 million verified creators worldwide.</p>
<p>Brave and Unstoppable are taking the next step in expanding the reach of the .brave domain by exploring the process for ICANN gTLD registration. While still in the early stages and subject to regulatory review, this move could pave the way for .brave to function across both the traditional Web2 internet and decentralized Web3 environments.</p>
<p>The potential ICANN accreditation would mark a significant milestone in the shared mission to empower users with greater control over their digital identities—no matter which corner of the internet they call home. This effort reflects a broader vision of a more open, interoperable web where innovation and ownership go hand in hand.</p>
<p>To claim a .brave domain and join the movement, visit <a href="https://get.unstoppabledomains.com/brave/">https://get.unstoppabledomains.com/brave/</a></p>

 About Unstoppable Domains 
<p>Launched in 2018, Unstoppable Domains is an ICANN-accredited registrar and leading digital identity platform dedicated to onboarding the world onto DNS and Web3. Unstoppable Domains provides Web3 domains minted on the blockchain, empowering individuals with full ownership and complete control over their digital identities, with no renewal fees.

Recognized by Forbes as one of America’s Best Startup Employers for four consecutive years—2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025—Unstoppable Domains has rapidly grown, boasting over 4.2 million registered domains.</p>
<p>For more information, please visit <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/">unstoppabledomains.com</a>.</p>

<p>With major shifts in regulatory landscapes and a growing awareness of digital privacy, the privacy coin market is poised for significant expansion. We speak with Jeffrey, the Head of Business Development at PIVX, to gain insights into their strategic vision, the key trends they anticipate, and how PIVX is positioning itself for robust growth in this evolving&nbsp;sector.</p> How do you see the privacy coin market evolving in the next 3–5 years? What key trends and challenges do you anticipate? <p>I believe we are now entering the stage of adoption in the privacy coin market. Major security breaches and recent crackdowns on privacy have sparked an interest in privacy and privacy&nbsp;coins.</p><p>Recently, Tornado Cash won a major legal battle for privacy in the USA, making people more comfortable with the idea of using obfuscation for funds. It is no longer perceived as a tool for criminals but as a tool to protect oneself from prying eyes. Privacy is a human right, and coins such as PIVX simply provide the tools to protect this&nbsp;right.</p><p>The biggest challenge to this is regulation at the moment. PIVX has overcome this by introducing exchange addresses to allow those who operate a business that requires transparency to only engage with transparent PIVX transactions.</p><p>There are also discussions with a few major cryptocurrencies to integrate privacy. I truly believe it will become the norm soon, as it’s simply the safest option for anyone. PIVX, being one of the first, has set a standard, and this is going to make PIVX shine especially with the optional privacy, which resolves many issues around regulation.</p><p>Ultimately, I believe the future for privacy projects is bright. Many of our new and upcoming partnerships have all embraced us and our privacy protocol. In the past, we faced scrutiny, but this is mostly not the case now, a clear indicator of privacy becoming a standard. I am excited for the future of PIVX in this&nbsp;sector.</p> Where do you believe PIVX currently stands in the market, and what are its biggest opportunities for&nbsp;growth? <p>PIVX dimmed out in recent years, largely due to the influx of memecoins. We also had a lack of funding and no dedicated business development activities. This has completely changed since the introduction of our new budget, which introduced new team members and&nbsp;roles.</p><p>Since taking on the role of business development head, we have successfully established major partnerships, such as NowPayments, Travala, Coinomi, as well as new exchange listings on top exchanges such as MEXC, Binance (USDT), BitMart, Lbank, and more. This shows major strength in a coin that was created at the beginning of the cryptocurrency cycle and will allow us to slowly but surely overcome all future challenges and to secure PIVX as a top privacy cryptocurrency.</p><p>Regarding our position from a technical standpoint, PIVX became the first-ever proof-of-stake cryptocurrency to incorporate ZK-Snarks and is currently working on becoming the first to allow private staking and masternodes. I believe we blaze the trail by providing sound security, fast transactions, functionality, and ease of use, with an expanding team that is going to introduce PIVX to many more. The future for PIVX is&nbsp;bright.</p> What are your thoughts on the role of regulatory compliance in PIVX’s business development strategy, and how would you navigate potential challenges? <p>It is key that we pay attention to regulatory demands so that we can provide PIVX globally without issues in terms of exchanges. However, as a decentralised project, our blockchain will go on regardless.</p><p>Because we care about following regulations, we keep in touch with our exchange partners. Binance recently asked for “Exchange Addresses,” a feature that limits them to receiving only the basic, transparent PIVX. This would make PIVX completely compliant due to a lack of privacy on said exchanges. This doesn’t remove privacy on our blockchain. Users who value protecting their financial data can always withdraw and send it to a SHIELD&nbsp;address.</p><p>Our team is active and willing to work with all of our partners and regulatory environments to deliver our project globally without issues, and most of all, to give our users a secure and sound blockchain that protects their financial data.</p> What are your thoughts on the integration of privacy features into other blockchain ecosystems and the potential for interoperability? <p>I believe it is very transformative and in the right direction for projects to integrate privacy features. It would also be a great introduction for PIVX as it is one of the earliest projects to incorporate privacy and the first-ever Proof of Stake blockchain to integrate ZK-Snarks (SHIELD) as a privacy protocol. I also believe PIVX, with its optional privacy integration, would be an inspiration for many existing and new projects that want to integrate privacy.</p><p>Having the freedom of choice makes things easier for those who require a transparent ledger, versus having some transactions that need to remain out of public sight, such as retail or savings. Having this model also makes PIVX regulatory compliant and a great example to replicate. <br> <br> Allowing for interoperability would be a great way to incorporate seamless value transfer across other blockchains, whilst preserving privacy through PIVX. I am all for it since it would introduce PIVX to a much wider audience and grow the use of the network. Perhaps it is something that we as a PIVX team can look at and discuss once we achieve our milestone v6.0&nbsp;release.</p> What are some common misconceptions about privacy coins that you would like to&nbsp;address? <p>The most common I’ve seen is the narrative that those who engage with privacy coins have something illicit to hide. I usually combat this with a simple question, “If a stranger were to ask to see your bank statement, would you let them?” This usually results in an immediate no; I then proceed with: “Well are you okay with the entire world seeing your cryptocurrency transactions without your permission?”</p><p>Most people fail to realise that relying on a transparent ledger can compromise one’s security and potentially lead to being&nbsp;harmed.</p><p>Using private blockchains such as SHIELD by PIVX helps you separate your crypto to prevent malicious parties from tracking your portfolio. I’ll end by saying that privacy coins do not facilitate crime, criminals facilitate crime, and privacy protects you from criminals.</p> What are some of the key lessons you’ve learned during your time leading business development at&nbsp;PIVX? <p>Even for a project with a minimal budget, big dreams can be achieved. I have worked alongside many amazing new partners for PIVX, such as Travala, MEXC, NOW Group, and many more, and each has provided a new use case for&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>It is hard, but having a community that unites behind my thinking process and choices makes everything much smoother. I have also learnt that everything in this industry has a ripple effect. What I mean by that is that one small listing or integration for PIVX can lead to another quite easily, as they may work together or use each other’s services.</p><p>It has also given me the time to reflect on PIVX and to identify weaknesses and to see that the biggest factor to growth is liquidity. This is now a key focus point for me. I am working alongside major exchanges that support PIVX to identify their liquidity needs so that we may attain other listings on their platform, such as Perpetual contracts, and thus far it has succeeded.</p><p>There is a lot to learn, however, I feel that the knowledge that I have gained through numerous conversations with like-minded people will be the driving factor for me to bring PIVX to new audiences, heights, and more use&nbsp;cases.</p> Beyond privacy, what other unique technological or community-driven advantages does PIVX offer potential partners and&nbsp;users? <p>A strong selling point I always highlight to our partners is the DAO and self-funded treasury that PIVX has. This mechanism allows for partners to submit their own proposals and to seek funding for work they may want to collaborate on with PIVX. This self-funded treasury guarantees constant development and funding for proposals that&nbsp;pass.</p><p>An example of this would be a recent partnership with Coinomi, which has now submitted a proposal for funding through our DAO. Participation in the DAO through such proposals, whether by submitting them or voting on them, is a key strength of the PIVX project. This also helps with our next advantage which is the community. Because PIVX is a DAO, our community has grown used to the fact that they do indeed have a voice when it comes to the decisions made for PIVX and are therefore active and do support us and our partners.</p><p>PIVX.

Your Choice.<br>To stay on top of PIVX news please visit PIVX.org and Discord.PIVX.org.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-future-for-privacy-projects-is-bright-pivxs-business-dev-lead-asserts-d079c6145c15">“The Future for Privacy Projects is Bright,” PIVX’s Business Dev Lead Asserts</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Blockchain architecture is constantly being forced to adapt to new technologies, as well as to meet new demands from users and builders. While the idea of apps building their own chains was first explored by Cosmos, it lacked the support and tooling to see it succeed. Later on, rollups also took the centerstage of Ethereum’s scaling roadmap, but due to their general purpose design, it led to a cannibalistic ecosystem. Initia learned from these 2 models and combined the best of both worlds: it built a full-stack framework for a seamless DevEx from the get-go and, more importantly, it designed its tokenomics in order to ensure maximum incentive alignment for its appchains. While the former decision removed the need for each separate chain to reinvent the wheel and risk ending up ‘a jack of all trades, master of none’, the latter ensured that appchains would not extract value away from the L1.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Ezaan’s background  From building on Terra to Initia  How Initia is rewriting the appchain thesis  Initia’s enshrined liquidity &amp; vested interest program (VIP)  Metrics &amp; Initia’s bet on crypto innovation  Solving liquidity fragmentation  Delphi’s involvement in Initia  Future roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/itsalwayszonny">Ezaan Mangalji on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/ZeMariaMacedo">Jose Maria Macedo on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/anildelphi">Anil Lulla on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/initia">Initia on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/Delphi_Digital">Delphi Digital on X</a>  <a>Delphi report on Initia</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Some people might call Jonathon Keats an artist, but he calls himself an experimental philosopher. His body of work explores the way that human life intersects with political and economic systems. His first major work, in the year 2000, involved sitting in a chair thinking for hours, and then selling his thoughts to patrons at prices calculated on the basis of their income. He once copyrighted his own mind as a sculpture. He created a ringtone based on John Cage’s famous piece, 4’33”, which is four minutes and thirty-three seconds of complete silence. He built a pinhole camera that takes photographic exposures lasting 100 years. In Berkeley, California, he built a temple for the worship of science. Recently, he has been involved in efforts to formalize rights of nature.&nbsp;</p><p>Jonathon challenges us to look carefully at the assumptions built into our markets, our democracies and our technologies, and constantly seems to do it in ways that seem abstract at the time, but end up prefiguring political or cultural issues years or decades before they erupt. He’s a wonderful guide to this territory, and to the big questions it involves.&nbsp;</p><p>In this conversation Matt and Jonathon discuss the philosophy of timekeeping. They consider the connectedness and the alienation of being on universal atomic time, the promise of alternative systems such as the river clock, and how different notions of timekeeping influence our understanding of democracy and nature.</p><p>Jonathon Keats is an experimental philosopher, artist and writer. He is currently a fellow at the Berggruen Institute, a research fellow at the Long Now Foundation, a research associate at the University of Arizona, principal philosopher at Earth Law Center and an artist-in-residence at Hyundai, the SETI Institute and Flux Projects. His most recent book is “You Belong to the Universe: Buckminster Fuller and the Future” (Oxford University Press).</p><p>Mentioned:</p>  <a href="https://alaskarivertime.org/About">Alaska RiverTime</a>  <p>If you have feedback or ideas for future episodes, email us at <a href="mailto:info@radicalxchange.org">info@radicalxchange.org</a>.</p><p>Host: Matt Prewitt</p><p>Guest: Jonathan Keats</p><p>Producer: Jack Henderson</p>

 PIVX Weekly Pulse (May 9th, 2025 — May 15th,&nbsp;2025) <p>Keep up with PIVX! Get your weekly dose of key market insights and community updates.</p> Market Pulse   Masternode Count: Demonstrating continued network strength, the number of active PIVX masternodes has risen to 2,123, up from last week’s&nbsp;2,117.    Price Check: While the Daily USD Value showed a period of consolidation this past week, with values holding steady between $0.16 and $0.18, the overall narrative remains encouraging. This week’s average price of $0.1758 represents a tangible step forward from the $0.1694 recorded in the preceding week. The upward trajectory, even amidst daily stability, likely reflects the unwavering commitment of the PIVX community and the tailwinds of a generally bullish cryptocurrency market providing a supportive environment.  v  Trading Buzz: The total weekly trading volume for PIVX witnessed a significant pullback this week, registering at approximately $16.5 million, a stark contrast to the previous week’s $40 million. Nevertheless, the daily trading volume maintained a healthy pace, consistently exceeding $2&nbsp;million.  <p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>One of the early selling points of cryptocurrencies was a promise of a new era of financial freedom and control. Ironically, most blockchain transactions remain completely public by design. Your wallet activities and spending patterns are exposed for anyone curious enough to&nbsp;look.</p><p>Privacy protocols emerged as the solution to this transparency problem. They create a protective shield around your financial activities, preserving your right to privacy. Join me as I explore the ABC of privacy protocols.</p> Why Privacy&nbsp;Matters <p>Know-Your-Customer (KYC) isn’t exactly a bad thing. As a matter of fact, you may not appreciate the value of KYC until your funds are stolen and recovered. However, given our increasingly connected world with massive digital footprints, you never know who is watching.</p><p>Individuals publicly associated with cryptocurrency are frequent targets for attackers, and tragically, their family members can also be at risk. Here are some chilling incidents to jolt your interest:</p>  Dad Kidnapped for Ransom: Imagine your dad snatched in broad daylight! That’s what happened to the father of a wealthy French crypto holder in Paris this May. The brutal twist? Kidnappers cut off one of his fingers to force compliance with their multi-million-euro Bitcoin ransom demand. Five suspects were caught, but the sheer audacity and violence highlight the real-world dangers of being a known crypto asset&nbsp;holder.  Ledger Co-Founder Tortured for Crypto Keys: In January 2025, David Balland, a co-founder of the massive crypto wallet firm Ledger, his wife, and a former colleague were victims of a home invasion. Balland himself was kidnapped, and in a horrifying act, his finger was severed to coerce him into revealing crypto wallet credentials. The gang even contacted another Ledger co-founder for&nbsp;ransom.  Teenage Crypto Heist Turns Violent Kidnapping: Three teenagers, emboldened by the allure of digital wealth, lured a crypto event host in Las Vegas in November 2024, kidnapped him at gunpoint from his own home, and drove him into the desert. They then proceeded to drain a staggering $4 million in crypto and&nbsp;NFTs.  <p>Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies expose your transactions to public view. Your wallet address functions like a public record that anyone can monitor. Over time, repeated transactions create patterns that can link back to your real identity.</p><p>Data analytics companies track these patterns to profile your spending habits. Government agencies might monitor your financial activities and wealth accumulation. Even your business competitors could gain insights into your deals and strategies. Privacy isn’t just a nice feature to have in this environment — it is essential for genuine financial independence and security.</p> Basic Types of Privacy Protocols <p>1. Stealth Addresses</p><p>Think of stealth addresses as burner phones for your crypto transactions. They generate unique, one-time addresses for each transaction you receive. Even if someone knows your main public address, they cannot connect it to these temporary addresses. Your complete transaction history remains private and compartmentalized. Monero incorporates this technique as one of its core privacy features.</p><p>2. Ring Signatures</p><p>Ring signatures cleverly mix your transaction with others to create ambiguity about the source. Imagine placing your signed check in a stack with several others of the same amount. An observer would see that a valid check exists, but couldn’t determine which person wrote it. When someone attempts to trace your transaction, they encounter multiple possible senders instead of just you. Your true identity blends into this carefully constructed group.</p><p>3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs</p><p>These sophisticated protocols work like mathematical magic tricks. They allow you to prove you know something without revealing what that thing is. In cryptocurrency transactions, you can verify you have sufficient funds without displaying your actual balance. You can confirm a transaction’s validity without exposing any sensitive details. Zcash built its privacy features around this technology, with PIVX implementing several bespoke upgrades.</p><p>4. Confidential Transactions</p><p>These specialized protocols conceal the amount being transferred while maintaining verifiable transactions. Observers can confirm that a valid exchange occurred but cannot see how much money changed hands. This prevents outsiders from analyzing your spending amounts or patterns. Cryptocurrencies like Grin and Beam implement this approach as a central&nbsp;feature.</p><p>5. Coin Mixing/Tumbling</p><p>Mixing services combine your coins with those from other users. They shuffle everything thoroughly and return different coins of equivalent value to each participant. This process resembles putting your marked dollar bills in a hat with others, mixing them thoroughly, and having everyone draw the same amount they contributed. CoinJoin protocols operate on this principle to break transaction trails.</p> Major Privacy Cryptocurrencies <p>Monero (XMR)</p><p>Monero is perhaps the most popular privacy-focused cryptocurrency. It implements a comprehensive suite of protections, including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions by default. Every single transaction automatically receives these privacy benefits without requiring special settings. Your balance, transaction history, and recipient information remain hidden from prying&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>Zcash (ZEC)</p><p>Zcash offers a flexible approach to privacy through its innovative zero-knowledge proof system called zk-SNARKs. Users can choose between fully private “shielded” transactions or transparent ones similar to Bitcoin. This optional privacy model appeals particularly to institutions and businesses that need privacy for sensitive operations while maintaining regulatory compliance when required. The cryptographic foundations of Zcash come from rigorous academic research.</p><p>PIVX (PIVX)</p><p>PIVX brings privacy to the proof-of-stake consensus model. It began as a fork of DASH but evolved significantly in its own direction. PIVX implemented a custom privacy protocol called zk-SNARKs (similar to Zcash) through its SHIELD technology. Users can choose between transparent and private transactions according to their needs. The project combines privacy with energy efficiency through its staking mechanism. This unique blend makes PIVX stand out as both environmentally conscious and privacy-focused. The PIVX community strongly emphasizes decentralized governance, allowing stakeholders to vote on development decisions.</p> Privacy Protocols on Public Blockchains <p>Secret Network</p><p>This innovative blockchain platform extends privacy to the realm of smart contracts. While standard smart contracts expose all their data and operations publicly, Secret contracts maintain data confidentiality while executing programmed functions. This breakthrough enables private decentralized applications, including confidential DeFi services, private NFT marketplaces, and anonymous voting systems. Secret Network provides privacy for entire applications rather than just basic transactions.</p><p>Aztec Protocol</p><p>Aztec brings sophisticated privacy features to Ethereum through an advanced layer-2 solution. It employs zero-knowledge proofs to shield critical transaction details from public view. Users can obscure transaction amounts, sender information, and recipient details while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum network. The protocol creates private versions of tokens that can interact seamlessly with existing DeFi applications. This integration brings powerful privacy options to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.</p> Regulatory Challenges <p>Government authorities worldwide have expressed growing concerns about privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. They worry these tools could potentially facilitate illicit activities beyond regulatory oversight. These concerns have led some cryptocurrency exchanges to delist privacy coins to avoid regulatory complications.</p><p>Compliance with financial regulations becomes particularly challenging when transaction details remain hidden. The privacy cryptocurrency community actively works to address legitimate regulatory concerns while still protecting fundamental user privacy rights and financial sovereignty.</p><p>In conclusion, privacy doesn’t exist to conceal wrongdoing — it protects your fundamental right to financial autonomy. We naturally expect privacy in other financial contexts, using sealed envelopes for mail and secure passwords for banking. Privacy protocols simply extend these normal expectations into the cryptocurrency realm.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy. Your Choice.<br>To stay on top of PIVX news please visit PIVX.org and Discord.PIVX.org.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-abc-of-privacy-protocols-0c48172f80c8">The ABC of Privacy Protocols</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Empeiria’s development update from April&nbsp;2025</p><p>Over the past weeks our team focused on reliability, identity‑centric functionality, and polishing the end‑user experience.</p><p>Take a look at some of the key milestones that move our Self‑Sovereign Identity (SSI) stack closer to a public launch — and what they mean for builders and the wider community.</p> 1. Test Infrastructure: From Unit to Full‑Stack Confidence <p>Testing is mission‑critical for an identity network, so we invested heavily in new automation.</p><p>Core libraries now sit at nearly 100 % unit‑test coverage, giving us early warning when edge‑cases creep&nbsp;in.</p><p>On top of that, we built a Docker‑orchestrated end‑to‑end (E2E) framework that spins up the complete stack — blockchain nodes, agents, and auxiliary services — in a disposable network.</p><p>Every pull request now runs the same interactions a production system would perform, catching integration bugs before they leave the&nbsp;branch.</p> 2. Linked Resources Module: On‑Chain Proof for Any&nbsp;Asset <p>Our new linked‑resources Cosmos‑SDK module lets a DID owner anchor versioned resources -revocation lists, credential schemas, media, or arbitrary JSON directly on‑chain.</p><p>Each upload is signed by the DID controller, timestamped, and assigned a monotonic version so consumers can verify both authenticity and freshness.</p><p>This unlocks lightweight, verifiable registries without a separate storage service and paves the way for richer ecosystem integrations.</p> 3. MCP Server: Faster QR Flows &amp; Cloud‑Native Deployment <p>We released a brand‑new Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server, now hosted in its own repository at <a href="https://github.com/empe-io/mcp-server%5B.%5D(https://www.notion.so/1e35ca766165802b9318da6d74c3411e?pvs=21)">https://github.com/empe-io/mcp-server</a></p><p>The server exposes the complete set of SSI operations through a streamlined API and ships with plug‑and‑play Issuer and Verifier services you can deploy in a single&nbsp;click.</p><p>Test API keys and sandbox addresses are pre‑configured in the&nbsp;.env.test.example file, letting developers issue and verify credentials in minutes. A convenient /qr endpoint can also return wallet‑ready QR codes on demand, smoothing agent‑to‑wallet hand‑offs without extra libraries.</p><p>Learn more about MCP Empe Server: <a href="https://x.com/empe_io/status/1920826190756995091">https://x.com/empe_io/status/1920826190756995091</a></p> 4. EMPE DID Wallet: Fresh Look, Secure Backups, Biometric Login <p>The wallet received its first full design overhaul since&nbsp;alpha.</p><p>Users will notice a cleaner layout, clearer credential previews, and snappier navigation on low‑power devices.</p><p>Under the hood we introduced an encrypted backup/export option that lets you download all credentials in a single protected file, while a companion seed‑word export secures your DID keys. Restoration stays a one‑tap operation — ideal for device migrations.</p><p>We also enabled biometric authentication and broadened deep‑link support for seamless transitions between any on‑device app and the&nbsp;wallet.</p> 5. EMPE Hub: Credential‑Gated Airdrops &amp;&nbsp;Faucet <p>On the platform side, the Airdrop section of the Empe Hub now issues an eligibility credential that doubles as anti‑sybil protection.</p><p>Holding that credential unlocks a new faucet protected by rate‑limits and on‑chain revocation checks, dramatically reducing the risk of bots draining test&nbsp;funds.</p><p>The flow showcases how Verifiable Credentials can safeguard token distribution without sacrificing user experience.</p><p>Stay tuned for upcoming details about on-chain&nbsp;airdrop!</p> 6. AI Credential Agent Prototype: Conversational Issuance&nbsp;Demo <p>Our prototype conversational agent now begins each session with a quick KYC validation, confirming the user’s identity before any sensitive data is exchanged.</p><p>Once verified, the agent gathers only the necessary details about the user’s tax profile and — when the criteria are met the agent issues a compliant credential via the MCP pipeline.</p><p>The entire flow happens in a single chat, concluding with a wallet‑ready QR code, and demonstrates how SSI agents can seamlessly combine identity proofing and document issuance while keeping the user in&nbsp;control.</p> 7. Backend &amp; API: Launch‑Ready Clean‑Up <p>Finally, the API layer underwent a spring clean: we removed deprecated endpoints, unified error codes, and tightened request validation. Container hardening, SBOM generation, and stricter CI gates round out the picture, positioning us for external security audits and the forthcoming mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p> Looking Ahead <p>With confidence in our test coverage, a powerful new on‑chain resource model, and user‑facing tools ready for prime‑time, we are gearing up for performance tuning under load and a full security&nbsp;review.</p><p>May will also bring an external developer preview of the wallet SDK — stay tuned and, as always, thank you for building the future of trust with&nbsp;us!</p>

<p>Google has agreed to pay Texas $1.375 billion to resolve claims around its unlawful collection and tracking of users’ private data. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced the agreement, emphasizing that the settlement sends a strong message to tech companies that they were not above the law and would be held accountable for violating user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The lawsuit, initially filed in 2022, alleged that the tech giant secretly tracked users’ movements, private searches, and even collected biometric data such as voiceprints and facial geometry through various products and services, including Google Photos and Google Assistant. These practices, according to the lawsuit, violated the privacy rights of Texas residents.</p><p>Google, while agreeing to the settlement, did not admit any wrongdoing. The company was quick to state that the agreement resolves “old claims” related to product policies that have already been updated. Google also clarified that the settlement does not require any further changes to its current products or services. A Google spokesperson stated that the company is pleased to put these issues behind them and will continue to build robust privacy controls into its services.</p><p>The settlement is the largest data privacy payout from Google to a single state, exceeding previous settlements obtained by other states in similar cases. Texas has been proactive in holding tech companies accountable for data privacy violations. In a similar case, Texas secured a $1.4 billion settlement with Meta over the company’s use of facial recognition software without user&nbsp;consent.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>Once live, the Input | Output (IO) led integration will bring full Cardano support to Brave Wallet, including Cardano native assets, as well as send, receive, swap, and signing capabilities- all natively embedded within Brave’s best-in-class browser wallet. This establishes Brave as a key partner to the Cardano community in the age of Voltaire.</p>
<p>San Francisco, May 12th, 2025: Input | Output (IO), the preeminent Web3 blockchain infrastructure and engineering firm, today announced a strategic partnership with Brave Software, the creator of the leading privacy-first browser and&nbsp; integrated multi-chain Brave Wallet. Together, they will integrate Cardano into the Brave Wallet, enabling Cardano blockchain access and token management from within the Brave wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our partnership with IO reflects Brave’s commitment to building a Web3 that maximizes interoperation for user choice, while giving them better tools to engage with decentralized ecosystems,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave and the Basic Attention Token (BAT). “Integrating Cardano into Brave Wallet not only expands multi-chain access, but also enhances security, governance participation, and the overall user experience.”</p>
<p>Through this integration, Brave users and the broader Cardano community will gain direct access to Cardano’s blockchain for activities such as governance participation and native asset management, all within the privacy-focused Brave Wallet. Additionally, Brave Wallet will support the execution of swaps with Cardano native tokens and other on-chain transactions. This major milestone enhances Brave’s multi-chain capabilities, adding to its existing support for networks like Ethereum and Solana. Cardano users will now be able to manage native assets like NIGHT, engage in governance, and seamlessly swap tokens—securely and privately—through Brave’s in-browser wallet.</p>
<p>“This collaboration with Brave is a natural fit,” said Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IO. “We share a vision for a more secure, accessible, and user-respecting Web3. By bringing Cardano into Brave Wallet, we are not only  expanding functionality for Cardano users in the age of on-chain governance, but also advancing a new standard for how blockchain networks should empower individuals—protecting privacy while enabling active, on-chain participation.”</p>
<p>The partnership also sets the stage for future innovation around engagement with Cardano’s governance and Midnight, a blockchain developed by Shielded Technologies, an Input | Output spinout focused on confidential smart contracts and data protection.&nbsp;</p>

 About Input | Output (IO) 
<p>Input | Output (IO) is a world-leading blockchain infrastructure and research engineering firm dedicated to building a sustainable Web3 ecosystem. IO is committed to advancing the next generation of blockchain innovation, focusing on scalability, security, and real-world adoption through pioneering research and cutting-edge engineering.</p>

 About Brave Wallet and Brave 
<p>Brave Wallet is the secure, multi-chain crypto wallet built directly into the Brave privacy browser—no extensions required. With Brave Wallet, users can manage tokens and NFTs; connect to DApps and onramp to Web3; and explore decentralized finance, social media, gaming, and more. Brave Wallet users can connect other “cold” wallets like Ledger &amp; Trezor. They can buy, store, send, and connect to DApps on Solana, Ethereum and EVM chains, Zcash, and Filecoin.</p>
<p>Brave Wallet is available on desktop, Android, and iOS, and is free to use. To get started on desktop, Brave browser users can click the wallet icon  near the address bar. On mobile, users can tap “⋮” (Android) or “…” (iOS), then tap the wallet icon.</p>
<p>Brave is a driving force leading the way for Web3 adoption, directly supporting Web3 into the broader Web through its privacy browser, independent search engine, and browser-native, multi-chain crypto wallet. Brave currently has over 85 million monthly active users. Learn more at <a>brave.com</a>.</p>

<p>As society evolves, so do its values and principles, but is that desirable for technology that seeks to build the most reliable, trustless and censorship resistant global settlement layer? Ever since the rise in popularity of Solana with its inflow of retail capital in a memecoin gold rush, Ethereum became even more criticized for sticking true to its core values despite the completely divergent demands of market participants. Moreover, the rollup centric scaling roadmap seemed to further silo attention and cause liquidity fragmentation, driving away value from Ethereum mainnet.

<p>As AI agents increasingly mediate financial transactions, healthcare decisions, and supply chain operations, a $7T verification fraud crisis looms — a figure highlighted by Anthony Scaramucci at ADFW 2024. With 85% of enterprises citing data provenance as their top AI adoption barrier, Empe L1 blockchain and Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerge as Web3’s answer to trusted AI interactions.</p> Why Trust&nbsp;Matters?   AI agents become increasingly autonomous and influential without tools to verify and&nbsp;trust.  Traditional systems waste $7T annually on verification costs.  62% of executives distrust AI decisions due to unverifiable data&nbsp;sources.  Deepfakes and phishing scams cost businesses $12B+ yearly, demanding cryptographic proof of authenticity.   MCP Empe Server: AI Trust&nbsp;Solution <p>MCP Servers are systems that provide context, tools, and prompts to AI clients. They expose data sources like files, documents, databases, and APIs to make them accessible to AI&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Empeiria drops the world’s first MCP Web3 Trust Layer — scalable, private and future-proof.

  AI Ascent 2025  <p>Sequoia convened builders and researchers in AI for another packed day of conversations, talks and demos.</p>   
	By Team Sequoia	 



Published May 8, 2025
  



 
<p>On May 2, we hosted our third AI Ascent event in San Francisco, bringing together more than 100 leading founders and researchers in AI to engage with what partner Pat Grady calls, the “tremendous sucking sound in the market” for AI, and his advice to “go at maximum velocity, all of the time.” Partner Sonya Huang talked about the improved retention rate of generative AI applications and pronounced that coding had reached “screaming product-market fit.” And partner Konstantine Buhler looked ahead to how the agent economy will transform how we work, and laid out the technologies we need to get there.</p>



<p>Over the course of the day we talked with AI leaders including Sam Altman of OpenAI, Jensen Huang and Jim Fan of Nvidia, Jeff Dean of Google, Mike Krieger of Anthropic, Bret Taylor of Sierra and many more. The talks ranged from new business models for AI agents, the race to build data centers, the power of vertical applications and the importance of open source.</p>



<p>Below is a selection of videos from the event (some sessions were off the record).</p>

<p>The PIVX story began in 2016, and since then, it’s been a tale of continuous evolution. From a fundamental shift in its consensus mechanism to ongoing improvements in its privacy technology, PIVX has continued to build. But what does the future hold for this leading privacy&nbsp;coin?</p><p>Let’s dive&nbsp;in…</p> PIVX’s Core&nbsp;Tenets <p>Before peering into the future, it’s essential to understand the foundational principles that guide PIVX’s long-term vision. Top on the list is the project’s commitment to privacy. Many proponents of the project would agree that privacy is not merely a feature for PIVX; it is a fundamental right and a core tenet. The long-term vision centres around continuously enhancing and innovating privacy-preserving technologies to empower users with control over their financial data.</p><p>Another foundational principle is decentralization and community governance. PIVX has always championed decentralization, not just in its network architecture but also in its governance. The Masternode network plays a crucial role in decision-making and funding proposals, ensuring the community actively shapes the project’s future.</p><p>As a digital currency intended for real-world use, security and network stability are paramount. PIVX’s ongoing development roadmap prioritizes maintaining a robust and resilient network that users can trust for their transactions and holdings. And while privacy and security are critical, PIVX recognizes the importance of user-friendliness. One of its goals is to make privacy accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise, through intuitive interfaces and seamless integrations.</p> The BHAG <p>There have been <a href="https://forum.pivx.org/threads/its-time-pivians-lets-define-our-bhag-big-hairy-audacious-goal.2737/">discussions</a> around defining a Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) for PIVX since the beginning of 2025. Weeks of vibrant deliberation across social platforms culminated in a compellingly ambitious BHAG: “Developing circular economies powered by PIVX.” To a great deal, the new mission aligns with the mission of PIVX Labs, which is to “Build a parallel economy, reachable anywhere in the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>This points to the possibility of prioritizing efforts that champion a PIVX-powered economy. While this is ambiguous in both interpretation and implementation, I expect to see more exchange listings and integrations with local businesses.</p> Ambassador Program <p>Speaking of local businesses, one key item on the roadmap is the Ambassador Program, which is still being refined to ensure its effectiveness and sustainability. The initiative is envisioned as a crucial catalyst for grassroots adoption.</p><p>By empowering passionate community members to become local evangelists and facilitators, the Ambassador Program aims to foster organic growth and real-world use cases for PIVX at a foundational level. This boots-on-the-ground approach will be instrumental in building local circular economies where PIVX can truly&nbsp;thrive.</p> PIVX Labs <p>Labs in the powerhouse behind a handful of PIVX products, including PIVX Rewards, PIVCards, and the MyPIVXWallet (MPW). As an integral part of the project, its current roadmap is hinged on four pillars — wallet (banking), cards (spending), rewards (earning), and messaging (communication).</p><p>The first pillar focuses on developing a comprehensive wallet, extending its functionality beyond basic transactions to encompass a range of banking-like features, aiming to be a central hub for users’ financial activities.</p><p>Complementing this is the second pillar: cards for spending, which seeks to integrate user-friendly card solutions, making it seamless for individuals to utilize their PIVX for everyday purchases.</p><p>The third pillar centers on rewards for earning, envisioning the creation of various mechanisms and platforms that empower users to accumulate PIVX through active participation and contributions within the ecosystem.</p><p>Finally, the fourth pillar emphasizes messaging for secure communication, aiming to integrate private and protected communication capabilities directly within the PIVX environment.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy. Your Choice.<br>To stay on top of PIVX news please visit PIVX.org and Discord.PIVX.org</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-road-ahead-pivxs-long-term-vision-and-development-roadmap-b491ad0b3061">The Road Ahead: PIVX’s Long-Term Vision and Development Roadmap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.3.0">Zebra 2.3.0</a>.</p>



<p>This release includes a number of improvements to regtest mode, by adding methods to reconsider and invalidate blocks, as well as fixing a bug that was preventing some transparent transactions from being served by Zebra in regtest mode. Additionally, this release restores Zebra’s ability to mine blocks on testnet and regtest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have also made several improvements to the set of RPC methods supported by Zebra to cover the required validator node use cases once zcashd is deprecated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the release includes the following breaking changes:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The RPC endpoint is no longer enabled by default in Docker. Users who require it must follow <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/docker.html#rpc">these instructions</a>. 



 We no longer publish Docker images tagged with the <code>sha-</code> or <code>v</code> prefixes. 



 The <code>getblocktemplate-rpcs</code> Cargo feature has been removed, and the functionality behind that flag is now available by default. 
 



<p></p>



<p>You can see a full copy of the included changes in the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.3.0">v2.3.0 Release Notes</a> on GitHub.</p>

  Partnering with FastAPI Labs: Simplified App Deployment   <p>Sebastián is removing roadblocks for app developers—and transforming the software development process. </p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a>	 



Published May 5, 2025
  



FASTAPI LABS FOUNDER SEBASTIÁN RAMÍREZ.



 
<p>We at Sequoia knew Sebastián Ramírez well long before we became the lead investor in his company, <a href="https://fastapilabs.com/">FastAPI Labs</a>. In 2023 he was the inaugural recipient of our <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/open-source-fellowship-applications/">Open Source Fellowship</a>.</p>



<p>We started the fellowship because we recognized that open source is the lifeblood of software, and that open source contributors around the world make commercial software better and more reliable. We wanted our first fellowship recipient to be someone who already had a huge impact on the open source ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sebastián perfectly fit that bill! He is the creator of <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, the wildly popular open-source Python framework used everywhere from Fortune Global 500 corporations such as BMW, American Express and Roche, to academia, to nonprofits such as NASA’s Space Telescope Science Institute and the Red Cross. At the start of the fellowship, Sebastián was overflowing with ideas to improve on what he’d built—and we are proud to have supported his work in the years since.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting a company came up several times in our many conversations with him. In a sense, Sebastián has been an entrepreneur his entire life, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sebastian-ramirez-spotlight/">having taken the road less traveled many times before</a>. And he has plenty of the grit and perseverance a founder needs. Building a new business today may be a fad for many engineering and business graduates, but Sebastián was intentional about what his company would do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FastAPI the open-source framework was born from Sebastián’s vision for solving a complicated problem—building an API in Python. FastAPI Labs the company was born from his frustration with how difficult it is to deploy an app. It turns out that the software development lifecycle is an exercise of moving the cheese: you remove one bottleneck, only to discover the next. And Sebastián has never been someone to shy away from removing bottlenecks or solving gnarly problems. That’s why he and his team are building <a href="https://fastapicloud.com/">FastAPI Cloud</a>: a service that enables developers to seamlessly deploy apps to the cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given our long relationship with and belief in Sebastián, it’s only natural that we’re leading the seed round in FastAPI Labs, and we are excited to continue to support him and his team.</p>

<p>The European Parliament has given its nod to a ban on anonymous cryptocurrencies within the EU, setting a target implementation date of 2027. The new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), supposedly driven by the imperative to clamp down on money laundering and the financing of terrorism, will likely clamp down on privacy coins such as Monero, ZCash, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>The new <a href="https://x.com/EuCInitiative/status/1915012789602836794">regulations</a>, part of a wider legislative push against illicit financial activities, will effectively prohibit the issuance and trading of cryptocurrencies that do not permit the identification of their users. Specifically, credit institutions, financial institutions, and crypto asset service providers (CASPs) will face a prohibition on maintaining anonymous accounts and handling cryptocurrencies that enhance&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Proponents of the ban argue that the inherent anonymity of these tokens presents a considerable threat to financial security, rendering them attractive instruments for illicit actors. By outlawing their availability within the EU, lawmakers intend to cultivate a more regulated and traceable environment for digital assets, aligning them more closely with established financial systems concerning anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) protocols.</p><p>However, this move has ignited significant controversy within the cryptocurrency community. Critics voice concerns that the ban encroaches upon the fundamental principles of privacy and decentralization that underpin many cryptocurrencies. They argue that anonymous tokens serve legitimate purposes, providing financial privacy for individuals in various contexts, and that a sweeping prohibition could stifle technological advancement and push users towards less regulated ecosystems outside the EU’s jurisdiction.</p><p>Furthermore, questions have been raised regarding the practicalities of enforcing such a ban and its potential ramifications for the broader crypto market. Implementing a complete prohibition on anonymous tokens could prove technically complex, given the decentralized and borderless nature of many cryptocurrencies. There are also uncertainties about how exchanges and other crypto service providers operating within the EU will effectively identify and delist such tokens by the 2027 deadline.</p><p>But according to Vyara Savova, senior policy lead at the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI), “the regulations (the AMLR, AMLD, and AMLAR) are final, and what remains is the ‘fine print’ — aka the interpretation of some of the requirements through the so-called implementing and delegated acts.”</p><p>This decision by the European Parliament underscores a growing global trend of heightened regulatory scrutiny over the cryptocurrency market. While jurisdictions worldwide grapple with the optimal approach to managing the risks and opportunities associated with digital assets, the EU’s decision to ban anonymous tokens signals a clear inclination toward prioritizing traceability.</p><p>PIVX.

  Brave for Android 1.78 introduces a new Shields option called Block Elements, which lets you tap any on-page annoyance and hide it

<p>This is the 34th post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Vadym Struts (Senior Software Engineer) and Kleant Zogu (Mobile Product Designer) and was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (VP, Privacy and Security).</p>
<p>Brave for Android 1.78 introduces a new Shields option called Block Elements, which lets you tap any on-page annoyance and hide it.</p>



    


    



<p>Most websites are crowded with visual clutter, largely due to third-party advertising. This problem is even worse on mobile devices, where limited screen real estate makes every banner feel even more intrusive, especially on news or recipe websites. Brave already protects you from many of these annoyances by automatically stripping away third-party ads and trackers, cookie consent notices (<a>read more</a> about how we’re automatically detecting cookie consent notices) and those “Open in app” prompts. This ensures a safe and pleasant browsing experience the moment you download Brave.</p>
<p>Now, Brave for Android takes this annoyance blocking a step further by allowing you to manually hide any remaining page clutter. This could be a sidebar of “Trending” clickbait, a promo banner you can’t close, or anything else that gets in the way of focusing on the content you care about.</p>
<p>The Block Elements feature already exists on desktop, but we’ve revamped the experience there to improve its usability and better align with Android.</p>

 How to block elements 

 Android 
<p>To block unwanted page elements on Brave Android:</p>
 
 Tap the Shields icon in the address bar. 
 Tap Advanced controls. 
 Tap Block element. 
 Tap the page element you want to block. 
 Press the Block Elements button. 
 
<p>The unwanted page element will now be hidden.</p>
<p>


    


    



      
      
    



    


    



      
      
    </p>

 Desktop 
<p>To block elements on Desktop:</p>
 
 Right-click on the page you’re viewing. 
 Select Block elements. 
 Select the element you want to block. 
 Press the Block Elements button. 
 



    


    



      
      
    

 Clear all blocked elements 
<p>On both Android and desktop, you can easily undo your changes and bring back blocked elements for a website:</p>
 
 Open Shields. 
 Click or tap Clear all blocked elements. 
 
<p>Note: This action will only clear rules for the website you’re currently viewing. Also note that the Clear all blocked elements option will only appear at the bottom of the Shields panel if you have any blocked elements on the page.</p>

<p>Clear all blocked elements on desktop</p>

 Customizing blocking rules 
<p>Under the hood, the Block Elements feature works by adding custom, cosmetic filter rules for individual sites. To see all of your per-site custom rules, you can press Manage filters while selecting elements to block. Alternatively, you can navigate to brave://settings/shields/filters on both Android and desktop.</p>
<p>On desktop, you can also find other elements at the same DOM level by moving the slider. This can be useful to block multiple related elements or narrow down the block. Click Show rules to see the changing cosmetic rules.</p>

 User-friendly privacy features 
<p>Similar to the <a>Shred feature</a> on iOS, we designed Block Elements on Android to be a usable and fun feature that gives you more control over your browsing experience. However, note that blocking elements on a page might cause the website to break, especially if the website changes over time. If a page suddenly looks odd (for example, the page is blank or has unusable buttons) tap Clear all blocked elements to undo your changes for that page.</p>

Our weekly highlights keep you updated on crucial market trends and everything happening within the vibrant PIVX community.</p> Market Pulse   Masternode Count: The number of active masternodes now sits at 2,111, an increase of 7 over the last week, signalling a healthy and ongoing commitment to the PIVX&nbsp;network.    Price Check: Riding the positive crypto market wave, PIVX is showing impressive price action! Over the past week, the Daily USD Value traded between $0.14 and $0.2, resulting in a strong weekly average of $0.1552.

   On April 17, 2025 we opened a Dev Fund Poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to determine which of the funding proposals have the most support, or if the Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block rewards should go to miners.

<p>On April 17, 2025 we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/d55e9c6a-1b8a-11f0-8188-0ebcee0014ca/view">Dev Fund Poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to determine which of the funding proposals have the most support, or if the Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block rewards should go to miners. Additionally the poll surveyed community members about prioritizing an extension of the Dev Fund and implementation of a new funding model, even if it requires postponing NU7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>128 ZCAP voters participated in this poll, representing 64% of the total number of members. The results appear below.</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q1: Which of the following funding proposals do you support? You can select more than one proposal.</p>



 
 Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C) (84 votes/32.3%) 



 Community-Governed Funding Model (41votes/15.8%) 



 Pure Coinholder Funding Model (28 votes/10.8%) 



 Pure ZCAP Funding Model (39 votes/15.0%) 



 Zcash Governance Bloc (zBloc) (44 votes/16.9%) 



 The Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block reward should go to miners. (24 votes/9.2%) 
 



<p></p>



<p>Note: This question allowed for multiple selections, therefore the percentages above represent the total number of votes for each option, based on a total of 260 selections made across all options.&nbsp;</p>


 
 


 



 



<p></p>



<p>Q2: Do you support prioritizing the extension of the Dev Fund and the implementation of a new funding model, even if it requires postponing NU7?</p>



 
 Yes (66 votes/51.6%) 



 No (43 votes/33.6%) 



 Abstain (19 votes/14.8%) 
 



 


 
 


 



 



<p></p>



<p>Based on these results we can conclude that the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-ecc-community-and-coinholder">Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C)</a> has the greatest level of support and that an extension of the Dev Fund and implementation of a new funding model is ZCAP’s recommended path forward. The outcomes of this poll will be considered along with the ZAC and coin holder polls to determine if there is community consensus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would like to express our gratitude to everyone who contributed to this process. Thank you to those who drafted proposals, engaged in discussions and debates on the Zcash community forum, across social media, and during community calls. Additionally, we appreciate those who organized alternative community polls and are grateful to everyone who took the time to vote.</p>

<p>During Q1 2025, Least Authority (in their role as the Zcash Ecosystem Security Lead) undertook an audit of the FROST Demo code, including the <code>frost-client</code> command line tool and <code>frostd</code> server components. We expect that the FROST server, <code>frostd</code>, will be used by wallets to help participants and coordinators communicate with each other and that the FROST client, in addition to being a working command line tool, will help wallets to integrate FROST as an example of how to interact with the server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are pleased to announce that the audit contained no high severity findings, and that we have addressed and mitigated the audit findings which can be found in the current main branch of the <a href="https://github.com/zcashfoundation/frost-zcash-demo">frost-zcash-demo github repository</a>.</p>

<p>Panther Protocol has completed a major milestone as it approaches its mainnet launch, having been successfully audited by blockchain security firm <a href="https://veridise.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Veridise</a>. The audit of the protocol confirms that Panther’s smart contracts and privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as the protocol’s Zero-Knowledge (ZK) circuits, meet Veridise's high-security standards.&nbsp;</p> Why This Matters <p>The security of Panther's smart contracts and privacy-enhancing technology is critical to instilling trust and adoption of its confidential transaction infrastructure by both users and market operators. The Veridise audit confirms that Panther’s smart contracts and cryptographic implementations function as intended.</p><p>Beyond security, the audit verifies that Panther’s privacy-preserving architecture is implemented correctly and operates as designed, including the protocol’s compliance mechanisms, logic-related functions of the protocol, and protocol-wide vectors. Veridise also assessed Panther Protocol’s cryptographic primitives. In total, Verdise's assessment of Panther Protocol V1 was conducted over 171 in-person days.&nbsp;</p> What This Means for Panther Users <p>For users, this means greater confidence in Panther’s infrastructure. With the audit complete, Panther’s privacy-preserving technology has been independently validated, improving the security and reliability of transactions. Web3 users can utilize Panther Protocol’s solutions, knowing that the system has undergone rigorous scrutiny and improvements where needed.</p><p>For full transparency, the final audit report is available <a href="https://github.com/pantherfoundation/audits/blob/main/Veridise%20Panther%20Protocol%20250425.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.</p> What’s Next? <p>Panther’s Canary Network was recently launched on Polygon. This live, production-like environment uses real assets to fine-tune functionality before mainnet launch. The Canary Network features a single Zone operated by Eurobit, a Spanish crypto exchange, providing a preview of Panther’s privacy-preserving infrastructure.</p><p>The Canary network will continue to operate for 2-3 months. Follow Panther on <a href="https://x.com/ZKPanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">X</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EST99KpuGX?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> to stay updated while we progress.</p> Conclusion <p>The Veridise audit marks a major milestone for Panther as the Panther ecosystem prepares for mainnet. By prioritizing security, compliance, and privacy, Panther is building a trusted and resilient DeFi platform.</p><p>The future of on-chain finance is private—Panther is making it a reality.</p>

  Partnering with Nuvo: The Future of B2B Commerce  <p>The number of businesses and the volume of trade in the global economy are exploding—yet much of it remains offline and disconnected. Sid, Rameez and their team at Nuvo are building the modern B2B commerce network to accelerate how businesses connect, build trust and coordinate trade at scale.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bryan-schreier/">Bryan Schreier</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a>	 



Published April 30, 2025
  



TEAM NUVO.



 
<p>A coffee roaster in Minnesota is gaining customers across the country. But when a new restaurant places an order, the roaster doesn’t get paid right away. Instead, they begin a slow process of onboarding the restaurant, extending trade credit with payment due in 30 days or more, and navigating a maze of paperwork, references and risk checks. Multiply that across dozens of new customers, and growth starts to feel like strain. More risk. More complexity. Less time to focus on the business itself.</p>



<p>This is how the $5 trillion trade credit market operates: manually and offline.</p>



<p>Trade credit is the most common form of capital allocation across the global goods economy, yet the infrastructure behind it remains fragmented and outdated. While consumer lending is built on centralized bureaus and machine learning models, businesses still rely on instinct, emails and spreadsheets to decide who they can trust. There is no shared system for verifying partners or coordinating trade at scale. The result is slower growth, greater risk and untapped opportunity across the industries that power the world.</p>



<p>Opportunities are everywhere, but the people who recognize them are rare—and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidmalladi/">Sid Malladi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rameez-remsudeen/">Rameez Remsudeen</a> are one in a trillion. Sid and Rameez co-founded <a href="https://nuvo.com/">Nuvo</a> with a goal to solve trade credit, and a vision to build a connective layer for how businesses establish trust, form relationships and grow faster together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Nuvo, businesses create a verified profile that shares critical trust signals with potential partners—licenses, creditworthiness, banking information and trade history—all in one place. That same coffee roaster can now validate new customers, connect with better suppliers, negotiate stronger terms and scale their trade relationships without chasing paperwork or waiting weeks for approvals. Every relationship becomes easier to start, faster to scale and stronger over time.</p>



<p>And as more companies join Nuvo, they bring their buyers and sellers with them. Each connection strengthens the network, making it more powerful and valuable for every participant. It is a dynamic we have seen before in iconic companies like PayPal, Block&nbsp; and Stripe, where early adoption created lasting flywheels that reshaped entire industries. We believe Nuvo is on a similar path, building the trusted infrastructure that B2B commerce has needed for decades.</p>



<p>Sid and Rameez have approached this problem with the depth, speed and precision that we believe defines enduring companies. They have spent time inside the industries Nuvo serves, from lumber to logistics to fresh produce, understanding how trade relationships are built and where they break. They listen carefully, intentionally evolve the company as it scales, and move quickly. When we discussed a strategy shift to accelerate go-to-market, for example, it was fully executed within two weeks. That discipline and agility are already showing in results. Thousands of businesses are now joining Nuvo every month.</p>



<p>We are proud to partner with Nuvo on this journey by leading their Series A, which will help them <a href="http://nuvo.com/jobs">grow their team</a> and expand their suite of products. They are tackling an invisible but critical part of the global economy and building the infrastructure that will allow millions of businesses to trade with more trust, more intelligence and fewer barriers.</p>

This month, we introduce a new slate of partners pushing the boundaries of Web3 media, usability, and engagement. In addition to 6 new partners, April brings new <a>Brave Rewards</a> product updates and developments.</p>

 &nbsp;Brave Rewards 3.0 product updates 
 
 Rewards 3.0 now available on Android 
 Updated Rewards UI with a single-page view for easier navigation and viewing on desktop and Android

 Meet April’s featured partners 
<p>This month’s partners are transforming how people engage with Web3, from community-owned media and collaborative storytelling to digital identity, privacy tools, and movement-based rewards. Each brings something unique to the table for Brave Rewards users and BAT holders: From educational content and token-gated perks to fitness incentives and weekly community engagement, these projects are helping enhance BAT’s presence across culture, content, and everyday life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>New partner offers will roll out on the Brave Rewards Offer Wall, Notification Ads, Newsfeed, and New Tab Takeovers throughout the program, giving users more ways to explore, earn, and engage with BAT.</p>

 Coinage 
<p><a href="https://www.coinage.media/">Coinage</a> is the first community-owned crypto news outlet, delivering original reporting, sharp analysis, and a weekly video series that puts its members in the producer’s seat. Coinage introduces a Web3 media model where subscribers can join the Coinage DAO co-op to collaborate, own, and earn patronage dividends. Zack Guzman, founder of Trustless Media and Coinage, appears on <a>Episode 67 of The Brave Technologist</a>, where Zack discusses his journey from traditional media to Trustless Media, and the model he’s pioneering with Coinage.</p>
<p>As part of the program, Coinage is exploring ways to reward community engagement with BAT, including perks for sharing episode feedback, voting on future topics, and unlocking exclusive content.</p>

 H3 Entertainment 
<p><a href="https://x.com/h3entertain?lang=en">H3 Entertainment</a> is pioneering the next era of entertainment by empowering fans and filmmakers to collaborate in a transparent, decentralized media ecosystem. With a mission to democratize storytelling through Web3, H3 is reshaping how content is created and shared.</p>
<p>During the program, H3 will develop video campaigns around Brave and BAT, including high-impact introduction ads, Web3 explainers, and creative concept pieces to boost awareness and onboard new users.</p>

 STEPN 
<p><a href="https://www.stepn.com/">STEPN</a> is a move-to-earn lifestyle app from the team at FSL with over 5.7 million users. STEPN rewards users with tokens and NFTs for walking, jogging, or running outdoors. As a pioneer in Web3 fitness, STEPN transforms physical activity into digital rewards, promoting healthier habits while connecting physical activity to on-chain value. STEPN is among a growing cohort of products that show crossover potential for Web3 to add value to physical activities.</p>
<p>Through the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program, STEPN will integrate custom Brave and BAT in-game collectibles and BAT-powered prize pools to help users stay active and earn along the way.</p>

 Unfungible 
<p><a href="https://www.unfungible.xyz/">Unfungible</a> is a leading Web3 marketing agency dedicated to pioneering community building, having supported over 200 NFT projects and brands, driving more than $100 million in client revenue through innovative campaigns and Web3-native expertise. Together with Brave, they have co-hosted weekly X Spaces panels since May 2024, highlighting NFT and Web3 trends featuring guests from Forbes Web3, MemeFi, PublicAI, and many more.</p>
<p>These panels have generated 1.9 million impressions and reached over 150,000 listeners. As part of the Program, Unfungible will offer Brave Ads media credits to their top Web3 clients each month, enabling them to leverage Brave’s premium ad network and amplify their reach.</p>

 Unstoppable Domains 
<p><a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/?ref=ac4f9d4dec334fc&amp;gad_source=1">Unstoppable Domains</a>&nbsp;is a leading provider of on-chain domain names, including .crypto, .nft, and .pudgy, giving users full ownership and control of their digital identity.</p>
<p>Since 2021, Brave and Unstoppable have partnered to bring native support in Brave for decentralized websites in the Brave browser, eliminating the need for extensions or custom settings.</p>
<p>Today, BAT can be used to purchase on-chain domains at Unstoppable, through the crypto option with Coinbase. On-chain domains can be used in the Brave Wallet to easily send and receive BAT and other cryptocurrencies. Through this program, we’re working together to unlock even more opportunities for our users.</p>

 Zcash Media 
<p><a href="https://z.cash/ecosystem/zcash-media/">Zcash Media</a> is an independent team of creators in the Zcash ecosystem that creates high-quality educational content focused on Zcash, privacy, and the future of money. Their work is produced by the award-winning team at 37 LAINES.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://x.com/jswihart">Josh Swihart</a>, CEO of <a href="https://electriccoin.co/">Electric Coin Company (ECC)</a>, joined Brave’s <a href="https://x.com/AttentionToken/status/1914702758990524483">weekly BAT Community Call</a> (Tuesdays at 2 PM Pacific / 5 PM Eastern on Brave Talk) to discuss Zcash’s <a>ongoing partnership</a> with Brave and Filecoin Foundation, and our recent rollout of <a>shielded Zcash support in the Brave Wallet</a>. The call drew over <a href="https://x.com/AttentionToken/status/1914778895217533309">1.3K live simulcast viewers</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the program, Zcash Media will work with Brave on new short-form content that underscores our shared mission to protect user privacy and expand support for shielded Zcash transactions in the browser. Privacy education is key, and Brave, Brave Rewards, and Zcash Media will collaborate to inform the public on the importance of privacy for the Web, search, and transactions.</p>

 Updates from March partners 
<p>The Rewards 3.0 Partner Program kicked off with strong momentum in March with 7 inaugural partners: Bandit’s Badchain, CHOMP, Decentraland, GuanoCoin, Karate Combat, Pudgy Pop, and SOL Incinerator. We launched Brave Ads campaigns, co-branded activations, and early BAT integrations that helped partners build visibility, boost engagement, and pilot new on-chain experiences.</p>
<p>To foster collaboration, we launched the Collab Lab: a dedicated space where Rewards 3.0 partners, BAT Ambassadors, and community leaders connect to co-create campaigns that drive mutual value and expand the BAT ecosystem.</p>
<p>Decentraland spotlighted its <a href="https://mvfw.org/">Metaverse Fashion Week</a> through a Brave New Tab Takeover, allowing millions of Brave users to discover the event (and earn BAT just for seeing the campaign with Rewards enabled). Decentraland’s Executive Director, Yemel Jardi, appears <a>on episode 68 of The Brave Technologist</a>, discussing the role of community in open virtual worlds, lessons learned in their journey to discover market fit, and more.</p>
<p>Karate Combat collaborated with the BAT Community to launch a series of limited digital collectibles on <a href="https://drip.haus/echo">Drip Haus</a>. Styled like retro fight night ticket stubs, the NFTs unlock access to a token-gated viewing party for <a href="https://karate.com/events/kc54">KC54</a>, streaming May 2nd via <a>Brave Talk</a>, with live commentary by BAT Ambassador and martial arts coach <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cryptodojo">Crypto Dojo</a>. The Brave and BAT logos will continue to be featured in the Karate Combat arena for all eyes to see at KC54.</p>
<p>CHOMP joined our recent <a href="https://x.com/AttentionToken/status/1905330319965778096">BAT X Spaces panel</a> on Web3 gamification and design, and <a href="https://x.com/lukemulks/status/1894527747772616955">stopped by our weekly BAT Community Call</a>. During its Brave New Tab Takeover last month, CHOMP welcomed over 2000 new users in just 24 hours—some becoming power users. To date, CHOMP has released five BAT-powered interactive decks, each drawing hundreds of participants and showcasing BAT as a strong driver of engagement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, updates from GuanoCoin, SOL Incinerator, and Pudgy Pop are underway and will be shared in the next update.</p>

        How multimodal models are unlocking new forms of human expression and fluid intelligence.

<p>For most of computing history, intelligence flowed through a narrow channel: text in, text out. </p>



<p>If you could code or write, you had power. If you couldn’t, you were boxed out. Digital tools were built for verbal, logical thinkers. Everyone else—visual thinkers, spatial reasoners, musicians, creatives who think in movement or metaphor—had to translate their intelligence into text to be understood by machines.</p>



<p>That era is ending.</p>



<p>We’re entering a new phase of AI: one where models natively understand and generate across modalities—text, image, code, video, audio, voice—not as plugins, but as representations in a unified latent space. This isn’t just a technical upgrade. It’s a shift in the cognitive interface between humans and machines.</p>



<p>Multimodal AI is not just about making cooler images. It’s about unlocking intelligence that’s been latent, unexpressed, or trapped in the wrong modality. It’s about turning the act of thinking itself into a richer, more fluid medium.</p>



<p>This is AI’s synesthesia moment.</p>



 Multimodality: The new superpower&nbsp; 



<p>Multimodal models don’t literally “think” in pictures or sounds—they encode and generate meaning through a universal latent representation.</p>



<p>That’s the leap. Not a patchwork of plugins or stitched-together APIs, but a single system that learns and expresses concepts through a shared semantic embedding space, where a sentence, a sketch, a snippet of code, or a melody are all interconnected representations of meaning.</p>



<p>When Google announced Gemini, it described the model as “built from the ground up to be multimodal.” So was GPT-4o. These aren’t add-ons—they’re foundational systems each built on their own universal representations.</p>



<p>Why does that matter? Because it fundamentally changes how intelligence is represented inside the model. Instead of translating across separate sensory domains, multimodal models encode information into a shared latent space—enabling seamless transitions between forms of expression.</p>



<p>Under the hood, this unified approach enables a more expressive and controllable generation process. Consider the two dominant paradigms in image generation: diffusion and next-token prediction.</p>



<p>Diffusion starts with noise and gradually refines it—like a sculptor carving form from chaos. Next-token prediction works more sequentially, adding elements incrementally. While GPT-4o’s precise internal workings aren’t fully public, its image generation appears to integrate both approaches: creating a rough semantic outline autoregressively, then refining it through diffusion processes. The outputs aren’t “thought” in images or audio—they’re decoded from the latent space. This unified latent representation makes outputs better because generation happens all together, rather than across loosely coupled systems.</p>



<p>Previously, image generation meant rewriting prompts, piping them through DALL-E, and hoping for the best. With GPT-4o, prompting feels collaborative. You can speak in fragments or metaphors, and the model effortlessly decodes these into coherent results.</p>



<p>The same latent-space shift is happening with voice. Models like Sesame’s voice engine capture tone, emotion, pacing, and style—not because they “think” in sound, but because they decode nuanced semantic representations directly into expressive audio outputs. Voice becomes a fully expressive medium, with vast implications for storytelling, education and interaction.</p>
 







 
 Translating intelligence with AI synesthesia 



<p>Digital tools have long favored those who express themselves verbally. But intelligence isn’t limited to words. Some think visually, rhythmically or spatially.</p>



<p>Multimodal AI bridges these gaps. Visual thinkers no longer need paragraphs. Conceptual thinkers no longer need to wrestle with interfaces. Musicians and speakers no longer depend solely on editors or engineers. Intelligence can now fluidly express—and translate—across mediums via a shared latent space.</p>



<p>This is AI synesthesia: converting strengths in one cognitive domain into capabilities in another. If you’re adept at prose but not code, AI bridges the gap through semantic representations. If you’re a gifted designer but struggle to pitch verbally, AI transforms your sketches into narratives.</p>



<p>Scriabin, the Russian composer and mystic, experienced music as color. His neurological synesthesia enabled fluent transitions across sensory modalities. What was once rare neurological wiring is now becoming our shared digital capability, mediated through latent semantic representations.</p>



<p>Your intelligence is no longer siloed—it’s fluidly transferable.</p>
 







 
 Raising both floor and ceiling of human capability 



<p>The implications for work are profound. Multimodality raises both the floor and ceiling of human capability.</p>



<p>The floor rises as specialized skills become accessible. No design degree is needed to create beautiful visuals, nor coding expertise to automate workflows. AI fills the gaps—fast.</p>



<p>The ceiling rises, too. Specialists can explore across modalities. Data scientists can craft visuals without designers. Strategists can prototype without engineers. Composers can narrate stories. More time is spent at the forefront of their expertise rather than on technical minutiae.</p>



<p>This doesn’t make everyone an expert—it amplifies those who already are. Meanwhile, routine “middle skill” tasks—basic design, simple data analysis, boilerplate content—may automate or morph into new roles focused on prompt design and output supervision. Demand at the high end, for originality and domain-specific insight, may surge.</p>



<p>We’ve seen this before. Word processors didn’t end writing—they transformed who writes and how. Multimodal AI will similarly redefine every knowledge field.</p>
 







 
 Fluid intelligence 



<p>We’re just beginning to understand what it means to think through a unified latent space across modalities.</p>



<p>As multimodal AI becomes native to the tools we use every day, intelligence starts to feel less like a fixed trait and more like a transferable asset. We are now entering the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">creative new world we predicted</a> two-and-a-half years ago: Visual thinkers can speak in paragraphs. Coders can sketch in pixels. Writers can prototype products. Musicians can narrate. The barriers between disciplines, roles and modes of thought begin to dissolve.</p>



<p>This isn’t just a UX improvement—it’s a new mental operating system.<br>Your strengths are no longer limited to the format you were trained in.<br>Your ideas are no longer trapped in the mode you happen to be best at.</p>



<p>In the synesthesia era, creativity becomes translation.<br>Expression becomes multidimensional.<br>And intelligence becomes fluid.</p>
