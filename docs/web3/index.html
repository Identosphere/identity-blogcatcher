<p>"Short like bullets, yet offering bulletproof security assumptions". With these words, Shashank Agrawal's named the technology that played an essential role in stabilizing blockchain privacy solutions.<br>Although Agrawal's epic caption meant that this new technology earned the name bulletproofs, it does not explain why they’re safe, useful, and necessary for the blockchain industry. Let’s have a look at the concept of bulletproofs, how they work, and their applications.</p> Introduction: It all started with CTs and range proofs <p>During Bitcoin's early years, one of its selling points was a promise of anonymity to users. The popular belief, which was motivated both by the time’s misconception of Bitcoin’s capabilities and lack of chain analysis techniques, was that you could send and receive Bitcoin and interact with the network without leaving a digital footprint traceable to your <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">real-world identity</a>. Of course, many accepted the somewhat erroneous concept as a fact, but it all came undone as innovative efforts began to link people's real-world identities to their on-chain activity. Law enforcement agencies could suddenly trace transactions by uncovering the identities behind alphanumerical public keys.<br></p><p>As it became clear to all that <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">Bitcoin's transparency</a> meant that it could not offer absolute confidentiality, people began to devise ways to get around loopholes to achieve privacy. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">Coin mixers</a> or tumblers were one of the earliest endeavors, but one of the most successful series of attempts came under the name of <a href="https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions">Confidential Transactions</a> (CT).<br></p><p>In short, with Confidential Transactions, a user can send or receive funds without disclosing the values or addresses involved. However, due to the structural changes their implementation would imply, CTs never got integrated into the Bitcoin protocol. This is because they would prevent public validation of the blockchain. An observer could no longer verify that the number of Bitcoin arriving at one address equals the number of Bitcoin leaving another – one of the fundamental principles of the Bitcoin network.<br><br></p>Confidential Transactions obscure sender and receiver addresses. (<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/an-introduction-to-confidential-transactions">Source</a>) And so range proofs were invented <p>Range proofs are a type of zero-knowledge proof system that helps determine whether a number is negative or positive without revealing its value. In essence, a range proof could solve the problem of proving that within a Confidential Transaction, the number of Bitcoin being transacted are within a required range without actually revealing the amount.<br></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/6--S5xPHGn8?t=791">https://youtu.be/6--S5xPHGn8</a><br>Here’s a long but great explainer video for range proofs.<br></p><p>Regardless of their efficacy, attaching range proofs to every transaction effectively increases their size and impairs the efficiency of the verification and storage processes. Larger transactions mean higher gas fees and lower throughput, which do not bode well for any blockchain network.<br></p><p>However, a proposal in an academic paper changed everything.</p> What are bulletproofs? <p>In December 2017, the Stanford Applied Cryptography Group proposed the concept of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf">bulletproofs</a>, defining them as a novel zero-knowledge argument of knowledge that can prove that a secret lies within a given range. Bulletproofs are short, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that can convince a verifier that an encrypted value lies within a stated range without disclosing any information about the number.<br><br></p>Oleg Andreev’s stylized illustration of the Bulletproofs range-proof protocol. (<a href="https://cathieyun.medium.com/building-on-bulletproofs-2faa58af0ba8">Source</a>)<p>Bulletproofs are a type of range proof that employs zero-knowledge proofing techniques similar to those seen in <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/">zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs</a>. Like zkSTARKs, bulletproofs do not require an <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">initial trusted setup ceremony</a> or procedure. Also, they are smaller than zkSTARKs and have significant efficiency and security. However, as stated in the academic paper, it takes longer to verify a bulletproof than a zkSNARK proof. <br></p><p>Bulletproofs attracted for the edge they provided to verifying commitments in Confidential Transactions. Privacy blockchains like Monero were quite public about their <a href="https://medium.com/digitalassetresearch/monero-becomes-bulletproof-f98c6408babf">switch to using bulletproofs</a>, and they recorded up to an 80% decrease in transaction size and fees after implementing them.<br></p> How do bulletproofs work? <p>As established earlier, bulletproofs are both secure and non-interactive, and they achieve this through a <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mrh/330tutor/ch06s02.html">discrete logarithm</a> problem and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat%E2%80%93Shamir_heuristic">Fiat-Shamir heuristic</a>. A discrete logarithm problem is a type of one-way computation which makes it totally infeasible to compute an input given only the output. This makes bulletproofs unbreakable with limited computing power i.e., creates an infeasibility assumption. This last concept underlies the basis of much of modern cryptography.<br></p><p>On the other side, the Fiat-Shamir heuristic takes an interactive zero-knowledge proof and creates a digital signature based on that proof. With the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, bulletproofs can power confidential transactions by becoming the digital signature of a previously established interactive proof of knowledge. The Fiat-Shamir heuristic also converts the interactive zero-knowledge proof to a non-interactive form (bulletproofs).<br></p><p>Bulletproofs derive their security from the infeasibility assumption of discrete logarithm problem, as mentioned above. While regular range proofs increase linearly in proportion to the number of transactions bulletproofs increase logarithmically in proportion to the size of the data to be verified. This makes bulletproofs more succinct and smaller in size.<br></p><p>Bulletproofs rely on <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/pedersen-commitment.html">Pedersen commitments</a>, which allow zero-knowledge verification of values using a mathematical trick that reveals that the sum of the inputs is of a greater value than the sum of the outputs without disclosing any of the values. Pedersen commitments are cryptographic algorithms that allow a prover to commit to a certain value without revealing it or being able to change it.</p> What makes bulletproofs so secure? <p>Bulletproofs offered a breath of fresh air to <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/">cryptographic</a> protocols that utilized range proofs through two of their most significant characteristics. <br></p><p>Firstly, bulletproofs are short, so they take up much less storage space than other range-proofing systems. If a regular transaction with a range proof occupies 10KB worth of space, a transaction with a bulletproof could save up to 80% of that size, taking up only 2KB instead.<br></p>Comparison of bulletproofs against zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs. (<a href="https://github.com/gluk64/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs">Source</a>)<p>Secondly, bulletproofs are non-interactive <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, requiring no interaction between prover and verifier. Their non-interactive nature means that they could be proved in a single exchange, unlike interactive zero-knowledge proofs that require constant back-and-forth communication between both parties. <br></p><p>Also, bulletproofs do not need trusted setups. Zero-knowledge proofs that depend on trusted setups are subject to lingering concerns from users. Everyone involved in them needs to trust the participants involved in creating the parameters to destroy the keys (toxic waste) after the event. Failure to trash the toxic waste could lead to the malicious creation of new tokens, inflating the total token supply and endangering the ecosystem. With bulletproofs, there is no such concern.<br></p><p>Furthermore, bulletproofs are storage-saving and scalable, occupying less block space and allowing faster verification times than the average range proof. However, zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs require less verification time than bulletproofs. <br></p><p>Bulletproofs require no trusted setup because they rely on publicly generated algorithms that take advantage of mathematical principles to obfuscate inputs.<br></p> Range proofs vs. bulletproofs <p>Earlier, we mentioned that bulletproofs are a type of range proof. Not only are they a variation of the latter, but bulletproofs are also a significant improvement upon range proofs. To understand how they measure up to one another, we must first explain the concept of range proofs.</p> Range proofs <p>Range proofs were the earliest forms of commitment validations applied in Confidential Transactions. They provided a way for an individual to prove that a specific commitment is a value within a given range while withholding any information about the value and its worth. For instance, using a simple range proof, you could validate that the late Queen Elizabeth was born after the first World War and before World War II without disclosing her actual birth year. <br></p><p>Range proofs were primarily adopted by privacy-enhancing cryptographic protocols and used to obfuscate transaction amounts on networks like <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-crypto-projects-bitcoin-competitors-or-not/">Monero</a>. It’s worth noting that Monero has implemented an even more efficient range-proving system called <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/2020/12/24/Bulletproofs+-in-Monero.html">Bulletproofs+</a>. When you transfer coins on the Monero blockchain, for instance, Bulletproofs+ proves that your payment is a positive number without revealing how much you paid.</p> How bulletproofs improved on range proofs? <p>Range proofs were effective in shielding transaction amounts and offering <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">privacy</a> on publicly distributed ledgers. Yet, they had one shortcoming that rendered them impractical in the long run. According to the Stanford paper, when it was published, all implementations of confidential transactions used range proofs, and the proof size was linear in n.<br></p><p>Range proofs contain the number of outputs and bits that make up the range; hence, they scale linearly. Their linear scalability resulted in increased size, especially when verifying multiple transactions. Furthermore, range proofs are attached to every confidential transaction, making them larger than regular, unshielded transactions and a less sustainable long-term option for any cryptographic protocol.<br></p><p>At the time, all blockchain networks had fixed block sizes. A larger transaction size meant that fewer transactions would fit into a block. With increased adoption, the blockchain size would increase at a faster rate, limiting the ability of regular people to participate as nodes due to storage constraints.<br></p><p>Bulletproofs solved the storage problem with their less-than-1KB size, reducing transaction costs and size without compromising security. Also, with bulletproofs, a prover could aggregate several transaction range proofs for their corresponding outputs as a single proof. Instead of having a range proof for every transaction and their outputs, you can aggregate them all into one short bulletproof, saving space immensely.</p> Applications of bulletproofs <p>We have established that bulletproofs are short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that have shown tremendous promise towards reducing transaction size and costs, powering Confidential Transactions, and helping to aid blockchain privacy. Here are some applications of bulletproofs in cryptographic protocols:</p> Enabling confidential transactions <p>Perhaps the most popular application of bulletproofs is in confidential transactions. Notably, Monero uses bulletproofs to power its <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies/">RingCT</a> technology. They switched from using Schnorr signatures and Borromean ring signatures to lightweight bulletproofs. The initial ring signatures were effective, but they increased the size of an average RingCT exponentially.<br></p><p>After incorporating bulletproofs into the Monero network and deploying the rewritten version of the original, transaction sizes on Monero were reduced by at least 80%, along with transaction fees. Thus, bulletproofs have effectively replaced range proofs in confidential transactions. <br></p><p>Bulletproofs are also designed to enable Confidential Transactions on public blockchain networks like <a href="https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/confidential-transaction-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>. If implemented, they will reduce the blockchain size moving forward, and transaction fees may also drop.</p> Supporting multi-party computation protocols <p>Bulletproofs can be applied in <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-secure-multiparty-computation/">multi-party computation</a> protocols that allow several secret-holding entities to jointly generate a range proof for their secret values without disclosing them. <br></p><p>Sometimes, a transaction could be so complex that it requires inputs from multiple parties. With such an MPC protocol, instead of producing separate range proofs for each input, all the proofs can be aggregated as one short bulletproof. Bulletproofs are more efficient in cases like these than ordinary range proofs, saving time and space.</p> Enabling confidential smart contracts <p>Blockchains like Ethereum support smart contract deployment. Ethereum is a public blockchain solution, which means that the smart contracts are equally public including their parameters. The lack of privacy of the smart contract's parameters can expose users to several risks such as on-chain surveillance, exposure of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">MEV</a>, etc. <br></p><p>Several developers have proposed introducing privacy to smart contracts with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">zkSNARKs</a>.

 Leveraging the flexibility of zk-SNARKs to make private DeFi transactions cheap and&nbsp;easy <p>Aztec has been working hard to make general purpose zero-knowledge transactions as easy as possible, and rapid advancements in zk cryptography are helping to make those transactions as cheap as they are easy. In this post we want to describe a fundamental technology that helps us get&nbsp;there.</p> Tradeoffs in the Design of Proving&nbsp;Systems <p>In a zero knowledge proving system, two parties engage each other so that one can convince the other that some statement is true. One party, which we call a prover, would like to convince another party, a verifier, that they have some particular kind of information while sharing as little of that information as possible. This often breaks down cleanly into two phases: proof generation, and proof verification. Ideally, both of these would be fast and computationally efficient, but the reality is one often has to accept tradeoffs between the two. (In an absolute computational sense, proof construction is generally more expensive than verification, thus when we talk about, for example, ‘fast’ construction, we mean relative to some meaningful baseline, not relative to verification).</p><p>In the setting of Aztec’s zk-rollup, there are actually three distinct parties engaging in the creation and verification of SNARK proofs, each with different computational powers and constraints:</p>  User: the user possesses secret information, such as their balances and their transaction history, which they would like to keep secret while still engaging in transactions and interactions with DeFi protocols. They generate proofs in a web browser, typically on a low-power device such as a&nbsp;phone.  Rollup Provider: the rollup provider batches together and compresses user transactions, a process that involves proof generation as well as proof verification, at least in a sense (see more on recursion below). They generally have access to commercial grade hardware.  Blockchain: the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a highly-constrained computational environment where every operation has a varying, but typically expensive, cost that must be paid by the users in transaction fees. The EVM is responsible for verifying one proof (which encapsulates many other&nbsp;proofs).  <p>To bring affordable, truly zero knowledge transactions to Aztec’s users, we blend together different proving systems (different, tasty flavors of PlonK, in particular) across recursion boundaries. For users, this means reduced computational cost during client-side proof generation, as well as reduced monetary cost through minimized computation on the&nbsp;EVM.</p> Recursion <p>Recursion is based on the following powerful observation: the verification of a zero knowledge proof is itself a computation that can be attested to by a zero knowledge proof. Said differently, there is nothing stopping us from replacing the action of verifying a SNARK proof p with a proof p* that p has been verified correctly. Of course, by doing this we have introduced p* which itself must be verified. But this starts to suggest a notion for how two different proving systems might be combined or ‘composed’.</p><p>Let’s view a proving system as a pair of algorithms (P, V), a prover and a verifier. Suppose we have one proving system, (P, V), which has cheap proof construction but expensive proof verification, and another, (P*, V*), which has expensive construction and cheap verification. Is there a way to compose them and reap the benefits of both? Consider the following process:</p>  Construct a proof 𝛑 under proving system&nbsp;P  Construct 𝛑* under proving system P*, where p* is a proof that attests to the correct verification of 𝛑 under&nbsp;V  Verify 𝛑*.  <p>Ultimately, the benefit here is derived from the fact that each of these three steps can be performed by parties with different computational capabilities. A version of this idea is exactly what enables Aztec Connect to make cheap, private transactions available to its users. The two proving systems in question there are PlonK and TurboPlonK, where the former has cheap verification and the latter has efficient proof construction. A simplified outline of how we use this composition technique in our rollup is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The Client constructs a proof 𝛑-Client using TurboPlonK, a varietal of PlonK with custom gates (more on that below) to allow for efficient proof generation on constrained devices. They send 𝛑-Client to the Rollup Provider.  The Rollup Provider takes in 𝛑-Client and constructs a Standard (i.e. non-Turbo) PlonK proof 𝛑-Rollup that 𝛑-Client has been verified correctly. In this sense, the Rollup Provider has been constrained by the high cost of TurboPlonK verification and Standard PlonK proof construction. But the rollup provider is mighty, and can handle both while still making money and creating massive savings for users. The proof 𝛑-Rollup is sent to Ethereum.  The EVM verifies 𝛑-Rollup via a smart contract <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/blob/master/blockchain/contracts/verifier/StandardVerifier.sol">StandardVerifier.sol</a> deployed to Ethereum.  <p>Note: to further optimize the compression process, an Aztec rollup provider actually engages in three steps of recursion, two Turbo-to-Turbo (using the <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/blob/master/specs/aztec-connect/src/rollup_circuit.md">rollup</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/blob/master/specs/aztec-connect/src/root_rollup_circuit.md">root rollup</a> circuits, assembled in a way explained <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/privacy-for-pennies-scaling-aztecs-zkrollup-9f2b36615cc6">here</a>) and one Turbo-to-Standard (the <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/blob/master/specs/aztec-connect/src/root_verifier_circuit.md">root verifier</a> circuit).</p> Interlude for Nerds: Custom&nbsp;Gates <p>We want to illustrate, in a contrived, baby case, where the tradeoffs between Turbo and Standard PlonK come from. Our goal is to blackbox cryptographic concepts as much as possible, but the reader is warned that we get just a bit technical here.</p><p>Scenario: you work as a protocol designer for a company called JazzTec. You have designed and implemented a zero knowledge proving system called PlunK that allows users to prove statements that include combinations of multiplication and addition like a + b = c, (a + b) · c = d, a · b · c = d, and so on. Your small proving system contains only one kind of gate, written symbolically as</p><p>Here the w represent “wires” with l = left, r = right, and o = output, and q is a “selector” that is used to switch between multiplication and addition. JazzTec’s circuit writers have made an app where a user (or prover) must show that they have found numbers a, b, c, and d such&nbsp;that</p><p>The circuit writers provide the users a template:</p><p>Schematically, the circuit looks like&nbsp;this:</p><p>By filling in the template with values a, b, z, c and d like&nbsp;this:</p><p>the user can prove knowledge of values that satisfy the claim. (Well, almost. We’re ignoring the fact that a link must be enforced between the two instances of z. This relates to the notion of copy constraints, which is very important in general but not essential for making our present&nbsp;point).</p><p>After using PlunK for a while, JazzTec has decided to add a new feature which will require users to prove statements of the form x⁵ = y. (This is perhaps not such a made-up example. The recently developed <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf">Poseidon hash</a>, for example, designed specifically for zero-knowledge proving systems, requires computation of fifth powers). How can we implement this type of operation using PlunK? Well, our expression can be decomposed into a series of multiplications and one addition&nbsp;as</p><p>Thus, the piece of the circuit designed to handle this operation might look like&nbsp;this:</p><p>With this new component added to the circuit template, an execution trace could look like&nbsp;this:</p><p>Now let’s consider an alternative approach. What if instead of using the more minimalistic setup of PlunK, we extend the proving system to one with native support for statements of the form x⁵ = y. The key idea here is that the circuit writer, who dictates to the prover the form of the statement to be proven, can add a new selector that introduces an additional interpretation for each row in the execution trace. Let’s flesh this&nbsp;out.</p><p>We’ll call our new, extended proving system TangoPlunK. It contains a new custom selector, and its generic gate has the&nbsp;form</p><p>We see that the new q-custom selector switches on or off the custom functionality; when q-custom is 1, we have our fifth-power equation, and when q-custom is 0, we have the old standard PlunK equation. The operations involved in x⁵ = y can now be encapsulated into a single gate that looks like&nbsp;this</p><p>Using TangoPlunK, the execution trace for our program would simply&nbsp;be</p><p>To summarize, what used to take 6 gates now takes 3, so we have realized a 50% reduction in circuit size by switching to TangoPlunK!</p> A Quick Caveat for TurboNerds <p>The experienced reader might have noticed that introducing a custom gate for handling fifth-power type operations also increases the degree of the identity to be proven. In general, this can mean an increase in computational work for the prover, potentially counteracting some of the benefit gained from a reduction in circuit size. In our toy example, the degree of the identity doubled (from 3 with PlunK to 6 with TangoPlunK) but the size of the full circuit was halved (coincidentally, from 6 to 3). If our program contained a smaller proportion of computations representable by our custom gate, we’d have to reconsider its utility. In practice, such tradeoffs have to be taken into&nbsp;account.</p><p>It’s also important to note that one can conceive of useful custom gates that do not increase the degree of the identity, or at least not to the point where the prover feels the effect. This is the case, for example, in the original <a href="https://docs.zkproof.org/pages/standards/accepted-workshop3/proposal-turbo_plonk.pdf">TurboPlonK</a> proving system, where the critical innovation is the introduction of custom gates that facilitate efficient elliptic curve scalar multiplications in the context of computing Pedersen&nbsp;hashes.</p> Prover and Verifier&nbsp;Costs <p>Our example of PlunK and TangoPlunK is meant to highlight how computational tradeoffs can be made in the design of a proving system based on the observation that (1) prover complexity is fundamentally tied to the number of gates in the circuit, and (2) verifier complexity is relatively independent of circuit size but increases with the complexity of the claim or identity being&nbsp;proven.</p><p>For our sample program, TangoPlunK proof construction is cheap because the introduction of our custom gate allows for a substantial reduction in circuit size. Verification is relatively expensive in TangoPlunk because not only does the verifier see no benefit from the reduced circuit size, it must contend with a an identity that has increased in complexity relative to&nbsp;PlunK.</p><p>More concretely, in proving systems such as PlonK, a large portion of the computational cost for both the prover and the verifier is incurred through the need to compute expensive elliptic curve scalar multiplications. For the prover, these operations arise from the need to compute polynomial commitments in the construction of a proof 𝛑. The number of scalar multiplications that need to be performed is proportional to the degree of the polynomials being committed to, which is in turn proportional to the number of gates in the circuit. (For those not familiar with the important role that polynomials play in SNARKs, we suggest <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/26/snarks.html">this blog post</a> by Vitalik Buterin).</p><p>For the verifier, on the other hand, scalar multiplications are primarily required in reconstructing the original claim or identity using the commitments received from the prover in 𝛑. In particular, an additional selector in the identity directly results in an additional scalar multiplication during verification. Take a look, for example, at Step 9 from the Standard PlonK verification algorithm:</p><p>The q’s in this expression are the selectors of Standard PlonK, and the operation “·” represents elliptic curve scalar multiplication. With more selectors, this lovely expression gets even lovelier&nbsp;😍.</p><p>The example for nerds illustrates this tradeoff: In comparison with standard PlunK, TangoPlunK allows for a 50% reduction in the number of gates, lessening prover cost (at least in terms of commitments), while increasing the verifier complexity (via addition of the selector q-custom).</p><p>Of course, the reality we’re alluding to with this example is the similar tradeoff between the Standard PlonK proving system and TurboPlonK. That’s why in our applications at Aztec, like Aztec Connect, we arrange for the prover to use TurboPlonK and for the verifier to use Standard&nbsp;PlonK.</p> Going further <p>Zero knowledge cryptography has seen an explosion of activity in the past few years. At Aztec, we’re upgrading from TurboPlonK to what we call UltraPlonK, which is simply TurboPlonK + <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/315.pdf">Plookup</a>, a protocol we designed for using lookup tables to further speed up proof construction at additional cost to the verifier. At the opposite extreme, we’ve designed a protocol called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1167.pdf">Fflonk</a> that allows extremely efficient verification at additional cost to the prover. Fflonk, which harnesses the commitment scheme of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/081.pdf">this paper</a> (which we call SHPLONK), has the potential to reduce our EVM execution costs by&nbsp;35%.</p> Conclusion <p>Zero knowledge proofs are an extremely cool, cutting-edge concept with enormous technological potential. What we describe here will be considered baby steps in harnessing that potential to create a better internet. Thanks for joining us on the way&nbsp;there!</p><p>Thanks to Jon Wu, Ariel Gabizon, Suyash Bagad, Innokentii Sennovskii and Guillaume Drevon for helpful comments and discussion.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/proof-compression-a318f478d575">Proof Compression</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">Aztec Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A brand is the heart and soul of a company, guiding and supporting company culture and the driver of business growth. We are setting up Zaisan for long-term success. Aiming to be easy to mind and easy to find once web3 and blockchain mass adoption hits.</p>







<p>After changing the name from Europechain to Zaisan, the organisation also underwent significant changes. The perfect time for a rebrand.</p>



<p>The complete process took 8 months, starting with intensive brand strategy sessions with key stakeholders. From there we entered an extensive process with our branding agency, resulting in a 79-page Brand Guidelines document. The final stage was infusing the brand in all marketing communication, including our social channels, merchandising, and the revamped website.</p>



<p>We hope you will enjoy the brand as much as we do. We want to thank our partners, from communication strategists to graphic and UX designers and back-end developers for their hard work. An amazing result.</p>



<p>For those of you, that (like me) are fascinated about some of the reasoning behind the choices we made, below you find a more in-depth look.</p>

<p>A clear link to blockchain and its impact on what (digital) ownership means and how it enables prosperity.</p>



<p>In Japanese, Zaisan means PROPERTY, ASSETS, ESTATE, FORTUNE.</p>



 Zaisan’s vision 



<p>Where we aim to be. Our aspirations and impact. A guiding beacon.</p>



<p>Zaisan wants to become a global leader in unleashing the power of next-gen tech solutions to improve and secure how people interact, transact, and live.</p>



 Zaisan’s brand voice 







<p>The personality and emotion infused into the company’s communications. It encompasses everything from the words and language we use, to the personality and image our marketing assets aim to invoke.</p>



  Dynamic  Knowledgeable  Confident  Revolutionary  Tasteful  Impactful  



 Zaisan’s core values 



<p>Our fundamental beliefs. They reflect what we value as an organisation. They dictate behaviour, support the vision, shape culture, and educate customers on what we are about.</p>



<p>Agility – Self-Leadership – Impact – Partnerships – High Energy and Drive – Enjoyment – Next-gen – Knowledge.</p>



 The Zaisan symbol 







<p>A simple yet distinctive geometric form showing two blocks linked together, literally expressing ‘blockchain’ but in a subtle, abstract way. Its abstraction enriches its symbolic potential by not tying it down. Among the images embedded within it are: chainlinks (connecting businesses and consumers to blockchain); DNA (suggesting Zaisan as a blueprint of future technological evolution); and even a handshake (forging new business communities).</p>



<p>Its simplicity means it’s easy to scale without losing clarity or distinctiveness. And while the ‘Z’ of Zaisan is not literally present, it is visible in the negative space at a 45-degree angle.</p>







<p>The lock-up brings together the dynamism of the logo with a bold, angular typeface expressing the future-facing, revolutionary ethos of the brand.</p>



 Zaisan’s colour palette 







<p>The Zaisan colour palette is grounded in black, white, and subtle shades of grey. All of these centre around its signature Electric Yellow, which is supported in turn by a dash of its inverse purple tone, functioning as an accent colour. Note that Cinematic Black is not a pure black but a slightly lighter variant.</p>



 Supporting graphic language 







<p>Zaisan’s graphic language builds on the geometry of the logo and extends it to facilitate the expression of the brand values and services across all touch points.</p>



<p>The graphic language plays a significant role in our brand coding and you will see it in basically all our visual communication.</p>

 Congratulations on The Merge — now prepare to cure the hangover with a strong dose of&nbsp;privacy! <p>The transition to a POS consensus algorithm has been an aim since the very beginning of the Ethereum network and is a major milestone for the community. So congratulations are in order! It was a long time&nbsp;coming.</p><p>In fact, the transition was so important to so many of you that you managed to achieve this fundamental adjustment to the core protocol affecting the hundreds of billions of $ worth tied up in this global decentralised infrastructure. This shows that when something really matters to a community it can lead to real change at a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>We are convinced that it is necessary for a similar urgency and mobilisation to grow around the right to privacy and anonymity in our digital lives. If it is possible for POS, it is possible for&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>For many people, privacy in and of itself doesn’t mean a whole lot. What is more important are the things it enables: dignity, autonomy, the ability to make mistakes and learn and the ability to make independent decisions. And, importantly, privacy enables security.</p><p>Just last week, the Nym team was in Ukraine for the Kyiv Tech Summit, joined by none other than the Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov and Vitalik Buterin who arrived for the final day to show his&nbsp;support.</p><p>The relationship between privacy and security were major themes throughout the summit and included in discussions about The Merge. New risks of privacy, censorship resistance and MEV were raised at the Security Leaders panel by Nym panellist Jaya Klara Brekke, to fellow panellists were Dyma Budorin, Co-Founder of Hacken and Peter Robinson, Technical Director &amp; Applied Cryptographer at Consensys. Below we will go into more detail on what is at stake in the transition — nothing less than the security and censorship resistance of the Ethereum&nbsp;network.</p> Validator privacy — why does it&nbsp;matter <p>Ethereum is transitioning to POS. In short, this means that instead of nodes all competing with each other in a race to compute the next block on the blockchain, validator nodes take turns doing so one by one, thereby radically reducing energy consumption and&nbsp;cost.</p><p>The way this works is that validators put up a stake in order to get a turn at computing a block. A validator is chosen at random and in order to make sure that validator does not misbehave, a ‘committee’ of other validators check the block and sign&nbsp;it.</p><p>This results in two&nbsp;things:</p>  Validators need to know in advance who is going to create the next&nbsp;block  there is a lot of resultant communication between validators  <p>Now add to that the fact that currently, network layer traffic is visible and IP addresses of validators can be linked and a number of problems crop up: knowing who is next in turn and their IP address means that the given validator becomes vulnerable to a number of attacks, from MEV Bots and DDoS attacks to targeted censorship.</p><p>We don’t think that burying your head in the sand is a good idea for such an important issue especially when you, the community will have to bear the dire consequences. Addressing the problem of privacy in Ethereum at a network level could solve not just the MEV problem, but also contribute to both censorship resistance and traffic analysis resistance of the network in general and provide you all the privacy protection that you deserve. Here is&nbsp;how…</p> Validator privacy — protecting against censorship at the network&nbsp;layer <p>It is possible to protect validator IP addresses and thereby radically improve the security of POS. IP addresses leak with every tx or message that is sent. And a good VPN is just not enough because traffic patterns can effectively be used to deanonymise communications.</p><p>Traffic analysis is one of the primary means through which people are de-anonymised in network infrastructures including blockchains. It has been known for a long time that despite the pseudonymity of wallet addresses, simple traffic analysis can reveal a person’s identity and much more. This is the case for Bitcoin, Ethereum as well as for privacy coins and traditional messaging apps. It is the case for communications between clients and nodes, as well as between validators.</p><p>Providing network layer privacy by default ensures that the patterns of communication cannot be analysed as peer-to-peer tx are broadcast across the network. Mixnets, that protect traffic at the network layer, solves this problem by encrypting packets, making them all uniform and mixing them through three layers of mix nodes, effectively obscuring metadata and patterns of communication.</p> Manipulation and censorship resistance <p>Validator privacy also contributes to censorship resistance. When an attacker knows in advance who is making the next block, that means it is vulnerable to an intervening authority who might censor a given block. Of course another validator could simply pick it up in the next turn, however it is important to emphasise that this requires a sufficient amount of validators, spread across jurisdictions and geographical areas to ensure enough network redundancy should a set of validators face pressure from censors in parts of the world. Validator privacy adds essential security by obscuring which validators are creating a given block, thereby protecting the network from pressures to manipulate or drop&nbsp;blocks.</p> Join the Universal Privacy&nbsp;Alliance <p>Nym is a mixnet that protects the network layer — key for validator privacy thereby contributing essential security to the Ethereum&nbsp;network.</p><p>The privacy problems in Web3 are major. In some senses even more so than in Web 2.0 due to the public nature of ledgers. There is however a new generation of projects that are working to solve privacy at all layers of the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Be part of making privacy the next major milestone. Not just on the Ethereum network but all new network infrastructures that are keen to build digital autonomy.</p><p>A new alliance is launching and will be open to those keen to take action — find out more and register your interest on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/congratulations-on-the-merge-now-to-cure-the-hangover-with-a-strong-dose-of-privacy-c4b0c8eb46ea">Congratulations on The Merge — now to cure the hangover with a strong dose of privacy!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

An unbounded bond uses SILK or SHD that is minted after the inception of the protocol. A treasury bond sells digital assets from the ShadeDAO (such as SCRT or ATOM) that were acquired from protocol revenue, bonded bonds, or unbounded bonds&nbsp;sales.</p> Collateral Types <p>There are four different types of collateral deposited by users into the bond contracts:</p>  Yield Bearing  Stablecoins  Store of&nbsp;Value  Liquidity Tokens  <p>Yield bearing asset are any sort of collateral that is capable of generating yield without experiencing the risk of impermanence loss. Examples of yield generating assets are tokens such as ATOM and SCRT which are all capable of being staked to generate&nbsp;yield.</p><p>Stablecoins are digital assets that hold a target price and are able to be redeemed or sold at the target peg regardless of market conditions. The quality of a stablecoin is based on six variables:</p>  Liquidity  Bridge risk  Smart contract&nbsp;risk  Degree of decentralization  Volatility  Stability mechanisms  <p>The higher the quality of stablecoin, the more likely the ShadeDAO will issue a bond to acquired said stablecoin. These stablecoins can be used to back Silk issuance, or to deepen liquidity on Shade Apps (such as ShadeSwap).</p><p>Scarce stores of value are non-yield bearing assets that are volatile, but with economic levers focused on value accrual due to a combination of long term scarcity and utility.

<p>As my friend Cliff says, when a person’s lashes out against another person the reverberation of the blow will resonate back into your own arm. Jeffrey Strahl, <a href="https://guymcpherson.com/resistance-is-the-only-ethical-response-to-near-term-extinction/">a UC Berkeley mathematics instructor who started out working for Bechtel on nuclear power plant construction</a>, has cultivated an extensive email list over the past two years. After Jason removed him from our Discourse board, Jeffrey appears to have taken it upon himself to misrepresent our work to his network. Jason told me this had happened previously, and he opted to remain a member of the group to monitor what Jeff was saying about us. It was really the only reason for him to stay, because the vast majority of the content Jeff shared was centered on the health freedom arena and clearly the problem is so much bigger than that.</p>
<p>I made my video to set the record straight after Jeffrey lied about me and to educate people about computational agents and game theory in digital artificial societies. I am sharing two emails Jason sent to Jeff’s list and another Jeff actively posts on. The truth ALWAYS shows itself. I imagine anyone who values the work Jason and I have been doing will see this for the petty, sour grapes that it is. The only person Jeff is hurting at this point is himself. If you care for his well being, it would be a kindness to tell him to put down his hammer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I must correct some things that Jeffrey has stated below about Alison and the Wrench in the Gears Working Group Discourse Forum.</p>
<p>First of all, the forum is my project, not Alison’s. Although it is based largely on her work and I do consult with her, it was my idea, I set it up, I wrote the guidelines and I administer and moderate it.</p>
<p>Alison&nbsp;did not&nbsp;call Jeff a PsyOp. Here is a post and video by Alison explain what happened and includes screen shots of the thread.&nbsp;<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/09/12/is-terrain-an-artificial-society-a-response-to-jeff-strahl-re-psy-ops">https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/09/12/is-terrain-an-artificial-society-a-response-to-jeff-strahl-re-psy-ops</a>&nbsp;Rather than just take Jeff’s word, please see for yourself.</p>
<p>I removed Jeff from the forum because it was clear to me (from the beginning actually) that he was not interested in participating in research the forum was specifically created for. Which actually include a wide range of subjects but with a common them and particular focus.&nbsp;<a href="https://discourse.wrenchinthegears.org/categories">https://discourse.wrenchinthegears.org/categories</a></p>
<p>By the way, I invited Jeff at the suggestion of Alison. She (and we) genuinely want more people to seriously engage with and add to the research we are doing. I reluctantly added Jeff even though I know he has misrepresented Alison’s work in the past. I now see that was a mistake based on his comments below.</p>
<p>On the Poornima Wagh situation, to me the whole thing appeared to be big boondoggle but I agree with Alison’s point that all this focus on credentials is way off and actually promotes “the experts” as well as “verified credentials”, which will be part of the digital ID system on blockchain. This not about whether or not you agree with or trust Wagh or not. That is missing the point.</p>
<p>Regarding Jeff’s comment, “Last i looked, there was an item listed there about the&nbsp;“Truther Community,” which had been deleted, but the headline was left behind.”</p>
<p>What is the point of Jeff pointing this out? What is he suggesting here? By the way, the&nbsp;full&nbsp;title&nbsp;was,”TRUST in the Truther Community? Vetting the Vetters, Authoritarian Fact Checkers, Blockchain Cults, Biostatistics, Voronoi in Radiobiology and Cancer, Voronoi in the Liver”. I don’t know what this article would have said as the person deleted it. The title has me curious though. I would likely agree with it based on the title. If Jeff’s suggestion is that we are against the “Truther Community” he would be wrong. I have been involved with 9/11 truth since 2002. I personally don’t like the term “Truther Community” and I certainly would have challenged the author on using that term but there is a very serious problem within these spaces around trust vetters, fact checkers and more. And I’m not talking about the official fact checkers either. I’m hoping this person posts what they are working on (preferably without the “Truther” tag, or at least with a qualifier about that label).</p>
<p>Jeff also writes:<br>
“Back in January and February, Alison included in her long videos segments&nbsp;regarding members of the&nbsp;“freedom” community such as RFK Jr, Steve&nbsp;Kirsch, and Doctors Malone, McCullough and Kory, &nbsp;who continue to push the idea that the virus exists, that there is a real pandemic, and that&nbsp;“alternative treatments” are needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I sent those in Lockdown Times editions. By Spring, i sensed she was now saying (via for&nbsp;example Twitter) that she was through dealing with the virus matter at all, since anyone who still believed in it was not&nbsp;worth communicating to anyway.”</p>
<p>Here again Jeff appears to be misleading or implying something. Alison included those public figures in the conversation to talk explicitly about the cybernetic governance system, behavioral economics and weaponized narrative.&nbsp;Not the virus matter!&nbsp;Her position is the same now as it was then even though her understanding has expanded.</p>
<p>Here’s a clip of her talking about RFK, Jr. it’s about his roll in pushing early treatment, which directly connects to impact finance and cybernetic governance.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/UdBDebgIjjU">https://youtu.be/UdBDebgIjjU</a>&nbsp;She questions the framing “mismanaging a pandemic” within the understanding of what this narrative is serving.</p>
<p>Here’s a segment where Alison and I talk about Kirsch and Malone. Again, it is about narrative and impact finance, not the virus question.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/J_2sBImR9-A?t=7611">https://youtu.be/J_2sBImR9-A?t=7611</a></p>
<p>Jeff further writes:<br>
“By Spring, i sensed she was now saying (via for&nbsp;example Twitter) that she was through dealing with the virus matter at all, since anyone who still believed in it was not&nbsp;worth communicating to anyway.&nbsp; And now she seems to think anyone who discusses the matter is part o a PsyOp”</p>
<p>This another gross misrepresentation. Other than a few off comments early on, she’s never really dealt with “the virus matter”. Her discussions have always been in the context of digital governance, impact investing and hive mind/global brain/web3/etc..</p>
<p>Jeff:<br>
“Basically, she respects only those who focus on exactly what she focuses on.”</p>
<p>This isn’t about respecting people or not. She’s just focused on very specific threats we are facing from a specific lens and is looking for others to join in on this investigation. If someone like Jeff doesn’t agree that the issues she and the rest of us on the forum are focused on they do not have to engage with us or us with them. This is clearly the case with Jeff, which is why I removed Jeff from the forum. He has different concerns and commitments, which mostly deal with the virus and Russia apparently.</p>
<p>In the future if Jeff does promote items from Alison or others from our forum on his Lockdown Times,&nbsp; I hope he doesn’t lie or misrepresent them as he has done here.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Alright, one last time then I’m done. Here are my responses to Jeff’s Reader’s Digest of Alison, Lynn and I’s presentation below.</p>
<p>JEFFREY:&nbsp;“1:15:00 – Discussion back in 1946 (among those putting forth early visions of the global brain, etc) of “social unrest.” Alison thought it was weird to be discussing that topic in 1946. Say what?&nbsp;In fact, there was a very high level of social unrest that year“</p>
<p>Alison wasn’t saying that there wasn’t social unrest back then. What she was talking about was viewing social unrest within the context of creating a “world brain”. The quote she read from Reiser’s The World Sensorium book is, “Social unrest is inevitable so long as this process of differentiation continues for there can be no stability until embryonic maturity is reached.” This is early cybernetic thinking. I can’t imagine Jeff didn’t know what she was talking about. He’s obviously watching all her talks. His “reaction” is to a complete misrepresentation. He completely removed the context of the conversation. Why is that?</p>
<p>JEFFREY: “1:58:00 – People prominent in the Metaverse milieu, like Scott Stornetta just happened to be there at the time to participate in this project. Really?&nbsp;As if this entire “project” happening because … it is happening, just something which has been happening for a long time, which has a mind of its own.&nbsp;As if this process isn’t anchored in the needs and imperatives of the social/economic/political ruling system.“</p>
 This is blatant deception. Nowhere does Alison say or even suggest that this project is just happening because it is happening and has been happening for a long time. WTF? Or that this isn’t serving a ruling system. I honestly don’t even know how Jeff crafted this framing. It’s quite creative but is not representative. Please people, listen to the talk yourself.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/ddx4z6iTM6o">https://youtu.be/ddx4z6iTM6o</a>&nbsp;The point she was making in that segment was about how this system is actually being built by our friends, family and neighbors. And yes, it is anchored in the needs and imperatives of the ruling system (which does go back). We’ve always maintained that position so what is Jeff talking about here? We just think that not enough attention is paid to the everyday people actually building and managing this thing. That was the point of this segment, which was completely missed or ignored by Jeff. 
 &nbsp; 
 JEFFREY:&nbsp;“A recent interview by Alison and Jason of a Swiss psychologist named Arlette including her statement that&nbsp;she is not interested in systemic change, only in personal change, which is how she sees the world changing.&nbsp;I don’t know if Alison and Jason agree, but they did not express a different perspective.“ 
 &nbsp; 
 Arlette is not psychologist (at least that I’m aware of – unless I missed something). She was sharing her personal experiences as a patient within the Swiss mental health system. Her statement was that her personal process was through personal change. It was clear to me that she wants systemic change but doesn’t know how to make it happen. So her approach is to pull out and to work on herself. I agree that must be part of the process of change for all of us. I think it’s vital in fact but not the only thing. How can Jeff suggest that Alison or I are not interested in systemic change when we have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours putting out material exposing and speaking out against this system? The way he wrote that implies something he knows to be false. You can watch that actual interview here:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/arfNOiXB8CU">https://youtu.be/arfNOiXB8CU</a><br>
 
 &nbsp; 
 JEFFREY:&nbsp;2:28:00 – “It was the highly regarded president Eisenhower who in fact gave “birth” to ARPA, the forerunner of DARPA, in January ’58.“ 
 &nbsp; 
 Correct, it was originally called ARPA and later changed to DARPA and Eisenhower set it up. She initially misspoke when she said DARPA but then read off some text that had the corrected name in full, “Advanced Research Projects Agency”. What is the point or reasoning for you nit picking over such nonsense? It’s ridiculous.<br>
 
 &nbsp; 
 
 2:38:00 – “Comments about how everyone’s “right to have a job” is being taken away. Speaking personally, i do not regard having a job as a “human right.” It is an imposition upon the population of the world, unprecedented till the advent of capitalism,&nbsp;i.e. the Enclosures,&nbsp;when a population consisting largely of self-subsistence farmers working hereditary land, with access to the Commons, was pushed off their lands and enclosed from the Commons.&nbsp;These people are required for the first time to acquire money in order to buy their subsistence needs, which is why they needed jobs. The very idea of wage labor is&nbsp;part and parcel of the capitalist form of slavery.“ 
 &nbsp; 
 Alison made a short comment in response to me mentioning the Points of Light Foundation and the promotion of mandatory national (volunteer) service. She then said, “because they’re gonna take away everyone’s right to have a stable job.” In here extensive work over the past several years she has not advocated for people to simply have a job. We have both explicitly spoken about many of the problems with the jobs people are pushed into and I have often spoken about how the artificial demand or actually requirement for one to possess the legal fiction of “money” is manufactured in order to force people into labor. I give the example of Cecil Rhodes mining operation in southern Africa in the late 1800s. How the implementation of taxation played a significant role in coercing and forcing the locals into mining. We’ve also spoken about the Enclosures in the past but not in detail. They way you framed your comment suggest that Alison and I are advocating the “right to have a job” as a “human right”. I certainly don’t and I don’t think Alison does either. Leaving the word “right” aside, she is correct that they are taking away everyone’s ability to have a stable job. But Alison absolutely knows the problem is much much bigger than that. Jeff should she does after listening to so many of her talks.<br>
 
 &nbsp; 
 3:15:00 – Alison states that the Cold War was really just a cover for the creation of isotopes for shaping the future.&nbsp;Sorry, i have to disagree, there were numerous factors which led to the “Cold War,” particularly the consolidation of the US post-WWII global order.&nbsp;Reducing it to a single deception is not even Monday morning quarterbacking, more like Wed morning. 
 &nbsp; 
 Actually she said it was about weaponizing space and isotopes. I don’t know what to think about the Cold War but I do know that the narrative we have been indoctrinated with is wrong. I haven’t read all the stuff that Alison has that leads her to make that statement but so far she’s had a damn good batting average. Whether it was only about those things, I’m sure it was also very much about those things. And they are not being talked about.<br>
 
 &nbsp; 
 
 With all that said, please take me off this list Jeff. I don’t have the energy to correct all of your creative misleading interpretations and lies. It doesn’t appear you’re going to stop. How you can watch so much of Alison’s material and keep getting it so wrong does not sit well with me. I just hope people will go to the source and not rely on Jeff or anyone else to be their intermediary for information.<br>
 
 &nbsp; 
 Go to the source and think for yourself! 
 &nbsp; 
 And please don’t respond to me Jeff. I don’t want to hear it. You’re not being honest or acting in good faith.”

  Understanding the Merge  <p>A normie’s guide to one of the biggest changes in Ethereum’s history</p>  <p>By Dan Chen</p><p>Published September 13, 2022</p>  



 
<p>The Merge is set to be the biggest crypto event of the year. It’s the first time in history a top market cap cryptocurrency has changed its consensus model and is a key milestone in Ethereum’s long-term scalability roadmap. At Sequoia, we believe in the importance of deeply understanding major events that will be transformative to industries and crypto and the Merge is at the top of this list. As the deadline fast approaches, we’d love to share with the community a summary of our main considerations for the Merge. This is meant to be purely informational, and none of this should be treated as investment advice.</p>



 Background 



<p>The Merge is the planned upgrade of Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. Proof-of-Stake is a consensus model where network validators —that is, the nodes in the network responsible for maintaining the true transaction history of the Ethereum blockchain—vote on the next “correct” bundle of transactions and are fined if they are bad actors. In contrast, Proof-of-Work is a computational race to decide on the next “correct” bundle of transactions. Instead of being fined, the transactions of bad actors are ignored as the network collectively builds on the “correct” branch.</p>



<p>The Merge is an integral precursor to the Ethereum scalability roadmap and has been pushed back many times in the past. As has been repeated ad nauseam, it is important to note that the Merge does NOT scale Ethereum. It merely updates the consensus mechanism to something more akin to other modern blockchains that execute smart contracts. Solana, Avalanche and Cosmos all run PoS-based consensus. Bitcoin, on the other hand, runs PoW consensus. The Merge is a giant step in a three step process to scale Ethereum:</p>



  The first step was the launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020. The Beacon Chain is a separate PoS-based chain running in parallel with the main PoW Ethereum blockchain.  The second step is the Merge. This is where we are now! This is the swapping of the main chain for the parallel PoS chain. The estimated date is around September 15 and is dependent on network hashrate.  The third step is Sharding. You can think of it as Ethereum going multi-threaded to scale the network. The estimated date is 2023-2024, but the community believes it won’t happen until much later due to Ethereum’s track record of significantly delaying both steps 1 and 2 (sorry EF!).  


  


<p>Vitalik estimates the network to be only <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/vitalik-buterin-says-ethereums-transition-has-been-long-and-complicated/">55% complete post-Merge</a>, implying that the third and final scaling step will be the largest of the three by far. The price of Ethereum has risen ~60% from July 1 to the time of writing (Sept. 13, 2022). Most of the price increase is attributed to positive sentiment around the Merge as the Merge date approaches. As the Ethereum Foundation loves to point out, if Ethereum is an airplane, it’s like swapping out the engine (or the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ethereum-merge-edition-part-2-moving-to-proof-of/id1460134454?i=1000579176370">whole plane</a>) mid-flight. It also changes the economics of all participants in the Ethereum ecosystem. While the first and second order effects have been public knowledge and have been debated in public forums since the beginning of the year, there has been a significant increase in market interest in the past two months as the timeline has been finalized and it is clear that the Merge will indeed happen.</p>



 First-order effects 



<p>Here are the first-order effects following the Merge, that is, the effects that are a direct consequence of the protocol upgrade:</p>



  Change in security model. Ethereum is moving from a model that is primarily reliant on miners running expensive rigs and performing computation to secure the network to a model reliant on economic voting and “fining” (slashing) to keep voters in check while decreasing energy usage by ~99.95%. Part of the reason the migration has taken so long is that, when it was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437">originally proposed</a> around 2016-2017, PoS was not known to have the same rigorous security guarantees versus PoW, which had been proven to secure a much larger network in Bitcoin. Since then, many other blockchains such as Solana have proven the robustness of PoS consensus in practice and the theoretical robustness is much better understood.  Decrease in supply and inflation. Ethereum supply will change from ~4.62% inflationary issuance to roughly net zero inflation or potentially slight deflation depending on gas. This is akin to Bitcoin’s halvings but on steroids. The way to think about it is: currently, Ethereum pays ~$26M/day (assuming $2k/ETH)* in rewards to miners to compensate them for running expensive hardware. Afterwards, Ethereum will pay ~$3.2M/day to validators to compensate them for running less expensive hardware. This compensation—called block rewards or validator rewards—happens via Ethereum minting new ETH. After the Merge, the amount of ETH minted will be ~90% less. Plus, there is a countervailing force to the minting of ETH: when paying for computation, a small amount of ETH gets burned (EIP-1559 base fee burns)—that is, removed from the circulating supply. Depending on network demand, this amount just so happens to be roughly equal to the amount that will be paid to validators post-Merge, netting out to roughly zero inflation. There is quite a bit of minutiae, described in more detail <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/">here</a>. Net, inflation would drop from ~4.62% to somewhere around 0%, which would correspond to a net decrease in supply of <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/">~4.93M ETH/year</a> (~$9.86B).  


 Ethereum supply since the genesis block. Ethereum supply is expected to peak on the Merge date and then slowly decrease over time as fees burned to process transactions are expected to be slightly higher on average than new ETH issued via staking rewards. It will be the first and largest major cryptocurrency to be truly deflationary. Source: ultrasound.money 


  Energy efficiency. The Merge will get rid of PoW as the consensus mechanism for validating the Ethereum blockchain. Energy consumption is expected to reduce by <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/">2000x</a> as hash races are very energy intensive. Total network energy consumption will decrease from <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/#:~:text=Digiconomist%20provides%20whole%2Dnetwork%20energy,(53%20MT%2Fyr).">~112TWh/yr to ~0.01TWh/yr</a>. This is comparable from going from the energy consumption of the country of the Netherlands to an energy consumption of ~1000 US homes, which would be a town ~4x smaller than Sausalito. While this will improve the eco-friendliness and brand perception of Ethereum, it should not impact the usability of the blockchain, though it might increase long-term institutional adoption as ESG compliance becomes increasingly important.  Faster block confirmation times, increased time to finality. Block times will go down from ~13.3s on average to a fixed 12s. This will speed up throughput a little. Finality—basically, settlement time—will increase from around 1.5 minutes to roughly 13 minutes, but with the benefit that finality is now guaranteed (instead of probabilistic, with increasingly high probability over longer periods of time). How this translates to the end user depends more on application developers, many of whom might accelerate time to finality with the tradeoff that they might have to revert the transactions later.  



<p>*&nbsp;We’ll assume an ETH price of $2k for the rest of writeup for easy math</p>



 Second-order effects 



<p>Second-order effects are effects to various ecosystem participants that are a consequence of changes related to the Merge. Here is a non-exhaustive list of second-order effects.</p>



  Increase in staking. As mentioned previously, there are over 400k validators staking ~13M ETH (~$26B) on the Beacon Chain. Their nominal staking yield is ~4% APY, but their real staking yield is ~0% due to ETH inflation mentioned previously. Post-Merge, real yields will match nominal yields as inflation goes to zero. In addition, miners will go away, so the fees they get paid directly to prioritize transactions (called “tips”) will now go to validators. This is expected to increase real staking yields from ~0% pre-Merge to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">~7% post-Merge</a>. We expect an immediate increase in staking. If history repeats itself, we will see providers artificially inflate APYs to compete for volume before yields ultimately compress to the ~6-7% steady state. This could play out over several years (remember DeFi summer?). Coinbase has already signaled <a href="https://twitter.com/panekkkk/status/1496586698179989504?s=20&amp;t=FmsLmaHGCdE9ZHIdiKdAcw">9-12% APY</a>, albeit during a time when demand for blockspace was much higher. One more data point to increased staking: Solana, a much more mature staking ecosystem, has staking participation at <a href="https://stakesolana.app/">~78%</a>. In contrast, ETH Beacon Chain staking is currently at ~11%. Finally, it seems well understood at this point but still worth noting that the ~1M ETH (~$2B) that has been paid out via rewards to validators since the Beacon chain launched December 2020 will be locked for 6-12 months after the Merge, and then will only be “unlocked” at a limited rate. TradFi bros can think of this as a post-IPO lockup period where the staking ETH and ETH rewards cannot be sold.  Miners become obsolete. Ethereum miners generated <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/ethereum/ethereum-miner-revenue-monthly">$19B</a> of revenue from mining rewards in 2021. This will be zero post-Merge. In addition, it is estimated that <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1552837630278385664">$5B of hardware</a> is dedicated to ETH mining across GPU miners and ASIC miners, which will need to be repurposed or sold. This is reflected by GPU prices in secondary markets, which <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/gpu-pricing-index#:~:text=GPU%20prices%20continued%20to%20drop,only%20fell%206%25%20in%20July.">decreased 14% in June and 6% in July</a>. Network hashrate peaked in May and saw a notable drop in June. In addition, the reduction of up to ~13k ETH/day of miner sell pressure to cover capex costs in a notoriously low-margin industry, though a small percentage of daily ETH volumes, still changes the supply/demand dynamics.

  Contentious hard fork. So where will the miners go? In response to the immediate evaporation of a $18B/yr industry, miners could move to an alternate PoW chain (e.g. ETC) depending on their hardware, or they might organize a revolt. They would continue mining the soon-to-be defunct PoW chain, which would result in a duplication of accounts and transactions histories across the main ETH chain. This would effectively create value as long as key stakeholders—exchanges, infrastructure, and applications—supported both networks. This has happened in a major way twice in the past: once in 2016 when Ethereum forked to ETH and ETC to revert the DAO hack and once in 2017 when Bitcoin forked to BTC and BCH as the community was split over the block size debate. Ultimately, the networks supported by the core developer community won out both times. This time, instead of the dynamic duo of Jihan and Roger Ver, we have Chinese mining kingpin and investor Chandler Guo at the helm. Chainlink, USDC, and USDT have all <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/markets/what-will-happen-to-my-ethereum-after-the-merge-7301497613864205089">signaled</a> that they would not support a hard fork as it would have massive negative ramifications: you would immediately duplicate all assets, including NFTs, stablecoins, and wrapped assets. Exchanges all give the boilerplate “we will treat and review this as any other asset” messaging. Compared to previous hard forks, this fork seems to have significantly less community support as virtually every major community figure acknowledges the Merge. Market sentiment reflects this. Justin Sun-backed exchange Poloniex listed an IOU for the forked chain with the ticker symbol ETHW. Since its listing on August 8, it has fallen 64%. The derivatives exchange BitMEX listed a similar perpetuals contract, which followed a similar trajectory (nb: both contracts are thinly traded). The crowded long spot/short futures trade puts the expected value of the forked asset at around ~7% (see next point).

  Increased speculation in perpetuals and futures markets. On August 1, for the first time, open interest on ETH options <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1554060039861989377">surpassed</a> BTC options at $5.6B notional vs. $4.3B notional, signaling increased speculation on this singularly important ETH event. In addition, the futures curve started experiencing backwardation (futures prices &lt; spot prices) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1557792345881513985?s=20&amp;t=IkI14K2s9Brsj7Mf52_Vfg">earlier this month</a> and <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/ether/ether.quotes.html">persists to date</a>. This is significant as your average futures market prices longer term contracts higher (contango). It’s also worth noting that this backwardation only affects ETH: the BTC futures curve is still in <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.quotes.html">contango</a>. The most common interpretation is there is a recent increase in demand as institutional investors go long ETH hedged by short futures, netting free forked PoW ETH.

  Other considerations. There will be new opportunities in MEV (maximal extractible value) as block proposers are now known in advance. Our rudimentary guess is that MEV will increase in the short term as new areas of MEV are figured out and PBS (proposer builder separation) works towards getting adopted, but might decrease in the long run post-PBS implementation and adoption of mev-boost. Other areas of technical or tail risk are likely overestimated as the Ethereum Foundation has committed to a TTD (terminal total difficulty), though we are reliant on developers to perform some <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer">updates</a> on their dApps. Finally, mainstream media coverage and general hype has picked up in the weeks preceding the Merge, and we can only expect this to increase and amplify the success or hiccups (if any) immediately following.  



 Short-Term 



<p>In the days immediately leading up to and following the Merge, we might see a lot of volatility as the market prepares for a rate hike following the September 13th CPI update. In addition, macro uncertainties around European oil prices, a potential re-escalation in Ukraine, China/Taiwan black swan events, domestic inflation concerns over student loan cancellations (though it will likely play out over a longer period of time) could be strong factors to the extent crypto blue chips become increasingly more correlated with the S&amp;P and global markets. There is a minimal chance that the Merge is a catastrophic failure—I’ve heard anywhere from 0.1% to 5%—and institutions seem to be pricing in this tail risk. If you were to decompose ETH/USD to ETH/BTC and BTC/USD components, there is a possibility that the BTC/USD side dominates in the near term. A hard fork might result in a rush to the exits similar to the ICO/IEO days as soon as there is a venue for PoW ETH liquidity; however, the long-term impact on the ecosystem will likely be negligible.</p>



 Medium-Term 



<p>Over a longer period of time, say 6-18 months, we expect the positive supply changes and the positive economics of staking versus mining to dominate. The shift of Ethereum from an inflationary currency to a potentially deflationary currency introduces supply reductions similar in structure to Bitcoin halvenings. And the shift of network participants from miners to validators reduces sell pressure in perpetuity and effectively decreases circulating supply. If you think of it from naive Econ 101 terms, the supply curve shifts aggressively left while the (unpredictable) demand curve should generally move right as staking demand increases.</p>



 Long-Term 



<p>Long term is anyone’s guess. Most importantly, after the Merge, Ethereum will have proven the ability to execute on their ambitious roadmap of Ethereum scalability. There are more upcoming structural changes to be aware of, notably the Shanghai upgrade where Beacon chain ETH will be unlocked, sharding and Verkle proof compressions. This is a strong signal to developers, especially new ones, and a good signal for the Ethereum community overall following the surge of alt L1 developer momentum towards the end of 2021. We don’t have strong opinions on the long term viability of individual ecosystems, though we acknowledge the underlying thesis of scaling at the base layer has its merits and will be eagerly tracking the progress of Solana, Cosmos appchains, Sui, Aptos and others as they launch and gain more adoption. In all of this, Bitcoin seems a little underappreciated since maximalism and perhaps a bit of hubris have isolated the community from broader crypto discourse. However, Bitcoin is and will continue to be Bitcoin—the most viable digital gold—and we will watch with interest as Lightning, Lightspark and Stacks, among others, work to push the narrative of a global state-free currency and programmable money.</p>

         Vision, Grit, Growth: Introducing the Next Arc Founders            <p>The second cohort of Sequoia’s seed-stage catalyst launches this week.</p>  <p>By Jess Lee and Alfred Lin</p><p>Published September 13, 2022</p>       



            



 
<p><br>Today, we are excited to welcome our newest cohort of outlier founders to Arc, Sequoia’s catalyst for seed-stage companies. This seven-week company building program will take exceptional founders from 13 companies (including 4 in stealth) through our bespoke <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/company-design/">Company Design</a> curriculum taught by Sequoia partners, operators and founders. The Arc experience seeks to arm founders with the mindset, community and foundations they need to build a company that will endure over decades.</p>



<p>In our search for Arc companies, we reviewed thousands of applications and met with hundreds of applicants. The result is a curated cohort and community of the most promising seed-stage founders spanning a variety of industries, from data infrastructure and e-commerce to telemedicine and crypto. We believe these seven weeks can be transformative for early-stage companies, and we’re excited to invite a few seed founders with whom we recently partnered with to this cohort. We can’t wait to see what this group will do. To learn more about each of them and the outlier ideas that got our attention, read on.</p>



 <a href="https://arcwise.app/">Arcwise</a> 



<p>As the use of data explodes in business, the talent to leverage it is increasingly hard to find. But without the resources to design more advanced platforms, analysts are stuck in the familiar-yet-constrained world of spreadsheets. During stints at Flexport and Meta, Rahul Bali and Hanson Wang wished for a robust but more user-friendly data science workbench—and that’s why they created Arcwise. Business and engineering teams can work together in one low-code environment to build powerful machine learning tools that streamline cost estimation, sales forecasting, inventory management and more.</p>



 <a href="https://www.beamo.co/">Beamo</a> 



<p>From New York to Hong Kong, Colombia to London, Millie Yang has lived all over the world—and felt the need for a global payment solution firsthand. Historically, merchants who want to accept crypto have been forced to contend with price volatility, cross-chain complexity and time-consuming implementations, but Millie and co-founder Peng Du found a better way with Beamo. Just one five-minute integration enables payments from wallets, exchanges and credit cards—complete with automated reconciliation and reporting, and everything settled in USDC.</p>



 <a href="http://constellate.team/">Constellate</a> 



<p>An early Stripe hire, Brie Wolfson left in 2019 but carried the culture with her, launching a research-project-turned-consultancy to help companies unite their teams. Now, as the shift to remote work exposes the gaps water coolers and office hallways once filled, she’s building Constellate to be the new connective tissue. Think of it as TikTok for the workplace: an algorithmically curated platform where employees can share what they’re up to, get work out of silos and collaborate more effectively.</p>



 <a href="https://joinhallway.com/">Hallway</a> 



<p>As a kid, Bryan Pratte convinced his teachers to let him bring home 38 school computers so he could run Pixar’s Renderman software in his bedroom. Now, he and co-founder Brett Koonce are combining their lifelong love for animation with their experience building consumer apps for Reddit, Houseparty, Eventbrite and Epic Games, and launching the avatar creation tool Hallway. Using cutting-edge machine learning, they’re unlocking professional-grade motion capture and animation for anyone with a webcam—and enabling identities that work across the digital world.&nbsp;</p>



 <a href="https://roon.care/">Roon</a> 



<p>When his father was diagnosed with a rare neurodegenerative disease, Vikram Bhaskaran discovered how much patients and their families need support outside of just the doctor’s office—and saw that web searches and social media support groups can be generic at best and inaccurate at worst. So together with co-founders Dr. Rohan Ramakrishna and Arun Ranganathan, he started Roon. Members get content and community spaces that are both medically vetted and empathetic—from the doctors, caregivers and patients who have been there.</p>



 <a href="https://safara.travel/">Safara</a> 



<p>As anyone who’s spent an afternoon scrolling through endless lists of hotel bookings can tell you, most online travel agencies leave a lot to be desired. The next generation of travelers still want low prices, but they’re also craving a more curated experience—and that’s where Safara comes in. Co-founded by Square and Resy veterans Doug Schuessler and Cody Rose and born from challenges they faced while traveling together, Safara is now disrupting this massive industry by offering customers a built-in community, fully carbon-offset bookings and 10% credits to use toward the next adventure.</p>



 <a href="https://www.summerhealth.com/">Summer Health</a> 



<p>Twenty doctor visits in the first two years alone, and a two-week wait each time. When Ellen DaSilva became a mother, she learned that’s the reality for the average U.S. parent. But as employee No. 4 at hims &amp; hers, she had also learned how to scale telemedicine—so she and co-founder Matthew Woo set out to revolutionize pediatric care with Summer Health. Customers can get in touch with a real doctor by text to discuss symptoms, ask questions, and get prescriptions, test orders, referrals and more—in 15 minutes or less.</p>



 <a href="http://vitrine.us/">Vitrine</a> 



<p>As Head of Instagram Ads Data Science, Youssef Ahres saw firsthand how stricter privacy policies have transformed advertising—especially for direct-to-customer and e-commerce brands. But he and co-founders Juhana Kangaspunta and Khalil Hajji recognized what others did not: content creators were the ones driving product discovery; they just weren’t getting the credit. Enter Vitrine, a platform that allows influencers to become the new retailers, curating their own stores and linking directly to brands to handle inventory and fulfillment—no cookie tracking required.</p>



 <a href="https://zeet.co/">Zeet</a> 



<p>At 16, Johnny Dallas made history as the youngest speaker at Amazon’s AWS re:Invent conference—and that was just the beginning. Today, he and co-founder Zihao Zhang are on a mission to simplify the cloud with Zeet, an all-in-one deployment platform that works across existing tooling and services. Instead of spending valuable time configuring infrastructure for an ever-growing menu of services, engineering teams can authorize their account and let Zeet handle the details—so their developers can get back to building.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with cryptography, computational protocols, and distributed systems, you must surely have encountered the phrase 'trusted setups'. <br></p><p>Trusted setups are integral to the optimal performance of several cryptographic protocols like zero-knowledge proof systems. Yet, some users of these systems may have trouble understanding the complexities going on behind the scenes.<br></p><p>In this article, we will explain the concept of trusted setups in detail along with the need for them, their inner workings, and the different alternatives to trusted setups in cryptography.</p> What are trusted setups? <p>To understand the concept of trusted setups, let us consider both words in the phrase. <br></p><p>Trust comes into play because a group is involved in the setup process of a proof system. In contrast, the setup phase involves performing (the setup part) some computation that generates a piece of data (<a href="https://z.cash/technology/paramgen/">parameter generation</a>) called into use every time you run a specific cryptographic protocol. Trusted setups are exceptional cases of multi-party computation, that require randomness, multiple individuals, and at least one honest party.<br></p>A diagram showing the anatomy of a trusted setup. (<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html">Source</a>)<p><br>A trusted setup is a procedure that involves more than one party. Its aim is to produce the standard parameters that a proof system or similar <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies/">cryptographic</a> protocols rely on. During this setup, random numbers (secrets) are generated, encrypted, used to generate the data, and then deleted to ensure the protocol remains foulproof. People refer to these random values as toxic wastes because they need to be deleted forever. As the participants need to be trusted for the setup to fulfill its purpose, this process is called a trusted setup.<br></p><p>After generating the initial parameters and destroying their random values, the trusted setup participants have fulfilled their obligations, and no further action is required from them. Single-participant setups are also possible, requiring one person to generate secrets, use them to produce the parameters, and destroy them. However, single-participant setups have a gaping loophole: you need to trust the sole participant to destroy the secrets after the parameter generation event. Them failing to do so exposes the whole protocol.<br></p><p>During its trusted setup ceremony, Zcash famously attempted to turn this issue on its head by selecting an explicit group of both anonymous and ‘trusted’ figureheads to generate a set of random numbers. These numbers were then leveraged to function as the public parameters for creating private transactions on the network.<br></p><p>The entire event, from generating random values to creating a structured reference string (parameters), destroying them, etc. is known as a <a href="https://zkproof.org/2021/06/30/setup-ceremonies/">trusted setup ceremony</a>.</p> The need for trusted setup ceremonies <p>As of now, ZK technology has two main applications in the context of blockchains: privacy and scalability. When it comes to privacy-enhancing tools and protocols, non-interactive ZK proofs such as zkSNARKs are often leveraged to achieve on-chain privacy. Many of these protocols, especially in the areas of data availability sampling and zkSNARKs, depend on trusted setups to generate initial parameters also known as a <a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/6582384">common reference string</a> (CRS). <br></p><p>A common reference string is required for non-interactive and short ZK-proofs that can be shared between the verifier and prover. Without a trusted setup ceremony that destroys the random number function used to create the commor reference string, a malicious actor can create a fake CSR and subsequently generate fake proofs, thereby breaking the proof system.<br></p><p>Several ZK cryptographic protocols rely on trusted setup ceremonies to collaboratively generate their cryptographic parameters. In these ceremonies, each participating party uses secret information, generated locally, to generate data that helps create these initial parameters. The finalized public parameteres determined by a group of participants during the trusted setup ceremony serve as the standard enabling users to trust the privacy assurance of the network.<br></p><p>In other words, trusted ceremonies generate random values and then use them to create a “source” for the system that protects users’ privacy (the common reference string). If at least one participant of this ceremony is fully honest and does not save their contribution, every future user’s privacy is safe.<br><br><br></p>Zooko Wilcox, one of the creators of Zcash, destroying his computer after Zcash’s trusted setup ceremony. (<a href="https://fortune.com/2017/12/18/jp-morgan-bitcoin-zcash-wilcox/">Source</a>) A simple analogy for trusted setups<br> <p>Let’s say you want to create a unique perfume that will be made only once and used by people forever. <br></p><p>However, you’re not supposed to share the recipe with anyone or even know it yourself. To make this perfume, you give a bunch of people the instruction to bring in a random amount of a random ingredient. Some bring in roses, other lilies, vanilla extract, etc. You also assign yourself an ingredient to bring a random amount of, and demand that no one, not even yourself, takes note of the amount of their ingredient they brought or its type. Everyone will, without meeting, or seeing the ingredients of others, enter theirs into a special blender that does not let anyone see what’s inside.<br></p><p>If this process is followed correctly, no one will be able to replicate your exact mix ever again with full certainty. The second-to-worst scenario in this case is that everyone but one person kept record of their values. However, even if the rest of the participants aims to replicate the perfume, no one will be completely sure about the missing ingredient (at least in a low-tech setting).</p><p>In the above analogy, the final recipe is the key and the perfume the zkSNARKs parameters. Once these initial parameters are set, the key is destroyed to ensure the parameters are never tempered by anyone.<br></p><p>This kind of event is quite popular in proof systems and privacy-enhancing protocols like <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a>, <a href="https://loopring.org/#/">Loopring</a>, etc. These protocols needed a trusted setup ceremony to remain foulproof, especially from an economic point of view.<br></p><p>The story of Zcash’s trusted setup ceremony. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6dY-3x3teM">Zcash Ceremony</a><br><br></p> Additional information on trusted setups<br> <p>Since privacy-enhancing cryptographic protocols run on the data generated by the trusted setup ceremony, protecting these parameters remains key to keeping the network secure. After the parameter generation, the random values become toxic waste, which must be deleted forever. If these secrets –random values– fall into the hands of a malicious entity, they can create false proofs (in proof systems), threatening the network's integrity. In a network like Zcash, this equals creating fake <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">coins</a> at will, inflating its supply and crashing the entire protocol. To prevent these things from happening and to ensure the protocol performs as designed, generating proofs and verifying<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/"> transactions</a>, its trusted setup ceremony was necessary.<br></p><p>This need makes trusted setup ceremonies essential, as it ensures that secrets do not fall into the hands of untrusted parties. Furthermore, some trusted setups split up a secret between multiple parties. This makes it such that participants may not know anything besides the secret in their possession or may not even know what the secret is, only that they need to compute it, creating a kind of secure multi-party computation protocol. In some instances, the trusted setup may only require one participant to dispose of the secrets in their possession to secure the network.<br></p><p>Since parameter generation depends on different secret pieces, having at least one honest party is sufficient to prevent malicious activity. A shortcoming of this instance is that some multiparty computation protocols do not need all the pieces of the secret to generate proofs, but a minimum threshold amount. This challenge is easily countered when the participants are selected randomly within a large distributed set and when participants do not know one another (participation in anonymity).<br></p> Categories of trusted setups <p>There are several routes through which a trusted setup may run to achieve its desired result. <br></p><p>Trusted setups, in fact, have multiple phases. The setup phase is done only once, thereby enabling the main phase. Once the main phase is activated, this enables all participating parties to interact with a single trusted part repeatedly. Individuals send inputs to the trusted party, which’s job is to run certain functions, after which the trusted party sends the corresponding output to the respective particpating parties. <br></p><p>The main phase is usually repeated. This scenario assumes that all communication channels between individuals and trusted party are secure. Based on the different dynamics that can take place at this time, a typical trusted setup should fit into one of the following categories:</p> No setup <p>Ironically, the first category of trusted setups is “none at all”. A protocol without a setup phase is easier to trust than those that rely on trusted setups, although it cannot provide features such as privacy. In a protocol with no trusted setup, there are no trusted entities. Instead, we assume that there communication between the parties involved. <br></p><p>There are two significant varieties of 'no setup' protocols:<br></p><p>The first is called an anonymous channel model, which assumes that the parties communicating are unknown entities. In contrast, the second draws relevance from the knowledge of the global identities of all participants. While the first type may not be readily acceptable in real-world applications, the second is, as it helps establish some measure of trust. It is easier to know whether to trust a protocol when you know the parties responsible for keeping it running. <br></p><p>Although it is easier to trust protocols without trusted setups, several limitations are associated with the “no setup” category, such as likeliness of <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/man-in-the-middle-attack-MitM">man-in-the-middle attacks</a> due to their non-authenticated communication channels.</p> Pairwise setups <p>While the “no setup” category suffers from non-authenticated communication channels, pairwise setups assume that the communication channels between any two of the set of initial parties are secure. The members of the initial set of parties are grouped in twos, with each pair having a secure line of communication. <br></p><p>For example, when Member-1 sends a message on the (1,2) channel, Member-2, who is the message's recipient, knows it came from Member-1 because they are the only two parties that share the channel. Depending on some conditions, this setup may fail, while with the right conditions, it can permit the full implementation of different <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.116.2968&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">functionalities,</a> such as contract signing, secret exchange, joint coin flipping, voting, and playing poker.</p><p>.</p> Broadcast setups <p>The broadcast setup category of trusted setups assumes a phase without secrets. Instead of secrets being split up and distributed across participants, the trusted entity chooses to be transparent by distributing all important components across all participants, making them public.<br></p><p>A typical example of a trusted setup in the broadcast category is seen in <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/faq/public-key-infrastructure-pki/what-public-key-infrastructure-pki#:~:text=The%20Public%20key%20infrastructure%20(PKI,digital%20certificates%20and%20public%2Dkeys.">public key infrastructure</a> (PKI) protocols. In a typical PKI scenario, a trusted entity broadcasts all the public key addresses of all parties to the public. Also, all the inputs and outputs received or sent are public knowledge, including its random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_reference_string_model">common reference string</a>. With broadcast setups, it is assumed that the protocol's security is not at risk, even if the trusted entity has to be transparent.<br></p><p>With public key infrastructure and broadcast setups, the chances of the protocol's ability to keep running even if some parties are compromised increase significantly. This process is relatively simple, and broadcast setups are less prone to computational attacks. However, a trusted entity distributing different keys to different parties may lead to the failure of a <a href="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-27-defining-consensus/">broadcast setup</a>.</p> Partially public setups <p>In a partially public setup, some parts of the process are made public, like in broadcast setups, while others are withheld (deleted or kept a secret), like in a regular trusted setup. In this arrangement, the output from the trusted entity is made public, while the inputs from participants and the random values generated at the initial phase are kept secret. The partially public setup is also known as the Common Reference String model.<br></p><p>For example, the trusted entity may trigger a function that generates an encryption key pair and a puzzle that shields half of the key pair until a set time. Then, it sends the puzzle out to all parties with the other half of the encryption key pair. Since trusted setups are two-phase procedures, the second phase will see users encrypting their messages using the other half of the encryption key pair. Users will also subsequently broadcast the encrypted messages while trying to solve the puzzle to access all encrypted messages.<br></p><p>Partially public setups have been used to develop verifiable secret sharing models and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">zero-knowledge</a> protocols, while a fully-private setup usually requires a trusted setup ceremony for efficiency.</p> Fully private setups <p>A fully private setup represents the ideal trusted setup structure, where even the generated output that the parties receive after computing is kept secret. Hence, either party is oblivious of what they have received. Therefore, trusted setups required for blockchain networks or protocols using zero-knowledge technology fall under fully-private setups.<br></p><p>Fully private setups are often known as “the offline phase”, as MPC (<a href="https://inpher.io/technology/what-is-secure-multiparty-computation/">Multi-party computation</a>) protocols usually have an offline and online phase.<br></p><p>To understand how fully private setups work, we must consider two foremost cryptographic setups that fit into this category: offline phases for MPCs and distributed key generation setups for threshold signature schemes. The offline phase of a typical secure multiparty computation protocol is usually private, as the output needs to remain secret to curtail malicious operations and maintain security. <br></p><p>Distributed key generation setups come in handy for <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/threshold-signatures-explained">threshold signature schemes</a>, which do not require all inputs to produce the already-generated secret, but a minimum number of the involved parties. This involves random bits of the input and a key pair, where one part of the key pair is distributed to all parties, while the other part is split into shares and distributed, with each participant required to keep its part of the secret.</p> Alternatives to trusted setups <p>The emergence of Bitcoin and blockchain technology has already established a fact that we do not have to depend on an individual, institution, or third-party for a network or payment system to function. Trustless systems are the need of the hour and, as we have witnessed in the past decade, these systems are getting more robust and versatile. <br></p><p>It’s worth noting that ZK-technology is still in its infancy and, until now, trusted setups were the most secure way to establish initial parameters for <a href="https://www.michaelstraka.com/posts/recursivesnarks/">recursive proof systems</a>. However, the need to look beyond building systems that rely on trusted setups cannot be avoided. <br></p><p>Some categories of trusted setups do not support <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364/">decentralization</a>, while others are prone to computational attacks. Whatever seeks to replace trusted setups must ensure proof generation and verification without the trusted setup is possible, without sacrificing speed or performance.<br></p><p>Some protocols use multiple setups that generate several common reference strings (<a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/6582384">CRSs</a>), assuming that they generate a percentage of these reference strings genuinely. With several CRSs in the mix, the protocol can eliminate the need for a single trusted setup. Also, the 'no setup' phase is an alternative, along with collision-resistant <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/">hash functions</a>, employed by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/">zkSTARK</a> technology.<br></p><p>Notably, a trusted setup phase is only done once, and a protocol has to run on the parameters generated on its existing setup until there’s a need to revise its initial parameters. If they fail, a new ceremony is to be conducted. The idea of running a current system on dated parameters may be risky, security-wise. An alternative approach is to adopt continual setup phases that keep updating their common reference string such that the setup phase remains current with the protocol's state.<br></p><p>Finally, a breakthrough emerged when Sean Bowe, Jack Grigg, and Daira Hopwood published a paper called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021">Recursive Proof Composition without a Trusted Setup</a>. This paper obtained and implemented Halo, the first practical example of recursive proof</p><p>composition without a trusted setup.<br></p><p>It’s worth noting that in May of 2022, Zcash started using the <a href="https://halo2.dev/">Halo 2</a> proving system, thereby removing the need for trusted setup ceremonies. Halo 2 is a fast zero-knowledge proof-carrying data implementation which doesn’t require a trusted setup.<br></p><p>Besides Halo, there’s also work being done to run on-chain trusted setup ceremonies without going through all the complexities of the traditional form of trusted setup ceremonies. One of them, known as a <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377">powers-of-tau</a> ceremony, this kind of ceremony leverages smart contracts on Ethereum to allow anyone to run such a ceremony. <br></p><p>Some of the protocols that used powers-of-tau setup to run their own ceremonies include <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">ZK-rollup</a> networks such as Hermes Network, Loopring, Aztec, and zkSync. However, power-of-tau ceremony come with their own set of limitations, such as allowing only up to 64KB of cryptographic parameter size. This limitation of size is due to on-chain data constraints, thereby, only limiting its applications to only small parameters.<br></p>A diagram showing the perpetual rounds of a Power of Tau ceremony.

 Nym puts up ‘AnonDrop’ bounty at Kyiv Tech Summit hackathon for people to securely submit evidence of war&nbsp;crimes <p>As a sponsor of the Kyiv Tech Summit, Nym boosts efforts to democratise the documentation of human rights violations with a follow up grant via&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">Shipyard</a></p><p>NEUCHÂTEL, SWITZERLAND, 12 SEPTEMBER 2022 — <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym</a>, the leader in network layer privacy, in partnership with <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> and <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, both providing persistent decentralised file storage, is pleased to announce that the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/be-brave-as-ukraine-build-anondrop-at-the-kyiv-tech-summit-hackathon-4959ea99cfb8">AnonDrop challenge</a> bounty, worth $4,000, at the recent Kyiv Tech Summit hackathon, has been awarded to the Citizen5 project by <a href="https://devpost.com/allisterb">Allister&nbsp;Beharry</a>.</p><p>AnonDrop is an encrypted file drop application that allows users to securely upload data without compromising their identities. In the current climate in Ukraine, this would be particularly important for the purpose of securely documenting and sharing evidence of war crimes anonymously. One of the harder problems facing the documentation of war crimes is to allow witnesses to send in data without revealing who they are or their location to an adversary that can watch their internet connection.</p><p>The intention is for AnonDrop to become a tool that democratises the gathering of evidence that can be used to pursue human rights cases — by making the process simple and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>Nym General Counsel Ahmed Ghappour affirms, “More than ever, witnesses to human rights violations must come forward and without fear of retaliation. In Ukraine, where witnesses of war crimes are facing a technologically sophisticated adversary, network level anonymity is the only way to guarantee the safety and security needed to provide evidence to prosecute perpetrators.”</p><p>Ukraine is the third largest community operating and using Nym at present. Nym CSO Jaya Klara Brekke and COO Alexis Roussel travelled to Kyiv to show the Nym team’s support and to understand the actual threats faced by Ukrainians on the ground. They were joined by the Minister of Digital Transformation and Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov and Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum. Visiting the country is essential for understanding the requirements for AnonDrop to be usable for the Ukrainians.</p><p>The inspiration for AnonDrop is early cypherpunk work on distributed persistent data storage as well as the recent effectiveness of the open source intelligence community (OSINT) in mobilising broad, decentralised efforts towards intelligence gathering and verification during the Russian invasion. The use of OSINT has enabled intelligence gathering, debunking and fact-checking to happen in real&nbsp;time.</p><p>“With AnonDrop, Ukrainians and other witnesses will be afforded the protection they need to capture and upload subversive content. Coupled with a suite of image provenance and verification features, the uploaded media will satisfy evidentiary requirements for use in courts across the globe. Nym is committed to advancing AnonDrop as a matter of urgency as we understand the immediate need for it,” Ghappour&nbsp;adds.</p><p>Use of AnonDrop will extend beyond Ukraine, in cases where human rights work is needed and sender anonymity is paramount, allowing the persistent and decentralised storage of data. There has been a long-stream of work on using mixnets for this use-case, such as the <a href="https://www.freehaven.net/">FreeHaven design</a> that preceded even Tor, but this privacy-preserving storage is now one step closer to becoming a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Using Nym as a decentralised mixnet that provides privacy and anonymity at the network layer, AnonDrop will be able to withstand attacks by even nation level adversaries. The Nym mixnet protects not only the content of messages but also, crucially, the metadata associated with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Further iterations are needed before the application should be used in life or death situations, in view of the gravity of circumstances. To that end, Nym has qualified the winner of the AnonDrop bounty to automatically receive a follow-up grant from their upcoming <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">Nym Shipyard grant program</a> to continue development. Prioritised features include image provenance and authentication in order to make the evidence usable in&nbsp;court.</p><p>AnonDrop is the first application by Nym that directly addresses an immediate challenge in reporting war crimes. This is in line with Nym’s focus and vision of enabling everyone to communicate freely without censorship or fear, protecting people from the consequences of surveillance, one of which is human rights violations. More applications using the Nym mixnet are expected to be built over the upcoming year through integrations and the Nym Shipyard grant&nbsp;program.</p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralised platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance.

<p>As you all are probably aware, Jason created a digital space with Discourse software and private data storage to run a research group focused on blockchain, debt finance, synthetic-bio and how it is fueling a cybernetic mixed-reality future. This is his project, not mine. It is a small group of members, though anyone is welcome to poke around and see what we’re looking at. You can find it <a href="https://discourse.wrenchinthegears.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Until last week Jeffrey Strahl, a retired statistics lecturer who lives in the Bay Area and is active in the terrain space on social media, was a member of Jason’s group. Jeff had shared some materials from outside writers to the site, but had not actively pursued his own investigations, which was the point of the space.</p>
<p>After a recent post about Russia that referenced Pavel Lushka and Ervin Laszlo, systems theorists who have been pursuing digital evolution for decades, I asked Jeff to do some independent research into the two men and how their work relates to re-skilling, digital credentials, blockchain permissions, and ultimately stackable badge mind-files of Soulbound tokens that will be used for human capital derivatives trading and to train machine learning towards the Singularity.</p>
<p>My concern is that the social media organization of “terrain” interests could be a key “artificial society” set up for monitoring and management by AI nudges. In light of my exploration of game theory and evolutionary algorithms, I became concerned after I was tagged as part of a #TeamNoVirus by Bill Huston, a person with whom I have no acquaintance. He was very, very unpleasant to me when I asked pointed to have my name removed from his site. The tagging is central to the game. Everyone is in the game whether we want to admit it or not.</p>
<p>Jeff was not inclined to take up the task of researching Luksha or blockchain credentials or possible implications for the Poornima spectacle. He was not open to the possibility that “terrain,” which is central focus of Voronoi pattern simulation modeling, could be being used to manage and model resistance sub-groups. I never said people were doing this knowingly. We don’t yet understand the degree to which AI and frequencies are subtly directing actions and outcomes. That is the whole point of the simulation. We many not know the degree to which the twinned world is influencing our material reality and emotional states.</p>
<p>As a career statistician who is familiar with emerging technology, <a href="https://guymcpherson.com/resistance-is-the-only-ethical-response-to-near-term-extinction/">including nano-tech way back in 2013</a>, you might think Jeff would be interested in incorporating these ideas into his analysis. That, however, was not the case. I respect that people have different areas of focus, and if his is health, so be it. I will say, however, that the inability of Bay Area residents in particular to come to terms with Berkeley’s history of radio-isotopes, computational biology, track and trace tech, smart cities, predatory finance, and digital ID will likely back them into a corner over time. But each of us gets to choose, and then we live with the choices we’ve made. That is what makes up human, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
<p>Jason was very clear about the intention of the board. Jeff was not up to meeting the group’s expectations about digging deeper, doing original research, and “lifting the bar” (a term Jason coined as a way to getting us all to step up in a bigger way). At that point Jason removed him from the group. It was not the right fit. In removing Jeff’s account, his posts were also taken down, but I am sharing images from the post in question so you can evaluate what happened for yourself. Jeff misrepresented me in an email group he is an active member of, and that is not ok. This is why I am pulling together this post and sharing key parts of the story that he left out. I went over it in a livestream I did this morning, including some introductory material around social identity and agent-based modeling from the Swarm Intelligence text book.</p>
<p>I will point out that there was a second person in the thread who did use the term psy-op. I never use that term, and people who follow me know that. It was factually incorrect for Jeff to characterize ME as having used that term, and he knows that. You will see in my comments, which surely can be characterized as direct or even blunt, that I was asking Jeff to step up and reflect on his experience professionally and as sometime who spends a lot of time in social media to consider game theory, tagging, and contrived spectacle. I asked him to learn something about blockchain credentials and their connections to transhumanism. I understand that to do this might put him in a difficult position in his chosen digital society. Maybe now is the time to ask if such constructed societies are actually helping or hurting the cause of preserving natural life on earth.</p>
<p>I trust you to look at the facts and sort it out for yourself, but be advised that sometimes really looking means getting uncomfortable. The sections in red are my comments and Jeff’s. The other comments belong to a different person whom Jeff neglected to mention at all. He acted as if what the other person on the thread said was what I had said – a miscalculation on his part. Hard to say if it was about self preservation in his social circles or something else. I’d still like for him to consider doing that homework assignment. It could be informative for all of us.</p>
<p>PS: If any readers out there are interested in doing the assignment I gave to Jeff, email me at timpsila at protonmail dot com. I’d be happy to feature it as a guest post.</p>

 Nym wallet v1.0.9 — Bug&nbsp;fixes <p>A new version of the Nym wallet is released. This release fixes the issue that some of the users were experiencing when querying node rewards in the wallet (more on that&nbsp;below).</p><p>You can download the latest version of the wallet from the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">website</a>. Nym software is <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym">open source</a>, unpermissioned and can be forked by anyone wishing to extend functionality.</p> What has been&nbsp;fixed: <p>In order to show the operator or delegator rewards, Nym wallet has to do a large query to retrieve rewarding data from the mixnet contract storage. This query can sometimes exceed the default gas query limit of the validators. When the query limit runs out of gas, the wallet silently fails and does not show rewards for the operator or delegators. In order to fix this issue we have changed the default RPC endpoint to a cluster with a high gas query limit so that the query wouldn’t fail and as the result the mix node rewards can be shown in the&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>You can see the proposed changes in the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-wallet-v1.0.9/nym-wallet/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>.</p><p>Thanks to our users for reporting the issue.

<p>Tl;dr: In this piece we share critical lessons about the nature of the Celer Bridge compromise, attacker on-chain and off-chain techniques and tactics during the incident, as well as security tips for similar projects and users. Building a better crypto ecosystem means building a better, more equitable future for us all. That’s why we are investing in the larger community to make sure anyone who wants to participate in the cryptoeconomy can do so in a secure&nbsp;way.</p><p>While the Celer bridge compromise does not directly affect Coinbase, we strongly believe that<a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/how-coinbase-responds-to-industry-wide-crypto-security-threats-ad2c8a5da1f5"> attacks on any crypto business are bad for the industry as a whole</a> and hope the information in the blog will help strengthen and inform similar projects and their users about threats and techniques used by malicious actors.</p><p>If any dapps or service providers think they’ve been impacted by a frontend hijack like this, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:security@coinbase.com">security@coinbase.com</a></p><p>By: Peter Kacherginsky, Threat Intelligence</p><p>On August 17, 2022, Celer Network Bridge dapp users were targeted in a front-end hijacking attack which lasted approximately 3 hours and resulted in 32 impacted victims and $235,000 USD in losses. The attack was the result of a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) announcement that appeared to originate from the QuickHostUk (AS-209243) hosting provider which itself may be a victim. BGP hijacking is a unique attack vector exploiting weakness and trust relationships in the Internet’s core routing architecture. It was used earlier this year to target other cryptocurrency projects such as <a href="https://medium.com/s2wblog/post-mortem-of-klayswap-incident-through-bgp-hijacking-en-3ed7e33de600">KLAYswap</a>.</p><p>Unlike the <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/nomad-bridge-incident-analysis-899b425b0f34">Nomad Bridge compromise</a> on August 1, 2022, front-end hijacking primarily targeted users of the Celer platform dapp as opposed to the project’s liquidity pools. In this case, Celer UI users with assets on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Optimism, Fantom, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Metis, Astar, and Aurora networks were presented with specially crafted smart contracts designed to steal their&nbsp;funds.</p> Impact <p>Ethereum users suffered the largest monetary losses with a single victim losing $156K USD. The largest number of victims on a single network were using BSC, while users of other chains like Avalanche and Metis suffered no&nbsp;losses.</p> Compromise Analysis <p>The attacker performed initial preparation on August 12, 2022 by deploying a series of malicious smart contracts on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Optimism, Fantom, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Metis, Astar, and Aurora networks. Preparation for the BGP route hijacking took place on August 16th, 2022 and culminated with the attack on August 17, 2022 by taking over a subdomain responsible for serving dapp users with the latest bridge contract addresses and lasted for approximately 3 hours. The attack stopped shortly after the announcement by the Celer team, at which point the attacker started moving funds to Tornado&nbsp;Cash.</p><p>The following sections explore each of the attack stages in more detail as well as the Incident Timeline which follows the attacker over the 7 day&nbsp;period.</p> BGP Hijacking Analysis <p>The attack targeted the <a href="https://cbridge-prod2.celer.network">cbridge-prod2.celer.network</a> subdomain which hosted critical smart contract configuration data for the Celer Bridge user interface (UI). Prior to the attack cbridge-prod2.celer.network (44.235.216.69) was served by AS-16509 (Amazon) with a 44.224.0.0/11 route.</p><p>On August 16, 2022 17:21:13 UTC, a malicious actor created routing registry entries for MAINT-QUICKHOSTUK and added a 44.235.216.0/24 route to the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) in preparation for the&nbsp;attack:</p><p>Figure 1 — Pre-attack router configuration (source: <a href="https://seclists.org/nanog/2022/Aug/236">Misaka NRTM log</a> by Siyuan&nbsp;Miao)</p><p>Starting on August 17, 2022 19:39:50 UTC a new route started propagating for the more specific 44.235.216.0/24 route with a different origin AS-14618 (Amazon) than before, and a new upstream AS-209243 (QuickHostUk):</p><p>Figure 2 — Malicious route announcement (source: <a href="https://www.ripe.net/analyse/internet-measurements/routing-information-service-ris/archive/ris-raw-data">RIPE Raw Data&nbsp;Archive</a>)</p><p>Since 44.235.216.0/24 is a more specific path than 44.224.0.0/11 traffic destined for cbridge-prod2.celer.network started flowing through the AS-209243 (QuickHostUk) which replaced key smart contract parameters described in the Malicious Dapp Analysis section&nbsp;below.</p><p>Figure 3 — Network map after BGP hijacking (source:&nbsp;<a href="https://stat.ripe.net/app/use-cases/prefix/bgplay/S1_44.235.216.0%252F24_bgplay_TMR672">RIPE</a>)</p><p>In order to intercept rerouted traffic, the attacker created a valid certificate for the target domain first observed at <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=7356184952">2022–08–17 19:42 UTC</a> using GoGetSSL, an SSL certificate provider based in Latvia.

Modifying any of the bridge addresses would result in a victim approving and/or sending assets to a malicious contract. Below is a sample modified entry redirecting Ethereum users to use a malicious contract <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x2A2aA50450811Ae589847D670cB913dF763318E8">0x2A2a…18E8</a>.</p><p>Figure 7 — Sample Celer Bridge configuration (source: Coinbase TI analysis)</p><p>See Appendix A for a comprehensive listing of malicious contracts created by attackers.</p> Phishing Contract&nbsp;Analysis <p>The phishing contract closely resembles the official Celer Bridge contract by mimicking many of its attributes. For any method not explicitly defined in the phishing contract, it implements a proxy structure which forwards calls to the legitimate Celer Bridge contract. The proxied contract is unique to each chain and is configured on initialization. The command below illustrates the contents of the storage slot responsible for the phishing contract’s proxy configuration:</p><p>Figure 8 — Phishing smart contract proxy storage (source: Coinbase TI analysis)</p><p>The phishing contract steals users’ funds using two approaches:</p>  Any tokens approved by phishing victims are drained using a custom method with a 4byte value 0x9c307de6()  The phishing contract overrides the following methods designed to immediately steal a victim’s&nbsp;tokens:  send()- used to steal tokens (e.g.&nbsp;USDC)  sendNative() — used to steal native assets (e.g.&nbsp;ETH)  addLiquidity()- used to steal tokens (e.g.&nbsp;USDC)  addNativeLiquidity() — used to steal native assets (e.g.&nbsp;ETH)  <p>Below is a sample reverse engineered snippet which redirects assets to the attacker&nbsp;wallet:</p><p>Figure 9 — Phishing smart contract snippet (source: Coinbase TI analysis)</p><p>See Appendix B for the complete reverse engineered source&nbsp;code.</p> Swapping and Obfuscating Funds <p>During and immediately following the&nbsp;attack:</p>  The attacker swapped stolen tokens on Curve, Uniswap, TraderJoe, AuroraSwap, and other chain-specific DEXs into each chain’s native assets or wrapped&nbsp;ETH.  The attacker bridged all assets from Step 1 to Ethereum.  The attacker then proceeded to swap the remaining tokens on Uniswap to&nbsp;ETH.  Finally, the attacker sent 127 ETH at 2022–08–17 22:33 UTC and another 1.4 ETH at 2022–08–18 01:01 UTC to Tornado&nbsp;Cash.  <p>Following the steps outlined above, the attacker <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x294ad642f11cdb9f2a0c21bd75c5392ab9e4eda5342736ffd5c3919d3cd28528">deposited</a> the remaining 0.01201403570756 ETH to <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x66140a95d189846e74243a75b14fe6128dbbfcd9">0x6614…fcd9</a> which previously received funds from and fed into Binance through <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xd85f81d913d6f2f42a7f717cfc661d0b5b064ed8">0xd85f…4ed8</a>.</p><p>The diagram below illustrates the multi-chain bridging and swapping flow used by the attacker prior to sending assets to Tornado&nbsp;Cash:</p><p>Figure 10 — Asset swapping and obfuscation diagram (source: Coinbase&nbsp;TI)</p><p>Interestingly, following the last theft transaction on 2022–08–17 21:49 UTC from a <a href="https://bscscan.com/tx/0x390bde97ffa6b9bb731f98f9ec560396f45e6a221b758cb75b4c76dd3430c3c1">victim</a> on BSC, there was another transfer on 2022–08–18 02:37 UTC by <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0xe35ca77c9aa17d589f3bd48492f07fc2a140aa9d">0xe35c…aa9d</a> on BSC more than 4 hours later. This address was funded minutes prior to this transaction by <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x975d9bd9928f398c7e01f6ba236816fa558cd94b">0x975d…d94b</a> using ChangeNow.</p> Attacker Profile <p>The attacker was well prepared and methodical in how they constructed phishing contracts. For each chain and deployment, the attacker painstakingly tested their contracts with previously transferred sample tokens. This allowed them to catch multiple deployment bugs prior to the&nbsp;attack.</p><p>The attacker was very familiar with available bridging protocols and DEXs, even on more esoteric chains like Aurora shown by their rapid exchange, bridging, and steps to obfuscate stolen assets after they were discovered. Notably, the threat actor chose to target less popular chains like Metis, Astar, and Aurora while going to great lengths to send test funds through multiple&nbsp;bridges.</p><p>Transactions across chains and stages of the attack were serialized, indicating a single operator was likely behind the&nbsp;attack.</p><p>Performing a BGP hijacking attack requires a specialized networking skill set which the attacker may have deployed in the&nbsp;past.</p> Protecting Yourself <p>Web3 projects do not exist in a vacuum and still depend on the traditional web2 infrastructure for many of their critical components such as dapps hosting services and domain registrars, blockchain gateways, and the core Internet routing infrastructure. This dependency introduces more traditional threats such as BGP and DNS hijacking, domain registrar takeover, traditional web exploitation, etc. to otherwise decentralized products. Below are several steps which may be used to mitigate threats in appropriate cases:</p><p>Enable the following security controls, or consider using hosting providers that have enabled them, to protect projects infrastructure:</p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure">RPKI</a> to protect hosting routing infrastructure.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">DNSSEC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization">CAA</a> to protect domain and certificate services.  Multifactor authentication or enhanced account protection on hosting, domain registrar, and other services.  Limit, restrict, implement logging and review on access to the above services.  <p>Implement the following monitoring both for the project and its dependencies:</p>  Implement BGP monitoring to detect unexpected changes to routes and prefixes (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/nttgin/BGPalerter">BGPAlerter</a>)  Implement DNS monitoring to detect unexpected record changes ( e.g. <a href="https://www.dnscheck.co/">DNSCheck</a>)  Implement certificate transparency log monitoring to detect unknown certificates associated with project’s domain (e.g. <a href="https://certstream.calidog.io/">Certstream</a>)  Implement dapp monitoring to detect unexpected smart contract addresses presented by the front-end architecture  <p>DeFi users can protect themselves from front-end hijacking attacks by adopting the following practices:</p>  Verify smart contract addresses presented by a Dapp with the project’s official documentation when available.  Exercise vigilance when signing or approving transactions.  Use a hardware wallet or other cold storage solution to protect assets you don’t regularly use.  Periodically review and revoke any contract approvals you don’t actively&nbsp;need.  Follow project’s social media feeds for any security announcements.  Use wallet software capable of blocking malicious threats (e.g. Coinbase&nbsp;Wallet).  <p>Coinbase is committed to improving our security and the wider industry’s security, as well as protecting our users. We believe that exploits like these can be mitigated and ultimately prevented. Besides making codebases open source for the public to review, we recommend frequent protocol audits, implementation of bug bounty programs, and partnering with security researchers. Although this exploit was a difficult learning experience for those affected, we believe that understanding how the exploit occurred can only help further mature our industry.</p><p>We understand that trust is built on dependable security — which is why we make protecting your account &amp; your digital assets our number one priority.

<p>The Cosmos is modular. Over the years, the Cosmos SDK has introduced powerful features as modules that developers can easily build on top of. This sits central to the application specific blockchain philosophy: we want developers to focus on building their application, with the least amount of work needed to bootstrap a functioning blockchain.</p><p>These modules are the secret powers that make the Cosmos SDK stand out from the crowd. <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/secret-powers-what-are-the-authz-and-fee-grant-modules-c57d0e808794">A previous blog post </a>— the first of this series — covered Authz and Fee Grant, but now that the Cosmos SDK has released version 0.46, we thought it would be a great moment to introduce you to the new Groups module, and the various ways the Governance module has gotten a well-deserved power&nbsp;boost!</p> Cosmos SDK Groups&nbsp;Module <p>What do we mean with groups? In essence, the Groups module is Multisig on steroids. The Cosmos SDK has supported <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/master/run-node/txs.html">multi-signature wallets</a> since its inception, but limitations were hindering wider adoption. For starters, signatures are not stored on-chain, so you’d have to manually send over signed transactions to all members. Additionally, there is no dynamic key rotation, so if you wanted to change members, you’d have to create a new multisig and move your funds to that&nbsp;account.</p><p>With that in mind, the Groups module was introduced to offer advanced multi-signature wallet support native to the chains built on top of the Cosmos SDK. As a first and obvious use case, this will allow funds to more easily manage their tokens. But there are ample opportunities for developers to build on top of Groups and create vast usability improvements to wallet management, such as 2-factor authentication styled authorizations.</p> How Does the Groups Module&nbsp;Work? <p>At its core, a group has members that vote on proposals. Proposals can be one or multiple arbitrary messages that the chain supports, like staking your tokens, sending an IBC transfer and voting on governance, for example. The members of a group can change either through a proposal, or by an admin if the group has elected one or was configured with one from the&nbsp;start.</p><p>Additionally, the group itself can have multiple decision policies. A decision policy is a set of criteria that determine when a proposal passes or fails. For example, you can have a threshold decision policy that says that 3 out of 5 members need to vote yes within 5 days for a proposal to pass. The secret power here lies in the fact that it’s not the group that holds the tokens, but the decision policy itself. Why is that important?</p><p>Say you’re a member of a DAO that’s funding development work. You may want to pay out a relatively large amount of tokens for work that has been completed. In this case, you want to make sure that a large majority of your group approves the payment, and that there’s enough time for everyone to vote, because you’re dealing with a large sum of money. At the same time, perhaps you’ve had a laptop break down and you need funds to replace the machine quickly. That would be tricky to do with a voting period of, say, 15 days and a 7 out 10 majority requirement.</p><p>When you have multiple decision policies, you can secure your large fund with a strict policy, and allow a smaller fund to be accessed by a smaller threshold in a short period of time. This flexibility allows DAOs to be more responsive, or more secure, wherever it’s appropriate. The choice is&nbsp;yours.</p><p>The <a href="https://interchain.io">Interchain Foundation</a> is currently funding Regen Network to build a front-end interface for Groups, but in the meantime, you can learn to play around with the module on the <a href="https://tutorials.cosmos.network/tutorials/understanding-group/">Developer Portal</a>.</p> The New and Improved Governance Module <p>One of great features about Cosmos chains is that they come with an on-chain governance system by default. Anyone who delegates tokens to secure a chain has a vote on how the chain operates, either through parameter changes or software upgrade. Additionally, delegators can vote on signal proposals or decide how funds in the community pool are spent. This on-chain governance system has enabled tremendous community engagement in the past, but was only limited to these four types of proposals so&nbsp;far.</p><p>The Cosmos ecosystem has become more interoperable with the success of IBC, and now that <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-accounts-take-cosmos-interoperability-to-the-next-level-39c9a8aad4ad">Interchain Accounts</a> is starting to roll out to chains, composability is rapidly accelerating. Chains are now able to create addresses on other chains and execute transactions natively. This allows composability between applications similar to how smart contracts on a monolithic chain like Ethereum can interact with each other. How does governance play into&nbsp;this?</p><p>Almost all blockchains built with Cosmos have a community pool. This is a decentralized fund that receives a percentage of the block rewards and continuously keeps growing in size. So far, the community pools have been used to fund public good work, conferences like <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/68">Cosmoverse</a>, and more recently <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/74">HackATOM Seoul 2022</a>, but there are many more opportunities for the fund to engage with the wider ecosystem.</p><p>What’s changed? Instead of the original four proposal types that existed previously, the new Governance module allows people to propose to execute any number of arbitrary messages that the chain supports, similar to how the Groups module functions. A chain’s community pool could for example send tokens over to a decentralized exchange and swap tokens to create a wider exposure to the Cosmos ecosystem, or buy carbon credits on-chain to offset the carbon output of the application. At its core, the extension of the governance module allows a blockchain’s community to interact with the Interchain in ways previously unimaginable.</p><p>We encourage developers to have a look at the <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/gov/">specification</a> of this module to learn more about the potential impact this might have on their blockchain or&nbsp;client.</p><p>With the tight integration of Groups, Governance and the previous Auth and Authz modules, the Cosmos SDK is building something akin to a Linux permissions system, a core primitive of the Cosmos kernel. When paired with Interchain Accounts, this enables powerful remote account access, quite similar to&nbsp;SSH.</p> Groups and Governance <p>In a sense, the Groups and Governance modules are two sides of the same coin. You can imagine all delegators of a chain to be members of the community group by default seeing as the proposal and voting functionality is pretty much identical between the two modules. We’re excited to see where the new features will take you. We hope that chains are eager to adopt the new modules, that exciting new frontend applications will emerge, and that painstaking multisig management will soon be a thing of the&nbsp;past.</p><p>We’d like to thank <a href="https://www.regen.network/">Regen Network</a> for their contribution to the design and engineering work on these features.</p><p>About the Author:<br>Noam Cohen works at <a href="https://www.interchain.berlin/">Interchain GmbH</a> and is the Developers Relations Lead for the Cosmos Hub team.

<p>In a rough and tumble world where it is becoming harder and harder to keep your heart open, having genuinely good people in your life is a true blessing. While Lynn and I came from different ends of the manufactured ideological spectrum, we immediately recognized authenticity, honesty, and gumption in one another, and we’ve been fast friends ever since. This is a sacred engagement designed to test every fiber of our being as moral, loving humans. I am glad to share this glimpse into Lynn’s journey as we get to the heart of the matter.<br>

<p><br>
My journey as a child in the American public school system, and now as an education researcher, is a long and winding road. I grew up in Dallas, and my parents bought their first house on Blessing Drive, which was zoned for Dallas ISD and Dan D. Rogers Elementary. My siblings and I are close in age, and our growing family was busting at the seams. My parents bought a bigger house in Northeast Dallas on Faircrest in Lake Highlands, and I went through Richardson ISD schools. During my senior year at Lake Highlands High School I was in a Pre-Employment Laboratory Education (PELE) program where I studied learning theories and behavioral psychologists like Skinner, Piaget, and Freud and worked as a teachers aide at my alma mater, Northlake Elementary. In June of 1989 I graduated at seventeen and enrolled at the University of North Texas in their Elementary Education department with Special Education as my discipline. After three years of education courses, I realized I was in the wrong major.</p>
<p>In the early 90’s corporations were following wellness trends to get their employees healthier. The idea behind the movement was the notion — or so I thought — that healthier employees would reduce healthcare insurance claims, thus saving corporations the cost of premiums. I changed my major to Corporate Health Promotion/Kinesiology/Wellness with a minor in Psychology. I did an internship with Frito-Lay Headquarters in their onsite fitness facility where I used fat calipers to pinch fat and tell employees what their percentage was (as if they needed someone to pinch them to tell them “you’re fat!”). It was an awkward and humiliating experience they relegated to the lowly unpaid intern. Frito-Lay had complimentary junk food kiosks and soft drinks everywhere as a benefit to employees. The irony was not lost on me. Once again I was in the wrong major, but I stuck it out and completed the internship and the degree plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon graduation in 1996, I applied to a position posted in the employment section of the Dallas Morning News for the Cooper Aerobics Center founded in 1970 by the “Father of Aerobics” Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper. I was thrilled to get an interview and very anxious, but well-prepared. The position was in their physical fitness for education division called FITNESSGRAM where they provided physical fitness assessments for school districts. According to the <a href="https://www.cooperinstitute.org/pub/news.cfm?id=24">website</a>, “The Cooper Institute, the 501(c)3 nonprofit research and education division located at Cooper Aerobics Center in Dallas, developed the FITNESSGRAM in 1982.” In 1998 The Cooper Institute partnered with Human Kinetics, which now publishes and distributes the product to schools nationwide. I didn’t get the job. Things were going great until she asked me to work the printer. I only had retail POS computer experience and had never worked a basic printer. It was a test, and I failed miserably. Divine providence. As an interesting aside, Cooper developed the Smart Snack Ribbon guidelines in 2003 for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frito-Lay">Frito-Lay</a> division of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo">PepsiCo</a>. Junk food junket?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_H._Cooper">Wikipedia</a>, “A native of Oklahoma City, Cooper completed a 13-year military career in both the US Army and Air Force. During his Air Force career, he devised the simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_test">Cooper test</a>, which could conveniently and quickly establish the fitness level of large numbers of people – originally the distance run in 12 minutes which correlated well with the existing concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max">VO2 max</a>. Cooper left the Air Force in 1970 when he and his wife, Millie moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas">Dallas</a> to start his companies.” He coined the term <a href="https://archive.org/details/aerobics00coop/page/n9/mode/2up">Aerobics</a> in 1966, and his book under the same name was published in 1968. Ten years later he published a mass market version The New Aerobics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an education researcher, I have been on a whirlwind speaking, writing and advocacy tour that began in 2020 after studying and collaborating with Alison McDowell of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/">Wrench in the Gears</a> as she was exposing blockchain technology and the nudging of society towards tokenized economies and synthetic biology. I wrote a piece called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dallas-blockchain-life-ledger-lynn-davenport">Dallas Blockchain: Life on the Ledger</a> to shine a light on GreenLight Credentials and a deal struck between Dallas ISD, Region 10 Education Service Center and Dallas College (formerly Dallas County Community College District). They took a captive market of public school kids and fed them into a centralized blockchain system with a for-profit company to provide “life transcripts” to store academic, mental health, vaccine, and physical fitness data on students. This will be scaled statewide and eventually nationwide. Blockchain wallets are pitched as decentralization and a convenient tool for sharing and “owning our own data.” It’s the opposite. The arrangement allows for one company to have access to enormous amounts of private, sensitive student data for a tokenized future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2022, Dallas Innovates featured this article <a href="https://dallasinnovates.com/cooper-institute-and-greenlight-team-up-to-bring-a-blockchain-digital-locker-to-student-fitness/">Cooper Institute and GreenLight Team Up to Bring a Blockchain ‘Digital Locker’ to Student Fitness</a>. Cooper Institute is partnering with Dallas-based GreenLight Credentials to use its blockchain platform store and share records. School districts upload FITNESSGRAM data to the <a href="https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/health-safety-discipline/physical-fitness-assessment-initiative/pfai-fitnessgramr-resources">Texas Education Agency</a> website. I found an old <a href="https://www.cooperinstitute.org/pub/news.cfm?id=24">article</a> from 2007 on the Cooper website about Richardson ISD with a quote from a former superintendent that said, “Richardson ISD is pleased to host this event to stress the importance of exercise among young people,” said Superintendent Dr. David Simmons. “Many of our campuses have been using the FITNESSGRAM as an assessment tool for more than a decade.” RISD recently partnered with GreenLight to provide blockchain transcripts for students, as well.</p>
<p>When I speak in public, I often overwhelm the audience with information so it’s important that I close with action items, solutions, and offerings of hope through scripture and prayer. The most important thing we can do to repel this digital enclosure is to gather, worship, connect with each other and share our open hearts. Upon reflecting on the significance of the heart, I learned the electromagnetic frequency arcs out from the heart and back in the form of a torus field. The axis of this heart torus extends from the pelvic floor to the top of the skull, and the whole field is holographic, which means that information about it can be read from each and every point in the torus.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our friend, Jason Bosch interviewed me in 2020 about the plandemic, the future of work and the biosecurity state being imposed on us. He filmed a series of interviews called ‘If We Were Honest’ and mine was titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iUOkHZ6hY8&amp;t=2656s">Deep in the Heart of Dallas</a>. The aim of the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2PSzCewaA33zQ3xtqYCDkV">biosecurity state</a> to keep us as far apart as our heart frequencies extend is intentional. It is meant to condition us to be isolated, sick and fearful so we grow even further dependent on technology and the metaverse. The detachment from each other, the polarization of the political parties, and the increase in technology has led us to a tuning fork in the road. The tuning fork is two sides resonating negative energy. The energetic output flows into the torus of conflict and strife and feeds this agenda.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of blockchain as a superorganism, as Alison calls it. It can store everything from our financial transactions to our most personal details collected by institutions we are supposed to trust. The more we feed the beast, the more it turns on us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brain is also a torus but when we are embryos, the heart develops first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the heart.&nbsp;</p>

 💡Findora Validator Spotlight — HussariaONE💡  Validator Spotlights showcase the amazing people working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain. Here are HussariaONE’s responses to some questions from the Findora community.  1) Tell Us About&nbsp;Yourself <p>I’ve always been a huge fan of technology, and when I found out about blockchain in 2016, I instantly fell in love with it. I’m a software engineer with over 20 years of experience. My father started my journey into programming when I was nine years old, and I’ve been coding ever&nbsp;since.</p><p>I’m an entrepreneur, running a small business for the last 16 years. Based in Poland, I’m a husband and father of a 7-year-old son.</p> 2) What brought you into crypto/web3 in the first&nbsp;place? <p>I was attracted to crypto because, for me, it is freedom. I hope that one day we will be more free thanks to crypto. I see so many opportunities for the world to improve because of blockchain. I would never forgive myself if I missed&nbsp;it.</p> 3) What is your experience in validating or web3 in&nbsp;general? <p>Since 2017, I’ve been mining mainly Ethereum on a few GPU and ASIC rigs. A year ago, I started my first validator, which was for Ethereum 2.0, and in December 2021, I started another — this time for HarmonyONE.</p><p>I have a lot of experience with Linux and server administration. All my validators are running on two HP DL380 G10 servers with MSA 1060 storage with SSD&nbsp;drives.</p> 4) What makes your operation unique? What should people trust you with their&nbsp;stake? <p>For me, running validator nodes is not so much a business as it is a hobby, and it makes me happy. I like supporting projects I believe in, being part of something new, learning, and gaining amazing experience in the technology world.</p><p>I’ll be in the space for the long haul — I’m not going anywhere. I’m running validators on my own professional, enterprise-grade hardware, which isn’t very common in the community. My validators are secured by a Mikrotik firewall, two fiber optic connections, and a big UPS with additional batteries.</p> 5) Why do you want to validate with&nbsp;Findora? <p>I came to Findora from the Harmony ONE community, and thanks to the amazing people I met there, I started to validate with&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>After some initial research, I found that Findora was not only an interesting project but had big potential for the future. A key feature was their EVM compatibility.</p> 6) How can someone delegate funds to&nbsp;you? <p>You can find Husaria Validator on both the Findora desktop and mobile wallets wallet. Here’s a <a href="https://findorascan.io/node?node=F6D51E19E146E8CCFCCDB65164E66E3773BA6936">direct link to the validator</a>.</p><p>I’ve also prepared a Polish manual on Medium describing how to stake FRA. You can find it&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@husaria.validator/findora-fra-poradnik-dla-pocz%C4%85tkuj%C4%85cych-d490788e76b">here</a>.</p> 7) Where can our community go to learn more about you or contact you? Do you have a validator dashboard link? <p>I’m trying my best to be more available on <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-validator-spotlight-hussariaone-96e231857126">Twitter</a>, and Telegram (@HusariaOne)</p><p>I’m always happy to answer all your questions, and I am excited to make new connections with the community.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-validator-spotlight-hussariaone-96e231857126">💡Findora Validator Spotlight — HussariaONE💡</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The lawsuit explains that OFAC exceeded its authority from Congress and the President in sanctioning open source technology, rather than sanctioning the bad actors who used it or the property of those bad&nbsp;actors.</p><p>By Paul Grewal, Chief Legal&nbsp;Officer</p><p>Today, Brian Armstrong <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/defending-privacy-in-crypto-e09db33dece8">shared</a> why Coinbase is funding and supporting a challenge by six individuals (including two Coinbase employees) against the Treasury Department’s novel <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">sanctions</a> of open source software associated with Tornado Cash. I wanted to take a moment to share a little more detail about this legal action. At its core, this legal challenge is about how the Treasury Department exceeded the authority Congress and the President granted it in sanctioning open source technology, rather than sanctioning the bad actors who used it or the property of those bad actors. No one wants criminals to use crypto protocols, but blocking the technology entirely (which is what this sanction essentially does) is not what the people’s elected representatives authorized — especially when there are effective routes to more narrowly target bad actors. These sanctions represent a significant unauthorized expansion of OFAC’s authority, and they have harmed innocent people seeking to legitimately protect their privacy and security using this technology, as the stories of these six individuals make&nbsp;clear.</p> Tornado Cash Sanctions <p>On August 8, 2022, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) sanctioned Tornado Cash, an open source software project that uses smart contracts to allow users to send assets privately on the Ethereum network. As part of this action, OFAC added to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (“SDN List”) Tornado Cash’s smart contracts, which are publicly available, open source tools that anyone can access to send assets from their private accounts and withdraw them to a different crypto address. Smart contracts are essentially code that is not controlled by any individual or group and is executed by the Ethereum network according to strict rules that cannot be modified.</p><p>While prior OFAC sanctions against individuals or entities sometimes listed crypto addresses owned or controlled by these bad actors, OFAC has never before sanctioned an open source technology like the Tornado Cash smart contracts. For example, when OFAC <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm774">sanctioned</a> the North Korean Lazarus Group, it added eight Ethereum addresses to the sanctions list — each were accounts controlled by the Group where they held their&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In this case, by adding the Tornado Cash smart contracts to its SDN List, OFAC made it illegal for any U.S. person to use this privacy protocol — banning this technology for&nbsp;all.</p> OFAC Exceeded Its Authority From Congress and the President in Sanctioning Open Source Technology <p>Federal agencies, like the Treasury Department, ultimately get their authority to act from the people’s representatives in Congress, which enacts legislation defining an agency’s powers. When operating, federal agencies must act within the bounds of that Congressionally defined authority. If an agency’s action exceeds those powers, Congress has also authorized courts to review that action, with the remedy being to set aside the unlawful action. These challenges are critical to preventing executive overreach and ensuring agency action stays within the bounds of what the people’s representatives in Congress&nbsp;allowed.</p><p>Applying these principles here, Congress passed the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”), authorizing the President to freeze the assets of, and prohibit transactions with, any person determined to be a threat to the United States, and the President delegated this power to Treasury to issue sanctions. However, this delegated power only authorizes OFAC to target persons or their property.*</p><p>We are supporting the legal challenge to the Tornado Cash action because the Tornado Cash smart contracts are neither person nor property. This means OFAC exceeded its authority from Congress when it recently added these to the SDN List — effectively banning the technology for all U.S. persons. The outcome sought by this challenge is to have OFAC remove these crypto addresses associated with software from its SDN List, so that U.S. persons can once again use this privacy technology.</p><p>First, at the risk of stating the obvious, Tornado Cash open source smart contracts are not persons. They are lines of code, not humans, corporations, or organizations. Tornado Cash’s smart contracts enable a user to deposit tokens from one crypto address and later withdraw those same tokens to a different crypto address, and are executed automatically without human intervention. They are a privacy tool, a technology, that is neither human nor an&nbsp;entity.</p><p>Second, and for similar reasons, the Tornado Cash smart contracts are also not property. The ordinary meaning of “property” is something owned, a possession, or a tangible or intangible item that someone has legal title to possess.** The smart contracts are non-proprietary, open source code not controlled by any individual or group. Instead, they are simply programs that run on the Ethereum network according to preset rules that cannot be changed or altered. In the case of the Tornado Cash smart contracts, anyone in the world can send ETH to these contracts, which will then run according to preset instructions that neither the original developers of the code nor those sending or receiving funds can change. When an individual uses these smart contracts, they never turn over control of their assets to another individual or group and assets are not commingled or mixed; they simply use the privacy code to send and then withdraw their&nbsp;assets.</p> These Novel Sanctions Harmed Innocent Individuals and Threaten the Critical Development of Crypto Privacy Protocols <p>Unlike in traditional finance, ETH transactions are transparently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. That means anyone with a computer can view the transaction history and balances associated with a particular user’s address. So, when users send ETH from their address to a recipient’s address, anyone can use a public blockchain explorer to look up that sender’s prior transactions, learn about their spending habits, and check their account&nbsp;balance.</p><p>While this transparency is important for auditability and verification, it poses privacy challenges for Ethereum users who reasonably want to protect their personal financial information. For the same reasons that you’d be reluctant to publicly share all your private bank statements that detail your spending history, a person who receives their salary in ETH does not necessarily want everyone knowing how much they make or how they spend their&nbsp;funds.</p><p>The Tornado Cash privacy protocol allowed users to regain that privacy. Using smart contracts, a user could deposit assets from one crypto address and withdraw crypto assets to a completely different address, severing the otherwise clear connection to their prior transactions. Once withdrawn, the user could transfer those assets without fear of exposing their entire financial history or net worth to third party strangers. The plaintiffs in this lawsuit represent a cross section of crypto users and developers who used Tornado Cash to protect their privacy and security for various legitimate reasons — from wanting to safely donate to Ukraine war relief without risk of Russian retaliation, to concealing salary deposits that would show how much they earn, to preventing malicious actors from targeting their homes to try to steal large quantities of crypto assets held in their wallets. By creating new, private crypto addresses when sending funds to strangers, these plaintiffs could avoid disclosing their personal accounts, which they use to hold their assets and send personal transactions.</p><p>In this way, crypto privacy protocols are not only critical to the development of the crypto ecosystem, they are an important tool to protect individuals against hackers and thieves who may otherwise target owners of crypto addresses that hold significant assets. The sanctions against Tornado Cash have not only blocked this open source technology to U.S. persons, but cryptographers and developers have also been scared away from contributing to other important privacy projects, fearful that their code will be sanctioned in the&nbsp;future.</p> Coinbase is Committed to Combating Illicit Finance and Supports Reasonable Regulations and Action Against Bad&nbsp;Actors <p>Coinbase is fully committed to combating illicit activity and sanctions evasion. We regularly partner with and advise law enforcement and regulators on a range of cryptocurrency topics, support critical law enforcement investigations, and respond to many thousands of subpoenas a year. We fully support OFAC’s overarching national security objectives and greatly appreciate the important work it does to sanction bad actors and block the property those actors control. However, in the Tornado Cash action, OFAC did not target the bad actors or the property controlled by those actors; instead, it took the unprecedented step of sanctioning open source technology — a tool legitimately used by many innocent people even if also by some bad actors. We do not believe Congress authorized this, and for good reason. After all, we do not shut down email or the internet code because among its many users are some criminals. That is why we are funding and supporting this challenge by six crypto users seeking to regain critical tools needed to protect their privacy and security.</p><p>*50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B).<br>**American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&nbsp;1412.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/sanctions-should-target-bad-actors-not-technology-cb541ac6839a">Sanctions Should Target Bad Actors.

<p>Tl;dr: Coinbase is funding a lawsuit brought by six people challenging the U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions of the Tornado Cash smart contracts and asking the Court to remove them from the U.S. sanctions list. The sanctions exceed Treasury’s authority, harm innocent people, remove privacy and security options for crypto users, and stifle innovation.</p><p>By Brian Armstrong, CEO and Cofounder</p><p>Today we’re announcing that Coinbase is funding a lawsuit brought by six people challenging the United States Treasury Department’s sanctions of the Tornado Cash smart contracts and asking the Court to remove them from the U.S. sanctions list.</p><p>Tornado Cash is an open source piece of software running on the Ethereum blockchain that preserves privacy by allowing users to deposit assets from one crypto address and withdraw them using a different crypto&nbsp;address.</p><p>Last month, Treasury sanctioned the Tornado Cash software because it was being used by criminals — including North Korean hackers. We have no issue with the Treasury sanctioning bad actors and we take a hard stance against unlawful behavior. But in this case, Treasury went much further and took the unprecedented step of sanctioning an entire technology instead of specific individuals. The problem here is twofold: (1) there are legitimate applications for this type of technology and as a result of these sanctions, many innocent users now have their funds trapped and have lost access to a critical privacy tool, and (2) we believe the Treasury exceeded its authority, given by Congress, by sanctioning a technology.</p><p>At Coinbase, we’ve been fighting illicit activity since the very beginning, and while we share Treasury’s commitment to fighting crime, we believe this action harms innocent people and threatens the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and web3 specifically.</p> Treasury used a hammer instead of a&nbsp;scalpel <p>The nature of the blockchain — where every transaction is public — makes crypto more secure. But it can also create privacy concerns. If you receive your salary in crypto, for example, you might not want the world to know how much money you make, or how you choose to spend&nbsp;it.</p><p>That’s why the individuals we’re supporting in this case used Tornado Cash in the first&nbsp;place:</p>  One person used Tornado Cash to anonymously donate money to Ukraine. Afterwards, his wallet received potentially malicious air drops. But because he anonymized his crypto before donating, he avoided attacks against his personal accounts. He has funds trapped in Tornado&nbsp;Cash.  Another person is an early crypto adopter with a large online presence and a public ENS name linked to his Twitter profile. He used Tornado Cash to protect his personal security while transacting. Now he also has funds trapped in Tornado&nbsp;Cash.  A third person operates an Etherum staking business. At one point, a stranger working near where he engages in staking asked how much money he was earning. He started using Tornado Cash to protect his assets and his personal&nbsp;safety.  <p>Sanctioning open source software is like permanently shutting down a highway because robbers used it to flee a crime scene. It’s not the best way to solve a problem. It ends up punishing people who did nothing wrong and results in people having less privacy and security.</p><p>We believe law abiding citizens have a right to privacy, especially with some of their most sensitive data: their finances.</p> Treasury acted outside its authority <p>The second problem is that, while Treasury is allowed to sanction people (along with their property), Congress never gave it the power to sanction open source software. That’s why these plaintiffs are going to court to ask that this software be removed from the U.S. sanctions list. You can read more about our legal argument&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/sanctions-should-target-bad-actors-not-technology-cb541ac6839a">here</a>.</p> This will stifle innovation <p>Finally, sanctioning open-source code has a chilling effect on innovation.</p><p>Right now, developers are worried that they could be held responsible for something they had nothing to do with, and no ability to control. At a time when we should be encouraging innovation, this kind of fear and uncertainty will do the opposite — making developers wonder if, by pushing the industry forward, they could be putting themselves at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>As one of the largest companies in crypto, we have a responsibility to defend the crypto industry against actions that go too far, and treat crypto on an uneven playing field. It’s not enough to just say we disagree and sit on the sidelines. That’s why we’re funding and supporting this&nbsp;lawsuit.</p><p>We will fully comply with the law while we await the court’s decision. But we’re hopeful that these sanctions will be reversed, allowing innocent crypto users to regain access to their funds and making it possible for anyone to use privacy tools to protect themselves.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/defending-privacy-in-crypto-e09db33dece8">Defending Privacy in Crypto</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Most people still surf the Internet using Web2 addresses that are rented, not owned. With Brave and Unstoppable Domains, launching a decentralized website couldn’t be easier, giving people an alternative to renting Web2 domains.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Now, more than 2 million Unstoppable domains can be used to easily build decentralized websites that are fully functional on Brave</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that more than 2 million Unstoppable domains can now be used to display decentralized websites in Brave, a secure and privacy-centric browser that allows you to explore the Internet without being tracked. Through the Unstoppable Domains integration with Brave, creators can build decentralized content with a domain that they fully own and control – or explore the nearly 30,000 websites and counting that have been created using an Unstoppable domain. Now, we’re deepening our integration beyond .crypto to include more top-level domains – including .nft, .x, .wallet, .bitcoin, .blockchain, and .dao.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past 50 years, the Internet has transformed our world and the way we communicate. But today, most people still surf the Internet using Web2 addresses that are rented, not owned. With Brave and Unstoppable Domains, launching a decentralized website couldn’t be easier, giving people an alternative to renting Web2 domains. Unstoppable domains are yours for life with no renewal fees, eliminating the risk of losing a domain because you forget to renew or because the registrar takes it away.</p>
<p>“Together with Unstoppable, we’re giving more people the power to create content and explore the Internet without sacrificing their privacy or their autonomy,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “We’re excited to expand access to the decentralized Web for our 60 million users and to contribute to a privacy-first Internet where people have ownership of their data.”</p>
<p>“Web3 is the future, and with Brave, we’re expanding access to the decentralized Web and giving people more ways to build their identity online,” said Sandy Carter, SVP and Channel Chief of Unstoppable Domains. “Brave’s Web3-ready browser makes it possible to build websites that are fully owned by people, not rented from big tech companies.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the Brave integration with Unstoppable Domains, domains like Sandy.nft and Brad.crypto function just like normal Web2 addresses, but are hosted on the InterPlanetary File System (IFPS), a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. Brave offers a Web3-ready browser with native support for IPFS—meaning you don’t need to take any additional steps, or download any additional software, to access decentralized sites. Navigating to an IPFS URL is as simple as clicking a link or pasting it into the Brave browser’s address bar. Native support for IPFS is a key piece of infrastructure to offer truly decentralized websites where both the domain and Web content are owned entirely by the user and distributed across a network of nodes.&nbsp;</p>

 One domain, endless possibilities 
<p>An Unstoppable domain is your identity for Web3 – you can use it to receive cryptocurrency payments, to log in seamlessly to apps, to send and receive emails, and now, to build your Web3 presence via a personal website. Creators can now build their identity on Web3 by creating a decentralized website with any Unstoppable domain.</p>
<p>With Unstoppable Domains and Brave, you can:</p>
 
 Build a personal blog or thought leader post (TimDraper.crypto) 
 Launch your NFT and create content for your community (DeadHeads.NFT)&nbsp; 
 Inspire the future of gaming (bizesports.x) 
 Build a Web3 resume that expresses who you are (Macncheeasy.blockchain) 
 Advocate and gather your community in one place (UnstoppableWow3.x)&nbsp; 
 Showcase your crypto podcast (0xJosh.NFT)&nbsp; 
 Create a platform to share your knowledge with the world (CryptoMoonWalkers.X) 
 

 Build your decentralized website and win domain credit and tokens 
<p>Interested in building your own decentralized website? Start by minting your Unstoppable domain. Once your domain is minted, you can add an existing IPFS hash, upload HTML directly from the Unstoppable Domains site, or create a new website through Web3 web builders such as <a href="https://pazly.dev/">Pazly</a>. Then, you’re ready to launch a Web3 site and use it as your personal website or a decentralized backup to your Web2 site. There’s no fee to publish a website with your NFT domain – Unstoppable covers gas fees for hosting. You also don’t have to pay for a separate hosting company, which can cost up to $200 per year in the Web2 space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re focused on building utility for NFT domains – Unstoppable Domains recently launched a new <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/mobile-app">mobile app</a> for Web3 identity management, <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/unstoppable-email-skiff">integrated with Skiff</a> to give domain holders end-to-end encrypted email, and now, we’re making it even easier to use your domain to build a personal website. We’re thrilled to take this step towards a more decentralized web and to help more people build their Web3 identity.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: A common challenge with distributed systems is how to ensure that state remains synchronized across systems. At Coinbase, this is an important problem for us as many transactions flow through our microservices every day and we need to ensure that these systems agree on a given transaction. In this blog post, we’ll deep-dive into Overseer, the system Coinbase created to provide us with the ability to perform real-time reconciliation.</p><p>By Cedric Cordenier, Senior Software&nbsp;Engineer</p><p>Every day, transactions are processed by Coinbase’s payments infrastructure. Processing each of these transactions successfully means completing a complex workflow involving multiple microservices. These microservices range from “front-office” services, such as the product frontend and backend, to “back-office” services such as our internal ledger, to the systems responsible for interacting with our banking partners or executing the transaction on&nbsp;chain.</p><p>All of the systems involved in processing a transaction store some state relating to it, and we need to ensure that they agree on what happened to the transaction. To solve this coordination problem, we use orchestration engines like <a href="https://cadenceworkflow.io/">Cadence</a> and techniques such as retries and idempotency to ensure that the transactions are eventually executed correctly.</p><p>Despite this effort, the systems occasionally disagree on what happened, preventing the transaction from completing. The causes of this blockage are varied, ranging from bugs to outages affecting the systems involved in processing. Historically, unblocking these transactions has involved significant operational toil, and our infrastructure to tackle this problem has been imperfect.</p><p>In particular, our systems have lacked an exhaustive and immutable record of all of the actions taken when processing a transaction, including actions taken during incident remediation, and been unable to verify the consistency of a transaction holistically across the entire range of systems involved in real time. Our existing process relied on ETL pipelines which meant delays of up to 24 hours to be able to access recent transaction data.</p><p>To solve this problem, we created Overseer, a system to perform near real-time reconciliation of distributed systems. Overseer has been designed with the following in&nbsp;mind:</p>  Extensibility: Writing a new check is as simple as writing a function, and adding a new data source is a matter of configuration in the average case. This makes it easy for new teams to onboard checks onto the platform that is Overseer.  Scalability: As of today, our internal metrics show that Overseer is capable of handling more than 30k messages per&nbsp;second.  Accuracy: Overseer travels through time and intelligently delays running a check for a short time to compensate for delays in receiving data, thus reducing the number of false negatives.  Near real-time: Overseer has a time to detect (TTD) of less than 1 minute on&nbsp;average.  <p>Architecture</p><p>At a high-level, the architecture of Overseer consists of the three services pictured&nbsp;above:</p>  The ingestion service is how any new data enters Overseer. The service is responsible for receiving update notifications from the databases which Overseer is subscribed, storing the update in S3, and notifying the upstream processors runner service (PRS) of the&nbsp;update.  The data access layer service (DAL) is how services access the data stored in S3. Each update is stored as a single, immutable, object in S3 and the DAL is responsible for aggregating the updates into a canonical view of a record at a given point in time. This also serves as the semantic layer on top of S3 by translating data from its at-rest representation — which makes no assumptions about the schema or format of the data — into protobufs, and by defining the join relationships necessary to stitch multiple related records into a data&nbsp;view.  The processors runner service (PRS) receives these notifications and determines which checks — also known as processors — are applicable to the notification. Before running the check, it calls the data access layer service to fetch the data view required to perform the&nbsp;check.  <p>The Ingestion Service</p><p>A predominant design goal of the ingestion service is to support any format of incoming data. As we look to integrate Overseer into all of Coinbase systems in the future, it is crucial that the platform is built to easily and efficiently add new data&nbsp;sources.</p><p>Our typical pattern for receiving events from upstream data sources is to tail its database’s WAL (write-ahead log). We chose this approach for a few&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Coinbase has a small number of database technologies that are considered “paved road”, so by supporting the data format emitted by the WAL, we can make it easy to onboard the majority of our services.  Tailing the WAL also ensures a high level of data fidelity as we are replicating directly what’s in the database. This eliminates a class of errors which the alternative — to have upstream data sources emit change events at the application level — would expose us&nbsp;to.  <p>The ingestion service is able to support any data format due to how data is stored and later received. When the ingestion service receives an update, it creates two artifacts — the update document and the master document.</p>  The update document contains the update event exactly as we received it from the upstream source, in its original format (protobuf bytes, JSON, BSON, etc) and adds metadata such as the unique identifier for the record being modified.  The master document aggregates all of the references found in updates belonging to a single database model. Together, these documents serve as an index Overseer can use to join records together.  <p>When the ingestion service receives an update for a record, it extracts these references and either creates a master document with the references (if the event is an insert event), or updates an existing master document with any new references (if the event is an update event). In other words, ingesting a new data format is just a matter of storing the raw event and extracting its metadata, such as the record identifier, or any references it has to other&nbsp;records.</p><p>To achieve this, the ingestion service has the concept of a consumer abstraction. Consumers translate a given input format into the two artifacts we mentioned above and can onboard new data sources, through configuration, to tie the data source to a consumer to use at&nbsp;runtime.</p><p>However, this is just one part of the equation. The ability to store arbitrary data is only useful if we can later retrieve it and give it some semantic meaning. This is where the Data Access Layer (DAL) is&nbsp;useful.</p><p>DAL, Overseer’s semantic&nbsp;layer</p><p>To understand the role played by DAL, let’s examine a typical update event from the perspective of a hypothetical Toy model, which has the schema described below:</p> type Toy struct {<br>    Type string<br>    Color string<br>    Id string<br>} <p>We’ll further assume that our Toy model is hosted in a MongoDB collection, such that change events will have the raw format described <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/change-events/#change-events-1">here</a>. For our example Toy record, we’ve recorded two events, namely an event creating it, and a subsequent update. The first event looks approximately like this, with some irrelevant details or field&nbsp;elided:</p> {<br>    "_id": "22914ec8-4687-4428-8cab-e0fd21c6b3b6",<br>    "fullDocument": {<br>        "type": "watergun",<br>        "color": "blue",<br>     },<br>     "clusterTime": 1658224073,<br>} <p>And, the second, like&nbsp;this:</p> {<br>    "_id": "22914ec8-4687-4428-8cab-e0fd21c6b3b6",<br>    "updateDescription": {<br>        "updatedFields": {<br>            "type": "balloon",<br>        },<br>     },<br>     "clusterTime": 1658224074,<br>} <p>We mentioned earlier that DAL serves as the semantic layer on top of Overseer’s storage. This means it performs three functions with respect to this&nbsp;data:</p><p>Time travel: retrieving the updates belonging to a record up to a given timestamp. In our example, this could mean retrieving either the first or both of these&nbsp;updates.</p><p>Aggregation: transforming the updates into a view of the record at a point in time, and serializing this into DAL’s output format, protobufs.</p><p>In our case, the updates above can be transformed to describe the record at two points in time, namely after the first update, and after the second update. If we were interested in knowing what the record looked like on creation, we would transform the updates by fetching the first update’s “fullDocument” field. This would result in the following:</p> proto.Toy{<br>    Type: "watergun",<br>    Id: "22914ec8-4687-4428-8cab-e0fd21c6b3b6",<br>    Color: "blue",<br>} <p>However, if we wanted to know what the record would look like after the second update, we would instead take the “fullDocument” of the initial update and apply the contents of the “updateDescription” field of subsequent updates. This would&nbsp;yield:</p> proto.Toy{<br>    Type: "balloon",<br>    Id: "22914ec8-4687-4428-8cab-e0fd21c6b3b6",<br>    Color: "blue",<br>} <p>This example contains two important insights:</p>  First, the algorithm required to aggregate updates depends on the input format of the data. Accordingly, DAL encapsulates the aggregation logic for each type of input data, and has aggregators (called “builders”) for all of the formats we support, such as Mongo or Postgres for&nbsp;example.  Second, aggregating updates is a stateless process. In an earlier version of Overseer, the ingestion service was responsible for generating the latest state of a model in addition to storing the raw update event. This was performant but led to significantly reduced developer velocity, since any errors in our aggregators required a costly backfill to&nbsp;correct.  <p>Exposing data&nbsp;views</p><p>Checks running in Overseer operate on arbitrary data views. Depending on the needs of the check being performed, these views can contain a single record or multiple records joined together. In the latter case, DAL provides the ability to identify sibling records by querying the collection of master records built by the ingestion service.</p><p>PRS, a platform for running&nbsp;checks</p><p>As we mentioned previously, Overseer was designed to be easily extensible, and nowhere is this more important than in the design of the PRS. From the outset, our design goal was to make adding a new check as easy as writing a function, while retaining the flexibility to handle the variety of use cases Overseer was intended to&nbsp;serve.</p><p>A check is any function which performs the following two functions:</p>  It makes assertions when given data. A check can declare which data it needs by accepting a data view provided by DAL as a function argument.  It specifies an escalation policy: i.e. given a failing assertion, it makes a decision on how to proceed. This could be as simple as emitting a log, or creating an incident in PagerDuty, or performing any other action decided by the owner of the&nbsp;check.  <p>Keeping checks this simple facilitates onboarding — testing is particularly easy as a check is just a function which accepts some inputs and emits some side effects — but requires PRS to handle a lot of complexity automatically. To understand this complexity, it’s helpful to gain an overview of the lifecycle of an update notification inside Overseer. In the architecture overview at the beginning of this post, we saw how updates are stored by the ingestion service in S3 and how the ingestion service emits a notification to PRS via an events topic. Once a message has been received by PRS, it goes through the following flow:</p>  Selection: PRS determines which checks should be triggered by the given&nbsp;event.  Scheduling: PRS determines when and how a check should be scheduled. This happens via what we call “execution strategies”. These can come in various forms, but basic execution strategies might execute a check immediately (i.e. do nothing), or delay a check by a fixed amount of time, which can be useful for enforcing SLAs. The default execution strategy is more complex. It drives down the rate of false negatives by determining the relative freshness of the data sources that Overseer listens to, and may choose to delay a check — thus sacrificing a little bit of our TTD — to allow lagging sources to catch&nbsp;up.  Translation maps the event received to a specific data view required by the check. During this step, PRS queries the DAL to fetch the records needed to perform the&nbsp;check.  Finally, execution, which calls the check&nbsp;code.  <p>Checks are registered with the framework through a lightweight domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL makes it possible to register a check in a single line of code, with sensible defaults specifying the behavior in terms of what should trigger a check (the selection stage), how to schedule a check, and what view it requires (the translation stage). For more advanced use cases, the DSL also acts as an escape hatch by allowing users to customize the behavior of their check at each of these&nbsp;stages.</p><p>Today, Overseer processes more than 30,000 messages per second, and supports four separate use cases in production, with a goal to add two more by the end of Q3. This is a significant milestone for the project which has been in incubation for more than a year, and required overcoming a number of technical challenges, and multiple changes to Overseer’s architecture.</p><p>This project has been a true team effort, and would not have been possible without the help and support of the Financial Hub product and engineering leadership, and members of the Financial Hub Transfers and Transaction Intelligence teams.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/real-time-reconciliation-with-overseer-4d1b75a77f0c">Real-time reconciliation with Overseer</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

         Partnering with Zeet: Bring Your Code to Your Cloud            <p>A simple cloud infrastructure management console—to make developers’ lives easier.</p>  <p>By Lauren Reeder and Bogomil Balkansky</p><p>Published September 6, 2022</p>       



      Zeet co-founders Johnny Dallas and Zihao Zhang.      



 
 
   
<p>We wish we’d found Johnny Dallas four years ago, when he was 16 and the youngest-ever speaker at AWS re:Invent. Already three years into his career, he wasn’t yet old enough to set foot in a casino and had to be escorted to the presentation room—where he proceeded to explain how he automated an entire fleet of over a thousand servers at the video streaming platform Bebo, later acquired by Twitch. The name of that presentation? “<a href="https://newsvideo.su/tech/video/275419">Managing 1,000 Servers Without a Driver’s License</a>.”</p>



<p>Just a couple of years later, Johnny and co-founder Zihao Zhang (CTO) struck out on their own to launch <a href="https://zeet.co/">Zeet</a>, and today, they and their team have built a wonderfully intuitive product that helps companies simplify the management of cloud infrastructure. One common refrain from customers we talked to: “Everyone should use Zeet.”</p>



<p>The origin of the cloud was about self-service. Instead of waiting on internal IT to provision infrastructure, developers flocked to an alternative that offered instant​​—or at least much faster—gratification. As the cloud continues to grow, the cloud providers’ offerings are becoming richer—but also fundamentally more complex.&nbsp;</p>



Options abound in an AWS console.



<p></p>



<p>Most engineers shouldn’t have to worry about DNS or API gateway, or making sure the right ports are exposed. But we’ve seen that application developers everywhere are spending significant cycles on setting up the infrastructure they need to do their job. While it’s a difficult problem to solve, we knew there must be a better way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through an absolutely glowing customer reference, we’re excited to have found that better way in Zeet. Johnny recognized that for most applications, a lot of standard infrastructure can be automated, abstracting away the complexity of the underlying cloud and creating a developer-friendly experience that can scale as products grow. Customers can use Zeet to deploy and manage their applications, but because it operates in their own cloud accounts, they also have an escape hatch—they can go directly to the cloud provider’s management console or use its APIs alongside Zeet. The result is easier deployment of containers, serverless functions and databases, so developers can spend less time on infrastructure and more time on their products.<br></p>



<p>Just as exciting as the product is the team behind Zeet, and Johnny and Zihao are looking for more teammates as they continue to build the company—so if you’d like to help them tackle this massive problem space, please<a href="https://zeet-co.notion.site/zeet-co/Work-Zeet-584be4ec1e924c07af008f72fcf08c41"> reach out</a>! We at Sequoia could not be more thrilled to partner with them in this new round of seed funding, and to support them on their mission to help everyone make better use of the cloud.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>September has just arrived, giving us a chance to look back upon August and shine a light on the progress we have made. Given the most recent changes in the privacy and crypto space, this has also been a time for us to go back and review several aspects of our roadmap and targets. Nonetheless, there has been no change to our ultimate commitment to enabling privacy and trust in crypto and DeFi.</p><p>Now, let’s jump right into this month’s update!</p> Tech and Product  Advanced Staking <p>Most logic-level fixes and other standing issues detected by the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">third round of Advanced Staking testing</a> were ironed out throughout this month. We also finished internal testing of Multi-Asset Shielded Pools’ initial NFT capabilities this month at a smart contract level. The next step regarding shielding NFTs is to test the user interfaces, which will be initiated shortly.</p><p>Similarly, the fourth and final round of Advanced Staking testing took place with a small group of testers providing feedback upon the previous rounds’ findings. After this, all final pending merges on the contracts’ side were completed successfully. These smart contracts were shipped for an audit, the recommendations of which we’re currently working on. We’re currently in a back-and-forth process with our auditors that, when completed, will allow us to push Advanced Staking live.</p><p>Along with the above, Panther’s UI was updated according to a new design. We are also debuting new tools to track internal testing that should empower Panther to test its products in a better way.</p> Progress towards v1 <p>Advanced progress is crucial to the implementation strategy for Panther’s v1. As a part of the discussions sparked by recent events, next milestones, features and priorities related to disclosure and compliance tools have been determined and ranked.</p><p>Planning and careful, well-informed design are vital to Panther’s development. Along with the release of Advanced Staking, these determinations should provide clarity to developers and architects alike about Panther’s direction, both at a smart contract- and UI-level.</p> Community  Final $ZKP distribution <p>Panther completed the seventh and last distribution of vested $ZKP for Public Sale purchasers in the first week of August. The $ZKP from our Public Sale is now entirely in circulation, in its owners’ hands!</p> Telegram AMA <p>On August 26th, Panther’s Head of Marketing Mike Chan and our Product Managers DeFinci and Andrew Zaichenko hosted a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/advanced-staking-compliance-decentralization-more-recap-from-panthers-26-08-ama/">Telegram AMA</a> with the Panther community. They were able to discuss building during a bear market, our approach and stance regarding compliance, and the next steps to further empower the Panther DAO.</p><p>In a direct quote from Mike, “decentralization is an ongoing process that we're constantly thinking about. We're starting small and then iterating on that.” We also described multiple concrete undertakings in the works to make governance more heavily community-focused. </p><p>Check all of this out on our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/advanced-staking-compliance-decentralization-more-recap-from-panthers-26-08-ama/">Panther Blog</a>.</p> ZKoffee <p>One day before <a href="https://cbr.stanford.edu/sbc22/">Stanford’s Science of Blockchain Conference 2022</a>, we organized <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zkoffee-with-panther-tickets-408330907737">ZKoffee</a>, a delightful gathering in Lutticken's Deli over coffee and breakfast for privacy enthusiasts to talk zero knowledge, DeFi, security, and more. </p> Panther in the media <p>Anish Mohammed, Co-Founder and CTO of Panther, was invited for an <a href="https://anchor.fm/blockchain-dxb/episodes/Tornado-Cash-discussion-Crypto--Coffee-at-8-with-Anish-Mohammed-CTO-of-Panther-Protocol-e1mt9pq">interview on the Blockchain DXB Podcast</a> centered around the Tornado Cash sanctions and what they mean for privacy in blockchain. A nuanced subject like this needs careful analysis, and that is precisely what Anish had to offer to the podcast’s listeners.</p> Hirings <p>Our <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol">Angel.co page</a> lists several open positions for those eager to join the fight for privacy in Web3:</p>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2204245-applied-mathematician">Applied Mathematician</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2221049-blockchain-architect">Blockchain Architect</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2221050-cryptography-researcher-zero-knowledge-proofs">Cryptography Researcher (Zero-Knowledge Proofs)</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/1960045-head-of-quantitative-analysis">Head of Quantitative Analysis</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227585-full-stack-developer">Full-Stack Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227586-lead-front-end-developer">Lead Front-end Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2109231-machine-learning-internship">Machine Learning Internship</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2172598-graphic-designer">Graphic Designer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2169604-social-media-manager">Social Media Manager</a>  <p>This month, we also hired new contributors for several key positions.</p><p>If you wish to work with us or know someone who might be a good fit, please follow the links above!</p> September Calendar <p>A lot is lined up for September!

 Be brave as Ukrainians — Build “AnonDrop” at the Kyiv Tech Summit hackathon! <p>One of the harder problems facing the documentation of war crimes is to allow witnesses to send in data without revealing who they are or their location to an adversary that can watch their internet connection. The last thing someone who wishes to disclose a human rights violation to do is to make themselves a victim simply by reporting the&nbsp;crime!</p><p>Nym is a <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/network-privacy">decentralised mixnet</a> that provides privacy and anonymity at the network layer and so potentially can serve as a powerful privacy-protecting front-end for these attacks. The mix network can be utilized to provide strong privacy protections able to withstand attacks by even nation level adversaries.</p><p>We believe there is an urgent need to create an encrypted file drop application — AnonDrop. This will use the Nym mixnet to hide the metadata of a user uploading encrypted files (and their decryption keys) to a service operated by institutions requiring sensitive evidence where sender anonymity is paramount.</p><p>Kyiv Tech Summit and AnonDrop for the freedom of&nbsp;Ukraine</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kyivtechsummit.com/">Kyiv Tech Summit</a>, happening 6–9 September 2022 in a global hybrid format, aims to bring together some of the best developers, technology providers, designers, innovators, and product evangelists who are looking to solve tangible, on-the-ground issues to aid the Ukrainian people in their fight for&nbsp;freedom.</p><p>AnonDrop can be used by those fighting for the freedom of Ukraine to securely upload evidence of war crimes&nbsp;there.</p><p>Looking beyond, the software should defend the uploading of data not just in Ukraine, but anywhere where human rights work is needed, and allow the persistent and decentralised storage of data. There has been a long-stream of work on using mixnets for this use-case, such as the FreeHaven design that preceded even Tor, but now is the time to make privacy-preserving storage a&nbsp;reality!</p><p>Combining the powers of Nym, IPFS and&nbsp;Filecoin</p><p>As we have always believed, privacy loves company! AnonDrop combines the Nym mixnet for anonymity with IPFS for decentralised storage. Solutions built for the Nym specifications therefore also qualify for a <a href="https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Filecoin-IPFS-Hackathon-Judging-Criteria-fb29da31431c4c8da1be6c30e1d0ef82">IPFS/Filecoin bounty evaluation</a>!</p><p>Needing little introduction, <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS </a>and <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin </a>have been providing persistent decentralised file storage since 2015 so it is only natural for Nym to join forces with this tried and tested infrastructure to provide real support for defenders of human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Specifications for&nbsp;AnonDrop</p><p>Code already exists (see section below) for a generic ‘encrypted Dropbox’ proof of concept (‘NymDrive’) which utilises the mixnet. The spec for this challenge requires modifying the NymDrive code with additional features to make it suitable to securely send sensitive evidence to institutions such as the United Nations (‘the Authority’). These service providers will be run by the institutions who will be gathering this evidence. The institutions gathering the evidence run “service providers” enabling people to connect and send files through the decentralised Nym mixnet. The mixnet mixes the data, making it anonymous and untraceable before forwarding it to be stored on IPFS, a decentralised filestore.</p><p>This application spec involves three distinct bits of&nbsp;code:</p><p>1. An Uploader GUI allowing users to do the following through the&nbsp;mixnet:</p>  Store an encrypted file via the AnonDrop service&nbsp;provider  Multi-lingual interface (so interface can be in English and Ukrainian)  Verify their file has been uploaded and stored (via checking&nbsp;hashes)  Toggle an option to delete the local file from their device, ideally secure deletion.  Securely share the hash &amp; decryption key of uploaded encrypted files with ‘the authority’  <p>2. An AnonDrop service provider which does the following via the&nbsp;mixnet:</p>  Receive files.  Hash these files with the same hash function as the GUI and store the files with this hash as its identifier in&nbsp;IPFS.  Respond to verification requests from&nbsp;users.  Send the relevant file as a response to valid retrieval queries.  Deny invalid file retrieval requests.  <p>3. A Reader GUI allowing the Authority to do the following:</p>  Receive files.  Verify these&nbsp;files.  Decrypt these&nbsp;files.  <p>Changes required to existing NymDrive code for challenge</p><p>The specification of the NymDrive code can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16k5lw-Y3fzfk5mzE65DRCBa0IIqCvAUzM26zNsIo0rQ/edit">here</a>, and the code of the winner of the Hackathon <a href="https://github.com/saleel/nymdrive">here</a>.</p><p>There are a number of required changes to modify NymDrive into a FileDrop&nbsp;POC:</p>  Make a ‘reader’ GUI app with which the authority can decrypt and access information that is&nbsp;stored  Make data flow unidirectional    User uploads an encrypted file.  <p>(N.B. we have not yet implemented anonymous replies in the mixnet — as such acknowledgements of receipt of the file by the SP to the Upload Client will have to be implemented manually, and will not be anonymous. Anonymous replies via Single Use Reply Blocks (SURBs) would be swapped in once they are implemented in the mixnet in the future, and would be used in production / deployment of this application.</p><p>TL;DR its fine for teams to implement non-private hacks in this hackathon project as we do not yet have SURBs implemented.)</p>  File optionally deleted from local device (see point&nbsp;below)  Remove option to grab upload from SP at a later date that currently exists with&nbsp;NymDrive  <p>3. Add automatic file wipe from local device on upload as an&nbsp;option</p>  We already have the option of a file being deleted manually via the GUI — add the option for it to be automatic on upload once the encrypted file and other evidence are uploaded &amp; ack is received from the&nbsp;SP  <p>4. Enable Authority running the service provider to decrypt files on SP accessed via ReaderGUI</p>  E.g. something like ECDH key exchange with the Authority for decryption.  <p>5. Include additional information when uploading files to service provider:</p>  ​​​​​​​Identity of sender (cryptographic)  Metadata of photo or video from phone (e.g. time, if location tagging is on then that,&nbsp;etc)  <p>There are a number of additional things which would be interesting to see implemented on top of&nbsp;these:</p>  Image provenance check prior to uploading file&nbsp;to    CAI has a pretty well developed java SDK (the Rust SDK currently only handles images, not video, but might still be worth experimenting with given that this functionality is presumed to be added in the future): <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/c2patool">https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/c2patool</a>  Inclusion of this check is noted in the application flow diagram above, where the check takes place after the file is uploaded to a computer, but prior to being encrypted and sent through the mixnet to the&nbsp;SP.  Image provenance tasks are any tasks that must occur on the user’s end to make the file capable of being authenticated, verified, etc. This can be accomplished by running the file through CAI SDK functions.  <p>2. Identity sharding for key backup if you lose your device / original sender goes&nbsp;missing</p>  Something like ShamirSecretSharing with designated other Nym addresses  <p>3. Decentralised hosting via something like&nbsp;Akash</p><p>4. Private distributed storage solution instead of&nbsp;IPFS</p><p>Building beyond Kyiv — Nym&nbsp;Shipyard</p><p>The <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/shipyard/">Nym Shipyard</a>, the new beta space for Nym, will be launched shortly. Shipyard is a place to build and try out new Privacy Enhanced Applications (PEApps) in experimental mode. Members of the Nym ecosystem can apply for grants, build and test the strength of their privacy protections before sailing out into the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Participants successful in the AnonDrop challenge will quality automatically for a Shipyard grant to continue developing AnonDrop, focusing on verifying the authenticity of evidence submitted. This grant will also come with mentorship — details to be announced shortly.</p><p>Filecoin also has a <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants">Grants program</a> where promising projects that may not win in this hackathon, could apply for support if they would like to continue building after the hackathon and would like&nbsp;support.</p><p>Make a difference, join the hackathon now</p><p>The <a href="https://kyiv-tech-summit.devpost.com/">Kyiv Tech Summit hackathon</a> starts tomorrow, 6 September, and participation online is possible, so <a href="https://secure.devpost.com/users/register?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fkyiv-tech-summit.devpost.com%2Fregister%3Fflow%255Bdata%255D%255Bchallenge_id%255D%3D16007%26flow%255Bname%255D%3Dregister_for_challenge">join now</a> to use the power of technology to solve real on-the-ground issues in&nbsp;Ukraine!</p><p>For those unable to participate but interested in our efforts for&nbsp;Ukraine:</p><p><a href="http://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a></p><p>Use Nym to privacy enhance your existing apps.

<p>To understand the concept of zk-SNARKs vs zk-STARKs and how these technologies measure against each other, it’s imperative to first outlay the problem they solve.</p><p>Lack of privacy and scalability are the two biggest obstacles hampering the mass adoption of blockchain technology. As beautiful as the idea of a public and permissionless blockchain is, without data privacy, a Web3-heavy future could look like a dystopia in which every single transaction leaves a clear trail open to the public to learn everything about you.</p><p>Publicly accessible <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">transaction</a> records are great as verifiable activity proofs, but anyone who cared could go digging, linking payment to payment, and tying your real-world identity to your on-chain trail and could use it against you.</p><p>Similarly, a lack of scalability can gravely inhibit the prospects of blockchain adoption. The scalability problem has been at the core of most of the blockchain innovations we’ve seen in the past couple of years. Without sacrificing <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a>, the current state of blockchain technology simply cannot support applications that reach mass adoption.</p><p>Then came zero-knowledge proofs – &nbsp;a single solution to both problems.</p> ZKPs – a solution to the blockchain privacy/scalability riddle <p>A ZKP (Which stands for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">zero-knowledge proof</a>) allows one party to verify (among other things) a claim that a transaction is valid or correct without the need to carry additional information about the transaction. Through them, cryptography found a way to prove the authenticity of a transaction without revealing sensitive information.</p>A simple illustration of a zero-knowledge proof. (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-are-zero-knowledge-proofs-7ef6aab955fc">Source</a>)<p>The emergence of ZK-proofs signaled a new dawn for the crypto space. Not only could they enable truly private transactions, but they could also help networks like Ethereum scale.</p><p>For a zero-knowledge proof to work, it needs to fulfill three conditions – completeness, soundness, and zero-knowledge. ZKPs can be of one of two types – interactive and non-interactive. Interactive zero-knowledge proofs needed constant, back-and-forth interactions between the prover and the verifier until the verifier confirms the truth in the prover's claims.</p><p>Non-interactive ZKPs require no such interaction, with a single exchange of information sufficing to satisfy both parties. The most prominent non-interactive ZKPs are zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs. In this article, we’ll look at what they are, their differences, applications, and use cases.</p> What are zk-SNARKs? <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">zk-SNARK</a> stand for Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge, a type of non-interactive zero-knowledge proof widely used today. Privacy coin protocols like Zcash use zk-SNARKs to offer a shielded blockchain experience while providing sufficient proof that every shielded transaction is valid.</p><p>To understand how zk-SNARKs work, we must consider each letter of the acronym:</p>  ZK: This pair represents “zero-knowledge”, signifying that a zk-SNARK provides no additional information other than the validity of its submitter claims. Any information that describes the nature of the transaction(s), its participants, and the exchanged value is withheld from the verifier.  S: This letter stands for “succinct”, meaning that the proof size is small (occupying little space) paving the way for quick and easy verifications.  N: Stands for non-interactive, meaning that little or no interaction is required between prover and verifier. Everything from proof generation to submission and verification occurs within a single transaction.  ARK: Represents “Argument of Knowledge”, and this part adds the quality of computational soundness to zk-SNARKs. Simply put, a bad actor can hardly cheat the system without the knowledge to support their claim (i.e. by holding the underlying information they’re trying to forge). This is based on the theory that the bad actor has limited computational power, meaning that anyone with unlimited computational power could create fake proofs. Some zk-SNARK protocols have a way to prevent this kind of attack.  <p>zk-SNARKs have an important piece of their makeup: they require a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusted setup</a> between prover and verifier. To construct zero-knowledge proofs with zk-SNARKs, a set of public parameters is needed, along with the creation of cryptographic keys. You can liken these parameters to the “rules” of a protocol, and they are usually encoded. Meanwhile, the keys make privacy possible.</p><p>Zcash is one of the foremost privacy-preserving protocols that use zk-SNARKs. Also, some popular <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">ZK-rollups</a> and Layer-2 blockchains use <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zkevm-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/">zk-SNARK proof technology to provide scalability to traditional blockchain networks like Ethereum.</a></p> What are zk-STARKs? <p>The first papers detailing STARKs were published in 2018 by Eli Ben-Sasson, Iddo Bentov, Yinon Horeshy, and Michael Riabzev. As another type of non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, zk-STARKs are less popular than their zkSNARK counterparts, mostly because they are a newer model. The term stands for zero-knowledge scalable transparent arguments of knowledge, and they are faithful to the fundamentals of zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to share validated data or perform computations with third parties without disclosing any actual information to the third party. Like in the case of zk-SNARKs, we will evaluate each letter of the acronym to learn how zk-STARKs work.</p>  ZK: Like in “zk-SNARKs”, this also means “zero-knowledge”, implying that they prove transactions or interactions without disclosing any underlying information except that they are correct and authentic.  S: This means “scalable”, highlighting how these zero-knowledge proofs focus on enhancing blockchain scalability. zk-STARKs enable developers to execute computation and store data off-chain, increasing scalability exponentially. The zero-knowledge proofs verify these off-chain activities, which are then submitted online for interested parties to verify them.  T: Stands for “transparent”, and this quality marks one of the most significant differences between zk-STARKs and zk-SNARKs. They use publicly-available randomness to generate parameters, eliminating the need for a trusted setup.  ARK: “Argument of Knowledge” implies the same as in zk-SNARKs, but use a different computation approach. They use <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/">hash functions</a> resistant to collisions, effectively eliminating the need for trusted setups.  <p>zkSTARK technology is more recent than zk-SNARKs, and it was pioneered by Starkware with rollup solutions. Using zk-STARKs, one can compute several thousands of transactions in batches off-chain and submit a sole zkSTARK proof to confirm the transactions’ validity on-chain.</p> zk-SNARKs vs. zk-STARKs: similarities and differences  Similarities <p>These two share a few similarities. Firstly, they are non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocols, requiring little interaction between prover and verifier. Proof generation, submission, and verification are usually completed within one transaction.</p><p>Also, they enhance blockchain scalability. Zero-knowledge proofs are much smaller than the average Bitcoin transaction and get verified much quicker. Swift verification and less block space mean more scalability for networks like Ethereum.</p> Differences <p>zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs differ on four major points, at least:</p>Difference between zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and Bulletproofs (emojis are the author’s). (<a href="https://github.com/gluk64/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs">Source</a>) Transparency <p>zk-SNARKs need an initial trusted setup phase to generate the randomness required to generate zero-knowledge proofs. These parameters are usually held in the custody of a small group to protect them. If the parameters fall into the wrong hands, dishonest actors could use them to create false proofs.</p><p>zk-STARKs follow a different approach, utilizing collision-resistant cryptography to eliminate the need for private parameter generation ceremonies. Without trusted setups, the parameters for generating randomness are public, limiting centralization and empowering <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">transparency</a>.</p> Security <p>zk-SNARKs use an initial setup to generate parameters and, according to their setup, are computationally sound. Their soundness, however, assumes that provers have limited computing power. However, when a prover uses an unlimited amount of computing power, they will be able to, for instance, make use of a certain algorithm that can execute extremely quick parallel integer factorization computations that can be used to extract a private key from a public key. In other words, they will be able to breach proof systems. Thus, zk-SNARKs are, in theory, vulnerable to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590005621000138">quantum computing attacks</a>, therefore, not quantum resistant.</p><p>zk-STARKs do not need an initial <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html">trusted setup</a>, choosing a collision-resistant approach instead. Thus, they do not require high computation costs like zk-SNARKs, eliminating the threat of being compromised by the unlimited computation power of quantum computing. They are, therefore, higher in the quantum resistant scale.</p> Scalability <p>zk-SNARKs have a smaller byte size compared to zk-STARKs, but their computational demand makes them slower to generate proofs compared to the other option. zk-SNARKs consume less gas than zk-STARKs, and they verify proofs faster because of the difference in byte size.</p><p>While it may seem like zk-SNARKs are more scalable due to their faster proof verification, zk-STARKs generate proofs quicker and scale faster, consuming less gas when coming on-chain due to the adoption of off-chain computation and storage. However, during periods of low throughput (few proofs created), they will take much longer to verify.</p> Structure <p>zk-SNARKs are built on elliptic curves, which improve security and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">privacy</a> under the assumption that it is infeasible to find the logarithm of a random elliptic curve element in relation to a public base point.</p><p>zk-STARKs, on the other hand, uses lean cryptography – collision-resistant hash functions – to provide scalability and security.</p> Applications and Use Cases  zk-SNARKs <p>zk-SNARKs are the more popular of the two main non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs. Several projects in the crypto space today have adopted them to further scalability and privacy, with the latter being more widely used.</p><p>zk-SNARKs generate and verify zero-knowledge proofs quickly, and privacy-enhancing protocols have used them vastly. With zk-SNARKs, privacy-enabled blockchains can shield transactions from the public eye, allowing users to provide zero-knowledge proofs in the place of average transaction records.</p><p>Some privacy protocols like <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/">Panther Protocol</a> have integrated selective disclosure mechanisms that allow users to share the information shielded by the blockchain with trusted third parties.</p><p>zk-SNARKs can also be adapted for identity verification, allowing users to pass <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">KYC and AML</a> requirements without putting their sensitive information at risk. Using zk-SNARKs, these protocols can allow users to submit a zero-knowledge proof of their identity instead of &nbsp;documents, confirming that they have the required data to be verified without revealing any extra information. zk-SNARKs have also been adopted to drive <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-defi-privacy-suite-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary/">privacy in decentralized finance</a>, gaming, ZK-rollups, and asset ownership.</p> zk-STARKs <p>zk-STARKs are known to scale better than zk-SNARKs. Hence they have been adopted by blockchain scalability solutions like ZK-rollups and Layer-2 blockchain solutions. With them, these protocols compute transactions and store data off-chain, then submit zero-knowledge proofs on-chain to update the network's state.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>By Dan Kim — Vice President, Business Development — Ecosystem and&nbsp;Listings</p><p>Tl;dr: Coinbase reviews thousands of crypto tokens; around 90% never get considered for listing as they do not meet our strict requirements for protection against scams like “pump-and-dumps” and “rug&nbsp;pulls.”</p><p>Our proprietary threat detection software has identified and blocked over 700 tokens with malicious software that can harm Coinbase&nbsp;users.</p><p>We also conduct in-depth research on project teams to ensure they don’t have a record of engaging in questionable business practices.</p><p>In order to get the next 100 million people into web3, we need to make it easy to buy, sell, and hold the safest and most reputable catalog of digital assets, and further solidify Coinbase as the most trusted bridge to the cryptoeconomy. We also need to make sure users are protected.</p><p>That’s why our goal at Coinbase is to list every asset that meets our industry-leading standards for risk, safety, and user protection: If an asset doesn’t meet those standards, we don’t list&nbsp;it.</p><p>We only announce the assets we have decided to list — not the ones that fail to meet our standards. But we’ve heard from many of you that you’d like to learn more about how we decide which assets are added to our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/increasing-transparency-for-new-asset-listings-on-coinbase-e06f2edb095e">roadmap</a>.</p><p>How Coinbase reviews digital&nbsp;assets</p><p>We review assets based on applications submitted by project teams on <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/assethub">Coinbase Asset Hub</a>, as well as the thousands of other projects we track across the global web3 ecosystem.</p><p>The order in which we sequence asset reviews is not based on whether we think a project is popular or interesting. Our framework is much more objective and nuanced, and includes factors such as the legitimacy of a project’s white paper, integrity of their contributors, details of how their token works, and engagement levels of their user and developer communities. We only consider listing those assets that meet our rigorous guidelines for legality, safety, reputability, and technical integrability.</p><p>We do not list the majority of the tokens that we review. In fact, out of every 100 tokens we consider, only around 10 are identified as potential candidates for Coinbase Exchange, and fewer than that actually get approved for&nbsp;listing.</p><p>Today we’re sharing more details about the industry-leading tools, systems and methods we use to protect our users from dangerous digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>How our threat detection software keeps users&nbsp;safe</p><p>Blockchain technology is constantly evolving, so any asset review system must be able to adapt with those&nbsp;changes.</p><p>That’s why Coinbase developed our proprietary secure trait analyzer, a safety-first, threat detection software that informs us if a token is designed in a way that can harm you or your&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>Our software automatically reviews tokens on all the blockchains we support, and identifies those programmed with software (also known as smart contracts) that can potentially harm Coinbase customers. The secure trait analyzer works by detecting specific patterns in smart contracts (which we call code signatures), and comparing them against our database of code signatures from previously analyzed smart contracts. The more smart contracts we review, the faster we’ll be able to distinguish the safer tokens from the riskier&nbsp;ones.</p><p>So far, our Listings team has used this automated system to identify over 700 tokens that didn’t meet our security standards due to critical risks, such as single individuals being able to automatically seize users’ funds or unilaterally drain account balances. The proprietary software has also helped us detect dangerous backdoor vulnerabilities — like those that can be used for rug pulls, in nearly one out of every four smart contracts we’ve reviewed.</p><p>Whenever we find things that aren’t safe, we ask project teams to take the appropriate measures to mitigate those risks. If they don’t, we don’t list their&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Added security from comprehensive research</p><p>In addition to screening smart contracts with our threat detection software, we also conduct other types of detailed due diligence to protect our&nbsp;users.</p><p>That includes in-depth research into the project’s purpose, milestones, and key contributors to make sure we’re complying with regulations and identifying any potential connections to illicit activity.</p><p>To capture the most comprehensive view of all assets we consider for listing, we also perform on-chain and off-chain analyses of quantitative and qualitative signals — things like historical token prices and trading volume, ownership and vesting schedules, investment and financing history, market capitalization, community sentiment, technical roadmap, and information about how tokens are earned, burned, and distributed.</p><p>Digging deeper: Protecting users from bad&nbsp;actors</p><p>Beyond our security reviews, we take other important steps to protect our customers from&nbsp;scams.</p><p>Earlier this year, we implemented a fraud detection framework that expands our ability to identify even more factors that could potentially harm Coinbase customers. This analysis is specifically designed to evaluate consumer and business risks that might not show up when we review project whitepapers or analyze token smart contracts — things like key project contributors with a record of shady business practices or confirmed allegations of pump-and-dumps.</p><p>Since implementing this additional layer of protection, the Listings team has identified nearly 100 projects with tokens that we perceive to be high risk and have chosen not to&nbsp;list.</p><p>Coinbase is the most trusted platform for buying, selling, and exchanging digital assets. While we aim to list as many assets as we legally can, our priority is to protect our users. We’ve invested an enormous amount in tools and processes that weed out risky assets, and will continue working towards keeping all Coinbase users&nbsp;safe.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/how-coinbase-protects-users-from-risky-assets-342a6bd63763">How Coinbase Protects Users From Risky Assets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This week someone described me as a file that had been closed, annotated, and archived. In this (relatively) short video I compare the cybernetic circle with the dynamic spiral. Promises of stability and homeostasis are set against uncertainty with possibility. It draws upon themes I raised today in my discussions with Jason and Leo on parametric insurance contracts and risk profiling Mother Nature. I try to make the case for the spiral as we make our way to a hopefully less transactional and more reciprocal future. I did this as a clearing of any intentions, conscious or unconscious, meant to contain me in digital amber. I am a dynamic, evolving force, and I have more waves to make before my time is up.</p>
<p>I also read from John Trudell’s poetry book “<a href="https://indigenousliteratures.wordpress.com/2014/03/14/lines-from-a-mined-mind/">Lines From A Mined Mind</a>.”</p>
<p>The poem I read was “Peace,” but not Ervin Laszlo’s homeostatic variety, an authentic peace from the heart.</p>

<p>PS – A bit on the crystal <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/peridot-gemstone-meaning-4150129">peridot</a> or olivine.</p>
<p>“Peridot is a popular stone for protection against difficulties and negativity. It is also often used to strengthen and purify the physical and energetic bodies. Peridot is considered a very joyful, warm, friendly stone that can ease anger and jealousy as well as encourage open-heartedness. It is also a stone of abundance and gratitude, and can help us to acknowledge and invite abundance, both material and spiritual, in our lives. Peridot is also helpful when it comes to recognizing patterns that have been causing blocks, so that you can move past them. In addition, peridot can help you to trust your own inner voice and become less attached to the guidance of others outside of you.”</p>

<p>Jason Bosch, Leo Saraceno, and I presented the first half of an extended conversation today on new forms of automated insurance products and how data flowing through the smart contract layer of Web 3 has been designed to generate profit for those at the top while legitimizing expanded digital surveillance. That data will improve artificial intelligence machine learning as attempts are made to catalyze “life” at the cybernetic edge – order out of chaos. IoT monitored insurance risk is simply a more sophisticated cybernetic governance system. We plan to finish the second half of this discussion next Thursday, September 8, at 1pm EST.</p>

<p>by Coinbase Cloud&nbsp;team</p><p>Sep 6 — We have updated this post to more accurately describe our product by clarifying that the Solana Archival product is a blockstore of historical transactions, not an archive of account state at every point in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Tl;dr: Coinbase Cloud is expanding our dedicated Solana infrastructure offering to include Solana Archival Nodes. These Solana Archival Nodes can query information about every slot since genesis. These queries can be used to derive historical address balances, as well as build custom indexers and analytics products.</p><p>Customers using Cloud’s Solana Archival Node can query information about every slot since genesis. These queries can be used to derive historical address balances, as well as build custom indexers and analytics products.</p>  The archival nodes serve all historical block and transaction data  Current account data is stored “locally” on each node and accessible via native remote procedure call (RPC) functionality  Access to account state at specific points in history is not available  <p>Coinbase Cloud previously launched secure, dedicated Solana infrastructure nodes via Query &amp; Transact, allowing builders to access and verify data and transaction information from the Solana blockchain.</p><p>Today, Coinbase Cloud is expanding that offering with the launch of Solana Archival Nodes. Managing archival nodes in a scalable way is technically challenging due to Solana’s high throughput design (~2–3 blocks/sec) and large data footprint (~100TB for all historical data).</p><p>We’re excited about helping to empower developers to build better products and services that contribute to the growth of the Solana community!</p> Solana Archival Node Highlights:   Built for builders: Solana builders can let Coinbase Cloud do the heavy lifting and access the archival data they&nbsp;need.  Built with Solana expertise: Coinbase Cloud’s Solana archival node infrastructure is built with deep understanding of the Solana network. We operated one of the first validators on Solana on the Tour de Sol testnet, and have since been running validator and read/write node infrastructure.  Cloud-based, reliable infrastructure: Coinbase Cloud’s multi-cloud, multi-region infrastructure is architected to minimize downtime risk, and let you access data without skipping a&nbsp;beat.  Security-first: Coinbase Cloud’s infrastructure is built to meet or exceed the security needs of highly regulated institutions.  Designated support: Our engineers and customer success team are ready to assist you in managing your infrastructure.   Solana: a high-performance blockchain <p>Solana is an open source, high-performance, permissionless blockchain that uses highly scalable technology to prioritize transaction throughput, the ability to process a large number of transactions in a short span of time. Solana is currently able to process more than 50,000 transactions per&nbsp;second.</p><p>Secure, reliable, and easy-to-use infrastructure is critical for the continued flourishing of the Solana ecosystem. Solana’s high throughput capacity is well-suited for many use cases including trading. The high throughput capacity also requires expertise in developer operations and hardware selection to run a performant node. Nodes require powerful hardware, extremely high bandwidth, and significant protocol expertise to manage participation.</p><p>Coinbase Cloud has collaborated closely with the Solana team to support the network as it is growing and scaling securely. We operated one of the first nodes in Tour de Sol, Solana’s incentivized testnet. Since mainnet beta launch, we have helped our clients manage the complexity of participation with secure, tested validator infrastructure run by seasoned protocol engineers and specialists.</p><p>Now, we are expanding our Solana offerings to include our Solana Archival Nodes to empower developers interested in building on the blockchain.</p> Solana Query &amp; Transact: run reliable, secure read/write nodes to build applications and&nbsp;services <p>With Query &amp; Transact, developers interested in building on Solana can easily run read/write nodes, access data from the blockchain, and build applications and services that connect to&nbsp;Solana.</p><p>Even for highly technical teams, running nodes can be an expensive, time-consuming process. It requires strong protocol expertise, staying up-to-date with the latest network changes, and scaling infrastructure to manage potential changes in throughput. These demands are particularly true for Solana read/write infrastructure, given the higher throughput capacity than other protocols.</p><p>Coinbase Cloud’s Solana Query &amp; Transact alleviates this challenge and makes it easier to build on Solana. Developers and enterprises interested in building applications and services connected to the Solana network can easily manage their infrastructure from a single platform, and quickly scale their infrastructure based on changing throughput requirements.</p> Why run Solana Archival Nodes with Coinbase&nbsp;Cloud? <p>We are infrastructure experts with a deep understanding of the Solana network. With Solana Archival Nodes running on Query &amp; Transact read/write infrastructure, you can focus on your product and customers instead of core node infrastructure.</p>  High uptime: Our Query &amp; Transact read/write nodes are built on multi-region cloud infrastructure, with 99.9% uptime guarantee.*  Easy-to-use platform: We make participation and building on blockchains simple, including more complex networks like Solana. You can manage your node infrastructure easily from a single dashboard.  Dedicated support: Our engineers and customer success team are ready to assist you in managing your infrastructure.   Get in touch with us about our Solana products:   Solana Participate (staking infrastructure): Secure validator infrastructure to participate in the Solana&nbsp;network.  Solana Query &amp; Transact (read/write infrastructure): Read/write infrastructure to access data from the Solana network, verify information and transactions, and build products and services that run on&nbsp;Solana.  <p>*subject to the terms and conditions set forth in our SLA, some exceptions apply</p><p>Disclaimers</p><p>This document and the information contained herein is not a recommendation or endorsement of any digital asset, protocol, network, or project.

<p>Tl;dr: This blog post describes how we developed an efficient, reliable Python ecosystem using Pants, an open source build system, and solved the challenge of managing Python applications at a large scale at Coinbase.</p><p>By The Coinbase Compute Platform&nbsp;Team</p><p>Python is one of the most frequently used programming languages for data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and blockchain researchers at Coinbase. Over the past few years, we have witnessed a growth of Python applications that aim to solve many challenging problems in the cryptocurrency world like Airflow data pipelines, blockchain analytics tools, machine learning applications, and many others. Based on our internal data, the number of Python applications has almost doubled since Q3, 2022. According to our internal data, today there are approximately 1,500 data processing pipelines and services developed with Python. The total number of builds is around 500 per week at the time of writing. We foresee an even wider application as more Python centric frameworks (such as Ray, Modin, DASK, etc.) are adopted into our data ecosystem.</p> Choosing the right&nbsp;tool <p>Engineering success comes largely from choosing the right tools. Building a large-scale Python ecosystem to support our growing engineering requirements could raise some challenges, including using a reliable build system, flexible dependency management, fast software release, and consistent code quality check. However, these challenges can be combated by integrating <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants</a>, a build system developed by Toolchain labs, into the Coinbase build infrastructure. We chose this as the Python build system for the following reasons:</p>  Pants is ergonomic and user-friendly,  Pants understands many build-related commands, such as “test”, “lint”, “fmt”, “typecheck”, and “package”  Pants was designed with real-world Python use as a first-class use-case, including handling third party dependencies. In fact, parts of Pants itself is written in Python (with the rest written in&nbsp;Rust).  Pants requires less metadata and BUILD file boilerplate than other tools, thanks to the <a href="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/dependency-inference/">dependency inference</a>, sensible defaults and auto-generation of BUILD files. Bazel requires a huge amount of handwritten BUILD boilerplate.  Pants is easy to extend, with a powerful plugin API that uses idiomatic Python 3 async code, so that users can have a natural control flow in their&nbsp;plugins.  Pants has true OSS governance, where any org can play an equal&nbsp;role.  Pants has a gentle learning curve. It has much less friction than other tools. The maintenance cost is moderate thanks to the one-click installation experience of the tool and simple configuration files.   Previous problems <p>Python is one of the most <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages">popular</a> programming languages for machine learning and data science applications. However, prior to adopting the Python-first build system, Pants, our internal investment in the Python ecosystem was low in comparison to that of Golang and Ruby — the primary choice for writing services and web applications at Coinbase.</p><p>According to the usage statistics of Coinbase’s monorepo, Python today accounts for only 4% of the usage because of lack of build system support. Before 2021, most of the Python projects were in multiple repositories without a unified build infrastructure — leading to the following issues:</p>  Challenges with code sharing: The process for an engineer to update a shared library was complex. Changes made to the code were published to an internal PyPI server before being proven to be more stable. A library that was upgraded to a new version, but had not undergone enough testing, could potentially break the dependee that consumed the library without a pinned&nbsp;version.  Lack of streamlined release process: Code change often required complicated cross-repository updates and releases. There was no automatic workflow to carry out the integration and staging tests for the relevant changes. The lack of coherent observability and reliability imposed a tremendous engineering overhead.  Inconsistent development experiences: Development experience varied a lot as each repository had its own way of virtual environment setup, code quality check, build and deployment etc.   Building PyNest for data organization <p>We decided to build PyNest — a new Python “monorepo” for the data organization at Coinbase. It is not our intention for PyNest to be use as a monorepo for the entire company, but rather that the repository is used for projects within the data organization.</p>  Building a company-wide monorepo requires a team of elites. We do not have enough crew to reproduce the success stories of monorepos at Facebook, Twitter, and&nbsp;Google.  Python is primarily used within the data org in the company. It is important to set the right scope so that we can focus on data priorities without being distracted by ad hoc requirements. The PyNest build infrastructure can be reused by other teams to expedite their Python repositories.  It is desirable to consolidate mutually dependent projects (see the dependency graph for ML platform projects) into a single repository to prevent inadvertent cyclic dependencies.  <p>Figure 1. Dependency graph for machine learning platform (MLP) projects.</p>  Although monorepo promised a new world of productivity, it has been proven not to be a long term solution for Coinbase. The Golang monorepo is a lesson, where problems emerged after a year of usage such as sprawling codebase, failed IDE integrations, slow CI/CD, out-of-date dependencies, etc.  Open source projects should be kept in individual repositories.  <p>The graph below shows the repository architecture at Coinbase, where the green blocks indicate the new Python ecosystem we have built. Inter-repository operability is achieved by serving layers including the code artifacts and schema registry.</p><p>Figure 2.

Pynest repository structure</p><p>The following is a list of the major elements of the repository and their explanations.</p><p>1. 3rdparty</p><p>Third party dependencies are placed under this folder. Pants will parse the requirements.txt files and automatically generate the “python_requirement” target for each of the dependencies. Multiple versions of the same dependency are supported by the multiple lockfiles feature of Pants. This feature makes it possible for projects to have conflicts in either direct or transitive dependencies. Pants generates lockfiles to pin every dependency and ensure a reproducible build. More explanations of the pants multiple lock is in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XwEI8hzGNvJGJdyjHVKIN3SZcFUrfbpUlfUepuMcz9s/edit#heading=h.kw02t8xrp2jd">dependency management</a> section.</p><p>2. Lib</p><p>Shared libraries accessible to all the projects. Projects within PyNest can directly import the source code. For projects outside PyNest, the libraries can be accessed via pip installing the wheel files from an internal PyPI&nbsp;server.</p><p>3. Project&nbsp;folders</p><p>Individual projects live in this folder. The folder path is formatted as “{project_name}/{src or test}/python/{namespace}”. The source root is configured as “src/python” or “test/python”, and the underneath namespace is used to isolate the&nbsp;modules.</p><p>4. Code owner&nbsp;files</p><p>Code owner files (OWNERS) are added to the folders to define the individuals or teams that are responsible for the code in the folder tree. The CI workflow invokes a script to compile all the OWNERS files into a CODEOWNERS file under “.github/”. Code owner approval rule requires all pull requests to have at least one approval from the group of code owners before they can be&nbsp;merged.</p><p>5. Tools</p><p>Tools folder contains the configuration files for the code quality tools, e.g. flake8, black, isort, mypy, etc. These files are referenced by Pants to configure the&nbsp;linters.</p><p>6. Buildkite workflow</p><p>Coinbase uses Buildkite as the CI platform. The Buildkite workflow and the hook definitions are defined in this folder. The CI workflow defines the steps such&nbsp;as</p>  Check whether dependency lockfiles need updating.  Execute lints and code quality&nbsp;tools.  Build source code and docker&nbsp;images.  Runs unit and integration tests.  Generates reports of code coverages.  <p>7. Dockerfiles</p><p>Dockerfiles are defined in this folder. The docker images are built by the CI workflow and deployed by Codeflow — an internal deployment platform at Coinbase.</p><p>8. Pants libraries</p><p>This folder contains the Pants script and the configuration files (pants.toml, pants.ci.toml).</p><p>This article describes how we build PyNest using the Pants build system. In our next blog post, we will explain dependency management and&nbsp;CI/CD.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/building-a-python-ecosystem-for-efficient-and-reliable-development-d986c97a94a0">Building a Python ecosystem for efficient and reliable development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A guide to the projects and companies working to make web3 development as easy as&nbsp;web2</p><p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/aroundtheblock/home">Around the Block</a>, from Coinbase Ventures sheds light on key trends in crypto. Written by <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathankingvc">Jonathan King</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Cdempsey44">Connor Dempsey</a>, &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/HoolieG">Hoolie&nbsp;Tejwani</a></p><p>Special thanks to Mike Armstrong, Aaron Henshaw, Michael Atassi, Steven Willinger, and Shan Aggarwal for helping to inform this&nbsp;article.</p><p>Despite the rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with the emergence of new categories like DeFi, NFTs, GameFi and DAOs, web3 developers represent less than 1% of the 31.1M software developers globally.*</p><p>So why are there so few developers in web3 today? For one, the tools and infrastructure available to web3 developers are much less robust than that of web2. This simply makes it more difficult to get started building, experimenting, and deploying in web3. That’s all quickly changing however, as the number of monthly active web3 developers hit <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-developer-growth-hits-an-all-time-high-as-ecosystem-matures">all-time highs</a> at the end of 2021. And to support this growing contingency, is a vibrant ecosystem of teams working to simplify the entire web3 developer journey, which will ultimately help unlock the next stage of web3 growth and innovation.</p><p>In this edition of Around The Block, we’ll explore the growing web3 developer stack.</p><p>The Web3 Developer Stack</p><p>Building in Web2 vs&nbsp;Web3</p><p>Software development is the process of building computer programs. There are three main components to a given&nbsp;program:</p>  The front-end (what users interact&nbsp;with)  The back-end (what users don’t&nbsp;see)  Database (where critical data is&nbsp;stored)  <p>The front-end that a typical user interacts with through a mobile or desktop browser is basically the same in web2 and web3. A web3 app like Uniswap looks similar to a typical web2 app because both front-ends are mostly created using React — a popular developer framework for web and mobile&nbsp;apps.</p><p>It’s under the hood where web2 and web3 differ. The backend frameworks and types of databases that make web3’s defining characteristic — user-defined ownership — possible are new and&nbsp;unique.</p><p>Where web2 applications largely rely on centralized databases, web3 applications are built on decentralized databases (blockchains). This requires entirely new backends and new primitives like&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>The tools that aid in the creation, deployment, and maintenance of web2 applications are incredibly developer-friendly, thanks to decades of cumulative development. Out of the box solutions, mature infrastructure, shared code libraries, and easy to use frameworks largely make building in web2 a&nbsp;breeze.</p><p>Web3 on the other hand still requires specialized expertise to interface with complex infrastructure and commonly involves many redundant processes given that the stack is less developed, leaving teams to have to reinvent the wheel. That said, the tooling that will help onboard the next 1M+ web3 developers is rapidly improving.</p><p>Let’s take a (non-exhaustive) look at the evolving Web3 developer stack layer by layer (* denotes Coinbase Ventures portfolio company).</p><p>Protocol layer</p><p>The first decision a web3 developer has to make is which blockchain protocol to build on. Building on Bitcoin is entirely different from building on Ethereum, and Solana differs from Ethereum, etc.</p><p>For faster and lower-cost applications, developers might want to build on a layer2 protocol — <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a>*, <a href="https://bridge.arbitrum.io/">Arbitrum</a>*, etc. For applications that need to port value from one chain to another, developers will want to leverage cross-chain bridges like <a href="https://hop.exchange/">Hop*</a> or <a href="https://synapse.network/">Synapse</a>*.</p><p>Once these decisions are made, developers can start to incorporate building blocks that make user applications possible.</p><p>Infrastructure primitives</p><p>The next thing a developer needs to figure out is how their application will ultimately interact with the underlying blockchains. This is where infrastructure primitives come into&nbsp;play.</p><p>Node infrastructure — Nodes are where an app’s interaction with a blockchain “happens.” They’re computers that read the state of the blockchain and write updates to it once a user interacts with an application. Node infrastructure providers like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/cloud">Coinbase Cloud</a>, <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a>*, and <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/">Alchemy</a>* let developers easily set-up, manage, or access blockchain nodes, saving developers considerable time and resources.</p><p>Wallet &amp; Key Management — Blockchain wallets, like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/wallet">Coinbase Wallet</a>, allow users to manage the private keys needed to perform transactions within web3 applications. Wallet and key management providers like <a href="https://web3auth.io/">Web3Auth</a>* or <a href="https://www.pinestreetlabs.com/">Pine Street Labs</a>*, enable developers to build secure connectivity between blockchain wallets and user-facing applications.</p><p>Identity — protocols like <a href="https://ens.domains/">ENS</a>* serve as a user’s identity across applications. <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce</a>* provides frameworks and toolkits that developers can use to verify user credentials to authenticate actions on Ethereum. For example, developers can use the Spruce ID toolkit to empower users to sign into apps with their ENS accounts. Additionally, companies like <a href="https://litprotocol.com/">Lit Protocol</a> provide developer tooling for granting access to content, software, and other data utilizing their tokens or&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Decentralized compute — Compute resources provide processing power that applications rely on to carry out computational tasks. Currently, most of the web’s compute is provided by centrally owned providers like AWS. Decentralized compute is a shift towards community-owned networks, in which compute resources are distributed in a permissionless manner at low-cost. Companies like <a href="https://akash.network/">Akash Network</a> and <a href="https://aleph.im/#/">Aleph.im</a> have emerged to provide peer-to-peer compute resources that are highly-performant and optimized for smart contracts and blockchain applications.</p><p>Decentralized storage — Storing every piece of data associated with a given web3 app directly on blockchain nodes is costly. Rather than storing data on a centralized database, web3 developers can use peer-to-peer data storage protocols like <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>*, and <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic Network</a>* for certain data. For example, web3 blogging site Mirror is built on Ethereum, but stores actual blog content on&nbsp;Arweave.</p><p>Oracles — For a typical Ethereum application, the blockchain stores transaction history and “state” (balances, smart contracts, and other variables). It can’t, however, natively store and interact with data from external sources — i.e. transaction history from other blockchains or “real world” data like the weather in San Francisco. That’s where oracles like <a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a> or <a href="https://www.fluxprotocol.org/">Flux</a>*come in, connecting blockchains to on-chain and off-chain data&nbsp;sources.</p><p>Interoperability — many different blockchains exist but few have the ability to exchange value and make use of information cross-chain. Interoperability protocols like <a href="https://layerzero.network/">LayerZero</a>*, <a href="https://axelar.network/">Axelar Network*</a>, and <a href="https://astar.network/">Astar Network</a>* provide SDKs and APis for developers to build apps that are portable and can communicate with different blockchains.</p><p>Developer tools</p><p>Atop the infrastructure primitives that allow applications to interact with blockchain networks are tools that allow developers to more seamlessly interact with the above-named primitives.</p><p>Frameworks &amp; IDEs — Developer frameworks consist of libraries of code that other developers have created that make development easier. Web3 frameworks like <a href="https://trufflesuite.com/">Truffle</a>, <a href="https://moralis.io/">Moralis</a>*, <a href="https://tatum.io/">Tatum</a>, and <a href="https://thirdweb.com/">ThirdWeb</a>*, let developers leverage existing code for smart contract applications so they don’t have to build everything from scratch. They also let developers test and deploy applications. Integrated development environments (IDEs) like <a href="https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry">Foundry</a> and <a href="https://hardhat.org/">HardHat</a> combine common source code editors, and build automation and debugging tools into a single, easily accessible interface.</p><p>Low-code / No-code — These platforms enable user-facing applications to be quickly designed/deployed entirely via drag-and-drop interfaces. Companies like <a href="https://www.settlemint.com/?hsLang=en">Settlemint</a> provide developers with smart contract templates for NFTs to prevent web3 developers from having to reinvent the&nbsp;wheel.</p><p>Index &amp; query — Data indexers help people locate and access specific data within an underlying database. In Web2, Google search is the most popular data indexing service that allows users to query data stored in online databases with sub-second response times. In Web3, decentralized indexing services are emerging to help app developers fetch, process, and query blockchain data. <a href="https://thegraph.com/en/">The Graph Protocol</a>*, <a href="https://www.covalenthq.com/">Covalent</a>*, and <a href="https://coherent.sh/">Coherent</a>* all provide APIs for extracting and making use of data from decentralized data storage providers and EVM-compatible blockchains.</p><p>Test, simulate, &amp; monitor — It’s important to test and simulate web3 applications before they’re released into the wild. Companies like <a href="https://tenderly.co/">Tenderly</a>* and <a href="https://www.kurtosis.com/">Kurtosis</a>* offer a variety of tools for simulating how smart contracts and transactions will behave once live, as well as tools for debugging any issues. <a href="https://www.blocknative.com/">Blocknative</a>* provides dashboards and tools for monitoring transactions before they are submitted on-chain.</p><p>Security &amp; audit — Given the potential for smart contract exploits, these platforms let developers apply security and audit best practices to their applications. <a href="https://www.openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a>, <a href="https://forta.org/">Forta</a>*, <a href="https://www.certik.com/">Certik</a>*, and <a href="https://www.certora.com/">Certora</a>* all provide a variety of services, frameworks, and monitoring tools for developers to mitigate potential security risks and vulnerabilities.</p><p>Messaging — Web3 apps often involve sending various communications to end users. For example, a crypto wallet may want to push a user alerts regarding transaction confirmations. Companies like <a href="https://xmtp.com/">XMTP Labs</a>* and <a href="https://epns.io/">EPNS</a> are building secure messaging protocols and decentralized communication networks that drive user engagement and power these notifications within Web3 applications.</p><p>Analytics — There’s a host of platforms and services that let developers explore, analyze, extract, and visual blockchain data. <a href="https://dune.com/browse/dashboards">Dune</a>*, <a href="https://www.nansen.ai/">Nansen</a>*, and <a href="https://messari.io/">Messari</a>* each offer a variety of APIs and reporting capabilities to build data visualization features within web3 apps. <a href="https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/">Flipside Crypto</a>* offers SDKs (software development kits) and APIs to create and share data insights on various crypto projects.</p><p>App Enablement Layer</p><p>The application enablement layer ties all of the above layers into specific web3 uses. NFTs, DAOs, DeFi, and gaming each have their own bespoke developer solutions.</p><p>NFT focused tools offer infrastructure for creating and managing NFT assets. DAO tools offer solutions for DAO creation (<a href="https://syndicate.io/">Syndicate</a>*, <a href="https://samudai.xyz/">Samudai</a>*), governance (<a href="https://snapshot.org/#/">Snapshot</a>*), and treasury management (<a href="https://www.utopialabs.com/">Utopia Labs</a>*). DeFi focused tools offer APIs that let developers access various DeFi primitives. Gaming focused tools ( <a href="https://www.venly.io/">Venly</a>*, <a href="https://www.onjoyride.com/">Joyride</a>*, <a href="https://horizon.io/">Horizon Blockchain Games</a>*) provide solutions for creating virtual worlds and blockchain based&nbsp;games.</p><p>The ever-evolving dev&nbsp;stack</p><p>The protocols, infrastructure, and developer tools mentioned above make up the nascent, yet evolving web3 developer stack. The modular and interoperable nature of web3 means that the stack can be combined in endless ways to create new and interesting applications.</p><p>While the framework and layers we highlighted will likely remain unchanged, we continue to see new developer tooling primitives emerge and expect the entire stack to evolve dramatically in the coming&nbsp;years.</p><p>Coinbase Ventures will continue to invest in the next generation of platform and developer tooling that will ultimately onboard millions of developers into web3. If you’re as dedicated to building out the web3 dev stack as we are, we would love to hear from you — <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathankingvc">JK’s DMs are&nbsp;open!</a></p><p>Further Reading</p>  <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-simple-guide-to-the-web3-stack-785240e557f0">A simple guide to the Web3 stack</a>, by Angie Wang, Connor Dempsey, and Justin&nbsp;Mart  <a href="https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d">Electric Capital Developer Report 2021</a>, by Electric&nbsp;Capital  <a href="https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/the-architecture-of-a-web-3-0-application">The Architecture of a Web 3.0 application</a>, by Preethi Kasireddy  <p>This website does not disclose material nonpublic information pertaining to Coinbase or Coinbase Venture’s portfolio companies.</p><p>Disclaimer: The opinions expressed on this website are those of the authors who may be associated persons of Coinbase, Inc., or its affiliates (“Coinbase”) and who do not represent the views, opinions and positions of Coinbase.

<p></p><p>On August 26th, we hosted an exciting AMA session at Panther Protocol’s Telegram group chat. This AMA featured Mike Chan (Head of Marketing), DeFinci, and Andrew Zaichenko (both Product Managers), answering live and pre-submitted questions from Panther’s followers. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Below you can read our transcript for the event. Also note that, although they share the same title, DeFinci is mostly focused on Interchain work, while Andrew is primarily dedicated to Advanced Staking.<br></p><p>The transcript starts here:<br></p> What is the status of Advanced Staking, and how did the testing rounds go? <br> <p>Andrew:</p><p>We have a 100% functional product, which passed multiple internal test cycles. The latest updates were about implementing a mutable staking time and NFT-functionalities (with no UI yet). <br></p><p>There have been three separate workflows within Advanced Staking development: <br></p>  Addressing audit recommendations: The team received the results of the audit, addressed its recommendations, and provided feedback during the current week. As with every audit taking itself seriously, this process entails multiple feedback and change rounds before arriving at a final version.<br>  Resolving final tasks from the backend/contracts side: Numerous items informed by testing and internal work.<br>  Updating the UI's design to look beautiful while remaining functional. These products are a gateway into Panther's v1, so we want to make the UX feel as much as possible as the first version of the protocol.<br>  <p>The team's current key focus in terms of Advanced Staking is auditing. Implementation of audit results will enhance the product and unblock further iterations. <br></p> What’s the status of your progress when it comes to interchain features? This kind of feature is core to the protocol, so it’d be great to know what’s going on there. <br> <p>DeFinci:</p><p>I would say that MASPs are the core feature of the Panther Protocol. The Interchain Mechanism is a horizontal scaling architecture that would, in time, be the backbone of the Panther Ecosystem and drive the private communication between blockchains and dApps.<br></p><p>To emphasize how serious we take Interchain for anyone who just joined the ranks of Panther Protocol, here's what I can say. The world of blockchains is architecturally transparent, and there is a need for a solution that preserves the privacy of token transfers between different ecosystems. With private interchain transfers, we aim to solve the default transparency of blockchains, giving users a right to privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.<br></p><p>So far, we’ve identified the most appropriate liquidity approach to reduce the latency of token delivery from one blockchain to another, guaranteeing a higher rate of anonymity. Liquidity is the backbone of each successful interchain mechanism, and we take it very seriously. By design, everyone participating in MASPs will be appropriately rewarded depending on the demand and supply between multiple blockchains.<br></p> Panther takes compliance very seriously, unlike other players on the field. Do you see this as a competitive advantage or a drawback?<br> <p>Mike:</p><p>We’ve been serious about compliance from the very beginning, and in light of recent events, we’ve been proven to be correct. So we definitely see this as a competitive advantage.<br></p><p>We believe in the tenets of decentralization and permissionlessness that DeFi provides and, of course, the freedoms that privacy provides. But we also understand the regulatory environment and that DeFi won’t be left alone to run wild. <br></p><p>Regulators are here. They mean well, more are coming, and DeFi protocols must address that. And the tools we are building will help them do so and allow institutions to have a path towards compliance in DeFi and crypto.<br></p> Is Panther fast-tracking any compliance features in light of recent events?<br> <p>DeFinci:</p><p>We had multiple brainstorming sessions to design features that would solve various mass market problems. As it stands now, we will prioritize our approach toward disclosures and compliance with each new feature released within the Panther ecosystem. <br></p><p>We have been focusing on disclosures of token ownership and shielded transfers within Multi-Asset Shielded Pools and, later on, an audit trail with the release of Interchain Transfers. There are a lot more things that we are designing behind the scenes and consulting with lawyers closely following recent events that we can’t yet talk about.<br></p> Does the Panther Protocol have enough resources to sustain itself during a bear market?<br> <p>Mike:</p><p>Definitely. Every project’s token Treasury took a hit during this bear market. But we raised a good chunk of money through our Private and Public Sales and received a few grants from Layer-1s to integrate with their networks. So we’re in a good spot. <br></p><p>We’re still recruiting developers and engineers, as you may see in posts on social networks because we’ve got a lot to build. We’re also being smart with our budgets, cutting costs where we can, and spending on things we believe will give us a good return. <br></p><p>The bottom line is we are in an excellent position to weather the bear market and come out stronger on the other side.<br></p> Can you share what Panther is building with Flare? Any information about the partnership? Anything to do with the Flare/Songbird network?<br> <p>DeFinci:</p><p>We've done one round of deployment and testing so far with the Songbird network. There is further testing in progress, and once that's concluded, we will share it with the community in a formal report.<br></p><p>In the meantime, we would like to mention that we are thankful for the grant from Flare, and we are looking forward to their network being a part of the Panther Ecosystem. Both our projects are aligned in more than one way in our ideals.<br></p><p>Andrew:<br></p><p>We find Flare as a great project to cooperate with. Our team has been investigating the current state of the network and its technical possibilities. As of now, we've clarified that: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>  Cryptographic contracts exist on the chain, and we have deployed Panther's contracts there.  Subgraph itself does not support the network. Therefore, we need to host the subgraph node on our server.  A Gnosis Safe instance does not exist on the network,  Flare does not have a bridge to move messages from ETH to Flare.<br>  <p>We are in touch with an excellent Flare team and looking forward to developing our cooperation!<br></p> What are your next steps toward decentralization?<br> <p>Mike:</p><p>The first thing I'll say is that decentralization is an ongoing process that we're constantly thinking about. We're starting small and then iterating on that.</p><p>Some of the things we have in the works include:<br></p>  Creating a forum that allows all of us as a community to bring up, discuss, and debate topics about the protocol and its development. This could include technical, community, or marketing topics. This protocol was launched in a fully decentralized way, and we want everything we do to be as decentralized as possible.  Using this forum as a tool, we're creating a process for community members to be able to pitch Panther Improvement Proposals or PIPs. In the past, PIPs were put up on Snapshot with voting as the only way for the community to express their opinions. This will definitely change, and the community will have a much greater voice in the direction of the protocol.  Down the road, we're talking grants so community members can help build and grow the protocol, changing our corporate structure to ensure we're sufficiently decentralized, and much more. <br>  <p>Andrew:<br></p><p>I would add that the product team has been analyzing a decentralized way of voting function realization. Snapshot (which we have been using) is a good tool and has brought a lot of value to the crypto world and Panther. However, it is still representative of off-chain voting. This has specific risks, which can be mitigated using an on-chain voting attitude only. Any other intermediary actor/system is a potential point of failure. The target is to reach more independence and develop a self-sustainable ecosystem for the users and the community. &nbsp;<br></p> What are the main challenges when it comes to building a MASP?<br> <p>Andrew:<br></p><p>The accuracy one needs to craft real privacy. Here's how accurate the MASP's development must be to protect your privacy: <br></p><p>Digital activity produces digital footprints. E.g., any of your transactions (both of crypto and non-crypto nature) creates a footprint. In the case of decentralized tech, this footprint is immutable and publicly accessible. Now, guess: what data can potentially damage privacy? In-protocol rewards are a non-obvious yet easily-exploitable case. This is not intuitive, but we realized it within our work and have taken measures against it.<br></p><p>Why are rewards problematic? Well, because they need to be appropriately rounded. A number with no rounding produces a unique digital footprint - a decimal footprint. But even after cutting the decimal footprint, there still is a binary footprint, which must be addressed. <br></p><p>There are only two levels of privacy - 0% and 100%. This needs a lot of mastery, a ton of attention to detail, and patience while crafting it brick by brick carefully to be able to hunt the threats mentioned above/vulnerabilities. <br></p> What is the vital difference between the Panther protocol and Aleph Zero?<br> <p>Mike:</p><p>Let’s start with the similarities. We are both privacy-focused and use zero-knowledge proofs to maintain this privacy. <br></p><p>The biggest difference is that AZERO is a Layer 1, and we are not. This creates a completely different use case and market for each of us. Aleph will try to create an Ethereum-like ecosystem that’s based on their private contracts, we aim to interconnect different chains privately so that DeFi can happen privately and with interoperability. Overall, we’re pretty different.</p> <br>About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>I’ve been working for the past month or so to wrap my head around bio-geochemistry, radio-ecology, and complexity theory. During that time a collaboration I’d had with Raul Diego at Silicon Icarus transitioned, which I am chalking up to a cyclical communication failure, which unfortunately is not uncommon in these challenging digital waters. That situation led me to revisit “green” impact finance at the University of Pennsylvania, my alma mater, and discover new, unsettling things about the “just transition” and plans for next-gen modular nuclear energy that surprise, surprise will also serve as factories that will produce “medical” isotopes for the Human+ transition. You can read the piece <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/08/28/upenns-nuclear-green-syn-bio-blockchain-web-of-impact-and-leaving-silicon-icarus/">here</a>. I did a read aloud of it yesterday and attempted to clarify my position to set Raul’s mind at ease that my pursuing my own course of research was not meant as an attack on his important project, Silicon Icarus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, I’d heard from some folks that they would like for me to read some of my longer posts, because it is more convenient to listen to them while they are driving or doing housework / errands, etc. I kind of resisted at first, but honestly, it’s not a bad idea. In fact, I’d like to go back and re-read my early work on education as I think much of this is coming to pass now and invite people to comment with updated links showing how my predictions are all coming out into the open. Because my wireless connection isn’t great, I recorded the audio separately and actually set up a podcast format. It’s very basic, but it’s a start. If you want to check out things I post there, here’s the <a href="https://anchor.fm/alison-mcdowell">link</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I’d love some help thinking through this, because I believe I’m really onto something. Look at the screenshots that follow – circles, circles, circles. These circles are mathematically imposed and seek to remove or at least dampen the “chaos” of nature, replacing an open system of harmonized cycles – the symphony of the cosmos – with some sort of neutered, synthetic homeostasis. Contrast the image below, the placenta as the sacred tree of life, with the featured one above. Are we so enslaved to scientism that we will stand idly by as evolutionary algorithms supersede the womb?</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Lazslo-World-Homeostat-Peace-Bahai.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p>The first excerpt is from a talk given by Ervin Laszlo to the Baha’i in 1989 about global peace and convergence with “unity through diversity.” The second is from the paper I shared about complexity theory in Neal Stephenson’s sci-fi books touching on the emergence of life from non-life at the edge where order meets chaos. This is needed for ready access to stored energy to catalyze random molecules into novel bio-geochemical patterns that can hold and maintain their new form. It sounds similar to what I described at Southern Virginia University talking about science-fiction author Orson Scott Card’s theory of philotic twining.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This leads me to wonder about the push for cybernetic society. Is their closed-loop system of circles an attempt to delineate “order” from “chaos,” while engineering catalytic edge environments suited to their enhanced evolutionary plans? I’d guess it goes back to Ouroboros. Is the energy currency programmable money? Is, perhaps, the method of transfer being woven into our very biology through nanotechnology? Are we talking a new form of ecological economics with interspecies currency based on our metabolisms tracked through radioactive isotopes? Is that why we are seeing so many “hack your metabolism apps flooding our consciousness now?</p>

<p>When reading Laszlo’s quote, I can’t help thinking of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and his idea that “world peace” was necessary for the convergence. I suspect “peace” and “harmony” are going to be incorporated into the branding of the cybernetic global control grid. Remaking global economies along the lines of “sustainable” doughnuts double the edges. “The edge of chaos is where new ideas and innovative genotypes are forever nibbling away at the edges of the status quo, and where even the most entrenched old guard will be overthrown.” So much chaos, most of it manufactured. This is part of the pulsing program towards emergence.</p>
 
 
 
 
  
 <a href="https://www.aihr.com/blog/diversity-equity-inclusion-belonging-deib/">Source</a> 
 
 
 
 Is this planned doughnut economy (torus) and smart mega-city regionalism meant to incubate loosely structured, “decentralized” energy exchanges that maximize the edges described? To turn a non-life information system into a sentient entity? Maybe that’s what Oliver Reiser was talking about in the “World Sensorium”? Is it an Egregore seeking to usurp the sacred noosphere? Is it an emergent energetic parasite trying to leverage life as an armature to join the living? When you watch the clip with the rat in the torus, note that he is “illuminated.” Remember the metabolism hacking app is called Lumen.

<p>I see Laszlo using the term “parametric” like the parametric insurance Jason and Leo and I&nbsp; will be discussing in an upcoming podcast. How better to control populations within the cybernetic matrix than by systematically disrupting living conditions, including access to basic necessities like water and shelter and food? They are cultivating mass dispossession, which I wrote about in my series on cyber-physical systems and refugee encampments.&nbsp; Governments and defense contractors and telecom interests are able to monitor and influence weather outcomes. Somehow I feel like the weather derivatives and these new parametric&nbsp; insurance products are important tools they plan to use to run us as puppets in order to generate their desired hyper-cycles.</p>

<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-admin/upload.php?item=13433">Source</a></p>
<p>Note that Cambridge is also where they are monitoring crypto currency energy data. I believe this is to set up futures markets in “just transition” with inflated baselines, but also the energetic control grid will be key in catalyzing new forms of “life” for information fields – the injection or pulsing of energy?</p>
<p>That feels like the dual use of the concept of “parametric” as in insurance. It is the pulsing, the controlled management of information fields whether it be information warfare, supply chain scarcity, weather, currency exchange – that is the trigger point. Managing the “current” to use existing life forms to create “life” from “non-life.” It is also a technique by which to derive isotopes! Unbelievable.</p>

<p>It also makes me think about the push for holons and the promotion of decentralized nodes as optimal – that by creating many, many circles they exponentially expand the edges they have and the potential for emergent behavior, right? I’ve included some mapping I’ve done in that regard linking gestalt to management theory to social impact investing and the Earth as spaceship metaphor. There is a large map and a smaller one, but you can click through and explore beyond the edges using the links provided.</p>

<p>Also, the concepts of hormesis and hopeful monsters – that low-level stress causes changes that lead to evolutionary adaptation. What if ongoing austerity and UBI and managed scarcity are some attempt at a social science of hormesis? What if the subscription renter economy is actually social hormesis? And that by putting UBI on blockchain it will transmit the dynamic pattern of behaviors out to the edge of chaos in a way that allows information yet non-living to continue its progression towards self-organization and “life”?</p>
<p>For me the mechanical / engineered emergence from computers is a parallel to natural life and embryology, the fear of which is perhaps personified in the Vagina Dentata, first popularized by the writings of enlightenment philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg. The family of Andrew Carnegie were members of Swedenborg’s Church of the New Jerusalem in Pittsburgh as well as the Pitcairn family who brought his papers to the Delaware Valley and built a vast cathedral at Bryn Athyn in his honor. I paid a visit to set an intention for healing there in the early spring, leaving one of my felt mothers in a niche in the base of a tree on the hillside.</p>

<p>In recent weeks I and other women with whom I’ve been working have found stumbling blocks thrown across our paths as we get deeper into the labyrinth and closer to the truth of the matter. I really think that innate intuition is important and perhaps inclined to the feminine side, which can trigger intense pushback from data rationalists and lead others to sow confusion to direct us away from the path we are meant to be on. We don’t need numbers to do this work, though it does get lonely. We just need a few people to who can get to the center while holding onto our clarity and moral compass. Once there, maybe we can unlock something that will help ameliorate this ongoing psychic wound and find the way back out without getting stuck in the hamster wheel virtual torus.</p>

  zkEVM technology seems like a potential solution to the blockchain scalability problem. Here’s how it works:

<p>We’ve come a long way from smart contracts to sidechains and rollups before reaching zkEVM technology as the potential solution to the blockchain scalability problem.<br></p><p>This problem has been at the core of most of the blockchain innovation we’ve seen in the past couple of years. Without sacrificing decentralization (a trade-off most L1 blockchains make to scale faster), the current state of blockchain technology simply cannot support applications that reach mass adoption. Because of this, scaling remains in the center of most current blockchain discussions.<br></p> Blockchain scalability nightmares<br> <p>As you can likely recall, Ethereum network users &nbsp;had crushing experiences on-chain during the <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/358661">DeFi Summer</a> and crypto boom between 2020 and 2021. Gas fees soared to previously unimaginable heights, with network congestion becaming a frequent occurrence. &nbsp;Most importantly, these cycles of network congestion and soaring gas fees keep repeating themselves with every hype cycle, from Crypto Kitties to ICOs, NFTs, DeFi yield farming and dramatic.<br></p>Ethereum network average transaction fees through hype cycles. (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum/chart/txn-fee-avg">Source</a>)<p>Of course, with the risk of fees sky-rocketting after the release of every successful project (which in turn hurts its potential continued success), the incentive to develop and launch a product for a mass market suffers. From rollups to sidechains, various solutions have been built atop the Ethereum network to solve this issue.<br></p><p>Each of the above solution promises to result in lower gas fees and higher network throughput. However, out of all them, rollups can be said to be one of the most promising scaling solutions for Ethereum. Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism are popular today because they successfully became scalable blockchain layers built atop Ethereum. Zero-knowledge rollups, on the other hand, are fractionally less popular, but many see them as the holy grail of Ethereum scalability.<br></p><p>Let’s take a quick dive into ZK-rollups, as understanding them is vital to wrap your head around zkEVMs.<br></p> What’s unique about ZK-rollups?<br> <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">ZK-rollups</a> are unique in that they execute transactions faster than their optimistic neighbors because they do not have to use the delay period mechanism that optimistic rollups adopted. Instead, ZK-rollups generate <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/">cryptographic</a> proofs that verify that their transactions, usually in a batch, were genuine, valid, and completed in accordance with the base layer’s protocol. <br></p><p>ZK-rollups also cost far less in terms of gas fees because they do not have to post all transaction data back to Ethereum, only their proof. Sometimes, a proof can prove other proofs, saving additional block space. Yet, few ZK-rollups could do more than simple transactions (token transfers, atomic swaps, etc.). In the past, those that can support smart contract deployment usually required their developers to depart from the Ethereum framework, as existings ZK-rollups were not EVM (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>)-compatible.<br></p><p>All of this is changing now. In such a short while, developers in the ZK-rollup ecosystem have made giant strides towards building ZK-rollups that are equally compatible with the EVM.<br></p><p>The EVM is a virtual component that is contained in every Ethereum node which takes in smart contracts (usually written in high-level languages like Solidity) and converts them into EVM bytecode. ZK-rollups with EVM-compatibility require a code execution environment that supports EVM bytecode, therefore enabling Ethereum developers to migrate their smart contracts from Ethereum to rollups without having to write code from scratch. <br></p><p>These specific type of rollups are called zkEVMs...</p> So, what is a zkEVM? <p>In full, zkEVM means “zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine”. They aim to replicate the Ethereum environment as a rollup, allowing developers to build on them like they would on Ethereum.<br></p><p>A zkEVM is a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">zero-knowledge rollup</a> with the goal of bringing the Ethereum experience fully to Layer-2 blockchains without losing the advantages of rollups. Thanks to this, developers would not need to change their code or abandon their EVM tools (and smart contracts) when writing or porting smart contracts to more scalable solutions that preserve the decentralization and security of L1s.</p> How does a zkEVM work? <p>zkEVMs are no different from ZK-rollups, only an upgrade to them. <br></p><p>zkEVMs follow the general workings of zero-knowledge rollups. However, it is essential to note that several ideas surround the ideal structure of a zkEVM and its operations. The truest form of zkEVMs would be fully <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-rollup-race-true-zkevm-113000293.html">Ethereum-equivalent</a>, allowing no changes even if they could make proof generation any easier.<br></p><p>Zero-knowledge rollups take and complete transactions off-chain, in batches, and submit a cryptographic report that proves the correctness of these interactions to Ethereum. The zero-knowledge proof does not reveal the details of all the transactions in the batch, but only confirms that they are accurate enough to trigger a transition to the Ethereum state.<br></p><p>To understand how zkEVMs work, we must acknowledge that they are of different types, as shown by the projects currently in the works. Although they all share common goals, they differ in approach.<br></p><p><a href="http://vitalik.ca">Vitalik Buterin</a>, Ethereum's founder, <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html">attempted to group</a> zkEVMs into four types and a fifth. Here's his summary of the types of zkEVMs:<br></p>zkEVM types comparison by Vitalik. (<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html">Source</a>) Type-1 zkEVMs: fully equivalent to Ethereum <p>zkEVM Type-1s are expected to be fully equivalent to Ethereum, with no changes made to their state or transaction trees, hash codes, or any other logic within their consensus. Type-1 zkEVMs will be fully compatible with all Ethereum-native applications but require more prover time, as no unique reworking is done to make proof generation faster.</p> Type-2 zkEVMs: EVM (not Ethereum) equivalence <p>Type-2 zkEVMs will lower the bar a little, aiming for EVM-equivalence instead of Ethereum-equivalence. zkEVM Type-2s would look like Ethereum on the outside but will have slight modifications on the inside to facilitate development and speed up proof generation. <br></p><p>In this kind of rollups, a few applications may be incompatible. However, type-2 zkEVMs will still suffer slower prover times. Type-2.5 zkEVMs could therefore improve prover time by increasing gas costs.</p> Type-3 zkEVMs: departing from EVM <p>zkEVM Type-3s would not be fully EVM-equivalent as this type prioritizes the ease of placing an EVM-like system within ZK-rollups. This involves specific changes to make building easier and improve proof generation. While Type-3 zkEVMs could be compatible with most applications, some of them may require rewriting.</p> Type-4 zkEVMs: close cousins to the EVM <p>zkEVM Type-4s would be equivalent to high-level languages only, not the EVM itself. Skipping the process of providing zero-knowledge proofs for each stage of EVM execution would therefore reduce costs and encourage <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">decentralization</a>, as well as improve proof-generation time.<br></p><p>However, this would make Type-4 zkEVMs less compatible with several applications. Contract addresses will most likely change when moving applications to the EVM, and it will be impossible to carry over several debugging infrastructures.<br></p> Notes on zkEVM categories<br> <p>In the future, Ethereum will undergo changes that will make it more <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies/">ZK-SNARK</a>-friendly. These changes will likely upgrade any zkEVM that falls into either of these categories, which means that the categorization scheme here is not absolute. This, as Buterin points out, merely represents a system to reflect the practical difference of real-world products into an intuitive framework.</p> Top contenders for the zkEVM race <p>Mere months ago, many thought zkEVMs were years away from becoming functional, but several projects have begun to make considerable headway in their development. Recent social media announcements have added to the hype around the next big thing in crypto, and some of the top names in the space are in a symbolic race to launch the first zkEVM. <br></p><p>Here are some of the top contenders to the zkEVM race:</p> Polygon Hermez <p>In 2021, Polygon completed the $250 million purchase of the Hermez Network. The company launched its ZK-rollup solution, <a href="https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-hermez/">Polygon Hermez</a>, in mid-2022. Then, in July 2022, Polygon announced they were building a zkEVM, rebranding the Polygon Hermez project to <a href="https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-zkevm/">Polygon zkEVM</a>.<br></p><p>Polygon adopted the Type-2 zkEVM approach, aiming to be EVM-equivalent but falling short of Ethereum-equivalence. Polygon zkEVM's makeup will require developers to adapt code and EVM tools to the ZK-rollup. Polygon expects its zkEVM to reach 2000 transactions per second and cut transaction costs by up to ninety percent. A public Testnet is also in the works.</p> zkSync <p><a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync</a> adopts the Type-4 approach, supporting compatibility with Solidity and Vyper, Ethereum's coding languages. zkSync 1.0 is already live, having processed about four million transactions. zkSync’s new product, zkSync 2.0, will be powered by a zkEVM, although it falls under EVM compatibility rather than EVM equivalence.<br></p><p>Within zkSync, developers will be able to write Solidity smart contracts, which the protocol will transpile into Yul, another programming language it understands. As a Type-4 zkEVM, zkSync 2.0 experienced quicker proving times but suffers from less application compatibility than its competitors. zkSync 2.0 is currently live on the Ethereum Testnet.</p> StarkNET <p>While most zkEVM projects use <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">ZK-SNARKs</a>, Starkware's StarkNET adopts <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/">ZK-STARKs</a>, which are more secure than ZK-SNARKs in theory but require more gas, take longer to verify, and occupy more block space. <a href="https://starkware.co/starknet/">StarkNET</a> has already launched its Alpha version, although it remains limited.<br></p><p>StarkNET, like zkSync 2.0, follows the Type-4 zkEVM approach, which categorizes it as compatible with Solidity or high-level languages. The rollup uses Nethermind's Warp, a transpiler that translates Solidity to Cairo, StarkNET's programming language, to support smart contract deployment. The drawbacks of Type-4 zkEVMs will limit StarkNET.</p> Scroll <p>In collaboration with the <a href="https://appliedzkp.org/">Privacy and Scaling Explorations</a> group, which is part of the Ethereum Foundation, <a href="https://scroll.io/">Scroll</a> is building a zkEVM solution that angles towards the Type-2 zkEVM class, like Polygon zkEVM. The project is in its pre-alpha stage and is inviting developers and testers to battle-test the network.<br></p><p>Scroll's architecture is similar to that of Polygon zkEVM, but it has a high composability capability, making it less performance-wise compared to zkSync 2.0, Polygon zkEVM, and StarkNET. Scroll aims to build the first genuinely EVM-equivalent zkEVM and prioritize security and transparency.<br></p><p>The Privacy and Scaling Explorations group is also building and doing extensive research into the zero-knowledge EVM concept. Their solution leans towards that Type-1 zkEVM class, although there are no concrete announcements yet.</p> The race to build the first zkEVM: Polygon vs. Scroll vs. zkSync <p>Polygon, Scroll, and zkSync recently separately declared that they were building the world's first truly EVM-equivalent zkEVM. The separate declarations have been interpreted as a race, a healthy competitive environment for true innovation to thrive.<br></p>Top contenders of the zkEVM race. (<a href="https://mirror.xyz/msfew.eth/Yl64OK3lLG48eJpVB3GxqFEhmWOm6yMlAo9sc1VrQP4">Source</a>)<p>An uproar greeted the announcements on Twitter. However, it is essential to note that these solutions are different from one another, although none is exactly superior. Here's how they compare to one another, with respect to their core technology, benefits, and limitations:</p> The present state of the zkEVM ecosystem and timelines <p>While developers and stakeholders inclined toward <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-crypto-projects-bitcoin-competitors-or-not/">privacy</a> and scalability may buzz due to the latest zkEVM announcements, most projects are still far frpm launching finished products. <br></p><p>StarkNET is the only zkEVM that has launched its Alpha, while Polygon only has a Testnet open. Scroll's private Testnet is open, with a public Testnet in the works. zkSync 2.0 is live on the Ethereum Testnet, but nothing concrete may happen till Q4 2022 and all through 2023.<br></p><p>Q3 and Q4 2022 should see some progress from Scroll and StarkNET. In 2023, we expect public alpha launches from most zkEVM projects. However, going live is not the only challenge. <br></p><p>True Ethereum-equivalence is still a long way off, as even genuine EVM-equivalence is yet to be achieved. Changes in Ethereum will help zkEVMs cover more ground, and gradual improvements will follow after most projects launch.</p> Conclusion <p>zkEVMs are a welcome development in the crypto space, solving the Ethereum scalability problem like regular ZK-rollups while supporting smart contract deployment and application compatibility. <br></p><p>As projects like Scroll, Polygon, and zkSync race towards launching their zkEVM products, we expect widespread adoption and increased relevance as they soothe a sore pain point in the blockchain world. It’s also worth noting that zkEVMs are still a work in progress and that the pace of innovation in Web3 makes it practically impossible to predict the future. <br></p><p>We might stumble upon more use-cases of zkEVMs and zero-knolwedge proofs in the coming years beyond scalability and privacy, but we should also not discard the solution to blockchain scalability originating from a completely unexpected place.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Tl;dr: The following post recaps this episode of Coinbase’s <a href="https://youtu.be/GUhDXUA4mfQ">Around The Block podcast</a> in which Viktor Bunin hosts Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin discuss decentralization, privacy, and a credibly neutral Ethereum.</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/ViktorBunin">Viktor Bunin</a>, Senior Protocol Specialist at Coinbase&nbsp;Cloud</p><p>After 7 years of research and development, the Merge is just around the corner. A crowning achievement, the Merge will finally transition Ethereum from Proof-of-work (PoW) to Proof-of-stake (PoS).</p><p>I encourage everyone to listen to the whole episode, but I wanted to take this opportunity to pull out what I believe are the key messages to take away from the conversation between two industry&nbsp;giants.</p>  The transition to PoS wasn’t immediately obvious. As Vitalik put it, even if the idea can be scary as if it’s a pond filled with sharks, once you figure the sharks out, you at least know what you’re going up against, which makes it possible to deal with the&nbsp;problem.  Scientists and engineers are equally needed. Incredible researchers, like Vitalik, do the tough work of pushing the envelope on what’s possible, but it’s up to the builders to then take the baton, commercialize the products, and bring the technology to millions of&nbsp;users.  Good times create centralized projects. Bull markets tilt the scale from principles to expediency until a bear market tilts them back. The reality is that principles aren’t just principles, they result in decisions that keep projects secure and mindsets that keep builders building.  Decentralization is vital low in the stack. If the foundational layer breaks or is corrupted, everything built on top of it breaks as&nbsp;well.  Ethereum is more robust and decentralized on PoS. Anyone can spin up an Ethereum validator anywhere in the world with much less capital and technical skills compared to mining. All you need is a computer with an internet connection.  Ethereum will continue decentralizing its infrastructure operations. Proposer-Builder Separation will take away a validator’s ability to express a preference over the contents of the blocks they create, making censorship at the block level impossible.  OFAC took its first action involving DeFi. The recent Tornado Cash action is the first time OFAC has sanctioned a technology (smart contract) and it has raised questions with many groups (CoinCenter, EFF, CCI, etc.) about whether this was an overstep of OFAC’s authority.  Coinbase prioritizes and supports decentralization for Ethereum’s base layer. As mentioned earlier, decentralization is vital low in the stack, and there’s nothing lower than Ethereum’s base layer. In the hypothetical scenario where Coinbase is forced to censor, we would rather wind down our staking operation to preserve the integrity of the overall&nbsp;network.  Privacy is solvable. We can solve swaths of the challenges with privacy through technological solutions that enable user privacy while minimizing privacy for criminals.  We need to build the future we want to see. You need to make “stuff!” It doesn’t just magically appear. Decentralized identity must be created, it won’t spawn into being just because crypto becomes successful.  Values and culture must be cultivated. Whether the community is centralized or decentralized, it’s crucial for leaders to set and encourage cultural alignment around a set of values. Without cultivation, undesirable characteristics may rise and cause community fragmentation.  Crypto is global. The world is moving towards a global mindset and crypto is already there. One way in which Coinbase is adopting this mindset is by supporting global apps like Coinbase&nbsp;Wallet.  There are still unsolved problems.

   From developing a repeatable, strategic process and continuously working to identify ways to improve it, founders can take a number of steps to build a culture of recruiting. Sometimes, that means hiring a dedicated talent-sourcing and recruiting team. Glen Evans and Dwane Hamilton of Greylock's talent team discuss why, how, and when startups should think about working with recruiters.

<p>Nicholas Berggruen courted Robert Hertzberg in 2010 to join his campaign to begin to “fix” California’s governance problems while staking out a leadership role for the state in shaping the public imaginary as the Metaverse becomes manifest. It was the perfect task for a land of wine, citrus, and silicon built on mythic stories.</p>
<p>In California, material excess and entertainment have proven capable of deftly cloaking high-tech military R&amp;D and psychological operations, though after two years of draconian measures it’s getting decidedly harder to maintain the fiction. According to <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/the-freethinking-homeless-billionaire-and-the-flat-broke-state-44858">a 2017 feature</a> by Joe Matthews in Pacific Standard,&nbsp; the two men bonded on a plane flight from Panama to California geeking out over a shared love of policy. Nicholas launched the Berggruen Institute in 2010 as a home for the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Think_Long_Committee_for_California">Think Long Committee for California</a>.</p>

<p>Hertzberg was one of sixteen tapped by billionaire financier / aspirational philosopher king Nicholas Berggruen in 2011 to develop a “<a href="https://36z59wriv543qd814533ma8z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Blueprint_to_Renew_ca.pdf">A Blueprint to Renew California</a>.” The document prominently features plans for workforce-aligned education and management of human capital for “future skills.” Though not listed as an official participant, the report states Gavin Newsom, then Lt. Governor, served on the jobs task force. Newsom’s mentor, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, was among those who facilitated preparation of the document. It was a bipartisan effort that included conservatives like Condoleezza Rice and George Schulz; democrats like Gray Davis, Maria Elena Durazo, and Antonia Hernandez; as well as individuals like Eli Broad, Eric Schmidt, and Gerry Parsky who know their way around technology, education, data, and financial markets. It is this document that underlies the Berggruen Institute’s intentions to remake capitalism, democracy, and what it means to be human in a world dominated by artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Such seismic changes hinge on widespread adoption of digital identity, which is what Robert Herzberg’s California Trust Framework legislation will usher in. Mixed reality cannot function unless everything, humans, other animate beings, and inanimate objects can be properly embedded and monitored in the digital landscape. Precision virtual twinning is ready to come off the battlefield and into your kitchen to mitigate climate change – life in the CIA’s real time video game of impact data analytics. I discuss this during a site visit Jason Bosch and I paid to Maxar Geospatial Services in Westminster, CO in April.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity is meant to replace relational trust cultivated among humans in real community with high-speed automated “trust” dispensed through sensor networks. It will usher in new forms of globalized, electrical existence. We will be expected to learn to navigate encoded ephemeral worlds built on military systems where nothing can be taken for granted and anything could be a deception.</p>
<p>It truly is a harrowing prospect, and yet many appear ready to rush headlong into such a future without giving careful consideration as to how the choices we make today, through our actions or inactions, could irreversibly harm future generations and the sibling beings with whom we share the blessings of this earth.</p>
<p>The Trust Framework is your government on a smart phone, vending machine government.</p>
<p>It’s your children assessed as stackable credentials and scored as human capital assets.</p>
<p>It’s conditional cash transfers (UBI) tied to pay for success finance schemes.</p>
<p>It’s electronic health records building out our digital twins for the world simulation.</p>
<p>It’s managed mobility solutions based on identity.</p>
<p>It’s knowledge management tied to reputation scores.</p>
<p>It launches Richard Baldwin’s Globalization 4.0, globotics, where AI reviews skill tokens in learning lockers to decide who can put their mind in a robot for gig work at the lowest wage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHBoxRdd08o&amp;t=0s">Source</a>: Why will future globalization be so different? Richard Baldwin</p>
<p>Those at the top are working overtime to incorporate perpetual-pandemic threat into the “New Normal,” to justify ongoing bio-surveillance measures meant to track and trace us into a cybernetic reality where individuals will be managed as “agents” in a contrived game of “life” to generate impact profits and data to train the blockchain global brain.</p>
<p>I recently finished a read-aloud of San Diego State emeritus math professor and conceptualizer of the Singularity Vernor Vinge’s sci-fi novel “Rainbows End,” set in a near future dystopia of mixed reality where everyone “wears,” their own view of the world even as the actual world falls apart. Vinge finished his Hugo Award-winning book in 2006. At a Comicon festival he admitted that since he writes slowly, it was challenging to keep up with his colleagues in San Diego who were building it all out.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY8ZLjO5u0c&amp;t=1s">Source</a>: The Kollin Brothers Interview Vernor Vinge, 2010</p>
<p>The ongoing nightmare of Manifest Destiny has moved on from Leland Stanford’s railroads to Mark Andreessen’s crypto dystopia where those who seek to advocate for rights to access and preserve the actual material world will be branded as hopelessly naive and “reality privileged,” since Silicon Valley adamantly asserts that racial justice can only be attained in Web 3.0. In a world of 1s and 0s equity data will be accurately collected, used to demonstrate “impact” and siphon profits over to the Impact Management Project partners’ ESG portfolios.</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s not surprising that digital identity in California would surface now. For us to inhabit Vinge’s new imperial realm and interact with augmented reality, we must remain visible and identifiable. In Vinge’s book, the people who were not used to “wearing” had to practice a lot to make their digitally projected avatars appear real. The hardest part was making sure digital feet remained in contact with the ground. But it’s more than just appearances, a person’s past transactions and access credentials must travel with them through smart environments. That is the reason we must be assigned unique digital identifiers.</p>
<p>Once scaled, the California Trust Network will comprise an open-air decentralized carceral state of radical democracy run on conditional tokens. In this brave new world, public services will all be evidence-based, data rich, and linked to global financial schemes. This will be a SMART world where harmonized citizens are monitored for their conformity to the dictates of the Fourth Industrial Revolution overseen from the Presidio, the US headquarters of the World Economic Forum and the first Spanish colonial outpost on the West Coast.</p>

<p>Just beyond the southwestern-most corner of the boundary of Robert Hertzberg’s California Senate District 18 in the East San Fernando Valley, lies 447 acres of ridge line partially situated on a reclaimed landfill. It’s the intended site for a modern monastery, the dream of a billionaire financier turned “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/magazine/nicolas-berggruen-philosophy.html">philosopher king</a>.” A lofty perch from which to spin plans for a disconnected future where physical bodies are confined to structured cells, freeing minds to wander the Noosphere with assistance not from sacred texts or mental discipline, but from haptics and nanotechnology.</p>

<p>Picture the fruit of such ephemeral “labor” deftly harvested by neuro-nanobots and integrated into a Trust Network to train artificial intelligence. Streamlined, interoperable, on-chain tokenized data analyzed, and organized to efficiently stimulate an emergent global brain until, at long last (they hope), the Singularity is achieved. Each mind in each cell no longer acting as vital, autonomous beings with a soul, but as networked neuroblasts anticipating a bizarre metamorphosis for which they were never asked nor were ever consulted. This vision is chillingly described in Oliver Reiser’s 1946 book on radio-eugenics, “World Sensorium.”</p>
<p>The question of the future existence of biological life is central to the investigations of <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/nicolas-berggruen/">Nicholas Berggruen</a> and his collaborators. In 2016, he <a href="https://36z59wriv543qd814533ma8z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/BER_5YearAnniversary_R23_040416_Spreads.pdf">tapped</a> Portuguese-American neuroscientist, Antonio Dimassio, to <a href="https://36z59wriv543qd814533ma8z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/BER_5YearAnniversary_R23_040416_Spreads.pdf">undertake a study</a> laying out what it will mean to be human in an age of artificial intelligence. The irony is that Dimassio, an adjunct faculty at the Salk Institute, directs the <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/bci/">Brain and Creativity Institute</a> at USC. USC is home to the <a href="https://military.usc.edu/research/institute-for-creative-technologies/">Institute of Creative Technologies</a>, where the Army Research Lab has been funding the creation of synthetic humans for over twenty years.</p>
<p>Antonio and his wife Hanna, co-director of the Institute, say they are working to understand the human condition through research into how the brain processes music, organizes narratives, and the nature of consciousness to treat neurological conditions. My feeling, however, is that it’s all dual use technology, much of it federally funded, and the findings will be likely used to make engineered systems function in a way that appears more “natural.” That’s an interesting choice of art behind him, not to mention the composition of the photograph.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2022, Berggruen’s Institute hosted an invitation-only, two-day workshop with USC Dornsife called “<a href="https://www.berggruen.org/wwlb/">What Will Life Become</a>?” Among the questions being considered were:</p>
<p>How will scientists reform expectations of life and personhood in a post-biological world?</p>
<p>How will the extra-planetary recapitulate or stage new social relations, institutions, and politics of earth?</p>
<p>How do novel human/non-human agents (animals, robots) disrupt andro- and anthropocentric hierarchies of species and mind?</p>
<p>How will concepts of indigeneity, race, and ethnicity be shuttled to worlds beyond Earth and times beyond our present?</p>
<p>The vice-chair of digital biology at Singularity University wrote a couple of <a href="https://www.tiffanyvora.com/blog/imagining-what-life-will-become-reading-an-ad-from-the-not-too-distant-future">blog posts</a> about participating in the event. <a href="https://www.tiffanyvora.com/about-tiffany">Tiffany Vora</a>, trained as a computational biologist, incorporates gender and identity into her widely circulated talks. You know women and STEM, right? As a panelist, Vora pitched the idea of a new company to those in attendance, asking them first to understand that biocapitalism was a given in this planned future. Her fictional enterprise, BioFix, would integrate data from your family history to your wearables to your microbiome and then pair your body with synthetic bio-assets. These might include hybrid organs that could unlock novel abilities like breathing underwater or synthetic DNA that, if you pay the up-charge, you can pass on to your children</p>
<p>Now swap out the Marvel superhero lens for a eugenics-body-shaming one and realize this is leveraging manufactured self-loathing into a profitable keeping-up-with-the-Jones’ bio-hacking business sector. Is it any wonder people, especially children, are struggling with their mental health? Those with power and influence are fabricating a reality that will boost identity-based spectacle into the realm of cyborg hybrid existence. Are we ready for fast-fashion to morph into biohacking?</p>

<p>In 2015 Nicholas Berggruen’s Institute began to sponsor fellowships for dozens of independent scholars pursuing research in the United States and China in partnership with Harvard, NYU, Stanford, USC, Oxford, Peking and Tsinghua Universities. The first year it <a href="https://warpweftandway.com/berggruen-fellowship/">solicited</a> “cross-cultural” and “interdisciplinary” proposals from thinkers on the following: the Autonomous Self and the Relational Self; Harmony and Freedom; Equality and Hierarchy; Democracy and Political Meritocracy; Humans and Technology; and Sustainable Innovation. All topics grounded in systems engineering of individuals and societies. There are over <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/group/alumnifellows/">110 alumni</a> of the fellowship program, among them are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/terra-lawson-remer/">Terra Lawson-Remer</a> – social change entrepreneur focused on bio-tech and socio-genomic research, also member of CFR and advisor to the US Treasury Department</p>
<p><a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/stuart-candy/">Stuart Candy</a> – foresight strategist working with the UN, WEF, Ashoka, NASA, JPL, and US Conference of Mayors, Director of <a href="https://situationlab.org/about/">Situation Lab</a> at Carnegie Mellon</p>
<p><a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/marco-ferrante/">Marco Ferrante</a> – scholar of Sanskrit and Indian Philosophy researching metaphysics, language and action in early Brahmanical philosophy, and deontic logic (permissible, forbidden, required)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/gabriel-kahan/">Gabriel Kahan</a> – LA-based artist and technologist working on collective intelligence tied to civic participation and urban design management</p>
<p><a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/michael-a-mccarthy/">Michael McCarthy</a> – Economic Democracy Activist writing “Master’s Tools: Using Finance Against Capitalism”</p>
<p>Last year fifty fellowships were awarded, among them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saule_Omarova">Saule Omarova</a>, a Kazakh-born Cornell Law Professor who specializes in financial regulation and received considerable push-back on her nomination to become Comptroller of the Currency last winter. She’d floated the idea of a “People’s Ledger” where the Federal Reserve could involve itself in consumer banking, which was alarming for many given widespread concerns around Central Digital Currency and programmable money. John Titus gave a helpful breakdown of the issues surrounding Omarova’s nomination, which was later withdrawn at her request, in a December 2021 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DEYl3ryop0">presentation</a>. This is important, because one of the things Berggruen is looking to redesign is nothing short of capitalism itself.</p>

<p>In addition to the fellowships, the Berggruen Prize was instituted in 2016 in the spirit of a Nobel Prize, but for philosophy. A jury selects one individual annually whose body of work has made, according to them, a significant impact on wisdom and understanding the world. That winner is awarded $1 million. The Institute’s new outpost in Venice, Three Eyes Palace, hosted last year’s event. <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/news/annual-berggruen-prize-for-philosophy-culture-awarded-to-public-philosopher-peter-singer/">Peter Singer</a>, an Australian whose work centers “effective altruism” won the prize. How perfect for the new imposed ethos of social impact investing, right?</p>
<a href="https://www.speakart.it/en/a-new-resident-for-the-three-oci-house/">https://www.speakart.it/en/a-new-resident-for-the-three-oci-house/</a>
<p>Prior awards were made to Baroness Onora O’Neill, public discourse; Ruth Bader Ginsberg, gender equality; Martha Nussbaum, social liberalism; Paul Farmer, global health; and Charles Taylor, hermeneutics and social webs of relationship. If you follow my work, you will note how the interests of the winners interlock and align with the roll out of one-world government for the global good, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and blockchain impact finance. All winners are white men and women who hail from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. It’s important to note this not from the standpoint of woke-ness, but from the standpoint of empire and eugenics, both of which factor into the coding of the digital realm and next-gen eugenic efforts framed as precision medicine.</p>
<p>Nicholas Berggruen, the would-be monastic benefactor, grew up steeped in the Parisian modern art scene, made a fortune with his hedge fund rehabilitating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/04/burger-king-relists-tycoon">Burger King</a> among other undervalued companies, went on to study the Hermetica, and now seeks to bridge east and west through a <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/books/redefining-a-philosophy-for-world-governance/">global governance system</a> grounded in non-dualism. Zhao Tingyang, a Berggruen affiliate and member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, lays out a Theory of <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/books/redefining-a-philosophy-for-world-governance/">Tianxia</a>, or “All Under Heaven.” In ancient China the concept embodies a physical, psychological and political convergence towards harmony and a permanent peace. Harmonized digital citizens are the <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/industry-connections/connectivity-harmonization-of-the-digital-citizen/">goal</a> of IEEE.</p>

<p>Berggruen is a suave operator who’s spent the past decade courting G-20 influencers, <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/activity/21st-century-council-meets-with-dr-henry-kissinger-in-new-york/">Henry Kissinger</a>, and <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/activity/chinese-president-xi-jinping-meets-the-21st-century-council-in-beijing/">Xi Jinping</a> to join this effort, he needs an anchor point from which to launch this vision. I believe that intended anchor is California. This planned Trust Network of decentralized ledgers for avatar management must, however, be put in place before digital convergence can commence in earnest.</p>

<p>A dual US-German citizen, Nicholas was raised in France where his father <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/heinz-berggruen-the-collector-who-befriended-picasso-12091-1.aspx">Heinz</a> operated a lucrative book shop and gallery space. Galerie Berggruen and Cie sold modernist prints in the 7th arrondissement two blocks from the Seine. Heinz was an avid collector, and amassed a large personal collection of Picasso, Klee, Matisse and Giacometti. A native of Berlin, he arrived in the United States in 1936 to study art history at Berkeley and married Lillian Zellerbach of the San Francisco paper dynasty. Heinz later worked at the San Francisco Museum of Art, pulling together an exhibit of <a href="https://prabook.com/web/diego.rivera/724522">Rosicrucian</a> painter Diego Rivera’s works while engaging in an affair with Frida Kahlo. I did a couple of interesting presentations on Rivera with the What’s Left? podcast that you can listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENGpfjaZSBE">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsD9PqMaBJw">here</a>.</p>

<p>Heinz was drafted into the <a href="https://needleberlin.com/2010/11/07/the-berggruen-museum/">US Army Signal Corps</a> during World War II and stationed in Europe where his multi-lingual proficiency was valued. Following the war he divorced Lillian and decamped to&nbsp; France, initially landing, as had Caltech’s Frank Malina, at <a href="http://www.icmuseumberggruen.de/en/heinz-berggruen">UNESCO</a>, Julian Huxley’s <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000068197">project</a>, before establishing the gallery that would bring him into contact with the most prominent figures in European Cubism, Futurism, Expressionism, and Dada. Picasso was a close friend.</p>

<p>Heinz’s three other children all have ties to the art world. <a href="http://www.helenberggruen.com/about">Helen</a>, a painter; and <a href="https://hamptons.com/the-arts-in-the-galleries-27424-interview-john-berggruen-on-the-berggruen-html/">John</a> a prominent San Francisco-based dealer active in global art scene including <a href="https://www.berggruen.com/art-fairs/art-basel-miami-beach15">Art Basel Miami Beach</a>, are from his first marriage to Zellerbach. Nicholas and <a href="https://www.olivierberggruen.com/biography">Olivier</a>, curator and board chair of the library at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, are from his second marriage in 1960 to Catholic actress <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bettina_Moissi">Bettina Moissi</a>. Moissi starred in the 1948 film, <a href="https://jewishfilm.org/Catalogue/films/LongistheRoad.html">Long Is The Road</a>, the first German film about the holocaust that asserted the rights of displaced Jews to resettle in Palestine.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his life, Heinz donated sixty works by Paul Klee to the Metropolitan, loaned seventy pieces to the National Gallery in London, and sold at a greatly reduced price a collection of two hundred pieces to the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. That <a href="https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/museum-berggruen/about-us/profile/">collection</a>, of which the majority of pieces are by Picasso, is housed in a1859 neoclassical building opposite Schloss Charlottenberg and managed by the National Gallery of Berlin.</p>
<p>The transfer of the collection was lauded in 1996 as a symbol of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/464dbaec0aa76ebcb7a7f8988b39b0c4">reconciliation</a> between Heinz Berggruen, who left Europe during the rise of the Nazis when this collection would have been labeled “degenerate,” and the country of his birth. In a recent New York Times feature, Nicholas recalls having an “interesting” childhood immersed in art and culture. I do wonder how his father’s expertise in signals intelligence and non-representational prints, paintings, and sculpture may have influenced the philosopher king’s conception of “reality” and how it can be artfully manipulated.</p>

<p>To say <a href="https://brentwoodalliance.org/berggruen-institute/">neighbors</a> aren’t pleased with Berggruen’s planned mountain-top scholarly enclave would be an <a href="https://patch.com/california/brentwood/billionaire-s-project-would-sacrifice-last-great-open-space-l">understatement</a>. Nicholas, who branded himself as a “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/homeless-billionaire-nicolas-berggruen-2011-12#by-the-way-hes-worth-about-23-billion-dollars-now-and-lives-out-of-hotels-4">homeless</a>” globe-trotter bouncing around luxury hotels now lives in a condo in the star-studded Sierra Towers, a 1965 high-rise on the Sunset Strip. In 2021, he acquired the Beverly Hills <a href="https://therealdeal.com/la/2021/09/15/sold-billionaire-pays-63m-at-auction-for-hearst-estate/">Hearst Estate</a>, of The Godfather horse head scene and JFK/Jackie honeymoon fame, as well as multiple homes surrounding it since that deal closed. For privacy?</p>
<p>The planned monastery parcel, located west of the 405 Freeway, was acquired 2014 for $45 million from an embattled developer who had attempted to build homes on it. Opponents assert the proposed of “educational institution” use is illegal, inconsistent with the Brentwood-Pacific Palisades Community Plan, that the facility would damage the habitat of <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/599b1ee9b8a79b7ac3795443/t/601874209464323cfe9e8ebd/1612215330495/Center+for+Biological+Diversity+Letter+re+Berggruen+Institute+Project+NOP+1-20-2021.pdf">native pumas</a>, and create an extreme fire hazard – methane gas from the garbage festering below. Neither are they keen on having “high profile diplomats and world leaders” coming and going up and down the mountain, disrupting local traffic with their security details.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://planning.lacity.org/odocument/770edd4a-6587-46e4-93df-3a5295551659/Berggruen_Institute_Scoping_Meeting_Presentation.pdf">third proposal</a> began environmental review in late 2020 and is ongoing as of April 2022. The well-connected Berggruen still hopes to obtain a unique zoning designation from the Los Angeles Department of City Planning to greenlight the <a href="https://planning.lacity.org/odocument/4c72b779-dc74-4368-ac58-9e26ed8743b1/Berggruen_Institute_Project_Initial_Study_(November_2020).pdf">project</a>. If approved, thirty scholars would eventually be installed in sunken adobe-like alcoves atop the Santa Monica Mountains. Deep thinkers contemplating lofty ideas in relative solitude as children and those dispossessed by the City of Angels go about the soul-killing, but necessary drudgery of coding mixed reality. There are those who will be tasked with building and defending the digital empire and those who will be tasked with telling the stories that make it all seem necessary and right. Berggruen is gathering the storytellers who will be needed to keep the pot of post-humanism from boiling over.</p>

<p>Make no mistake. We are in the middle of an information war. Narrative frameworks are weapons to be strategically deployed to mold consensus reality and social norms. It is not surprising that a man who founded <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/nicolas-berggruen/?sh=613c9f3826a3">Alpha Investment Management</a>, a profitable hedge fund, would seek the counsel of philosophers as the big game transitions into the noosphere. Through forecasting and spell casting there’s a fine art in crafting perceived reality to ones advantage. Berggruen’s sees his network of aligned thinkers as valuable assets in his campaign to makeover life on earth, worthy of considerable investment of financial and social capital. I picture the Berggruen Institute rather like a mini-World Economic Forum, but covert and nimble.</p>
<p>See the architectural rendering of the scholar alcoves below. Do they look like the intellectual equivalent of military bunkers to you?</p>

<p>tl;dr How we protect personal information while complying with existing laws and regulations.</p><p>By Melissa Strait, Chief Compliance Officer</p><p>Recently, we’ve received questions about why we occasionally review specific accounts and ask for more detailed personal information about the owners of those accounts. In short, we do this to meet our regulatory obligations. Here’s a more detailed explanation:</p><p>At Coinbase, we strive to be the most trusted platform for buying, selling, and exchanging digital assets. Trust is the best way to help more people participate in the cryptoeconomy and reach our goal of increasing economic freedom around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Earning and maintaining trust requires us to ensure the integrity of all transactions supported by our platform. And an important part of doing that is abiding by relevant laws and regulations. We’ve always believed that for crypto to gain the legitimacy needed for mainstream adoption, compliance can’t be an afterthought — it is core to the way we&nbsp;operate.</p><p>In practice, this means following laws and regulations in different jurisdictions, some of which are more stringent than&nbsp;others.</p><p>Crypto is a highly regulated market, with various parts of it overseen by many different federal regulatory agencies, individual states and others — and that’s just in the U.S. If we want to offer Coinbase services in other countries, we also have to comply with local regulations. In some cases, this includes the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/whats-the-crypto-travel-rule-and-what-does-it-mean-for-you/#:~:text=The%20travel%20rule%20ensures%20that,for%20more%20uniform%20crypto%20regulation.">Travel Rule</a>, which requires companies like Coinbase to exchange information about the participants in crypto transactions under certain circumstances.</p><p>Over time, the advantages of web3 may allow people to create and own decentralized identities, sharing much less information with third parties and keeping that information more secure. We’re also excited about advances in digital identity which may move us away from reliance on traditional forms of identification, like driver’s licenses and other paper documents. But for now, companies like Coinbase are required to follow existing regulations, some of which have been on the books since before the Internet even&nbsp;existed.</p><p>This means we have to ask our customers for basic information about themselves and their businesses. Sometimes, and for a very small percentage of our customer base, we need much more detailed information. This helps us to comply with “Know Your Customer” regulations and keep Coinbase and the cryptoeconomy safe. No matter what, we are committed to protecting our customers’ privacy and providing a smooth and intuitive customer experience.</p><p>As part of our ongoing efforts to keep our customers safe, we’ve also <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/trust-expands-its-global-footprint-and-is-now-live-internationally-aa05e34ea2e2">organized a coalition</a> to help other companies comply with global regulations, following industry leading safeguards to protect customers’ privacy and security. To join this coalition, and receive Travel Rule information, all participants must meet anti-money laundering, security, and privacy requirements.</p><p>We’ve also developed proprietary blockchain analytics capabilities to help secure the crypto economy from bad actors. And we have ongoing dialogues with policymakers globally where we advocate for consistent and reasonable requirements that protect our customers’ privacy.</p><p>While some within the digital currency industry have questioned the application of more traditional Know Your Customer (“KYC”) requirements in this novel space, widespread adoption of crypto will depend on building and maintaining the trust and integrity of the ecosystem. For crypto to succeed, people need to be able to buy digital currency with common payment methods, and feel safe doing so. The only way that can happen is if companies like Coinbase follow local laws and regulations, while partnering with policymakers to guide the next generation of rulemaking in this space. Put simply, if we want crypto to be widely accepted, compliance can’t be optional.</p><p>That’s why we’ll keep working to be an industry leader in compliance — protecting our customers, preserving trust, and building the cryptoeconomy.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/compliance-and-protecting-personal-information-b709e65a78ef">Compliance and Protecting Personal Information</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Twice in the late winter and early spring of 2018, I climbed the stairs to the fourth floor of the Fisher Fine Arts Library, a Venetian-Gothic jewel box designed by Frank Furness as the main library of the University of Pennsylvania’s West Philadelphia campus in 1890. It had been years since I’d been inside the building whose open stacks of books I haunted in the early 1990s as a graduate student in the historic preservation program. It is there, for better or worse, that I learned about decoding symbols and interpreting diverse landscapes of industrialization and predatory finance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hold a crisp memory of my thesis advisor, a striking German woman with long white hair tucked into a tidy bun originally from the <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/288148282">Palatinate</a> who relocated to Oley, PA. We were walking down Walnut Street when she paused to look at me, put her hand on my shoulder, and tell me that one day I would see it; that my family would be protected because I could see it. Thirty years later the ability to sense worrisome artifacts lurking behind consensus reality is a burden I’d like to abandon, but I can’t. I’m still waiting for the upside. I don’t feel protected at all, and my family doesn’t understand me.</p>
<p>The account that follows isn’t about placing blame. I recognize we’re all caught in a terrible machine. Some of us are enmeshed more deeply than others. Some of us are more vulnerable than others. My ability to keep a roof over my head is intimately intertwined with the fate of Philadelphia’s largest private employer. If you believe the press releases, it is one of the best big employers in the nation. I am doing my best to complicate their contrived narratives. My lot is being a gad fly for Ben Franklin’s big project, the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>I consider myself fortunate to have the stability to witness and tell the stories I tell. I harbor some guilt, because many people I care about don’t have that luxury. Still, there is nothing to do but forge ahead honing our skills, learning from our missteps, being human. Hanging back because we are afraid to fail is not an option. So, I choose to chip away at the foundation upon which my world rests with stories and felt dolls and dandelions. This anti-life egregore is nothing you can disarm by military force. Fritz Kunz and Piritim Sorokin were searching for the power of eros, the creative force of the universe. I’ll settle for a tonic of philia, affectionate love, appropriate to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>My significant other regularly points out this institution, one from which we both hold degrees, is not a monolithic presence. Rather it is more like a fractious collection of feuding fiefdoms. The right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing, which is exactly how systems of power like it. University culture is a civilizing force that rewards deep, narrow, often polarizing inquiry. Academic pecking orders are determined by books published, conference papers given, grants secured, patents filed, the robustness of one’s network. Virtuosos of cultivated ignorance are lauded; plausible deniability abounds. Behind ivy-covered walls chosen ones are conditioned to look to experts to define the contours of their character even as the system guts them and hollows their minds to make room for infusions of submission coding.</p>
<p>Look everywhere but inside your heart where you might unearth your moral compass. Ignore the elephants in the room as the acrid odor of dung fills your nostrils. The war on consciousness and natural life is well underway, but few retain sufficient clarity of thought or a firm enough backbone to call a spade a spade. Their boning knives are so sharp, and the cuts so deft, many victims never realize they’ve been gutted. That was me for decades – the good student, the good mom, the good co-worker, plowing ahead until a lattice of fine cracks began to widen revealing socially conditioned “goodness” to be a flimsy veneer under which a deep psychic wound festered.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t one wound, but many wounds. It was a pervasive network of woundedness, riddled with rot, and papered over with progressive social policy. The prognosis is not good. There’s not yet a cure for chronic domination disorder though symptoms may temporarily be alleviated through superficial social justice performances enacted even as most participants know deep inside nothing is actually meant to change. Cycles of harm run on repeat with increasing intensity, a perpetual gas-lit charade.</p>
<p>On that day, February 20, 2018, Neil Kleiman, NYU professor of “what works” government would be presenting on “<a href="https://penniur.upenn.edu/events/partners-in-policy-a-new-city-o-s">A New City O/S</a>.” At the time I was new to Twitter, and I distinctly remember tweeting the question, who decided to put behaviorists in charge of our cities? Who had ordered up this new operating system, which I now understand will be blockchain vending machine e-government tied to digital ID and smart sensor networks?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I grabbed a chair up front to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gY6t43vl50">record the presentation</a> and got several pointed questions in at the end about social impact finance. As usual, the self-proclaimed experts seemed to know nothing about what was actually going on, upholding the ruse for an audience who would leave thinking they’d learned something when they were simply being managed through fanciful stories.</p>
<p>Two months later, on April 26, I walked past the coffee service set up in the hall outside that same room and chose a seat at one of a dozen or so white table-clothed round tables set up by the event hosts – the Fels Policy Research Initiative. It was a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2nd-annual-breakthroughs-conference-tickets-43491183300?utm_source=eb_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=order_confirmation_email&amp;utm_term=eventname&amp;ref=eemailordconf">half-day conference</a>, Breakthroughs – New Ideas for Social Policy, to discuss the relationship of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania to city government and social programs. I was there primarily to hear <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/impact-ed/about/claire-robertson-kraft/">Claire Robertson-Kraft</a> speak on data-driven education. Other speakers included <a href="https://www.fels.upenn.edu/instructors/john-kromer">John Kromer</a>, Philadelphia’s former housing director; <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dkrueger/">Dirk Krueger</a>, Wharton professor of econometrics and household risk relating to labor; <a href="https://billypenn.com/2021/05/23/philadelphia-new-health-chief-acting-cheryl-bettigole-biography/">Cheryl Bettigole</a>, Philadelphia Health Commissioner; <a href="https://www.design.upenn.edu/city-regional-planning/graduate/people/vincent-reina">Vincent Reina</a>, professor of regional planning and housing policy; <a href="https://ppeh.sas.upenn.edu/people/bethany-wiggin">Bethany Wiggin</a>, Penn Program in the Environmental Humanities (married to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-helgerson-994625/">David Helgerson</a>, an ESG / sustainability fund manager) ; <a href="https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/faculty-directory/gadsden">Vivian Gadsden</a>, professor of child development and educational psychology ; and keynote <a href="https://www.ericklinenberg.com/about">Eric Klinenberg</a> of NYU’s Institute for Public Knowledge. Klinenberg’s talk focused on climate change, urban heat crises, and anticipated growth in global populations of displaced people – all impact markets.</p>
<p>I was probably one of the only people attending who wasn’t already part of the game. Most of the participants, both the presenters and attendees, had bought into the idea that research partnerships between university and city could only be a plus for Philadelphia’s residents. They would not reflect on the fact that the largest private employer in the city, a non-profit, is not required to pay property taxes, a fact that hobbles our public schools. They would not consider how private funders, from philanthropists to the military, skew the research programs at institutions like Penn. They didn’t have any understanding of how housing, labor, education, and ecology were being woven into data-driven debt products through ubiquitous computing networks.</p>
<p>I recall that during one question and answer session someone made a statement, within the context of environmentalism, that Black people in North Philadelphia drank too much bottled water. That shows the degree of liberal entitlement in which these folks swim, four years after the people of Flint were intentionally poisoned by government officials. The person continued; I think maybe the social impact investors over at the Cira Center will figure out how to fix that; they’re meeting there today. And that was my introduction to Total Impact, which I wrote about later in relationship to Sister Mary Scullion, Project Home, and data-driven housing services <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/01/04/charter-public-health-and-catholic-charity-interests-help-launch-disruptive-pay-for-success-program/">here</a> and <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/03/03/philadelphias-5th-district-city-council-race-a-call-for-a-town-hall-on-social-impact-investing/">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That day on the top floor of Frank Furness’s jewel box no one was thinking about ENIAC or the Singh Nanotechnology Center two blocks east or the Wistar Institute on the other side of college green past Franklin’s broken button, created in 1892 as the nation’s first private biomedical research institute. Just like the young man who had sat next to me who was there to learn about skill development in human capital, their focus was narrow, not expansive. To look beyond is to risk being ostracized. Most don’t. Instead, they drink the coffee and nibble fruit salad cups and oversize muffins and pretend everything’s just fine. The wounds continue to fester.</p>
<p>To get to the room where those two social policy gatherings were held you had to pass the <a href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/">Kleinman Center for Energy Policy</a>, part of the Stuart Weitzman School of Design. The program was founded to promote innovation in energy policy with a $10 million gift from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-kleinman-93297b204/">Scott Kleinman</a>, a Wharton alumnus and co-president of Apollo Global Management. Two reports stood out to me as being of particular interest:</p>
<p><a href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/KCEP-Nuclear-Energy-Meets-Climate-Change_updated.pdf">Nuclear Energy Meets Climate Change</a>: Revitalizing Nuclear Energy to Decarbonized Electricity in the United States – 2021</p>
<p><a href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Energy-and-the-Blockchain-1.pdf">Energy and the Blockchain</a>: Opportunities and Challenges for Climate Energy Governance – 2018</p>
<p>Apollo emerged from the wreckage of the Drexel Burnham Lambert collapse in 1990 resulting from Michael Milken’s junk bond exploits. Kleinman maintains <a href="https://milkeninstitute.org/video/private-markets-opportunity-continuum">an affiliation</a> with the Milken Institute. Apollo’s early strategy, led by Leon Black, was to acquire distressed companies and then gain a controlling interest in them through managed bankruptcy proceedings. Black left the firm, which has $500 billion in assets under management, in 2021 after an internal investigation revealed he’d made <a href="https://archive.ph/FO9tb">$158 million in payments to Jeffrey Epstein</a> over five years. Black remains the firm’s <a href="https://archive.ph/od0x6">largest individual stockholder</a>. Last fall Apollo hired its first Chief Sustainability Officer, Dave Stangis, to lead <a href="https://www.newprivatemarkets.com/apollo-hires-first-chief-sustainability-officer/">ESG</a> (Environmental Social Governance) efforts in its portfolio management. Last summer Kleinman published a 120-page document, “<a href="https://www.apollo.com/~/media/Files/A/Apollo-V3/documents/apollo-esg-report-volume-12.pdf">The Apollo ESG Effect, Volume 12 Annual Report</a>” from which the excerpt below is taken.</p>
<p>“For over a decade, we have built a successful ESG program that has set the standard for ESG reporting within our industry, helping to drive sustainability, climate action, employee engagement, and responsible citizenship across our companies. However, as we look to further integrate ESG principles throughout our business, our goal is to engage all 1,700 of our employees and those of our funds’ reporting companies and relationships. ESG principles need to be fully embedded into our culture and permeate our entire organization. This is when we will truly make a difference and expand the opportunity and the impact.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the past 12 months, we are proud of the progress we have made toward achieving this goal. Apollo has taken steps to move to a best-in-class, transparent governance structure; we have redefined our purpose and values; and expanded the opportunity for diverse talent with industry-leading initiatives. Within private equity, we launched a dedicated Impact platform, which will invest in later-stage companies that align with specific UN Sustainable Development Goals. And within credit, we have developed a proprietary rating system to further incorporate ESG into our investment process. ESG integration across our entire firm has proven to not only be the right thing to do, but simply, better business.”</p>
<p>The impact measurement platforms described above will have to become automated and scalable. What will make that possible is the development of blockchain and Web 3.0 cyber-physical systems. The evolution of the internet from Individual Communication Technology into pervasive computing will demand intensive resource extraction to construct and power the sensor networks that will kill natural life on Earth to generate a counterfeit, controllable simulation. Research into bio-nano engineering will be leveraged to parasitize and redesign carbon and water-based life as armatures for the collective consciousness envisioned for a century by Teilhard de Chardin, Vladimir Vernadsky, Julian Huxley, Oliver Reiser, and Fritz Kunz.</p>
<a href="https://thegiin.org/">https://thegiin.org/</a>
<p>Dangerous weather events will reinforce the need for intensive risk assessment and new insurance products like the automated claims management of parametric insurance policies governed by IoT data analytics. A division of Wharton’s new ESG initiative is a <a href="https://riskcenter.wharton.upenn.edu/partners/">Risk Management and Decisions Process Center</a>, which is one of the Kleinman Center’s on-campus partners. At this point most of the public is unwilling to engage seriously with the degree to which <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/weather-control-as-a-cold-war-weapon-1777409/">natural atmospheric forces</a> can be influenced by technology and have been since the 1950s. All of this will require sensors, edge computing, and quantum AI.</p>
<p>The Quakers, UPenn’s mascot, described themselves as “children of the light.” Is this what they meant? Photonics?

<p>Material scientists associated with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxwell-murialdo-172800102/">Maxwell Murialdo</a> and <a href="https://people.llnl.gov/belof1">Jon Belof</a>, have been theorizing a new type of stablecoin that would employ quantum thermodynamics to create “free” energy from information with responsibility for erasing “waste data” transferred on blockchain to outlying network participants. Fellow researcher Leo Saraceno, alerted me to their paper, “<a href="https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/pub/murialdo-physical-asset-stablecoin/release/2?readingCollection=082fed82#how-e-stablecoin-works">Can Stablecoins by Collateralized by a fully Decentralized Digital Asset</a>,” published in the June 2022 issue of the <a href="https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/about">Cryptoeconomics Systems</a> journal which is housed within the MIT Digital Currency Initiative.

It’s not a stretch to imagine wearable or implanted piezo-electric energy harvesters used for that purpose.</p>
<p>Picture people on prescribed pre-diabetic fitness pathways linked to social impact deals with smart uniforms even as their <a href="https://conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu/files/JournalPapers/23_Energy%20Harvesting%20from%20the%20Animal-Human%20Body%20for%20Self-Powered%20Electronics.pdf">sweat, body heat, or blood flow</a> is used to offset the energetic costs of information erasure. In a conversation I had recently about Quakers being filled with the holy spirit to the point of physically “quaking” I can’t help but contemplate the possibility of an ultimate perversion of sacred practice through the intentional harvest of spiritual energetics using novel “climate-tech” materials. There are so many faith communities operating in the social impact space, would it be a stretch to imagine the dark forces wanting to capture the “inner light” of “pay for success” program participants to advance their misguided plans for liberal-minded decarbonizaton?</p>
<p>SBTs (soul bound tokens) anyone?</p>

<p>As fellows associated with the <a href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/people/">Kleinman Center</a> work on energy policy infrastructure, professors and students who are part of the VIPER program work on the developing the technology that underpins the faux “greening” of biomolecular design. The primary benefactors of Penn’s energy research division are P. Roy Vagelos and his wife Diana. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Roy_Vagelos">Vagelos</a>, an alumnus who serves on the university’s board, trained as a physician and held positions with the National Institutes of Health early in his career. From 1966 to 1975 he worked at the <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1363772">Washington University St. Louis School of Medicine</a> and <a href="https://ehss.energy.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap7_1.html">Massachusetts General Hospital</a>. Prior to his arrival both institutions maintained close relationships with the Atomic Energy Commission and conducted radiation experiments on civilian populations.</p>
<p>Vagelos took the reins of pharmaceutical giant Merck, and later Regeneron. During his time at Merck, the firm developed the anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin, which the company arranged in coordination with the World Bank and the World Health Organization, to donate the drug African countries as a treatment for river blindness. Control of the disease, starting in the mid 1970s, was the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/07/03/forty-years-later-the-extraordinary-river-blindness-partnership-sets-its-sights-on-new-goals">World Bank’s first public health project</a>. By the 1980s Vagelos was being lauded as an early <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4089453/">pharmaceutical philanthropist</a>.</p>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4089453/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4089453/</a>
<p>The <a href="https://communities.acs.org/t5/GCI-Nexus-Blog/UPenn-s-New-Vagelos-Integrated-Program-on-Energy-Research-VIPER/ba-p/15635?author=2014%2F03">VIPER</a> (Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research) dual degree (School of Arts and Sciences / School of Engineering) program was initiated in 2012 with the goal of creating a cadre of alternative energy researchers who’d have the opportunity to conduct extensive laboratory research at the undergraduate level. Among them was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-deo/">William Deo</a>, class of 2021, who studied physics, earned a MS in engineering, and augmented his science studies with summer internships in investment banking. During his time in the program, William prepared a <a href="https://www.viper.upenn.edu/news/2020/08/20/will-deo-viper-21-his-recent-piece-can-nuclear-hit-its-stride-africa">policy study</a> for the Kleinman Energy Institute that highlighted the potential for rural African communities to skip fossil fuels and move directly to modular nuclear power.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Seven years after their initial gift the Vagelos family made the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Arts and Sciences largest donation to date as part of the 2019 “Power of Penn” campaign. Fifty million dollars was pledged for the construction of a 110,000 square foot laboratory complex that would have high performance optics labs and a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer suite with helium recovery. The building will house the VIPER program and support interdisciplinary investigations into the creation of new energy science technologies. Vagelos previously <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/biochem/aboutroyvagelos.html">endowed</a> four chairs at Penn, funded the creation of a 100,000 square foot advanced chemistry lab in 1997, and established numerous scholarships in molecular life sciences and biophysics. The <a href="https://behnisch.com/work/projects/1656">Vagelos Laboratory for Energy Science and Technology</a>, now under construction is anticipated to be finished 2024 at a cost $173 million. In a press release, Dean of Engineering and specialist in multi-agent robotics (drone swarms) <a href="https://www.kumarrobotics.org/">Vijay Kumar</a> stated:</p>
<p>“This transformative gift will supercharge Penn Engineering’s interdisciplinary and innovative culture, while nucleating new collaborations with Penn Arts &amp; Sciences. There is no bigger challenge for our planet than the creation, storage, and conversion of energy in a clean, efficient and cost-effective way. Penn engineers and scientists are partners in working toward a sustainable future.”</p>
<p>Kumar’s choice of words, “nucleating,” for the gift seems significant. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/nucleation">Nucleation</a> is the appearance of a new thermodynamic phase, a daughter phase, that emerges and grows within the parent. <a href="https://nucleationcapital.com/">Nucleation Capital</a> is among the first venture capital funds organized around the promotion of fourth phase nuclear power, which they characterize as decentralized, modular, and designed for rapid deployment to remote locations. &nbsp;The fund is being managed in partnership with Rod Adams, creator of the <a href="https://atomicinsights.com/about/">long-running blog</a> “Atomic Insights.” In advance of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year, the International Atomic Energy Agency, a <a href="https://www.iaea.org/about/partnerships/united-nations-system">United Nations partner</a> based in Vienna and established in 1957 as part of Eisenhower’s “<a href="https://www.iaea.org/about/overview/history">Atoms for Peace</a>” initiative, released a report extolling the importance of nuclear power for a net-zero future.</p>

<p>As I see it, decarbonization and crypto/data center energy consumption seem to be issues meant to drive unquestioning adoption of the “green” nuclear power and blockchain energy grids that are intended to manifest Web 3, augmented reality life in the CIA’s mind games.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Soddy">Frederick Soddy</a>, the English chemist who discovered the transmutation of elements through radiation and coined the term “isotope” devoted the second half of his life from 1921-34 to theorizing an <a href="https://medium.com/iipp-blog/the-nobel-prize-winner-that-predicted-a-crisis-between-nature-and-capital-a174e6a774d3">economy based on energy</a>, embedded in an ecological frame and writing books about it. <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Soddy-Central-Role-of-Energy-Social-Responsibility.pdf">Nuclear energy was central</a>, and we see that making a comeback with many public figures, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen among them. There is much discussion of thorium reactors being an option not only for decentralized “green,” “safe” power, but with the potential to generate radioisotopes, too. Perfect for the human+ campaign of mutagenesis. There seems to be increased interest in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1909031116">saltational evolutionary theory</a>, substantial changes made to genes with multiple mutations showing up over a short period of time. This theory is counter to Darwin’s gradualist outlook and has been debated since the mid nineteenth century. Now, however, with bio-nano technology, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis">radiation</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Soddy">hormesis</a>, I sense that scientists are positioning themselves as technicians for God, bent on tweaking our bodies into “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17046365/">hopeful monsters</a>.”</p>

<p>In recent years cryptocurrency companies have been actively seeking arrangements to source nuclear power for their mining, because reactors don’t release greenhouse gases and are therefore considered “sustainable,” and can be factored into net-zero efforts. A <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2021-08-zero-carbon-bitcoin-owner-pennsylvania-nuclear.html">recent deal</a> was executed between Terawulf crypto-mining and Talen Energy that manages a reactor near Berwick, PA on the Susquehanna River.</p>
<p>While uranium has a bad name within the public sphere, thorium is emerging as a compelling alternative to power a new generation of reactors drawing on molten salt research carried out but then set aside in the 1950s as the arms race heated up. The Atomic Energy Commission opted for technologies that could generate plutonium for weapons. <a href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph240/ting1/">Thorium</a> requires additional processing, but is more abundant than uranium with India, Brazil, Australia, and the United States believed to have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_thorium_resources">largest deposits</a>. Beyond the nuclear option other alternatives are being floated in Pennsylvania, including <a href="https://archive.ph/qkewU">burning waste coal from decades-old detritus</a>. The claim made for it being beneficial is that even though it releases emissions when burned, that harm is offset by the removal of toxic waste piles.</p>

<p>Once you understand the problem, reaction, solution paradigm, it is hard to listen to this Penn Energy Week presentation by Lawrence Baxter, professor of government regulation at Duke Law, and not imagine they are actively setting up impact markets for a future of “green” crypto.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The logic of social impact finance requires a terrible baseline, so that any improvement moving forward would count as an easy win. I believe that is the reason that the folks at Cambridge are collecting data in such granular detail now when energy requirements are so high. Anyone who understands the game properly would plan ahead so they could leverage those numbers later. None of the players are preparing to jettison Web 3 due to the fact that it’s an abomination to natural life. Rather, they’re crafting data narratives that can be used to legitimize the creation of markets in alternative energy, acceptance of novel, engineered biomaterials that open the door to new forms of quantum computation.</p>
<p>My gut tells me that mineral mining whether for energy or technology fabrication, which is truly horrible, is being strategically positioned to make bio-mass engineering appear a more palatable option to the public. The problem, in my opinion, is that the public does not have a sufficient grasp on the capabilities of synthetic biology and its consequences or an awareness of our histories of eugenics and social engineering. Before we can have an informed discussion about the ethics of the alternatives that will be proposed by the scientists and the military and ESG money behind them there’s a lot of catching up to do. &nbsp;Given the rise of solutions journalism, the incorporation of digital media as verticals in the social impact finance space, and the creation of compliance-based online education systems, that’s seems very unlikely.</p>
<p>The next phase of “mining” will be detailed analyses of molecular components of living organisms in ecosystems. Inventories will be carried out in excruciating detail not only to provide the false pretense of accountability and gather data required to build climate finance deals, but to literally map life on the planet for machine learning and re-engineering. I believe the unspoken dual use behind such efforts is bioprospecting at the molecular level enabled by <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/21/3908/htm">chemo-taxonomy</a> and software like SistematX that automates <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/23/1/103/htm">chemo-informatic annotation</a> of organic compounds. From the microbe to megafauna, the agents of impact seek full spectrum domination.</p>
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/21/3908/htm">https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/21/3908/htm</a>
<p>It is vital that the public begin to grasp that the sustainability narrative as advanced by the United Nations, the Global Impact Investment Network, the Impact Management Project, Scott Kleinman’s Apollo Group, and other ESG promoters is not about saving the planet but rather entangling all facets of existence into mechanical systems to quantify nature, monitor the value of each individual piece (down to the microbe) to the larger system, engineer life from the position of full spectrum dominance, and using risk analytics gamble on innumerable combinations of possible outcomes beyond anything the human mind could ever hold. This is a dark, dark art masquerading as salvation. We must be strong of heart and clear of head so as not to wander into the wrong story. If we unthinkingly follow the crumbs being dropped it will be game over for natural life.</p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania knows this game well. Wharton began accepting <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/university-of-pennsylvania-cryptocurrency/3018458/">cryptocurrency for tuition payment</a> last year as well as accepting a <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/university-pennsylvania-receives-largest-cryptocurrency-gift-universitys-history-support">$5 million anonymous gift</a> of cryptocurrency for its Stevens Center for Financial Innovation. The center is named after Ross Stevens, an alumnus who started at Goldman Sachs before founding Stone Ridge Holding Group where he currently manages $20 million in alternative investments. Stevens is well-connected in the Bitcoin space <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/bitcoin/videos/bitcoin-macro-strategy">presenting with Michael Saylor</a> of MicroStrategy last February.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As founder and board chair of the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) Stevens held $6 billion in Bitcoin early last year and, even with losses, those holdings are now around $7 billion with new infusions of capital continuously flowing into the organization. NYDIG facilitates Bitcoin transactions, including Penn’s anonymous cryptocurrency gift, and hopes to pave the way for BTC adoption in hundreds of US banks and credit unions. Through partnerships with sports franchises like the Houston Rockets and the New York Yankees Stevens has begun to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nydig-to-provide-the-new-york-yankees-with-bitcoin-payroll-services/">target payroll and employee benefit systems</a>. NYDIG provides technical support for employees to direct a portion of their salary into BTC acquisition with dollar-cost-averaging “smoothing the bumps along the way.”</p>
<p>The Stevens Financial Innovation Center hosts a blockchain laboratory and incubators for both blockchain start-ups and digital assets. There is a <a href="https://stevenscenter.wharton.upenn.edu/blockchain-laboratory/">Penn-affiliated Discord community</a> to connect students and alumni with jobs and opportunities in the blockchain/crypto space. Among the advisors to their <a href="https://stevenscenter.wharton.upenn.edu/accelerator/senior-advisors/">Cypher accelerator</a> are Jeff Amico of Andreessen Horowitz, Charles Birnbaum of Bessemer Venture Partners, Stefan Cohen of Bain Capital, Tim Draper of Draper Associates, Mark Cuban of Cuban Companies, and Chris Giancarlo former chair of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Sponsored projects include software to scale blockchain smart contracts in housing, healthcare, gaming, and financial sectors; assess risk; promote ubiquitous AI and enable investments in celebrity athletes.</p>

<p>I have a great deal of frustration with people, especially people who identify themselves as experts in blockchain, who are not yet drawing obvious connections between digital money, decentralized ledgers, and Web 3 augmented reality and social impact finance. In my opinion, we are having all the wrong conversations around blockchain. Those pushing cybernetics and bio-nano engineering as a “just transition” continue manage digital conversations and channel attention in ways that allow the power structure to program public acceptance of “solutions” to problems they’ve manufactured for just that purpose. I saw it first in the education space. Eventually, I realized most of the activist “leaders” of the faux movement against standardized testing and predatory data collection were there to sound the alarm about children’s hacked personal information and drive us all onto blockchain where transcripts integrated with community school medical records and social support services would jumpstart a future of remote haptic labor based on ruthless competition among competency-based skills badge holders around the globe. Very few were willing to point to people like <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2017/09/20/when-someone-shows-you-who-they-are-believe-them-the-first-time/">Diane Ravitch</a> whose son Joe invested in that technology through Raine Group, or Leonie Haimson whose husband is a <a href="http://www.princetonmagazine.com/michael-oppenheimer-and-the-end-of-the-climate-as-you-know-it/">prominent climate scientist at Princeton</a> and say their actions didn’t add up – their cultivated ignorance of what was really happening after years of evidence was presented showed what side they were really on.</p>
<p>Wharton’s social impact initiatives began with a <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2011/01/new_wharton_programs_reflect_social_entrepreneurship_trend">social entrepreneurship MBA</a> in 2011 and morphed into an integrated ESG initiative that includes a Climate Center, Impact Investing Research Lab, Political Risk and Identity Lab, and a Center for Governance and Business Ethics in the summer of 2022. For the past decade, future leaders in data-driven impact have been groomed through academic coursework and hands-on projects like the <a href="https://socialimpact.wharton.upenn.edu/news/fortune-impact-investing-takes-hold-on-business-school-campuses/">Wharton Impact Investment Partners Fund and Training Network</a> run in coordination with representatives from Ronald Cohen’s Bridges Ventures, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Years after having completed my MA at Penn and immersing myself in independent research, it started to dawn on me that many departments, particularly graduate programs and affiliated research institutes, seem to knowingly or not be upholding the interests of the Wharton business school. I saw that with the <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/38765-Penn_Graduate_School_of_Education">graduate school of education</a> and its emphasis on educational technology. I saw it in the positive psychology program where <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/338454-Positive_Psychology_Center,_UPenn">Martin Seligman and Angela Duckworth</a> would feed into markets around mental health and wellbeing. I saw it in the approach to public policy at the <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/282175-University_of_Pennsylvania_Fels_Institute_of_Government">Fels Institute of Government</a> and <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/259246-Actionable_Intelligence_for_Social_Policy">Actional Intelligence for Social Policy</a>.</p>
<p>The alignment with impact investing was on full display September 13, 2019 in the Irvine Auditorium when I attended a day-long conference, “<a href="https://mcharg.upenn.edu/designing-green-new-deal-1">Designing A Green New Deal</a>,” that featured Naomi Klein as the keynote. That’s how I knew what she was about before our face off in 2020. The first panel presentation that day was literally “Mining the New Deal Legacy.” See Tim Scott’s “<a href="https://truthout.org/articles/disrupting-the-myth-of-franklin-d-roosevelt-in-the-age-of-trump-sanders-and-clinton/">Disrupting the Myth of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Age of Trump, Sanders, and Clinton</a>,” if you don’t understand how problematic that is.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The event was co-hosted by the <a href="https://mcharg.upenn.edu/ian-l-mcharg-center-urbanism-and-ecology">McHarg Center</a> of the <a href="https://www.design.upenn.edu/about-weitzman-school">Weitzman School of Design</a> / <a href="https://www.design.upenn.edu/pennpraxis/home">PennPraxis</a>, the <a href="https://www.pop.upenn.edu/">UPenn Population Studies Center</a>, the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/sociospatialclimate/">Social-Spatial Climate Collaborative,</a> the <a href="https://buellcenter.columbia.edu/">Buell Center for American Architecture</a>, and the <a href="https://www.pewcenterarts.org/grants/featured/?gclid=CjwKCAjwgaeYBhBAEiwAvMgp2sY_AALfuKCrKVq56B37KHxmPaTrAFQ0oR7V7LuhwZ4pOtGBpNsAgBoCOJIQAvD_BwE">Pew Center for Arts and Heritage</a>. Sure, at the time I didn’t understand the way in which blockchain would interface with cyber-physical systems to train machines in the finer points of being human, but I understood the game and UPenn’s place in it and I spent that day chasing down as many speakers as I could to try and get the point across that “data-driven” “sustainability” would not be a “just transition” or a digital utopia, but rather an open air prison where all the worst aspects of militarized finance would be amplified beyond our ability to comprehend it.</p>
<p>None of these experts had any interest in hearing from a person in the lobby who clearly wasn’t there to help them up the career ladder. Even the co-eds tabling environmental causes and progressive books from small publishing houses were too jaded or distracted to listen to me. After that conference I wrote “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/09/22/sustainability-for-financiers-what-climate-marchers-need-to-know-about-the-un-sustainable-development-goals/">Sustainability for Financiers: What Climate Marchers Need to Know About the UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>,” followed by &nbsp;“<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/09/20/two-paths-diverge-follow-the-red-one/">Two Paths Diverge, Follow the Red One</a>.” At that point I still thought an indigenous centered approach could be authentic, but over time I understood that Nick Estes, as wonderful as his book “<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2953-our-history-is-the-future">Our History is the Future</a>” is was in no position to face off against GIIN and the Impact Management Project. Those stories are needed to maintain polarization as we spin into the vortex of molten salt reactor promises of radioisotope, anti-aging protocols.</p>
<p>We need the stories. We need the spectacle. We need the performances to reassure us that we have what it takes to get through one more day, week, year in a world of crumbling foundations that threaten to topple us into the digital abyss. I saw it that day in all the faces. They were acting their parts even as I was acting mine, the gad fly to Franklin’s legacy in city that wraps itself in brotherly love even as it kicks the most vulnerable to the curb.</p>
<p>Story is one of Zane Griffin Talley Cooper skills. Described <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220827212709/https:/siliconicarus.org/2022/08/16/%EF%BF%BCcanary-in-the-rare-earth-mine-the-secret-war-for-greenland-and-the-geopolitics-of-the-data-economy/">in a recent Silicon Icarus article</a> as “a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School of Communication,” Cooper is a consulting researcher at the McHarg Center, one of the hosts of the <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/dissecting-green-new-deal-at-Penn">2019 Green New Deal event</a>. His <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/graduate-student/zane-griffin-talley-cooper">Annenberg Center bio</a> notes that he’s one of seven <a href="https://internationalistgreennewdeal.org/contributions">contributors</a> working on a “thematic development of the Internationalist Green New Deal Atlas.”</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><a href="https://internationalistgreennewdeal.org/approach">The group says</a> it is interested redesigning the built environment to “fight historical injustices” and “drive quality of life improvements.” They anticipate massive transformations of how and where people will live. Their lens, they say, is one of racial capitalism. They acknowledge infrastructure as an embodiment of hegemonic power at all levels, a contested space. They pay lip service to the harm caused by the extractive practices in mining and energy, but there is no acknowledgement that their planned smart environments will exponentially increase the harm, and the end result will be an open air, personalized prison. They naively speak of a future of abundance where resources are redistributed, but refuse to discuss social impact finance, smart contract layers of e-governance, globalization 4.0, platformed labor, interspecies currency, giraffes in heart monitors to pay for their drone surveillance, which not coincidentally will encompass surveillance of communities in the rainforest, too. They are chosen for their roles, because they are happy to play dumb.</p>
<p>People like Zane take funding from the Iceland Blockchain Foundation to run their immersive media junkets, while pretending mining is about Auroracoin and not about augmented reality, digital twinning, mental entrainment, behavioral economics, cybernetics linked to the internet of bodies, the internet of bio-nano things. Academics play both sides – the expert and the idiot – as circumstances require. What hat do you wear to your gig at Intel advising on Web 3 sustainability?</p>

<p>Is it the same one you wear when you’re writing papers about supply chain management for e-waste funded by a $200,000 “Greening the Internet” from the Internet Society Foundation? I suppose those supply chain systems would involve blockchain, too?</p>
<a href="https://innovate.ieee.org/innovation-spotlight/how-blockchain-can-solve-the-growing-e-waste-problem/">https://innovate.ieee.org/innovation-spotlight/how-blockchain-can-solve-the-growing-e-waste-problem/</a>
<p>What hat would you wear to meet me for a beer or a coffee so we could talk about IXO Foundation’s vision for a world covered in code? Yes, that Global South world you pay lip service to in your lofty essays. Well, I’ll never know Zane, because you didn’t reply to my requests to talk with you. The comfortable don’t want to be discomfited. It sickens me the degree to which so many people construct identities that end up being carboard cut outs, no substance. If you all actually had any intention of living up to the lofty ideals you write about, you’d want to know what I know. You’d stop spending your summers in Greenland and buckle down and do an ethnography of predatory philanthro-capitalism and synthetic biology and blockchain in your own damn back yard. But that’s not how the game works is it? It’s just one big scam on repeat.</p>
<p>“We believe that political economies are what drive the design professions: This project will foreground the histories and contemporary realities of colonialism, imperialism, racial capitalism and they manifest themselves in the built and natural environment. We are especially interested in the relationship between how and where design is deployed within these existing frameworks, and how alternative, anti-capitalist/imperialist/colonialist frameworks might restructure how and where our fields operate through an Internationalist Green New Deal.” <a href="https://internationalistgreennewdeal.org/approach">Source</a></p>
<p>The Internationalist Atlas came after the McHarg Center’s <a href="https://mcharg.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/20_04_17_5column_arial_minion_web_optimized.pdf">2100 Project</a>. The insanity of that thinking is aptly represented on page 66 of an 81-page document where the authors describe the need for nearly 90% of the United States to be covered in trees by 2060 in order to achieve their planned levels of carbon sequestration. While they may call such installations “forest,” I doubt very much such efforts would lead to any sort of biologically rich, integrated ecosystem. These are tree factories, and the idea that the government could impose such a land use on private property or that the millions upon millions of acres of prairie and desert would support billions of trees is ludicrous if not outright treacherous to the integrity of existing natural systems. Who are these regional engineers to play God anyway? Are they looking to exterminate all life in non-forest ecosystems? Because that’s what it looks like to me.</p>

<p><a href="https://mcharg.upenn.edu/ian-l-mcharg">Ian McHarg</a> was a Scottish-born landscape architect, a leader in regional planning who popularized the concept of “designing with nature.” These days that sentiment at UPenn could be rendered as some sort of bio-inspired material created by evolutionary algorithms that bears only a passing resemblance to the natural world. McHarg taught one of the most popular courses at UPenn in the 1960s, “Man and the Environment.” His students led the first Earth Day celebration in Philadelphia in 1970, and he developed the first database for a national ecological inventory for the EPA in 1993.</p>
<p>Today the visualizations that McHarg pioneered are much more sophisticated. In fact, social impact investors and the United Nations are creating metrics to run financial markets in measurable behavior change, especially behavior change aligned with the narratives that make the Sustainable Development Goals come to life. Now the machines can watch us, and artificial intelligence is getting better at responding – they call it <a href="https://wpa.wharton.upenn.edu/">people analytics</a> and <a href="https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/story/neuroscience-and-marketing-meet-in-the-classroom/">neuromarketing</a>. They’ll use it for <a href="https://chibe.upenn.edu/">our good health and economic wellbeing</a>, wink, wink. The folks over at Wharton are really good at it and have been since <a href="https://www.transformation.dk/www.raven1.net/mcf/tavistock.htm">Eric Trist</a> brought over his Tavistock social ecology work, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_%C3%96zbekhan">Hasan Ozbekhan</a> started up systems science and helped launch the Club of Rome.</p>
<p>The digital twin simulations, once Web 3 begins to scale, are going to be a game-changer. It’s hard to say if the results will be so warped that navigating that reality will make us psychically ill or if the majority of people will be so numb, they won’t even notice. If the latter, I guess the digitally engineered experiences will simply be ramped up in intensity until they can get us to move in the direction they want. Cooper started out as a young filmmaker at the University of Colorado Boulder. His <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Zane-Griffin-Talley-Cooper-CV.pdf">CV</a> lists him as Co-Founder, Director, and Editor at Kinematic Studios with office in Denver and Los Angeles. He did some acting, including a 2008 appearance as a dancing scientist on an Applied Biosystems commercial selling Veriti PCR systems. Wow.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2019, Cooper presented a piece of immersive media he created to examine sensations relating to the experience of infrastructure used for crypto mining in Iceland. The production, “Alchemical Infrastructures: Making Blockchain in Iceland,” was supported by the <a href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/about/history">Annenberg School of Communication</a>, the <a href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/">Kleinman Center for Energy Policy</a> and UPenn’s <a href="http://www.ceepenn.org/">Center for Experimental Ethnography</a> whose 2021-22 theme is hyper fictions / hyperreality. It was featured in an <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/exploring-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-iceland">exhibit</a> of the Annenberg School in 2019 along with a soundscape and portrait series.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One additional feature of the <a href="https://www.ibf.is/en-us/blog/exhibition-alchemical-infrastructures">exhibit</a> was a functional Antminer 7 that mined the unofficial cryptocurrency of Iceland, Auroracoin. Cooper said, “Configuring the rig for the solo-mining Auroracoin through a campus internet connection was no easy feat! The exhibit enjoyed a tremendously positive reception and was featured on the local news. The overall intent of the exhibit was to give blockchain and cryptocurrency a more immediately relatable face, by focusing on the people and material processes involved.” Auroracoin was created in 2014 as a replacement currency for the small country after the economy crashed in 2008. Coins were distributed to citizens through a national ID system, but many people cashed them in right away causing the system to crash in short order. Zane often describes the focus of his work as an alchemical process, a topic of a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ8fXwnvDf0">collaborative presentation</a>. Turns out it is very difficult to turn digital money into gold.</p>
<p>The VR element was featured in a 2019 conference hosted by the Penn Program in the Environmental Humanities, “<a href="https://virtualenvironmentnet.wordpress.com/">Environmental Storytelling and Virtual Reality</a>.” The keynote address given by <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/bailenso">Jeremy Bailenson</a>, director of Stanford’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, was titled “Experience on Demand.” According to his <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/bailenso">Stanford bio</a>, “Bailenson studies the psychology of virtual and augmented reality, in particular how virtual experiences lead to changes in perceptions of self and others. His lab builds and studies systems that allow people to meet in virtual space and explores the changes in the nature of social interaction. His most recent research focuses on how virtual experiences can transform education, environmental conservation, empathy, and health.”</p>
<p>This, of course, is about harvesting emotional data to fulfill the requirements of social impact finance deals and to train machine learning. Virtual reality is a central feature of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal implementation. It is astonishing to me that people imagine any of this is actually “green.” Not to worry though – fellows like Zane will be coming up with systems to manage all this e-waste and mitigate the harm caused by data transmission and storage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The conference had other talks on bodies in fantasy worlds, panels on the value of “play,” trainings in immersive game design for climate change sponsored by Unity, and hands-on pedagogical opportunities. Cooper joined <a href="https://www.sarahcameronsunde.com/about/">Sarah Cameron Sunde</a>, a performance artist engaged with concepts of deep time and water, to <a href="https://virtualenvironmentnet.wordpress.com/schedule/">discuss</a> In/Visible Elements. The frustration for me lies in the fact that all of these very well educated people are legitimizing this technology designed to usher in programmable digital life without even recognizing its origins in military behavioral psychology. You’d think being on Penn’s campus with Martin “Guantanamo-Learned Helplessness” Seligman nearby might trigger some measure of discernment. For goodness sake even the humanities folks and the environmentalists have all fallen into line without a peep. Money talks, I guess.</p>
<p>Among the references on his <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A3fAP60YOm4iffVvOPUQQ2zHCLnKikzp/view">CV</a> are a UPenn professor of digital culture and technological activism; the dean of Northwestern University in Qatar who specializes in evidence-based multi-modal storytelling centering the Global South; an anthropologist examining spatial epistemologies and mediated sensation; a Canadian communications professor who’s the PI for a project on DNA data storage; and a fellow with Data for Progress focused on low-carbon public housing policy. We can see in this group the importance of narrative – how it is structured – how it is delivered – how it is stored. We want our stories to empower us and make us feel like our better selves. Unfortunately for me I really suck in that regard. I’ve never been able to remember the spoon full of sugar approach. It’s not in my nature.</p>
<p>I feel I’ve provided a pretty good tour of the University of Pennsylvania. I hope you have gained an understanding of how I see things – cagey financiers, delusional do-gooders, crafty policy makers, ambitious scientists, and digital storytellers each of whom is living their own drama where they hope to be the hero. &nbsp;So why have I taken you down this winding path? Well, I wanted to let you know that Zane Griffith Talley Cooper is the reason I chose to separate myself from Silicon Icarus.</p>
<p>I’d had some communication failures with Raul the previous month, and when I saw his story highlighting Cooper’s work in Greenland my heart dropped. Not because it wasn’t a well written piece or that rare earth mineral mining wasn’t a concern, but I knew that the Annenberg School of Communication, created by Sir Walter Nixon’s ambassador to England and heir to the Daily Racing Form / TV Guide fortune, was a mouthpiece for social impact propaganda. I’d written about it in 2018, including their push for blockchain media and sham social justice outlets. I’d sent Raul the link to, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/09/30/dont-let-impact-investors-capture-the-non-profit-activist-media/">Don’t Let the Impact Investors Capture the Non-Profit Activist Media</a>,” a week or so prior to his article coming out.</p>
<p>I asked if we could have a conversation about Cooper, because the nature of his inclusion in the piece didn’t make sense to me. Nor did the shout-out given to him on Twitter. It was not the way Raul normally operated, and I pretty much read and uplifted every piece he’d written over the course of the year. I’m not one to let things fester. You may say I’m blunt or direct or even rude. I’ll own that. But I don’t play games, and people know where I stand.</p>
<p>I never got that conversation. The door was closed, a brief message exchange abruptly ended, and at that point I said I felt we were on different paths and it was probably appropriate to remove me as a contributor. Raul never opened the message I sent saying I hoped our paths would cross again, and that I wish him open pathways on his journey. I’m sure he will continue to do important work. I’d love to think impact finance will be a part of it, but it’s not the first time people I thought understood ended up pulling back and repositioning. As I said in the beginning of this post, this is not about assigning blame. I’m in this machine as deeply as anyone. I even have empathy for Zane Talley Griffith Cooper. It can’t be easy on the soul getting paid to study Web 3 while being expected to be an anti-imperialist in your academic circles. But he did do Beckett naked, so I suspect he’ll probably make it through.</p>
<a href="https://www.zanegriffintalleycooper.com/pastzane/when-i-used-to-do-commercials-and-make-movies-sometimes">https://www.zanegriffintalleycooper.com/pastzane/when-i-used-to-do-commercials-and-make-movies-sometimes</a>
<p>I stepped away from Silicon Icarus not because Raul interviewed Zane or wrote a piece I felt pulled punches, but because my request to talk about it was rejected. I didn’t have ten pages of thoughts when I made that ask, but there were things on my mind – serious things. To my way of thinking friends, real friends, should have enough trust and respect in one another to do the hard work of being human, which can be messy. Two years of support deserved better than ghosting, but we never know what it’s like to walk in another person’s shoes. I know he’s facing challenges. I don’t regret making that ask, because I wouldn’t be me if I hadn’t. The hardest part is not knowing if we ever were really friends, and that is the sickness of the Internet folks. It can be a real mind fuck.</p>
<p>But if the past few years have taught me anything, the universe operates according to purposeful if mysterious plans. I’ve had people arrive in my life to teach me and then abruptly leave. Still, we are all connected and so I will end with this passage from Louise Erdrich that I read this past week about waves. The waves are the key – periodicity, cycles, harmony. Edward Dewey knew some things. This paragraph is from “Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country,” page 64.</p>
<p>“Waves – On our way to visit the island and Eternal Sands we experience a confluence of shifting winds and waves. Tobasonakwut shows me how the waves are creating underwaves and counterwaves. The rough swells from the southeast are bouncing against the rocky shores, which he avoids. The wooded lands and shores will absorb the force of the waves and not send them back out to create confusion. Heading towards open water, we travel behind the farthest island, a wave cutter. We slice right into the waves when possible. But we are dealing with yesterday’s wind and a strong north wind and swells underneath the waves now proceeding from the wind that shifted, fresh, to the south. I think if what Tobasonakwut’s father said, “The creator is the lake and we are the waves on the lake.” The images of complexity and shifting mutability of human nature is very clear today.“</p>
<p>Perfect Louise.</p>
<p>Your words touch my heart.</p>
<p>I wish a wave cutter island for everyone who needs it right now – each and every one.</p>
<p>Hug your people.</p>
<p>You never know what tomorrow will bring.</p>

<p>It is no secret that the crypto space has witnessed tremendous growth in the past few years. DeFi protocols, NFT collections, ZK-rollup projects and everything in between have made a debut since the ICO era. <br></p><p>Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies has yielded massive upwards price action and a greater pace of innovations. At the same time, higher transaction volumes on networks like Ethereum have unearthed several issues. Prevalent among these challenges is scalability, which impacts the blockchain's performance directly. Transactions in the most popular, decentralized, and secure smart contract network now cost more and take longer to complete.<br></p><p>Because of these, Layer-2 blockchains and rollups were appointed to solve Ethereum's scalability problems. Among them, zero-knowledge rollups are one of the two prominent Layer-2 <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-defi-privacy-suite-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary/">scalability solutions</a>, the other being optimistic rollups. Built on Ethereum, zero-knowledge rollups like <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync</a> and <a href="https://loopring.org/">Loopring</a> changed the crypto space by lowering the entry barrier to the network and helping decentralized applications scale faster and offer better privacy.<br></p><p>In this guide, we will explore the concept of zero-knowledge rollups and learn how they work. We’ll also point out the benefits and drawbacks they bring to the table, how they compare to optimistic rollups and discover some of the leading ZK-rollup projects in the blockchain space today.</p> What are ZK-rollups? <p>A rollup is a Layer-2 scaling solution built on top of a “classic” Layer-1 smart contract blockchain network like Ethereum. Rollups solve the dilemma of high gas fees and low throughput, thereby empowering users to pay less gas fees and blockchains to validate transactions quicker. Rollup solutions tackle scalability and transaction cost challenges in different ways, with the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">zero-knowledge</a> approach being one of the most effective.<br></p><p>A ZK-rollup is a Layer-2 blockchain protocol that processes transactions, performs computations, and stores data off-chain while holding assets in an on-chain smart contract. Naturally, traditional Layer-1 blockchain solutions like Ethereum validate blocks and transactions on-chain. ZK-rollups take these activities same off-chain and relay a summary of the validated activities to the blockchain. By doing this, the rollup updates the state of the Layer-1 blockchain while storing only a fraction of the total data.<br></p><p>Much like a rolled paper, zero-knowledge rollups contain several transactions into a single batch to execute them off-chain. Then, instead of relaying the individual information of all transactions in the batch to the blockchain, the ZK-rollup submits a <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/validity-proofs-vs-fraud-proofs-4ef8b4d3d87a">validity proof</a>. This proof represents a receipt that confirms that the transactions are authentic and therefore can be accounted for both in the rollup and the main chain.</p> How does a ZK-rollup work?  Structure of ZK-Rollups <p>To understand how zero-knowledge rollups work, at least when it comes to the most popular ZK-rollup projects, we must consider how they are structured, using Ethereum as a base settlement layer.<br></p><p>The typical ZK-rollup is built on top of Ethereum, held fast by two on-chain smart contracts: the “main” contract and a verifier contract. These contracts act like anchors and are responsible for several functions. The main contract stores rollup blocks, monitors the blockchain's state and tracks fund deposits/withdrawals. The verifier contract, on the other hand, authenticates the zero-knowledge proofs submitted to Ethereum, the base layer. <br></p><p>An off-chain virtual machine occupies the second layer of a typical ZK-rollup. As mentioned earlier, ZK-rollups complete transactions in an off-chain environment that does not depend on Ethereum. The off-chain environment is called an off-chain virtual machine, which serves as Layer-2 and is the primary factor that improves scalability and throughput. ZK-rollups process batches of transactions using this off-chain virtual machine and post a validity proof on-chain to validate their activities.<br></p><p>ZK-rollups operate as hybrids, working off-chain but leaning on Ethereum for several things. Firstly, they derive their security from Ethereum since the network enforces the correctness of every update on the ZK-rollup's state and confirms that the data that explains these updates is available. Also, they publish compressed transaction data to Ethereum, while the network operates as a settlement layer for the ZK-rollup and helps resist <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">censorship</a>.<br></p>Merkle tree illustration of zk-Sync’s (a popular ZK-rollup project) volition. (<a href="https://hackmd.io/@canti/rkUT0BD8K">Source</a>)<p>A typical ZK-rollup also has a Layer-2 operator contract, and a supernode, in charge of transaction execution, batching, and Layer-1 submissions. Some ZK-rollups use a single operator, while others rotate their role among a set of proof-of-stake validators.<br></p> Internal mechanisms of ZK-rollups<br> <p>ZK-rollups follow a three-pronged setup that involves transactions, state commitments, and zero-knowledge validity proofs:<br></p>  ZK-rollup users approve transactions and submit them to the Layer-2 operator. This operator is responsible for Layer-2 block production and every activity from transaction validation to publishing compressed data on-chain.  Two <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/blockchain-merkle-tree">Merkle trees</a> represent the ZK-rollup's accounts and balances. After every batch of transactions, the rollup's accounts and balances transition to a new state. This new state is represented by Merkle roots, which are then submitted to the Layer-1 blockchain.  When the operator submits a new state root to Ethereum, the blockchain's state can only change when the operator proves that the root represents valid updates to the rollup's state. Through a zero-knowledge validity proof, the operator proves that the batched transactions are correct. Most ZK-rollups and ZK-rollup projects use <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">ZK-SNARKs</a> or ZK-STARKs. Also, one validity proof can prove other validity proofs, saving more storage space.   Optimistic rollups vs. ZK-rollups: the differences <p>Although both types pf rollups work with the goals of moving computation off-chain while keeping data on-chain in mind, optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups differ in a range of aspects in their modes of operation. The key difference between them is that optimistic rollups rely on fraud proofs, while zk-rollups rely on zero-knowledge proofs to verify changes to the main chain (a state transition).<br></p><p>Optimistic rollups can be described as an “honor system” in which the smart contract on the Layer-1 chain doesn’t check state transitions until a fraud proof’ is posted. In optimistic rollups, when a validator posts a new state root, the smart contract on Layer-1 simply takes the validator’s word at face value and accepts the state transition. Hence, optimistic rollups’ name.<br></p>An illustration of an optimistic rollup. (<a href="https://blog.bitnovo.com/en/what-are-rollups-ethereums-scalability-solution/">Source</a>) Scalability <p>Optimistic rollups provide significantly higher scalability than their zero-knowledge counterparts. Since they do not require computation work to submit transactions on-chain, optimistic rollups can improve scalability far more than ZK-rollups, which do computation work before updating state changes.<br></p><p>However, when it comes to withdrawing funds from rollups to the Layer-1 chain, optimistic rollups seriously lag behind ZK-rollups. This is because the withdrawal of funds is subject to a delay to allow anyone to challenge an exit transaction with a fraud-proof.</p> Challenge periods <p>While ZK-rollups provide cryptographic proofs to validate transactions on-chain, optimistic rollups do not do any computation work and submit transactions on the assumption that they are true. However, optimistic rollups insert a timeframe that allows anyone to challenge the correctness of the data updated by the sequencer.<br></p><p>On the other hand, for ZK-rollups there are no delays or need for a challenge period when withdrawing funds to Ethereum. This is &nbsp;because every state transition is immediately verified with validity proofs.</p> Smart contract capabilities <p>Before 2021, optimistic rollups were the only ones capable of executing smart contracts among all rollup solutions. ZK-rollups could only process simple token transfers and atomic swaps. Since 2021, developers have found a way to implement smart contracts for &nbsp;ZK-rollups.</p> Cost <p>Optimistic rollups do not perform any extra computation work off-chain. Thus, they require lesser transaction costs than ZK-rollups, which cost more due to the creation of validity proofs.</p> Privacy <p>Optimistic rollups can only provide privacy solutions available on base layer blockchain networks since optimistic transactions post all transaction data on-chain.<br></p><p>On the flip side, zero-knowledge rollups have some measure of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/is-privacy-a-human-right-philosophy-economics-legality/">privacy</a> in their makeup. This happens primarily because transaction data is not posted on the base layer individually but only as validity proof.</p> Benefits &amp; drawbacks of ZK-rollup projects <p>Although ZK-rollups have brought much-needed scalability and transaction cost improvements to Layer-1 blockchain networks like Ethereum, there are certain aspects in which they fall short. Here are a few benefits and shortcomings of zero-knowledge rollups:</p> Benefits   ZK-rollups employ trustless cryptographic setups to ensure their security. Compared to the reliance of optimistic rollups on honest validators and sequencers, trustless crypto mechanisms are a safer bet.  ZK-rollups use validity proofs to authenticate off-chain transactions and prevent operators from making incorrect changes to Ethereum's state.  ZK-rollups update the state of their host Layer-1 blockchains by storing compressed transaction data on-chain, thus ensuring security, decentralization, and resistance to censorship.  Transaction finality periods elapse faster with ZK-rollups, as they only need the blockchain to verify validity proofs submitted by the sequencers.  Withdrawal delays are minimal on ZK-rollups, and there is greater capital efficiency for users.  Due to excellent data compression techniques, ZK-rollups reduce the cost of publishing data on-chain, which results in lower fees for users.  Some sidechains and scaling solutions usually require users to validate the blockchain to protect their assets. ZK-rollups do not require such efforts as they do not depend on liveness assumptions.   Drawbacks<br>   ZK-rollups use zero-knowledge-proof systems as an essential part of their frameworks. Some ZK-proof systems usually require <a href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1503409375725109250">trusted setups</a>. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">If a trusted setup is mishandled</a>, it could compromise the rollup's security significantly.  Some ZK-rollups use a single operator, a supernode, as its sequencer. This centralized structure can directly influence transaction order and sometimes trigger censorship.  Zero-knowledge validity proofs are products of computational work, which requires specialized hardware to complete. The resulting high entry barrier limits the position of sequencers to a select few, which puts the chain at risk of centralization.  As expensive hardware requirements reduce the number of participants that can lucratively participate in the chain, the rollup is at risk of attacks from malicious operators and censorship.  Computation and validity proof verification costs are high and can increase fees for rollup users.  ZK-rollups could not support smart contracts until recently because the cost of building <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zkevm-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/">zero-knowledge rollups compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> is high. Also, zero-knowledge technology is complex, making it more challenging to build <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/zkevm">zkEVM</a> solutions.   Most popular ZK-rollup projects <p>Since the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">DeFi</a> rush of 2020, ZK-rollup projects have sprung up in response to the scalability challenges Ethereum has faced. Several of these projects have become popular in the crypto space for their unique solutions and side offerings.<br></p><p>Here are some of the top ZK-rollup projects in the crypto ecosystem today.</p> zkSync <p><a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync</a> is a leading Layer-2 blockchain solution built on Ethereum. The protocol utilizes zero-knowledge rollup technology to scale Ethereum while ensuring security and privacy. zkSync has an upgraded version in the works, which promises to achieve speeds of up to 100,000 transactions per second by combining zero-knowledge rollups with Ethereum sharding.<br></p><p>Several dApps are already active on zkSync, such as Curve, ZigZag, and Taker Protocol. zkSync 2.0 will support smart contract capabilities through Solidity and its (zkSync) native programming language, <a href="https://tibleiz.net/zinc/">Zinc</a>.</p> Hermez A diagram showing Hermez batching up transactions on Layer-2 and sharing validity proof on Layer-1.

The solution aims to decrease transaction costs and support community projects. To achieve the latter, Polygon Hermez adopts a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-donation">Proof-of-Donation</a> mechanism.</p> ​​Aztec Network <p>Aztec is a privacy-by-default smart ZK-rollup solution on Ethereum. The network prides itself as the first of its kind and is built on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf">PLONK</a>, a ZK-SNARK technology used by popular names like Dusk, Zcash, and Mina.<br></p><p>Aztec reduces Ethereum transaction costs by 100x and has a widely-used private transfer protocol, known as zk.money, and a bridge with Ethereum, known as Ethereum Connect.<br></p> StarkNET <p><a href="https://starkware.co/starknet/">StarkNET</a> is a permissionless Layer-2 blockchain protocol that stands out as a zero-knowledge rollup solution. StarkNET, as its name implies, relies on <a href="https://starkware.co/stark/">ZK-STARKs</a> – regarded as the most scalable and safest zero-knowledge-proof system. <br></p><p>StarkNET will support smart contracts and have a native token, which users will use to participate in the network's consensus mechanism, governance, and settle transaction fees.<br></p><p>Other notable ZK-rollup projects include <a href="https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-zero">Polygon Zero</a> and <a href="https://loopring.org/#/">Loopring</a>.</p> Closing thoughts on ZK-rollup projects and the future of these solutions <p>ZK-rollups are here to stay. Even after Ethereum's upgrade, they will continue to help drive scalability and reduce transaction costs on the network while adding additional perks, such as privacy by default in some cases. This is by design, as the Ethereum network highly depends on these alternatives to continue growing towards its goals. <br></p><p>Although they have their fair share of drawbacks, such as the possibility for censorship and centralization, ZK-rollups offer better security than other rollup solutions, as they leverage Ethereum's security model. It’s also worth pointing out that these challenges are by no means permanent and that several ZK-rollup projects are already working to address them.<br></p><p>As the crypto space continues to grow, ZK-rollups will play a vital role in securing the continuity of several <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralized</a> applications and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/user-types-and-use-cases-who-is-panther-for-how-can-they-use-it-c11ccafa4bbf/">use cases</a>. As such, it’s not too unlikely that they will quickly move from relatively niche knowledge to a centerpiece of everyday crypto lingo.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 <p></p><p>Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an umbrella term well-detailed by Christopher Allen, and inspired by many in the Identity community before him, in his 2016 blog post: <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity</a>, which identifies Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity:</p>  Existence. Users must have an independent existence.  Control. Users must control their identities.  Access. Users must have access to their own data.  Transparency. Systems and algorithms must be transparent.  Persistence. Identities must be long-lived.  Portability. Information and services about identity must be transportable.  Interoperability. Identities should be as widely usable as possible.  Consent. Users must agree to the use of their identity.  Minimalization. Disclosure of claims must be minimized.  Protection. The rights of users must be protected.  <p>Since 2016, a lot has happened! There have been a flurry of conventions, discussions, papers, standards, software, and industry wide adoption of technology based on the principles of SSI. The space is at its most mature, and only growing.</p><p><a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-changes-name-to-block">Block</a>’s mission is economic empowerment. Historically, this has looked like building products and offering services such as <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>, enabling millions of merchants to take payments, manage staff, and conduct business in-store and online, and <a href="https://cash.app/">CashApp</a>, which enables millions, especially the un and under-banked to send, spend, bank, and invest their money (and Bitcoin!). When <a href="https://www.tbd.website/">TBD</a>, a new business unit at <a href="https://block.xyz/">Block</a> formed in 2021, we expanded on Block’s mission, setting out to help create a decentralized future that returns ownership and control over your finances, data, and identity. TBD’s mission is strongly aligned with the principles of SSI.</p><p>To facilitate our mission, TBD launched <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5">Web5</a>: a decentralized platform that provides a new identity layer for the web to enable decentralized apps and protocols. Web5 takes SSI concepts, standards, and software and provides them as an opinionated bundle to enable all that self sovereignty and digital identity has to offer. What TBD is building for Web5 has a number of components today, and more tomorrow. Among those are the Self Sovereign Identity SDK and Self Sovereign Identity Service (SSI SDK, and SSI Service), Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN), and Identity Wallets. At the time of writing, all of these components are under active development. This was an intentional move by the team to adopt an ‘open-by-default’ model, and include the community in the development of Web5 from the beginning.</p><p>Here we’ll lay out the vision for a key component of Web5: Self Sovereign Identity. Specifically, how we at TBD are building standards based software in a community towards the goals of SSI and Web5. The two “SSI” named projects — the SSI Service and SSI SDK — sit along side Decentralized Web Nodes, Identity Wallets, User Interfaces, and much more — but focus on a set of standards-based building blocks of the Web5 stack.</p> Software Mission<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>TBD is developing open source, standards-based software to facilitate Self Sovereign Identity on Web5.</p> Open Standards<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The vision of SSI is realized via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard#:~:text=%22Open%20Standards%22%20are%20standards%20made,are%20intended%20for%20widespread%20adoption.">Open Standards</a>. Crucially, these standards are accessible to all: to view and to contribute. You may not be aware of it, but you interact with Open Standards every day: whether via web browsers, hardware you use and their underlying protocols, programming languages, audio files, internet and bluetooth devices, text documents, chat applications, encryption you use and so much more. Open Standards facilitate nearly every aspect of modern computation.</p><p>In the SSI space there a number of standards bodies that facilitate SSI-standard development. Though we may utilize specifications in multiple organizations such as the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>. TBD’s focus thus far has been primarily with the W3C and <a href="http://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> organizations:</p> The W3C<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The W3C, founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> in 1994, is one of the most prominent international standards organizations for the web. The W3C has a number of group types. Community Groups are the most open. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials Community Group</a> focused on Verifiable Credentials, and often serves as a staging ground for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a>, responsible for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model">Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a> (i.e. the Verifiable Credentials specification). The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/did">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a> is responsible for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (i.e. the DID specification).</p><p>TBD is a member of the W3C, actively utilizes the work items from all three groups, and has made contributions to each group’s corpus.</p> The Decentralized Identity Foundation<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation, or DIF, was founded in 2017 to focus on Decentralized Identity. Since then, it’s expanded to house a number of working groups around Identifiers, Claims &amp; Credentials, Sidetree, Secure Data Storage, Wallet Security, Interoperability, and more. DIF produces technical specifications, reference implementations (as in the case of Sidetree and <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion">ION</a>), and coordinates standards and software implementations for players across the industry.</p><p>TBD is a member of DIF, regularly attends working groups, contributing to both interoperability projects, specifications, and technical implementations.</p> Standards in Use<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The set of standards we rely on and use for Web5 is unbound. However, we have a good sense of the standards we begin with. The list below will likely soon be out of date. Consider it as a reference as you orient yourself with what we’re working with.</p>SpecificationStandards BodyDescriptionStatus<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID Core</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/did">W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>Decentralized Identifiers v1.0.Recommendation<a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">DID ION</a><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">DIF Sidetree</a>A layer 2 Decentralized Identifier network that runs atop the Bitcion blockchain, built on the Sidetree protocol.Ratified Specification<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">W3C CCG</a>A simple method to create a DID using a single cryptographic key.Unofficial Draft<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">W3C CCG</a>A DID method that allows bootstrapping trust using a web domain.W3C Internal Document<a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">DID Peer</a><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery</a>A DID method that can be used independent of any central source of truth, intended to be “cheap, fast, scalable, and secure.”Draft<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a>The Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1.Recommendation<a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-integrity">Data Integrity</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a>Describes mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of structured digital documents…such as digital signatures.Editor’s Draft<a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-jws-2020/">JSON Web Signature 2020</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a>A cryptographic suite for the purpose of creating and verifying proofs for JSON Web Signatures using Linked Data Proofs.Editor’s Draft<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-json-schemas/v2/index.html">Verifiable Credentials JSON Schema</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">W3C CCG</a>A mechanism to use JSON schemas to back a Verifiable Credential.Draft<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-list-2021/">Status List 2021</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">W3C CCG</a>A privacy-preserving, space-efficient, and high-performance mechanism for publishing status information such as suspension or revocation of Verifiable Credentials.Draft Community Group Report<a href="https://identity.foundation/JWS-Test-Suite/">VC Proof Format Test Suite</a><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">DIF Claims &amp; Credentials</a>A test suite providing interoperability testing and reporting for Verifiable Credentials and Presentation for Linked Data and JWT signature types.Unofficial Draft<a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">DIF Claims &amp; Credentials</a>A claim format and transport envelope agnostic format for Verifiers to articulate proof requirements, and for Holders to describe proofs according to those requirements.Working Group Draft<a href="https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/">Credential Manifest</a><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">DIF Claims &amp; Credentials</a>A common data format for describing the inputs a Subject must provide to an Issuer for evaluation and issuance of credentials, a means for a Subject to submit an application against those requirements, and a means for an Issuer to fulfill such an application.Pre-Draft<a href="https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/">Trust Establishment</a><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">DIF Claims &amp; Credentials</a>A means of communicating trust statements and relations between parties in decentralized identity environments.Pre-Draft<a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Node</a><a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">DIF Secure Data Storage</a>A DWN is a data storage and message relay mechanism entities can use to locate public or private permissioned data related to a given DID.

There are at least another half dozen either included or planned to be included in our software.</p> TBD Community<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>TBD is interested in building a space for community-driven projects, community members gaining merge and moderation access to community resources, and growing a diverse set of contributors interested in a broad set of use cases to be built on Web5. </p><p>We are not interested in becoming a standards body itself. Instead, we are focused on fostering a self-sustaining community focused on building and building on Web5. To facilitate this, we can expand our existing tools like adding sections of our <a href="https://forums.tbd.website/">Forums</a>, creating new <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">Discord</a> channels, creating new purpose-specific <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">GitHub repositories</a> and investing in new tools for collaboration like an ideas board, job listing page, or a Web5 wiki. I’d love to see a Web5 incubator similar to <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> that facilitates those building on Web5. The future’s possibilities are endless, and we are eager to adapt to the evolving needs of the community.</p><p>Sometimes, we may need more rigorous structure. As such, we are interested in forming working groups in the Web5 community where it makes sense. The output of these groups could be industry coordination, use-case building, software development, or even standards-related work that can be contributed to existing standards bodies. TBD has kicked off one such group to date around Credentials, first focused on creating a path for Know Your Customer (KYC) Credentials. This group already follows such a pattern: having built out <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/credentials-working-group">use-case documentation in GitHub</a>, having a purpose-specific <a href="https://discord.com/channels/937858703112155166/969682739005624412">Discord channel</a>, and <a href="https://forums.tbd.website/c/self-sovereign-identity-users/credentials-working-group/6">forum category</a>. Soon we’ll adapt this group to a more “office hours”-style format, allowing anyone in the community to show off their work, ask for assistance, and help shape our project development roadmaps. </p><p>Today we have one <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">GitHub org</a>, run by the TBD team. We will open up roles for community management. Creating light processes for community-driven moderation and maintenance (e.g. managing pull requests, issues, labels, and milestones), in addition to having projects and repositories started and managed entirely by members of the community. One such idea we are considering is for a new GitHub organization for the “Web5 Community” to foster and highlight community-driven efforts. We’re additionally looking to launch an Incubation program that gives a formal path towards recognizing and promoting the work that begins in a grassroots manner in our community. We plan on making the rest of our tooling community-driven as well: today this means Discord and the Forums, tomorrow it will be a lot more!</p><p>While this is something we are focused on internally, it is crucial that you as community members are able to make suggestions, plans, and directly influence change. Reach out on Discord, our Forums, gain mindshare for your ideas, and we will help make them a reality.</p> Open Source<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The foundations of Web5 are <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">open source</a>. This means that its source code is publicly available and, as stewards, we rely on external contribution—Web5 is only successful with the full innovation of a global community. Certainly there are cases where code cannot be open source for various reasons: this applies to the TBD business as well as members of our community. We do not mandate open source, but it is a guiding principle. We believe in the power of open, and all that comes with it. The more open Web5 can be, the better it will be.</p><p>Projects in the TBD GitHub may originate at TBD, or through the community (on our Discord, Forums). Today, the TBD team is acting as the primary steward and maintainer of all projects. As the community matures, we expect it to take the lead and for TBD to assume a higher-level maintainer role. We imagine this ends up looking like more community-driven projects, community members gaining merge and moderation access, and growing a diverse set of contributors interested in a broad set of use cases to be built on Web5. More broadly, we want to push forward to a world where TBD does not have the only, or final say on any Web5 decision: decentralization is a strength in the development of Web5.</p><p>This transition is only made possible by active engagement from the community. It is the reason our code is open, and we have set up avenues for engagement. We look towards the community to engage with TBD and others, and push for the future we wish to see built.</p> Software Vision<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>TBD is fostering a set of community-driven, open source, standards-based software to facilitate Self Sovereign Identity on Web5.</p><p>We want to realize the vision of the Web5 community: to build pragmatic standards-based software that serves a wide variety of needs. The software shall not be tied to any specific entity, nor, without good reason, exclude possibilities within the SSI space. Balancing both feature-richness and complexity we must work closely with our users to design software that meets the needs of all who wish to be on Web5. We think in terms of toolkits, composed of the purpose-specific tools in them. These toolkits exist in a hierarchy of abstractions from which powerful, intuitive, and human-centric software can be built.</p><p>The software must be designed in a flexible, modular manner. This means interfaces that feature a default implementation or two, but can be extended to facilitate integration into many systems (e.g. swapping out databases, encryption methods, credential formats as needed). The software is intended to be built on open standards in the SSI space. The standards space is fast-changing and there may be cases where we use ill-defined and ill-supported standards; we must be able to favor practicality and working implementations over robust standards with a commitment to see the standards through. There may be cases where we use our software to innovate past the current state of these standards and open the opportunity to contribute back to existing standards and standards bodies.</p><p>We recognize that the SSI ecosystem is full of competing and developing standards. Often this can feel like developing against a set of moving targets and promises of feature sets. There’s a lot of information to grok and everyone has an opinion—this is a good thing! It can be difficult to pick winners, and even more difficult to choose between multiple standards that appear to do the same thing: we do not want to create a Swiss Army knife that contains five different types of scissors, we’d rather it contain one (or maybe two) scissors that get the job done well 99% of the time. We favor evaluating the addition of features and standards on a case-by-case basis, and looking towards implementations of standards and features that are well-reasoned, with committed developers. Bonus points if there is already demonstrated usage and interoperability.</p><p>We also recognize that the SSI ecosystem uses a wide set of tools, languages, and technologies: working across web browsers, mobile applications, backend servers, ledgers, and more. For languages we’ve started with <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> (for the SSI SDK and SSI Service) because of its robust cryptographic support, speed, ability to be compiled to <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WASM</a>, and, above all else, simplicity. It is crucial that the code we write is approachable to encourage contribution. Simple and clear is always preferred over clever. The future is multi-language, and multi-platform. We welcome initiatives for improving multi-language and multi-platform support, and are open to fostering them into our GitHub organization.</p> SSI SDK<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Named <code>ssi-sdk</code>, this SDK encapsulates a set of standards related to <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">Self Sovereign Identity</a>. The <code>ssi-sdk</code> intends to provide flexible functionality based on a set of standards-based primitives for building decentralized identity applications in a modular manner: with limited dependencies between components.</p><p>Primarily, the SDK serves to support Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials and their associated standards. Interacting with Decentralized Identifiers: resolving identifiers, signing, verifying, encrypting, and decrypting data using cryptographic keys found in DID Documents. Interacting with Verifiable Credentials: creating and using data schemas, facilitating credential application, issuance, and exchange.</p><p>The SDK is an active work in progress, and can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk">TBD GItHub</a>.</p> SSI Service<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The Self Sovereign Identity Service (SSIS) facilitates all things relating to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model">Verifiable Credentials</a> — in a box! The service is a part of a larger <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5">Decentralized Web Platform</a> architecture. The SSI Service is a JSON-API web service that wraps the <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk">ssi-sdk</a> to facilitate user-focused interactions on Web5. The service is intended to interact with user interfaces, wallets, decentralized web nodes, and other web infrastructure. </p><p>By taking the lower-level building blocks exposed by the SDK, the service is intended to drastically lower the barrier to entry for any individual or organization interesting in building on the Web5 stack. Like the SDK, it is agnostic to any specific business or use case, and design to be pluggable into external infrastructure whether existing or new. </p><p>The service is assumed to be run by a single organization and assumes external authentication and authorization. The service assumes no infrastructure requirements and is flexible to multiple deployment models, databases, key management solutions, and user interfaces. We expect that a wide array of users and use cases will use and build on top of the service, creating layers of abstraction and intermediation for processing business logic, handling user accounts, and so on.</p><p>The service is an active work in progress, and can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-service">TBD GItHub</a>.</p> How Features are Developed<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>We are in the early days of Web5. By intention, we’ve announced our ideas and projects way before they are ready for an alpha release, let alone inclusion in a production-ready application. Transparency is an asset in sharing our thinking and gaining mindshare for what we are building. As such, there are many forks in the road fast-approaching. To move past these forks, and the forks after those I introduce some light process to guide principled decision making:</p>  Features shall be developed using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic method</a>: making statements, interrogating them, asking whys and hows, being intellectually honest with risk, uncertainty, consider second, third and n-order effects.  All new feature proposals shall include a light design document outlining desired functionality, end-user utility, prior art, room for improvement and next steps, risks and mitigations, considerations, and open questions.  A quorum of project maintainers shall review and progress feature proposals in a timely manner.  <p>Templates for the aforementioned process have been created on each GitHub repository. I encourage you to create GitHub issues and Forum discussions to explore thinking, and revise designs before going forth with a contribution.</p><p>For templates on feature development, philosophies on versioning and releases, and more information view our GitHub documentation: </p><p><a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-service">SSI Service GitHub Docs</a> | <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk">SSI SDK GitHub Docs</a></p> The Goal<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>I believe in setting public and ambitious measurable goals. This serves as a powerful self-discipline mechanism, as well as a call to action for forward progress. Officially the <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/web5-roadmap">timeline for Web5 can be found on our site</a>. Unofficially, here is my ambition:</p><p>By January 1st 2023 the following shall be true:</p>  The first beta release of the SSI SDK and SSI Service (0.1.0) will be released.  Each SSI project will have &gt;75% test coverage.  Each project will have robust user and developer documentation with clear examples.  The SSI SDK will have feature complete specification implementations for at least all fifteen standards identified above.  The SSI Service will be deployable in an infrastructure-agnostic manner, demonstrated on ≥ 2 platforms.  The SSI Service will facilitate practical end-user flows facilitating:  Creating and managing DIDs using ≥ 2 DID methods  Creating and issuing Verifiable Credentials backed by JSON schemas  Creating Credential Manifests, accepting Credential Applications, and fulfilling Credential Applications  Creating Presentation Definitions, sending Presentation Requests, and accepting Presentation Submissions  Creating Credential Revocations and checking Credentials against them  Creating and processing Trust Establishment documents    The SSI SDK and Service will support the Decentralized Web Node specification and the Service will work with at least one DWN.   Parting Thoughts<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>You should now have a pretty good sense of how we conceive of SSI software on Web5, and how its journey will unfold. Most importantly the mission is not TBD’s alone, it is that of the community. We build real software for real people and favor pragmatism above all else. What I’ve written here is current thinking and is always subject to evolution—with your help. I’m looking forward to you joining us in pushing SSI and Web5 forward, gaining new perspectives, solving new use-cases, and building some cool shit.</p>

 The issue with Bitcoin privacy <p>Bitcoin can be anonymous, but it is not private by default. Every transaction and address balance is publicly visible to everyone on the distributed ledger known as the blockchain. While this is good for decentralized auditability, it is bad for privacy.</p><p>There are two types of financial privacy within the scope of this article: transaction privacy: concealing the source or destination and balance privacy, concealing someone's net worth. The equivalent of privacy on Bitcoin was originally intended to be achieved through the assumption that bitcoin addresses are not associated with any identity. But in reality, bitcoin addresses are commonly or easily associated with identities. Many people get bitcoins from a source that complies with overreaching government regulations known as KYC (know your customer) requirements. Bitcoins that are obtained from a KYC source are tagged to your identity. Even if you obtain your bitcoin from an anonymous source, it can be tied to your identity the moment you purchase something from a business that needs to collect your information for something as simple as shipping information or email address. If the business you are paying is using a 3rd party payment processing service that complies with KYC, then your bitcoin can no longer be considered anonymous. Even if the business you are paying is using a self-hosted payment system, your information could still be leaked if the business gives up your data intentionally, unintentionally, or via government coercion. Even if you do achieve transaction privacy, you still have to worry about balance privacy. You might not want people you do business with to know your entire net worth.</p> Various Solutions to Bitcoin Privacy <p>Fortunately, there are ways to use Bitcoin privately. The methods to use bitcoin with privacy include coinjoins, coinswaps, The Lightning Network, state chains, off-chain physical transactions (such as opendimes) and WabiSabi, A method recently introduced in Wasabi Wallet 2.0.</p> Explanation of Coinjoins <p>For transaction privacy, a coinjoin conceals a bitcoin's future post-coinjoin activity from the past and conceals the past pre-coinjoin activity from the future. The coinjoin acts as an opaque wall in a timeline that transactions pass through. If a sender of bitcoin coinjoins, the recipient is unable to determine how the sender obtained the funds. If a recipient of the bitcoin coinjoins, the sender is unable to determine what the recipient does with the funds.</p><p>There are what I consider two types of common coinjoins, a mixing coinjoin and a spending coinjoin. A "mixing coinjoin" is used for the sole purpose of making bitcoin anonymous for future use. A "spending coinjoin" is when a coinjoin is used at the time of making a transaction to someone else, in which a recipient receives bitcoin from a sender directly as an output of a coinjoin.</p><p>For balance privacy, a coinjoin can also conceal someone's full net worth. One way to do so is for a sender to pay a recipient directly from a coinjoin, via a "spending coinjoin". Another way is to use a coinjoin to break up someone's balance spread across multiple addresses that are not associated with each other. This is how it is often done with a "mixing coinjoin".<br></p>

   NymConnect is now available for use with the desktop versions of the popular Telegram messaging app!  NymConnect is a one-click interface enabling you to privacy-enhance the apps you use everyday, by having them run over the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.  The Nym mixnet hides your IP address or other unique identifiers from your internet packets so snoopers on the internet can not see what applications you are

 💡Findora Validator Spotlight — Brother.FRA💡  Validator Spotlights showcase the great teams working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain. Here are Brother.FRA’s responses to some questions from the Findora community.  1) Tell Us About&nbsp;Yourself <p>Hello, My name is Kevin and I run the Brother.FRA validator on Findora. I also run a validator on the Harmony called BrotherOne and a master node for Pac Protocol. I have about 1 ½ years of experience with validating for&nbsp;crypto.</p> 2) What brought you into crypto/web3 in the first&nbsp;place? <p>I was an investor first and saw the potential of becoming a developer, and I decided to start by becoming a validator with zero experience. Technology has always been my forte, and I was looking for an opportunity to learn and grow my skills. Learning how to establish a validator would open the door to help achieve this goal. I love our crypto community and how supportive they are, and it drove me to search for ways to contribute. The relationship and friendships that I have built along the way have been a huge blessing.</p><p>Learning more about Web3 and how I can integrate it with our validator ecosystem is exciting. I’m looking forward to our Web3 Future and Findora’s contribution to&nbsp;Web3.</p> 3) What is your experience in validating or web3 in&nbsp;general? <p>I started with very little web design experience in 2012. That experience gave me some idea of what I was getting into, but I knew it would be different. It was difficult, but I had to learn everything from scratch. I am still learning, and I look forward to learning new things every day. Web3 is still new to me, but it is the future that I will come to familiarize myself&nbsp;with.</p> 4) What makes your operation unique? <p>I run my Harmony node with an at-home hardware server. I plan to do the same with my Brother.FRA validator.</p><p>Running an at-home server not only saves me out-of-pocket costs, but it also allows us to upgrade our machines. I have a partnership with an NFT project that is in the works, and I plan to integrate my validator with the project as a unique incentive for our delegators.</p><p>As we grow, we may be able to also establish future partnerships with DAPPs to provide services that are unique to validators for delegators. We are always open to these types of partnerships, and we encourage these services to reach out to us via Twitter or Telegram.</p><p>I do make guides as well for my delegators. If you’re new to Findora and want to learn how to stake or how to take your $FRA off from your exchange. You can do so here with our Medium Guide: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/FindoraG">https://tinyurl.com/FindoraG</a></p> 5) Why do you want to validate with&nbsp;Findora? <p>“Brother” has always been about crypto and how to expand into different protocols to support them and help grow their community. BrotherOne was the first and we branched out to Pac Protocol. Findora became my 3rd choice for Brother to validate with. Findora is unique and has some similarities to Harmony that I enjoyed personally.</p><p>ZK and privacy is something that I took an interest in, and I decided to help Findora with our services. With Brother.FRA I plan to dive deeper and learn more about privacy and how to leverage it for our delegators. ZK is also something brand new to me, and I want to see how I can help educate our delegators to learn about these new initiatives and how to utilize&nbsp;them.</p><p>There are a lot of opportunities with Findora, and we want to provide our services to the Findora community.</p> 6) Where can our community go to learn more about&nbsp;you? <p>Best place to find&nbsp;me:</p>  Twitter: @OniiiOne — <a href="https://twitter.com/oniiione?s=21&amp;t=h3GIXXlpWQ2S1J04rHD_pg">https://twitter.com/oniiione?s=21&amp;t=h3GIXXlpWQ2S1J04rHD_pg</a>  Telegram @kevkellius  Instagram: @brotherone_validator — <a href="https://instagram.com/brotherone_validator?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">https://instagram.com/brotherone_validator?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=</a>  Website: brotherone.net  How to stake with Brother.FRA:  <p>I wanted to thank everyone for your time and for listening to my story. I hope it will inspire you to contribute to the growth of Findora. You don’t have to be a developer or know everything there is to know about crypto. All it requires is your determination and a willingness to learn. Thank you for your time. Reach out to me at any time, and I’ll be happy to respond and help you&nbsp;out.</p> 7) How to delegate funds to Brother.FRA? <p>(Inserted by Findora DAO editors) When you go to stake FRA from the <a href="https://wallet.findora.org/">Findora Wallet</a>, you can select Brother.FRA.

<p>Following the recent launch of <a>Solana DApp support in our browser (version 1.41</a>), we’re thrilled to announce that nine leading DApps on Solana have joined Brave’s Wallet Partner program. Six new Ethereum and/or EVM-compatible DApps have also joined the program this month. This brings the total of partners to 27 since the inception of our program <a>just two months ago</a>, as the Brave browser continues to expand its Web3 integrations.</p>
<p>Through this program, partners add Brave Wallet to their list of supported wallet connections and co-market their DApp integration with Brave using the browser’s marketing channels, blogs, communities, and social media.</p>
<p>In addition to raising awareness of Brave Wallet, the program also offers an opportunity for Brave and its partners to work together on further BAT utility projects or integrations.</p>
<p>These are the 15 projects Brave is excited to welcome to the Wallet Partner program this month:</p>

 Aldrin 
<p><a href="https://aldrin.com/">Aldrin</a> is building what they deem is the best swap experience and set of tools to allow anyone to earn passive income through DeFi. Their mission is to help you cut your lifetime of work in half. They focus on the finer details to create a seamless user experience. When it comes to security, Aldrin doesn’t leave anything behind—the automated market maker (AMM) is audited by Kudelski, whose past projects include Solana and Binance. With over 450 trading pairs and 180 liquidity pools, users have a wide range of options to either swap, trade, stake, or provide liquidity.</p>
<p>“Integrating Brave is opening the doors to new users who will be able to use the power of DeFi. There is still a lack of knowledge amongst the masses when it comes to DeFi products and what they’re capable of—we want to show them that both pro traders and newcomers can reap the same benefits in the same platform,” said the team at Aldrin.</p>

 ApolloX 
<p><a href="https://www.apollox.finance/">ApolloX</a> is an industry-leading decentralized solution shaping Web3 trading for retail and institutional traders. Its product suite consists of ApolloX DEX, the biggest decentralized crypto derivatives exchange on BNB Chain, and ApolloX DEX Engine, a bespoke, ready-to-go solution for partners looking to launch their own derivatives DEX. Notable DeFi platforms like PancakeSwap, LaunchZone and SafePal leverage ApolloX DEX Engine to seamlessly deploy derivatives trading on their platforms in just a few steps.</p>
<p>“Integrating Brave Wallet with ApolloX empowers millions of users around the world to explore ApolloX’s unique platform and tap into thriving DeFi ecosystems. We’re thrilled to be working with Brave to advance our shared vision of the Web,” said a lead member at ApolloX.</p>

 Bonfida 
<p><a href="https://bonfida.org/">Bonfida</a>’s primary product is the Solana Name Service (SNS). SNS has a straightforward mission of providing users with a Web3 ID. One of the clear benefits of the name service is a human-readable name that maps to a SOL address. Wallet address formats can be a barrier to entry, and therefore having an identifiable address can facilitate payments, efficiency, and overall user experience in our sphere. A name, not a number.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty simple; crypto shouldn’t be difficult or confusing. The Solana Name Service has a beeline focus on convenience and enhancing user experience and in this manner, we will contribute to Brave’s native crypto browsing experience. Together, we can make Web3 easy and accelerate mass adoption amongst Brave’s robust community. We offer an identity, a name, a product with vast use cases but at the core, a domain name that cares to help users have the best Web3 experience,” bonfida.sol said.</p>

 Cropper 
<p><a href="https://cropper.finance/">Cropper</a> is the most comprehensive launchpad on Solana, providing initial dex offerings (IDO) to carefully vetted projects, as well as a range of associated services to help build their initial liquidity within the ecosystem. Services include Liquidity Pool, Yield Farming, Staking, Bonding or Option Mining.</p>
<p>“Cropper is on a mission to provide all users with a secure and enjoyable platform for staking, farming, IDO participations, and more. To continue these efforts, integrating Brave Wallet to Cropper is essential. In doing so, we can provide more users with unique DeFi opportunities, as well as ensure a secure and user-friendly wallet option. We look forward to continuing working closely with the Brave team in a joint effort to increase DeFi access and adoption across the globe,” said Croppish, core contributor at Cropper.</p>

 Holaplex 
<p><a href="https://www.holaplex.com/">Holaplex</a> provides enterprise-grade NFT commerce solutions and is the trusted technology partner for top brands and Web3 protocols, with over 10k creators utilizing our open source, decentralized products on Solana.

 Honeyswap 
<p><a href="https://honeyswap.org/">Honeyswap</a> is a decentralized exchange (DEX), deployed and maintained by 1Hive DAO. It’s the first Uniswap V2 Fork deployed outside of Ethereum mainnet, on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai). Honeyswap is deployed both on Gnosis and Polygon sidechains and utilizes the eco-routing developed by dxDao, acting as an aggregator that finds the best routes for your trades based on the available liquidity on all the other DEXs it supports. What makes Honeyswap unique is that the trading fees collected by the protocol are used to buy back HNY, which is, in turn, used to fund public goods. Hence, the more volume, the more public goods are funded through 1Hive. “Together we thrive,’’ said the1Hive DAO contributors.</p>

 Jet Protocol 
<p><a href="https://www.jetprotocol.io/">Jet Protocol</a> is a non-custodial borrowing and lending protocol built on Solana. Jet is evolving rapidly and recently implemented its own governance UI—JetGovern—that enables token holders to participate in JetDAO to vote and shape the protocol. Jet’s core MVP is an innovative cross-margin pooled lending protocol. The latest iteration of the Jet Protocol is internally named ‘V2’ and is set to launch in 2022. It’s focused on margin trading (Jet Margin) and fixed-rate, fixed-term borrowing and lending (Jet Bonds).</p>
<p>Jet’s Co-Founder James Moreau said, “Given Brave’s broad and growing adoption, focus on security and user experience, as well as a crypto-native ethos, we’re thrilled to see them support Solana-based web applications such as Jet Protocol through a browser wallet interface.”</p>

 Marinade 
<p><a href="https://marinade.finance/">Marinade</a> is the first non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Solana. Its mission is to strengthen and decentralize Solana and onboard more people around the world to DeFi. Marinade is the creator of the mSOL token: a collateralized version of SOL a user receives when they stake their SOL in the Marinade staking pool. Holders of mSOL tokens not only earn yield on their staked SOL, but can also use the fully liquid mSOL collateral token to earn additional yield through a growing selection of DeFi strategies. Marinade is a DAO with a governance token, MNDE, which can be locked to mint a Chef NFT that enables governance power and the ability to vote on validator and liquidity mining gauges.</p>
<p>“Marinade applauds Brave Wallet’s integration of Solana and support of SPL tokens. Internet users come to Brave because they seek performance, security, and censorship resistance. And now when they connect the Brave Wallet to the Marinade DApp to liquid stake their SOL for mSOL, not only are they getting SOL staking yield without sacrificing DeFi opportunities, but they are also playing a role in creating a more decentralized and performant Solana blockchain,” said Michael Repetny, Growth at Marinade.</p>

 NounsDAO 
<p><a href="https://nouns.wtf/">Nouns</a> is a generative non-fungible token (NFT) project on the Ethereum blockchain. Nouns are 32x32 pixelated NFT characters based on people, places, and things. One noun is auctioned every 24 hours, forever. Each Noun sold contributes to a treasury governed by Nouns holders, where one Noun is equal to one vote. At the time of writing, the DAO holds 26,354 ETH or roughly $43,800,000 USD. Nouns are <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">CC0</a> and fully open-source, which means the rights and project’s code are shared in the public domain. This status has allowed Nouns to proliferate freely via <a href="https://nouns.center/projects">over a hundred </a>derivative collections, works of art, communities, and products. Nouns are characterized by their Nounish glasses, sometimes referred to as Noggles. The ultimate goal of the NounsDAO is to expand the reach of their brand, what they call “The Nouns Virtuous Cycle: Nouns is a protocol for proliferating Nouns.”</p>

<p>More than one user has wondered what are hash functions, a term usually thrown around the more technical crypto circles.<br></p><p>The word 'hash' may evoke memories of meat and potatoes, chopped and mixed. However, food is the last thing on the menu. With hash functions, computers take center stage. Hash functions are all around us as long as we interact with websites, digital wallets, cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-laymans-guide-for-privacy-enhancing-technologies-24e210f550b7/">privacy enhancing technologies</a>, etc.<br></p><p>If you cannot understand the phrase 'hash function' when you come across it, this article is for you. We will explore everything about hash functions, their importance in the modern digital world, types of hash functions, and properties of a strong hash function.</p> What are hash functions? <p>A hash is, in short, a confusing mess. This word is used to describe the result of a person making a mess out of something and making everything worse. In computing, a hash is a result produced by a hash function, and it usually looks like letters, numbers or both jumbled up together in a way that makes no sense to the human mind. A hash function is a storage-saving tool that computers use to scramble data inputs and convert them into numerical values of fixed or variable lengths. <br></p><p>If you’ve watched enough spy movies, you must have heard of scrambled calls, which shut out unauthorized listeners by muddling up a conversation such that it becomes unintelligible. Hash functions take data of varying lengths and transform them into unintelligible (to humans) numeric or alphanumeric values called hash values, hash codes, or simply hashes. Unlike scrambled calls, which you can unscramble, hash functions are unidirectional, i.e., they must produce hashes that cannot be unscrambled into the original data.</p>Simple diagram illustrating a hash function. (<a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/06/what-is-a-hash-function-within-cryptography-quick-guide/">Source</a>)<p></p><p>Hash values are unique, with none having a similar makeup to another, which makes them similar to human fingerprints. They are usually stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash tables</a> for easy access, and are of the same length if produced by the same type of hash function. <br></p>Regardless of the size of input message, a hash function always gives an output of fixed size. (<a href="https://medium.com/@hitensangtani89/fundamentals-of-hash-algorithms-and-brief-explanation-of-sha1-algorithm-5fcff2473515">Source</a>)<p></p><p>For instance, if you scramble your 16-character Facebook password with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA256</a> hash function and a 56-character web link, the resulting hash values will be of the same length – a 64-character fingerprint. Even if you hashed a 10,000-word essay with SHA256, the hash length would remain unchanged.</p> How do hash functions work? <p>You must wonder how hash functions scramble data to produce fixed-length hash values or digests. Here's a simple breakdown: <br></p>  The hash function takes a key as an input.  The key is usually associated with a record and serves as a unique identifier of the record to the data storage and retrieval application.  The key could be of a fixed length, like numbers between 10 and 20, or varying lengths, like names, or the record itself in some cases.  The hash function converts the keys of fixed or varying lengths into fixed-length codes, usually of machine length. The function employs operators like ADD or XOR to fold the inputs by words or other units and preserve their parity.  The hash function then scrambles the key's bits to distribute the resulting values uniformly over the keyspace.  When the hash function scrambles the record, it produces an output, a hash code, which is then used to index a hash table that holds the data or other pointers to the records.   Applications of hash functions <p>Do you know what happens in the backend when you try to log into an account with your email and password? Password verification is one of the major uses of cryptographic hash functions.<br></p><p>During signin up to any online platform, your password is often stored in the hash table as a hashcode. When you input your password during a login session, the hash function creates a checksum for the password you entered and compares it to the saved checksum in the hash table. If both <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/363735/what-is-a-checksum-and-why-should-you-care/">checksums</a> are identical, access will be granted. If not, you’ll get an incorrect password message.<br></p><p>Hash functions are also leveraged for file verification. If you want to download a file from an untrusted website and its checksum is provided, you can check if it matches the checksum of the original file on the trusted site.<br></p><p>Besides passwords and file integrity verification, Hash functions also come in handy in data storage and retrieval applications and have a wide range of uses, including:<br></p>  Signature generation and verification  Data or file identifiers  Proof of work algorithm such as <a href="http://www.hashcash.org/">Hashcash</a> to counter email spams and denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks.  Hashcash is also leveraged in proof of work consensus mechanism such as <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin</a>   Types of hash functions <p>There are everal types of hash function variations, and their distinct modes of operation set them apart. Here are a few of the most significant types of hash functions in computing:</p> Folding <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/folding-method-in-hashing/">Folding</a> hash functions utilize a simple two-step method to generate hash codes. First, the key value (k) is split up into a fixed number of parts, each with the same number of digits (the last part can have fewer digits). Then, the sum of all the parts will be the hash value of the input key. The number of digits in each part depends on the hash table size.</p> Mid-Squares<br> <p><a href="https://www.digitalbithub.com/learn/mid-square-method-hashing">Mid-squares</a> hash functions produce hash values by squaring the input (key) and extracting a fixed number of middle digits or bits from the result of their multiplication. This type of hash function usually works when the data to be hashed is a numerical value, and it works well when there are few leading or trailing zeros in the record's key.<br></p>Mid-square hashing method – a type of hash function. (<a href="https://www.digitalbithub.com/learn/mid-square-method-hashing">Source</a>) Identity hash function <p>An <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16267567">identity hash function</a> comes into play when the data hashed is small, depending on the hash code length of the programming language you intend to use. With the condition of size fulfilled, you can use the input data as a hash value, although it gets reinterpreted as an integer. This type of hash function can be used to map zip codes to city names.</p> Division hashing <p>As one of the easiest ways to generate a hash code, division hashing uses a simple formula that divides the value of k by M, where k is the input key and M is the hash table size (usually a prime number). Although it is fast and great for any value of M, <a href="https://www.digitalbithub.com/learn/division-modulo-method-hashing-technique">division hashing</a> performs poorly by mapping consecutive keys to consecutive hash codes on the hash table.</p> Multiplicative hashing <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf2V77ut-B0">multiplicative hashing</a>, a constant value A is selected such that A is greater than zero but less than one. Then, we find the product of the input key and A, after which we extract the fractional portion X (all the digits after the decimal point). X is then multiplied by the size of the hash table, and the result is the hash code. This type of hashing is best suited to scenarios when the hash table size is the power of two.</p> Properties of strong hash functions algorithms Properties of a strong hash function. (<a href="https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers/problem-5-20-marks-consider-following-hash-function-takes-input-r-arbitrary-size-produces--q41956208">Source</a>)<p></p><p>For any hashing algorithm to pass as strong, it must have the following properties:</p> Irreversibility <p>Also known as preimage resistance, irreversibility is an essential property of a strong hash function. With a good hash function, it should be impractical to reverse the hashcode and recover the original input message. Strong hashing functions are one-way and irreversible.</p> Determinism <p>A strong hash function should always produce an output of the same size regardless of the input data size. This feature is known as determinism. Whether you are hashing the first and last names or an entire book, the hash codes produced by a specific hash function must be of the same size.</p> Collision resistance <p>Collisions in hashing occurs when two unique data inputs produce identical hashcodes. Collisions prove that a hashing function is broken and unsafe, which could invite malicious actors to manipulate data. Hash codes are unique to their data inputs, and collisions are unnatural occurrences for hashing algorithms. A robust hashing algorithm should be resistant to collision.</p> Avalanche effect <p>A strong hashing function must produce an avalanche effect when there is even the slightest change to the input key. If something as simple as a comma is added to the input, the output hashing value will change significantly.</p> Hash speed <p>A robust hashing algorithm is expected to compute hash values swiftly. Hash speed, however, is somewhat subjective, depending on how you intend to use the hashing algorithm. In some cases, like website connections, faster hashing algorithms are best suited to the job. When hashing passwords, it is best to use <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/150620/what-is-the-purpose-of-slowing-down-the-calculation-of-a-password-hash">slower hashing functions</a> to make sure it will much slower to brute-force the password. Thus, making it almost impossible to brute-force a large set of password database.</p> Applicability <p>A strong hash function must be applied in various situations and support varying input string values, hash table sizes, and seed types. For instance, a hash function that only allows specific table sizes, seed types, and limited string lengths, is less valuable than one you can use in various situations.</p> Uniformity <p>Strong hash functions must ensure uniformity by mapping input values evenly across their output range. Uniformity, in this case, demands that an exact probability is used to generate each hash code in the output range. Uniformed distributions keep collisions minimal, regardless of input size, which is vital for efficient hashing. <br></p> You can now answer to anyone asking “what are hash functions?”... but it doesn’t stop there <p>Hash functions are without a doubt a backbone of the modern Internet age. From password verifications, signature generation and data identifiers to blockchain networks, cryptographic hash functions are being used to make the digital world more secure, verifiable, and enhance users’ <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">privacy</a>.<br>As you can imagine, the rabbit hole of hash functions goes deep, and as you increase your technical knowledge you can continue to explore it.

 Light wallet is near (with the Zelcore desktop wallet) 

<p>Veil release 1.3.0.0 completes RingCT light-wallet API necessary for private use of Veil in the Zelcore Desktop light wallet. (Further work is needed for inclusion in the Zelcore mobile wallet.)</p>

<p>Stay tuned for Zelcore’s release of Veil in their Zelcore desktop wallet!</p>

<p>This will enable users who do not want to maintain a full node to hold Veil in their own custody, with their own private keys, and to use it privately through RingCT anonymous transactions.</p>

 Also imminent is a DAG reduction for proof of work miners using the ProgPoW algorithm 

<p>We have held off from including the DAG reduction in today’s release, because the most popular mining software was not yet ready, and the mining community preferred to wait a little longer.</p>

<p>The Veil mining community is excited and looking forward to using mining GPUs with smaller memory before the existing code makes it impossible to mine, and also hope to gain the attention of the miners with new and old GPUs who have been mining Ethereum as the end of Ethereum proof of work looms.</p>

 <a href="https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/FIPs/blob/main/FIPs/fip-2.md">FIP-2</a> is a recent community proposal that would create auditable assets on Findora. These assets could be audited by the issuer but would remain protected on-chain from public&nbsp;view.  Tl;dr <p>❗️FIP-2 proposes the creation of Auditable Privacy-Preserving Assets (APPA), tokens that issuers could track for the sake of regulatory compliance, internal audits, and forensic investigation.</p><p>❗️️️️APPAs are a new class of asset, not necessarily a token standard, and the Findora community would have the choice to use them or&nbsp;not.</p><p>❗️APPAs could open many new use-cases, especially for stablecoins.</p><p>❗️APPAs could be used to identify tainted tokens with the issuer’s permission.</p><p>❗️APPAs are the first step in auditability using zero-knowledge proofs, and Findora hopes to use similar technology for on-chain IDs and&nbsp;KYC.</p> What is&nbsp;FIP-2? <p>FIP-2 is a comprehensive design for auditable assets and is one of the first constructions of its kind. It enables Findora to offer an asset class that no other project currently offers, though many have discussed it.</p><p>Essentially, FIP-2 creates a new asset class called Auditable Privacy-Preserving Assets or APPAs. Institutions that issue APPAs will be able to see their movements, even though their movements won’t be visible on-chain. Only APPA issuers can audit these assets and provide transaction data, if necessary, for standard reporting and/or criminal investigation.</p><p>FIP-2 is not a response to recent drama regarding blockchain privacy. It’s a feature that has long been on Findora’s roadmap and one that distinguishes Findora from other privacy projects.</p> Why Privacy Needs Auditability <p>Privacy is not only an expectation but also a financial primitive — businesses and individuals rely on it. However, safety, accountability, and trust are also financial primitives, ones that aren’t capable in many existing privacy projects. To build a financial system with privacy, there must be room at some point for auditability.</p><p>Many will probably ask such questions as: What is the point of auditability in a privacy chain like Findora? Isn’t the point to make it so that assets can’t be audited? Is this a case of a feature looking for a&nbsp;problem?</p><p>As it turns out, many institutions have been asking for something like FIP-2. It would allow them to move major capital into Web3, something they haven’t been able to do because of the inability to protect user data, guard proprietary trading secrets, and comply with the many stringent reporting regulations in the financial sector.</p><p>The primary use case for FIP-2 is centered around stablecoins issuers. They would be able to comply with OFAC regulations and keep liquidity in DeFi. The ability to audit their tokens would allow them to identify tainted tokens so that their users could reject them, and allow them to use stablecoins to set up prepaid debit cards for easy transactions.</p><p>APPAs would allow institutions to conduct internal audits, prevent money laundering, and expose any illicit activity or fraud happening with their assets. It’s another key feature on Findora that would make web3 more practical and attractive to institutional capital.</p> What FIP-2&nbsp;Isn’t <p>It is important to be clear about a few things FIP-2 does not&nbsp;do.</p> FIP-2 Is NOT Mandatory <p>FIP-2 is not a proposal to turn all assets on Findora to APPAs. Instead, it creates an optional class of assets that projects can choose to use if they want. Findora users can choose whether or not they want to use&nbsp;APPAs.</p> FIP-2 does NOT Apply to&nbsp;FRA <p>FRA is the native token of Findora and is completely decentralized. If a private transaction occurs with FRA, it cannot be tracked publicly. FIP-2 does not change that. Further, FRA cannot be frozen even by the Findora Foundation. Findora and its FRA native token would remain permissionless, accessible to all, and freely tradable.</p> FIP-2 does NOT Affect Decentralization <p>APPAs issued by a centralized entity, like USDC or USDT on Findora, could be frozen because any asset issued by a centralized entity can be frozen. APPAs aren’t creating a centralized asset, they are giving centralized or decentralized issuers another tool in the toolbox when issuing assets. If the issuer wants APPAs to be centralized, they will be. If the issuer is decentralized, so will be the APPA. But in either case, the issuer will have the ability to track and audit the APPAs&nbsp;actions.</p> APPAs are Auditable, NOT&nbsp;Public <p>FIP-2 creates a class of assets that can be audited ONLY by the issuer. Transaction data involving APPAs will still be private on-chain so that not anyone can look it up or track movements. This allows businesses and trading firms to protect trade secrets while meeting regulatory requirements.</p><p>FIP-2, we believe, sends a strong message that while Findora will protect the rights of all people to privacy, it is not a suitable place for illicit activity. Criminal activity can be exposed on Findora, and Findora will always work to protect its users from&nbsp;it.</p> The Technical details <p>APPAs will work by adding an “auditor’s memo” to transactions that record the input and output data of the transaction.</p><p>There are two main privacy-preserving protocols on Findora that APPAs will need to work with: the Maxwell construction and the Zerocash construction.</p><p>The Maxwell construction is instantiated by Bulletproofs and normally allows for transactions where the amount and token type is hidden on-chain. However, when an APPA uses this construction, the token type will not be able to be shielded — only the transaction amount.</p><p>The Zerocash construction on Findora is used for Triple Masking, a way to shield the amount, token type, and wallet addresses involved in a transaction. For auditable assets, the triple masking protocol will enforce the sender to provide a correct “auditor’s memo,” while still having the same privacy guarantees as existing assets. The existing assets and auditable assets can be used in the same transaction, which enables interoperability and backward compatibility.</p><p>In FIP-2, for now, auditable assets would be restricted to the UTXO chain only and not permitted on the EVM chain until a future FIP extends the auditability to the EVM&nbsp;side.</p><p>For more details, read FIP-2&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/FIPs/blob/main/FIPs/fip-2.md">here</a>.</p><p>An FIP-2&nbsp;Future</p><p>FIP-2 is one of the first Findora FIPs and we believe a huge advancement for the project. Auditability is a key component of any financial system, and giving Findora users access to that functionality will be key. There are many use cases for such technology and many more are sure to come when it is deployed.</p><p>APPAs created by FIP-2 won’t affect the decentralization of the Findora chain and won’t affect FRA. FRA will remain a decentralized, permissionless asset anyone can use. APPAs are another tool that token issuers can leverage to comply with regulations, audit transactions, and create new web3 financial products.</p><p>But FIP-2 is only the beginning. As mentioned above, FIP-2 has long been on a roadmap that has many other exciting future stops. Findora hopes to one day use similar ZKP methods to make KYC more secure and less centralized. Instead of companies keeping vulnerable servers full of customer data, perhaps they can simply store the proof of that data. Instead of going through cumbersome and intrusive KYC procedures, maybe all users need to do is show proof of who they are, who they are not, and any other verifiable data without revealing it.</p><p>It will be exciting to move to a world where our relationship to data completely changes, from needing to deal directly with it to simply exchanging proofs of&nbsp;data.</p><p>That is still a long way off in the future, but APPAs and FIP-2 are the first steps in that direction. Findora welcomes community feedback and encourages comments and questions on <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/findora">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/findoraen">Telegram</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/the-findora-improvement-proposal-that-could-bring-auditability-to-privacy-a21952ca4f55">The Findora Improvement Proposal That Could Bring Auditability to Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Payments and privacy don’t mix — understanding the logic of ‘embedded finance’ <p>The cashless society is upon us, or so we’re&nbsp;told.</p><p>Just last morning the UK banking body UK Finance released its latest report on the use of cash; some 23 million people in the UK did not use coins or notes at all during 2021, a huge increase on the 13 million recorded in the previous&nbsp;year.</p><p>According to the financial services industry, this is good news. Cash is unwieldy, it’s expensive to produce, and it’s logistically inefficient — think, for example, about the hundreds of thousands of armoured trucks carrying bank notes along the streets of towns and cities around the world every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Many commentators point out the continued importance of cash for demographics that are not comfortable with or used to digital payments; the example that is constantly given is pensioners’ attachment to cheques. And they are right, of course. But cash is dying regardless — and this is as a result of a concerted effort on the part of financial services businesses.</p> Convenience at any&nbsp;cost <p>The transition away from cash is part of a broader tendency that is part of and necessitated by the stage of capitalist development in which the world finds itself. In the field of payments this philosophy manifests as the privileging of ‘convenience’ over all else, including privacy. The convenience imperative is used to justify systemic demands for the integration of every individual and every aspect of their lives into the logic of financialisation.</p><p>Consider this ‘convenience’ from the perspective of the businesses marketing it. Internally, these products are talked about in terms of ‘embedding’ and ‘integration’. The nascent ‘Embedded Finance’ industry tells every company on earth that they can ‘be a fintech’ by integrating financial services into their products, the idea being that they can generate new revenue streams through financialisation. The Embedded Finance industry is an organising layer that allows correspondence between non-financial companies and the financial system at large by leasing access to banking infrastructure. Today, for ambitious wannabe fintechs, even licences are a thing of the past. Don’t have a banking licence, or regulatory permission to operate as a financial institution? Don’t worry — just lease it from your Embedded Finance provider, who in turn is leasing it from the Tier 1 banks who operate the ‘pipes’ of the banking network. We’re told the cashless society is ‘frictionless’, and to an extent that is true — the modus operandi is to remove any barriers separating consumers from the global financial system, and to create new ‘touchpoints’ through which consumers can be woven into large and growing networks of financialisation.</p> Diminishing returns <p>As the financialisation of the global economy reaches its peak, and as the associated returns diminish, the scramble to integrate more and more functions into its rubric becomes increasingly urgent.</p><p>This is another example of the logic of global capitalist expansion — capital moves into ‘emerging markets’ in an attempt to generate new consumers (where it used to generate new, cheaper workforces). When it runs out of new consumers, it has to embed itself ever more deeply into the existences of those that it has already&nbsp;created.</p><p>The result is the concentration of financial power — and, crucially, the data generated as a result — within a vanishingly small number of hands. ‘Rebundling’ is one of the favourite current buzzwords of the payments industry. By this they mean the integration of multiple, disparate services and transactions within a small set of umbrella brands. The best current example is the crop of ‘superapps’ that are growing in popularity in South East Asia, as partly pioneered by Jack Ma’s Ant Group. These apps are a ‘single point of access’ through which you can not only book a ride-share or get groceries delivered, but also borrow money, do your banking, send remittances to family abroad, and so&nbsp;on.</p> Tornados and transactions <p>So, as we’ve seen, cashless societies are a necessity for the continued enfolding of all human behaviour into the financial system. They’re sold to us on the basis of convenience, and the implications for privacy and both private sector and state overreach are studiously ignored.</p><p>It is extremely difficult to return the genie of convenience to its bottle, and challenging the logic of convenience seems politically impossible in the current climate. The obvious alternative, therefore, is to build systems that are both convenient and equitable; that maintain privacy and keep the financial institutions at bay while also enabling people to transact as they wish, on a global basis, and at&nbsp;speed.</p><p>There are many attempts to achieve something along these lines, and it should come as no surprise that these attempts are being met with crackdowns and repression. The recent sanctioning of Tornado Cash, a prominent privacy-minded coin mixer, is a good example that will have significant implications for the DeFi space at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Crackdowns of this sort are excellent illustrations of the fact that financialisation is another vector through which power can be exercised. In the next parts of this series on privacy and payments, we’ll look in more detail at some of the alternatives.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/payments-and-privacy-dont-mix-understanding-the-logic-of-embedded-finance-dd8b91fc7c58">Payments and privacy don’t mix — understanding the logic of ‘embedded finance’</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>This post is contributed by the <a href="https://twitter.com/datachain_en">Datachain</a> team.</blockquote><p>IBC plays an essential role in the enterprise space because of the trust-minimised blockchain interoperability it provides for heterogeneous blockchains and is a proven technology, as discussed in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/why-cosmos-ibc-takes-an-essential-role-in-the-enterprise-space-95d84baeeca9">our previous post</a>. The <a href="https://ibcprotocol.org/">Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol</a> is not only for chains built on the <a href="https://interchain.io/technology">Interchain Stack</a>, but for all blockchains, regardless of app building framework, including enterprise (permissioned) blockchains and probabilistic finality&nbsp;chains.</p><p>This post is the second part of the IBC and enterprise series and will dive into enterprise use cases in production using the IBC protocol, specifically:</p>  Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) Settlements between digital assets and digital currency (NTT&nbsp;DATA)  USDF, a USD-pegged Stable Coin (USDF Consortium)  Enterprise Blockchain Platform BSN (Bianjie) backed by the Chinese Government  Atomic Swap Between Digital Currencies (Soramitsu)   DVP Settlements Between Digital Assets and Digital Currency (NTT&nbsp;DATA) An overview of the DVP settlement system, source: <a href="https://www.datachain.jp/news/datachain-collaborates-with-ntt-data-on-technology-for-interoperability-between-blockchains">Datachain Teams Up With NTT DATA For Blockchain Interoperability</a><p>NTT DATA and <a href="https://www.datachain.jp/">Datachain</a> have tested Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) settlements between digital assets on Hyperledger Fabric and digital currency on Tendermint-based blockchains using the IBC protocol. DVP settlement is a settlement method that reduces principal risk by simultaneously delivering securities while making payments. The IBC protocol enables DVP settlements by verifying transactions on the counterparty blockchain without a trusted intermediary. Securities and payments can be received only once both parties have put the transactions on chain and they are verified by the counterparty blockchain.</p><p>The experiment resulted in a joint demonstration of a <a href="https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/media/press-release/2022/january/tokio-marine-and-nichido-ntt-data-standage-and-tradewaltz-jointly-conducted">new international trade settlement system</a> by Tokio Marine &amp; Nichido, NTT DATA, STANDAGE and TradeWaltz.The architecture of this demonstration can be applied to other enterprise fields including the settlement of securities transactions. Therefore, as more digital assets become exchangeable on blockchains, there will be increasing demand to transfer digital assets and make settlements simultaneously to minimize the&nbsp;risk.</p> USDF, USD-pegged Stable Coin (USDF Consortium) <p>USDF is a USD-pegged stable coin minted by several United States banks at the USDF consortium. The consortium members are: <a href="https://www.amerantbank.com/">Amerant Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.atlanticunionbank.com/">Atlantic Union Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.connectonebank.com/">ConnectOne Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.efirstbank.com/">FirstBank</a>, <a href="https://www.nbhbank.com/">NBH Bank</a>, <a href="https://primisbank.com/">Primis Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.mynycb.com/">New York Community Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.synovus.com/">Synovus Bank</a>, <a href="https://public.websteronline.com/personal">Webster Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.figure.com/">Figure Technologies, Inc</a>., and <a href="https://www.jamfintop.com/">JAM FINTOP</a>. The primary use-case of USDF is to make money transfers between banks more efficient, and has additional applications such as capital call financing, invoice, and supply chain&nbsp;finance.</p><p>USDF runs on the Cosmos SDK based <a href="https://www.provenance.io/">Provenance</a> blockchain with IBC as a primitive. This is why, for example, it is possible for the Provenance blockchain to interoperate with other blockchains to settle payments by&nbsp;USDF.</p> Enterprise Blockchain Platform BSN (Bianjie) backed by the Chinese Government <p>Bianjie, the core development team responsible for delivering IRISnet, is also working on Cosmos-based enterprise solutions called IRITA (Inter-Realm Industry Trust Alliance). It is a consortium blockchain product built using the Cosmos/IRIS SDK branching off of the IRISnet&nbsp;project.</p>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/@bianjie/irita-interchain-service-irita-hub-has-launched-at-bsn-network-platform-10acaefeee9">IRITA interchain service, IRITA Hub&nbsp;, has launched at&nbsp;BSN</a><p>The Chinese government wants to include multiple blockchain frameworks and make them accessible under one uniform standard on the BSN (Blockchain Service Network) platform. The illustration above highlights the <a href="https://medium.com/@bianjie/irita-interchain-service-irita-hub-has-launched-at-bsn-network-platform-10acaefeee9">IRITA Hub as a key blockchain platform in the BSN ecosystem</a> with IBC connecting it to other public and private blockchains. Interoperability is supported between consortium and public blockchains such as Ethereum, IRISnet, Hyperledger Fabric and FISCO&nbsp;BCOS.</p> Atomic Swap Between Digital Currencies (Soramitsu) <p>Soramitsu, the initial contributor to Hyperledger Iroha and the co-development team behind the Cambodian Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Bakong has started using the IBC protocol to enable simultaneous exchange of digital currencies between different blockchains built on Hyperledger Iroha.</p><p>In recent years, the development of digital currencies has accelerated with multiple blockchains (Hyperledger Iroha, Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) employed as the underlying platforms. Therefore, there is a growing need to exchange multiple digital currencies simultaneously, called Payment Versus Payment (PVP) settlements, and this is enabled by connecting multiple heterogeneous blockchains via the IBC protocol. Soramitsu and Datachain have implemented IBC modules for Hyperledger Iroha and completed a <a href="https://medium.com/@datachain/datachain-and-soramitsu-successfully-achieve-interoperability-between-hyperledger-iroha-blockchains-eac55e7d8191">demonstration test</a> verifying viability. Soramitsu has also begun to conduct CBDC <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/philippines-vietnam-conducting-cbdc-feasibility-studies-with-soramitsu/">feasibility studies</a> in the Philippines and Vietnam to expand Enterprise IBC use-cases.</p> Conclusion <p>This article covers major enterprise use cases using the IBC protocol. As the use cases illustrate, large enterprise companies such as NTT DATA, US-based Banks, and the Chinese government-backed project BSN have started using the IBC protocol to minimize the risk in processing payments, through DVP settlements and exchanging multiple currencies, PVP settlements. While some projects are in the experimental phase, considering enterprise adoption is generally slower than for public chains, this is not a negative factor and demonstrates the potential of the solution.</p><p>If you have not yet done so, reading <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/why-cosmos-ibc-takes-an-essential-role-in-the-enterprise-space-95d84baeeca9">part one </a>of the IBC protocol for enterprise series will add additional context and is highly recommended to understand why enterprises have chosen to use the IBC protocol.</p><p>Datachain is committed to building an interconnected world of public and enterprise blockchains — the Interchain, powered by the IBC Protocol. Our work on the YUI project continues and we look forward to collaborating with the <a href="https://interchain.io/">Interchain Foundation</a> and Core Teams to drive adoption of the Cosmos Ecosystem.</p><p>Datachain also unveiled <a href="https://medium.com/lcp-network/lcp-a-proxy-for-light-client-verification-to-realize-trust-minimized-and-gas-efficient-f7d5868e4b0">LCP</a>, a proxy for light client verification to enable trust-minimized and gas-efficient cross-chain bridges using the IBC protocol.</p><p>To learn more about building the Interchain together, Datachain can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/datachain_en">Twitter</a> and messaged here: <a href="https://form.run/@datachain-contact-en">contact&nbsp;us</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/ibc-use-cases-in-the-enterprise-space-are-coming-c280523b90b6">IBC Use Cases in the Enterprise Space are Coming</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Just over one year ago, Statemine became fully operational on Kusama, allowing anyone to create fungible and non-fungible asset classes. Since then, Statemine has opened five bi-directional HRMP (aka XCMP-Lite) channels with other parachains and had two assets deemed “sufficient” by the Kusama stakeholders. Its cousin Statemint has become a parachain on Polkadot, and several applications, block explorers, development tools, and custodians have added support for assets on both networks.</p><p>Although as a live network, Statemint is the most visible, the team at Parity has been working to prepare for the launch of several more chains it plans to propose as common good parachains. On the technical side, this work has involved making runtime changes that allow more expressive interaction over <a href="https://polkadot.network/cross-chain-communication/">XCM</a> and developing testing and release processes that scale to several runtimes.</p><p>The community has also provided valuable feedback on XCM uses, the general role of common good parachains (especially when it comes to adding new functionality), and the most desired new features. This feedback has shaped a lot of our internal roadmap for the coming six months.</p> Collectives <p>The team at Parity has been busy testing a new parachain for collectives and plans to make a governance proposal to connect it to Polkadot. For those who pay close attention to testnets, you may have already noticed a new parachain on Westend since late July, and that is where some of the final testing is happening.</p><p>The name “collectives” may not evoke much meaning, but Polkadot and Kusama already have collectives, each operating with a Council and Technical Committee. Although these particular collectives will retire with the proposed next generation of Polkadot governance, the ability to organize and act as a group (without needing to trust third parties like lawyers and jurisdictional courts) remains an important element of Web3.</p><p>The <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/gov2-polkadots-next-generation-of-decentralised-governance/">new proposal for Polkadot governance</a> &nbsp;introduces a new collective, the Fellowship, which allows a ranked group of experts to express its opinion on sensitive or highly privileged proposals. This collective succeeds the Technical Committee, but with much broader membership to represent more of the technical contributors to the Polkadot protocol. Rather than fast tracking referendum voting and enactment schedules, the Fellowship expresses its opinion that certain proposals are safe and of technical importance to the advancement or functioning of the network. Although the Fellowship and its logic will incubate on Kusama, it should eventually migrate to Polkadot and serve both networks via stakeholder-approved referenda.</p><p>Another collective in development is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXlVDDQj6v8kOTvbMXBmenBZ3Sfn5zZf0ipQbYvdipo/edit#">Polkadot Alliance</a>. The Alliance is already deployed on the Westend test parachain and will likely be the first one on Polkadot. Several community teams banded together about two years ago and came up with the idea for the Alliance, primarily to fight misuse of the Polkadot brand and unattributed code. If approved by the network, the Alliance would be an on-chain industry collective that sets a code of ethics regarding brand use, scam activities, and harmful behavior, but also provides recognition to teams who do make positive contributions to the growth and success of the Polkadot network.</p><p>Although the Alliance would exist on-chain, and publish its findings of unscrupulous websites and accounts on-chain, it will not have any governance powers. You can think of it like an airline alliance (e.g. Star Alliance), where members could have an Alliance badge on their website or product UIs that give users more confidence that certain standards of quality will be upheld. Likewise, wallets could warn users when connecting to websites or interacting with accounts that the Alliance has flagged.</p><p>The collectives parachain will connect only to Polkadot; there are no plans for a Kusama counterpart. In fact, for some collectives, like the Alliance, the Kusama network could actually join the collective as a member. That is, networks themselves can act as collectives and express their legislative voices as single opinions within other networks.</p><p>How this works in practice leads to the next parachain in the works: a bridge hub.</p> Bridge Hub <p>Polkadot always included plans for bridges to other networks, like Ethereum. And plans for a bridge between Polkadot and Kusama predate the launch of Kusama itself. As highlighted by recent exploits, building secure bridge primitives is a considerable undertaking. But the engineering team at Parity (in close collaboration with Snowfork and the researchers at Web3 Foundation) have made enough progress to begin testing for the launch process.</p><p>Before Kusama and Polkadot supported their first parachains, the only way to design a bridge was to put the bridge logic into the Relay Chain itself. But with both networks supporting parachains, it makes sense to have a parachain on each network dedicated to bridges. Because of the execution isolation provided by parachains, the activity on a parachain does not affect the Relay Chain or other parachains. So a bridge hub can support bridges to many other consensus systems. The team has been working on adding a runtime to <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-pdk#cumulus">Cumulus</a>, and has been prototyping bridge parachains on local testnets with plans to move to <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-pdk#rococo-testnet">Rococo</a> (bridged to its sinister sounding cousin, Wococo).</p><p>A bridge hub would of course be a hub, and support more bridges than just one between Polkadot and Kusama. Parity is also working with Snowfork on an Ethereum bridge to launch on the same hub. But this does not exclude other bridges from existence; teams who have built a bridge that does not fit under the common goods umbrella can still operate as parachains and offer their bridge services to the network.</p><p>Bridges require an understanding of finality of their interlocutor complemented with a message format and delivery service. The more technically minded readers may be familiar with the GRANDPA Finality and BEEFY systems, used to verify finality on GRANDPA and Ethereum based chains, respectively. These modules are being reviewed by auditors and tested on the prototyping networks.</p><p>The second half, a message format and delivery service, comes from XCM v3 and Polkadot’s suite of <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain#cross-consensus-protocols">transport protocols</a> (UMP, DMP, HRMP/XCMP-Lite, and eventually XCMP). XCM v2 already allows for secure communication between parachains, but does not contain all of the messaging primitives that bridges need to interact with other consensus systems. XCM v3 is under review and bridges will be ready for action once XCM v3 is in production.<br><br>In practice, a bridge between Polkadot and Kusama will allow collectives like the Alliance and Fellowship to serve both networks, and even for Kusama to act as a unified voice and participant within those collectives or the Polkadot network as a whole.</p> Assets <p>Finally, let us not forget the first common good parachain, Statemint, which has a rich roadmap in its own right. At the launch of Statemint, the team kept the runtime intentionally lean, eschewing features like smart contracts that, according to the architectural principles behind Polkadot, should exist on other chains and interact with assets via XCM. This decision was frustrating to many developers who wanted to express more complex interactions. But the advancement of XCM is making these possible now.<br><br>Statemint’s two core pallets are dedicated to fungible assets and NFTs. After much feedback from the community about usability and desired features (e.g. asset locking and reserving, nested and multi-resource NFTs), several people from Parity, RMRK, Phala, KILT, and others are working on the next generation of these pallets to deliver these features.</p><p>Building on XCM v3 and the newer assets features, Statemint will also begin taking more “core system” level work from the Relay Chain, especially for the on-chain Treasury and balances. </p><p>It has been a long-standing idea within the Polkadot network for the on-chain Treasury to hold many assets, in addition to its native token. One, users making Treasury proposals may want to request funding in other assets besides DOT. In addition, the Polkadot stakeholder community as a whole may want Polkadot to acquire stakes in other assets. By providing the multi-asset support that Statemint specializes in, it can allow more options for Treasury use and management.</p><p>Statemint will eventually take on more balances functionality too. With staking and governance both on the Relay Chain, they can each interact synchronously with the DOT/KSM balances on the Relay Chain. That is, they can each get a “real-time” thumbs up that an account has sufficient lockable balance to stake, vote, etc. But as these subsystems move to parachains, they can only interact asynchronously. A user’s balance cannot exist at the same time on a governance parachain and a staking parachain, so those systems need a common place to reference balances.</p><p>To solve this, Statemint and XCM v3 support locking over XCM. In this model, a user may want to both vote and stake with 100 DOT, and the governance and staking chains would each request that Statemint lock the DOT and send an affirmation that the balance has been locked for each purpose. Then the governance and staking chains can issue the user the correct voting and staking rights, using the same locked DOT.</p> Community <p>The community has been a driving force in developing these plans. The roadmap that I originally had in mind for common good parachains has been rendered obsolete by many conversations with community members over the winter and spring. And that is a good thing. </p><p>Parachains have a diverse set of users: from end-users to application developers to other parachain developers. Feedback from all these groups has influenced our roadmap, and quite often external contributors submit PRs for the features that they want.<br><br>As the common good parachain team at Parity grows, we would love to see more community involvement from all types of users. The roadmap I’ve laid out in this article is a gargantuan endeavor. Common good parachains are meant to be an extension of the Relay Chain itself, part of the Polkadot core protocol. Like the rest of the core protocol, its success requires engagement from the entire community. We encourage everyone to get involved in any way: feel free to ask questions on <a href="https://substrate.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> or open issues in the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AR1-statemint">Cumulus repository</a>.<br><br>Interested in building on Polkadot? <a href="https://info.polkadot.network/contact">Get in touch here</a>.</p>

Additionally, the timeline for the second shade airdrop is revealed for those who <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-protocol-claim-tutorial-41aa959afbf0">qualified for the airdrop</a>. This airdrop will unlock the next 10% of the Shade airdrop for qualified users who also interact with the official Shade Bond airdrop smart contract.</p><p>As Shade Protocol steadily moves towards the launch of SILK, ShadeLend, and ShadeSwap in the fall — there has never been a better time to join the community!</p><blockquote>As we like to say: “…there is plenty of room in the&nbsp;Shade…”</blockquote> Timeline <p>The following is the official timeline for Shade&nbsp;Bonds:</p>  LP Campaign (August 27th — September 26th)  Bonds (September 12th)  Airdrop — Part 2 (September 22nd)  SILK Bond — (September 25th)  <p>The LP Campaign, Bonds, Airdrop Part 2, and SILK Bond will begin at 2:00 pm. UTC on their respective dates.</p> LP Campaign (August 27th — September 26th) <p>In order to ensure the success of Shade Bonds, deeper liquidity is required to make bond opportunities more attractive. Additionally, Shade Protocol core contributors want to give users time to mint protocol desired LP tokens in advance of the ShadeBonds launch on September 12th.</p><p>LP Campaign details are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Rewards for <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-staking-derivatives-aed1e93d10cd">stkd-SCRT</a> / <a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/shade-protocol/shd">SHD</a> pair on <a href="https://app.sienna.network/">SIENNA</a> will begin August&nbsp;27th  The first ShadeBond offered will be for <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-staking-derivatives-aed1e93d10cd">stkd-SCRT</a> / <a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/shade-protocol/shd">SHD</a> LP&nbsp;tokens  <p>To prepare for the LP campaign and the first ShadeBond opportunity you will need to perform the following:</p>  <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/staking-derivatives">Mint stkd-SCRT</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe_CPL3A3yA">Acquire SHD</a>   Bonds (September 12th) <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-protocol-bonds-audit-complete-cac484d48f0e">https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-protocol-bonds-audit-complete-cac484d48f0e</a><p>For those unfamiliar, <a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/apps/bonds">Shade Bonds</a> are a powerful mechanism by which the ShadeDAO will be able to grow its set of protocol owned assets which can then be utilized to generate both liquidity for Shade Apps and yield for the protocol. The launch of bonds signals the beginning of deeper liquidity for users and powerful yield opportunities.</p><blockquote><a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/apps/bonds">Learn About ShadeBonds</a></blockquote><p>The first ShadeBond offered will be for stkd-SCRT / SHD LP tokens.

These interconnected privacy-preserving DeFi products built on Secret Network will change DeFi as we know it — empowering the next generation of value creation and exchange. Shade Protocol is launching Silk: a privacy-preserving collateralized, reflexive stablecoin built on Secret&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Without privacy, DeFi is incomplete. Traditional financial markets offer a degree of privacy for users, and as a result offer up greater protections in some capacity than existing DeFi markets. Shade Protocol will be the world’s first cohesive set of decentralized and privacy-preserving financial applications — ushering in a golden era for Web3. Shade Protocol will always push for privacy by default, privacy as an expectation, and privacy as the key to unlocking the full value of a decentralized future.</p><blockquote>But we can’t do this without community.

    <p>We are excited to announce our first NFT release, Zero Gravity, an exclusive NFT line created for the Horizen ecosystem summit, <a href="https://zencon.events">ZenCon0</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero Gravity is a series of 250 pieces of artwork featuring Horizen’s mascot, Zenny, a galaxy explorer walking on a journey to a new world of web3. Owning one leaves footprints on paths of the Zen journey as we travel along these paths to the final destination of the unbounded.</p>
<p>The Zero Gravity NFT will be dropped to all ZenCon0 attendees and contributors who make this event a success. The NFT will offer the following privileges to its owners:</p>
 
 Exclusive access and benefits for all future ZenCon events and events hosted by Horizen and Horizen Labs 
 Whitelist spot for future NFTs issued by Horizen&nbsp; 
 Whitelist spot for future PKZ airdrops 
 VIP membership of Horizen swag store&nbsp; 
 
 The First NFT on TokenMint 
<p><a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a> is a no-code tokenization platform designed to provide a streamlined tokenization process. When first launched, the platform provided an easy and quick way to create fungible tokens. TokenMint will soon have NFT support, meaning the platform and tools (Cobalt wallet, explorer) can also support non-fungible tokens (NFTs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero Gravity NFT will be first released on TokenMint testnet as soon as the NFT support becomes available, targeted for the beginning of September, shortly before ZenCon0. Owners of the NFT will be able to receive, view, use and transfer their Zero Gravity NFT using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a> and the <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint explorer</a>. The NFT will be transitioned to mainnet once the NFT support becomes available on mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
 About ZenCon0 
<p>We are less than a month away from <a href="https://zencon.events/">ZenCon0!</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenCon0 is the first ever summit to celebrate what we have achieved, share ideas for growth, and envision together the future of the broader Horizen ecosystem.</p>
<p>ZenCon0 is hosted and organized by Horizen Labs. We are joined by our investors, partners, advisors, and community members looking to build what’s next in web3 and are integral to the growth and success of the Horizen ecosystem.</p>

 Earn Rewards By Helping Us Test the Polygon-to-Findora Rialto&nbsp;Bridge <p>In the <a href="https://gleam.io/frUq2/the-shaking-up-the-bridge-giveaway-phase-3">Building Up the Bridge Campaign</a>, you can earn FRA and a Project Galaxy NFT when you cross the bridge on&nbsp;testnet.</p> The Building Up the Polygon Bridge&nbsp;Campaign <p>Migrating assets to Findora over the Rialto Bridge lets you enjoy the privacy features Findora offers. Ethereum and BNB Chain are already connected, and the Polygon path is now live on&nbsp;testnet.</p><p>To stress-test this new part of the bridge, the Findora Foundation is sponsoring the <a href="https://gleam.io/frUq2/the-shaking-up-the-bridge-giveaway-phase-3">Building </a><a href="https://gleam.io/frUq2/the-shaking-up-the-bridge-giveaway-phase-3">Up the Bridge Campaign</a>. Complete the campaign to win $5 worth of FRA, receive a <a href="https://www.galaxy.eco/">Project Galaxy NF</a>T, and help expand the future of privacy finance to more of&nbsp;web3.</p><p>Let’s dive&nbsp;in:</p> How To Test the Bridge and Win&nbsp;Rewards <p>You can test the Rialto Bridge in three easy&nbsp;steps:</p>  Configure your MetaMask wallet to the Findora Anvil and Polygon Mumbai Testnets and get testnet MATIC and FRA&nbsp;tokens.  Bridge USDT from Polygon to Findora and then back to&nbsp;Polygon  Bridge a testnet NFT from Findora to Polygon and then back to&nbsp;Findora.  <p>First, you’ll need to enter the campaign <a href="https://gleam.io/frUq2/the-shaking-up-the-bridge-giveaway-phase-3">here</a> and complete the social tasks. After that, here’s a breakdown on how you can test the&nbsp;bridge:</p> Step 1: Get Set Up By Configuring MetaMask and Getting Testnet tokens from&nbsp;Faucets <p>If you haven’t already, you’ll need to add the Findora Anvil Testnt and Polygon Mumbai Testnet to your MetaMask Wallet. Open MetaMask, click on the network at the top, and select Add&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Here’s the RPC information you’ll need to&nbsp;enter:</p><p>Polygon Mumbai</p>  Network Name: Polygon&nbsp;Mumbai  RPC URL: <a href="https://matic-mumbai.chainstacklabs.com/">https://matic-mumbai.chainstacklabs.com</a>  Chain ID:&nbsp;80001  Currency Symbol:&nbsp;MATIC  Block Explorer URL: <a href="https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/">https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/</a>  <p>Findora Avil:</p>  Network Name: Findora Anvil&nbsp;Testnet  RPC URL: <a href="https://prod-testnet.prod.findora.org:8545/">https://prod-testnet.prod.findora.org:8545</a>  Chain ID:&nbsp;2153  Currency Symbol:&nbsp;FRA  Block Explorer URL: <a href="https://testnet-anvil.evm.findorascan.io/">https://testnet-anvil.evm.findorascan.io/</a>  <p>Next, you’ll need testnet MATIC and FRA tokens. To get Matic, go to the <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/">Polygon Mumbai testnet faucet</a> and put in your Polygon Mumbai MetaMask wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p>To get FRA tokens, you’ll need to go to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/789009413976883220/871676048788586546">#Faucet channe</a>l on Findora’s <a href="https://discord.gg/findora">Discord</a>. In the chat, type “!evm” and then insert your Findora avnil MetaMask&nbsp;address.</p> Step 2: Bridging USDT Tokens Between Polygon and&nbsp;Findora <p>With your new MATIC testnet tokens, head to <a href="https://legacy.quickswap.exchange/#/swap">Quickswap</a> to swap them for USDT. After a few minutes, the USDT tokens should appear in your MetaMask&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Next, go to the <a href="https://anvil.rialtobridge.io/">Rialto Bridge on Anvil testnet</a> and connect your Polygon Mumbai wallet to test the bridge. Make sure you’re going from Mumbai to Anvil and that you select USDT in the asset&nbsp;box.</p><p>TIP: You can simply check “I want to send funds to my address” instead of copy/posting your MetaMask wallet address in the destination address&nbsp;box.</p><p>Once the transfer is successful, switch to the Findora Anvil network to see the USDT.p you have just bridged over. If you can’t see USDT in your Findora anvil wallet, import the USDT.p token so your wallet can recognize it.</p><p>Under the Assets tab, click on “Import Token” and copy/paste the contract&nbsp;address:</p><p>0x01d79d0A2dC2fB13710A22d3e85984DC1f75eE60</p><p>The rest of the info should auto-populate but you can input it manually as&nbsp;well:</p>  Token Symbol:&nbsp;USDT.p  Token Decimal:&nbsp;6  <p>The USDT tokens may take a few minutes to appear in your Findora Anvil&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Simply reverse the process to bridge USDT.p back to&nbsp;Polygon.</p> Step 3: Bridging an NFT between Findora and&nbsp;Polygon <p>To get a testnet NFT, switch your MetaMask to the Findora Anvil testnet and select the ERC721 option. The blue NFT Faucet button should appear. Clicking on it will mint and NFT in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>NOTE: Be sure to copy the Token ID&nbsp;down!</p><p>Input the Token ID and select ZK Mole in the Source Contract Address box. After checking the box to send the NFT to yourself, start the transfer.</p><p>Once completed, wait a few minutes before transferring the NFT back to the Findora Anvil testnet. Make sure to switch to the Polygon Mumbai testnet and follow the same steps, being sure to input the same Token ID. You may need to wait around 15 minutes before the transfer back to Anvil will be possible.</p> How To Report&nbsp;Issues <p>If you encounter a bug or an issue, please submit a ticket on our <a href="https://discord.com/channels/789009413976883220/798784610670608415">#support channel</a>, and post your experience on the #<a href="https://discord.com/channels/789009413976883220/1006316888722260038">product-feedback channel</a>, both located on our&nbsp;Discord.</p> Thanks For Building&nbsp;Web3! <p>Rialto is a key piece of infrastructure, and we really appreciate you taking the time to help secure and improve it.

 Due to unprecedented actions of the US government to sanction Tornado Cash and all of its associated addresses, BlockWallet has stopped all privacy pool activity in the wallet. If you still have funds inside our privacy pool, please notify our community managers on Telegram. <p>BlockWallet was born out of our desire to give you tools to protect your wealth and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Features like privacy proxies, phishing protection, flashbots protection, and finally, privacy pools is a testament to&nbsp;that.</p><p>Privacy pools let you send or receive crypto without revealing your wallet address, which served as a practical and easy way to increase your privacy. We had integrated Tornado Cash as an underlying protocol for this feature because it was the most private and secure solution.</p><p>Last week, we saw OFAC take unprecedented action against Tornado Cash, effectively adding the protocol and associated addresses to their sanction list because of its unique role in crypto scams. This means that US citizens are barred from interacting with the protocol, but the implications go&nbsp;further.</p><p>Targeting malicious uses of this protocol is naive, short-sighted, and ignorant — because it also affects innocent users, including virtuous ones. Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin mentioned that <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1556925602233569280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">he donated to Ukraine using Tornado Cash</a> to protect his&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>In light of this situation, many thought-leaders have spoken out to give their opinion. One that stood out in particular was a <a href="https://twitter.com/SethHertlein/status/1557442355678117889">tweet by Seth Hertlein</a>, the head of Policy at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger</a>.</p><p>He mentions that if OFAC had sanctioned the criminals and hackers that used Tornado Cash, there wouldn’t be a problem. But crazily enough, the exact opposite occurred — a suspected <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/163206/suspected-tornado-cash-developer-arrested-in-amsterdam">Tornado Cash developer was arrested</a> in Amsterdam.</p><p>Tornado cash is open-source code meaning it’s not owned by anyone and is freely available to everyone. It is, thus a public good. We enjoy the benefits of public goods and infrastructure every day: the internet, our wireless networks, our money, the banking system, transportation infrastructure, and our roads and highways.</p><p>Guess what? Criminals use these everyday as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Of course, we should pursue these criminal who misuse public goods, but we don’t sanction SMTP because hackers send phishing emails or I-95 because drug dealers drive on it or cell towers that route terrorists’ calls. These are not persons — neither is Tornado&nbsp;Cash.</p><p>Like email and highways, Tornado Cash has been misused by criminals for criminal ends. However, Tornado Cash is also a tool that enables law-abiding citizens to maintain their privacy on the blockchain for a host of legal purposes, including political speech.</p><p>Regardless of government sanctions and ever-changing privacy landscapes, BlockWallet’s focus remains the same — protecting our users on Web3. We will continue exploring other alternatives to on-chain&nbsp;privacy.</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a privacy-first self-custodial browser extension wallet where you can store, send or receive crypto and interact with your favorite blockchain apps privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy often translates to security risks. BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating friction and making privacy accessible for everyone.</p><p>BlockWallet protects you and ensures privacy by default. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain apps, BlockWallet routes all node requests through Privacy Proxies, which mask the IP address and other metadata, that can be used to identify and track you on a blockchain. BlockWallet offers integrated Flash-Bot Protection, shielding you from sandwich attacks when you trade on DEXes. Meanwhile, the Phishing Protection feature helps you combat phishing scams by generating unique artwork on all sensitive pages.</p><p>BlockWallet is not a compromise. It’s privacy-first, but it still packs all features you would expect from a wallet. With full Web 3.0 support, the wallet allows you to connect to any&nbsp;DApp.</p><p>Become a part of the BlockWallet community today:</p><p><a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Homepage</a> | <a href="https://blockwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetBlockWallet">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/blockwallet">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/69gvNKatdb">Discord</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EKVZ2xWXEH">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://hello@blockwallet.io/">E-mail</a></p>

<p>It's hard to picture the future of financial privacy without Bitcoin. From its inception, Bitcoin was meant to be disruptive. And for over a decade, it has made giant leaps as a decentralized currency despite concerted efforts to subvert it. The fact that bitcoin is still here means that it's needed and has a role to play in the future.</p><p>Presently, using intermediaries in financial transactions always sacrifice privacy; as such, there's a growing need for decentralized peer-to-peer technology to facilitate money transfers. Bitcoin comes with some drawbacks in terms of privacy. The application of distributed ledger technology is fundamental to allowing bitcoin to work without "middle-men," but the transparency affects Bitcoin's ability to be used as currency. Consequently, bitcoin has had to evolve to meet the advances in technology used in deanonymizing public ledgers and degrading privacy.</p><p>The advancement in Bitcoin privacy will be most visible on the following fronts:</p><p>1. Wallets<br>2. Exchanges<br>3. Coinjoins<br>4. The Lightning Network<br>5. Open Source Development<br>6. Awareness and public sentiment</p> Wallets <p>The big question about wallets is, who keeps your private keys? If your wallet allows someone else to store your private keys, then the amount of privacy you have is controlled by the party trusted with your private keys. Giving away your private keys means that you trust the other party to always serve your interests over theirs, which is not always the case. A good wallet allows you to store your private keys. The wallets we use in the future will directly influence the amount of privacy we have while using bitcoin. The other feature of wallets that directly affects privacy is address generation. Working with a single unchangeable address is detrimental to a user's privacy as it builds a strong association with one address. The future of privacy will have more wallets allowing users to generate addresses on the fly whenever needed.</p><p>There will also be a more significant shift in the number of users running full node wallets. A node in bitcoin is software that allows a computer to have its record of the public ledger that other computers on the network can read or write. A full node also provides computation power when it participates in validating transactions before transmitting them throughout the network. Running a full node may be technical, but it gives the user more security and privacy when they know what they are doing.</p><p>With a growing number of novice users joining bitcoin, it will be critical for future wallets to be straightforward to use for everyone. This will directly affect fast advancements in user interface design to improve usability and user experience. The simplicity of the wallet does a lot to protect users from avoidable mistakes that may affect users transacting with privacy in mind. The trend for future wallets will likely sway in the direction of wallets that preserve privacy while being easy to use all at the same time.</p><p>The least private wallets in the future will be wallets that lack network-level protection from network deanonymization attacks. Such wallets will always reveal more network information about the users transacting with the wallets rendering them porous. To counteract this, the future will see more and more bitcoin wallets using Tor. The most private wallets will likely be Desktop wallets since they allow users to run better software than mobile phones. Wallets are at the center of the mass adoption of Bitcoin and privacy. There will always be a direct correlation between the wallet used to transact and the privacy of the user.</p> Exchanges <p>Bitcoin may be the future financial system, but it's unlikely that it can exist independent of the traditional financial system. The fact that bitcoin is a global currency means that users in different countries still need to convert their existing currencies into bitcoin and then back to local currencies. This is a role exchanges play. Centralized exchanges cannot exist outside the regulation that necessitates having all their customers fill KYC forms, degrading privacy. Central exchanges propagate the lack of privacy existing in the current financial system onto bitcoin. The biggest win for the future of privacy will be the growth of decentralized exchanges. Unlike centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges enable Bitcoin transfer in exchange for other currencies without giving away private information. The development of decentralized exchanges is likely to grow further with the growing interest in Non-Fungible Tokens and other cryptocurrencies. Users will easily exchange Bitcoin for other valuable assets with decentralized exchanges without giving up privacy. The near future will also see a more significant rise in the acceptability of bitcoin as a mode of payment, resulting in less need for exchanging bitcoin on central exchanges for local currencies.</p> CoinJoins All the Way <p>Coinjoins are probably a magic pill in the quest for bitcoin privacy. In a coinjoin, multiple users combine their coins and the output to every user is the same value of coins they put in the transaction, except that all the coins cannot be distinguishable from each other. &nbsp;Soon, trustless coinjoins will be more common because apart from improving privacy, they allow for fungibility. It will be noticeable that coinjoins will be more and more popular and their frequency will increase. For future wallets, conjoins will be one of the main features that make a wallet attractive to new users. Coinjoins will also see a shift to the type of coinjoins that do not allow third-parties access to users' wallet information. This is useful as it will enable users to preserve any private information they don't wish to give away in a coinjoin. With the increase in the number of coinjoins, the public ledger will be more obscure enabling greater privacy.</p> The Lightning Network <p>The development of the lightning network has the potential to revolutionize Bitcoin privacy and payments. By performing transactions off the main ledger, the lightning network allows for more private transactions. Already there exist implementations of the lightning network on bitcoin wallets but they haven’t been widely adopted yet. Wallets incorporating the Lightning Network will come with more development and advancements.</p> Open Source Technologies <p>Truth has to be verifiable. Open-source software allows us to inspect the software we use so that there is no fishy business. Privacy concerns make it important that the software we use really does what it says it does and not anything else. To establish trust, the trend of open source privacy tools is likely to pick up pace.</p> Public Sentiment about Bitcoin Privacy <p>Bitcoin hasn't been free from misconceptions. Probably the most pervasive relates to the usage of its privacy features in crime. Such claims have stopped others from leveraging bitcoin's privacy features to protect their financial information. Regardless of any held opinions, bitcoin has kept going because it’s desirable that a decentralized currency should exist and like all inventions, it is a driving force for both good and bad. The privacy features on bitcoin give users power that other tools can't afford, but we cannot assume that it is to be used entirely for bad. Future bitcoin users will understand that taking control of our financial privacy is necessary and that a future where our private worlds are constantly encroached upon isn't worth living in.</p>

  Cross-chain DeFi and interoperability are the holy grail of the modern blockchain ecosystem. Here’s why, and the reason they’re so hard.

<p>We’re still in the earliest years of cross-chain DeFi.<br></p><p>Different blockchains are significantly siloed, which you can tell by just looking at how Centralized Exchanges (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex">CEXs</a>) continue to be the most convenient way for users to swap coins between them. Albeit straightforward, this still is far from ideal, given that it does not rely on blockchain-native products and that users’ funds sit in exchanges’ hands. <br></p><p>Because of all of this, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/interoperable-privacy-building-privacy-bridges-to-all-of-defi-2eaa89c9c7ac/">cross-chain interoperability</a> has become the holy grail (and an over-used 'buzz phrase') in DeFi, as protocols try to move value seamlessly across different blockchains.</p> A peek into the world of cross-chain DeFi <p>Blockchains are like straight, parallel lines that do not cross, end, or cross paths. Although most of them may have similar underlying technologies, most independent blockchain networks are not compatible with one another. Like water and oil, they are immiscible – flowing side by side but never truly mixing. <br></p><p>The reason blockchains can’t “mix” is because a blockchain’s main purpose is to allow users to coordinate without communication to keep a shared ledger. Since each blockchain keeps track of its own ledger, making them mix would require both of the colliding chains to “agree” on a single state for each compatible chain, and track every subsequent move on the other. This process, as you might imagine, is far from efficient and introduces several different problems into the picture.<br></p><p>Because of the difficulty of upholding more than one ledger, even when a blockchain is <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-fork">forked</a>, the newborn chain can only run side-by-side with the original.<br><br></p><p>The exclusive nature of Layer-1 blockchains poses a significant problem for DeFi protocols, which seek to take their services across several networks. There are many reasons for these issues, such as:<br></p>  Popular blockchains’ native assets, such as Bitcoin’s BTC, Ripple’s XRP, Polkadot’s DOT, etc. are incompatible with the most popular DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum.  High fees in Ethereum make users migrate to other DeFi ecosystems that might be better prepared to meet periods of high demand.  Yield-seekers trying to make the most of existing platforms across the board as opposed to limiting themselves to a single ecosystem.<br>   Enter the million-dollar question: what is cross-chain interoperability and how can it be achieved? <p>Cross-chain interoperability is the ability of a blockchain network to speak with other blockchains with which they share a similar underlying technology to drive information sharing. <br></p><p>Through cross-chain bridges and communication channels, users could in theory seamlessly and securely move value across different networks. Like two parallel lines finding a way to meet, cross-chain interoperability could unlock a way for different blockchain networks to speak to each other, with <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">DeFi</a> being the biggest benefactor.<br></p>So far, cross-chain bridges have been the best way for users to move assets across multiple blockchains. (<a href="https://www.xdefi.io/article/cross-chain-bridges/">Source</a>) Why is cross-chain interoperability so important for DeFi? <p>Before the days of cross-chain interoperability, DeFi protocols were also restricted to serving the crypto community of the blockchain on which they were built. There was no room for non-Ethereum users to participate in Decentralized Finance on the most popular blockchain ecosystem. <br></p><p>Because of a lack of interoperability, DeFi protocols were limited to only the original blockchain they were built on. As such, they inherited all the underlying challenges associated with their native network. For Ethereum, this meant slow transaction speeds and high gas fees. For a few others, it was <a href="https://b2broker.com/news/cryptocurrency-liquidity-and-finding-the-best-liquidity-provider/">low liquidity</a> and a smaller customer base. <br></p><p>Cross-chain interoperability, therefore, changed the game for decentralized finance.<br></p><p>Projects no longer have to build for one network alone, as they can easily allow asset transfers across blockchains through bridges. Users can also complete cross-chain token swaps, deposit liquidity, collect and repay loans, farm new tokens without limitations, and transfer assets across networks at all times. Cross-chain interoperability also bridged previously disenfranchised participants into the world of DeFi, creating entry points for retail and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/how-defi-could-unlock-institutional-liquidity/">institutional</a> users alike.<br></p>Cross-chain interoperability among blockchain-based systems using transactions. (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/knowledge-engineering-review/article/abs/crosschain-interoperability-among-blockchainbased-systems-using-transactions/F411CF8796F08AFBEA09A3153A5F2183">Source</a>)<p>In summary, with cross-chain interoperability, DeFi protocols can enjoy:<br></p>  Scalability: Utilizing several blockchain networks allows for greater scalability, faster transaction speeds and reduced gas fees.<br>  Greater adoption: When a DeFi protocol supports cross-chain interoperability, it can access a greater pool of users across the different networks and provide DeFi services to everyone. <br>  Storage spread: A high number of users leads to higher storage costs for DeFi applications. When services are supported across several blockchains, DeFi protocols can spread storage costs evenly across networks. <br>  Liquidity spread: The more users a DeFi protocol can reach, the more liquidity is available for lending, borrowing, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">staking</a>, etc. Cross-chain interoperability creates an avenue for a large inflow of liquidity across several blockchains.   Relevant cross-chain DeFi concepts<br> A high-level overview of the cross-chain DeFi infrastructure. (<a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-on-steroids/cross-chain-infrastructure-to-go-for-defi-dapps-55cfbe55470e">Source</a>)<p>As DeFi applications and protocols continue to build for a cross-chain future, several projects and concepts have carved a niche for themselves in decentralized finance. They have become integral parts of the DeFi ecosystem, helping drive cross-chain transactions and, ultimately, DeFi adoption. Some of them include:<br></p> Bridges: a pillar of cross-chain DeFi <p>Bridges are essential infrastructure in the cross-chain DeFi ecosystem – the fundamental framework behind multichain asset transfers. Essentially, bridges lock assets on one network and mint the equivalent assets on the other. They can be unidirectional (allowing one-way transactions only) or bidirectional (allowing back and forth transactions across two networks).<br></p><p>The need for cross-chain bridges first emerged when the DeFi ecosystem started growing on the Ethereum network, while the Bitcoin network remained the biggest source of crypto liquidity. This lead to the creation of a wBTC bridge enabling the transfer of BTC from the Bitcoin to the Ethereum network. However, it’s worth noting that this bridge is a token-specific unidirectional bridge, meaning wBTC only supports Bitcoin and transfers the value from the Bitcoin to Ethereum network, not the other way around.<br></p><p>Some other popular cross-chain DeFi bridges include <a href="https://multichain.org/">Multichain</a> Bridge, <a href="https://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer">cBridge</a>, <a href="https://portalbridge.com/">Portal</a> (formerly Wormhole), and <a href="https://www.poly.network/">Poly Network</a>. Bridges for smart contract blockchains tend to be of the more flexible kind, as they allow for two-way communication.</p> Cross-chain liquidity networks &amp; decentralized exchanges <p>Even though cross-chain bridges bear the load of most cross-chain communications, they suffer from a range of issues. These include security concerns, the complexity of wrapped tokens, and the skepticism from several blockchain proponents.<br></p><p>Cross-chain liquidity networks and cross-chain decentralized exchanges (DEXs) aim to solve the problems faced by bridges and enable users to swap one network’s native token to another network’s native token (e.g. swap BTC for ETH without bridging assets, that is, an atomic swap) through a <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/cryptoeconomic-research/osmosis-a-fully-customizable-cross-chain-amm-built-on-cosmos/">cross-chain AMM</a> model.<br></p><p>With cross-chain interoperability and robust, intelligent algorithms, liquidity networks &amp; DEXs can power native token swap transactions across different blockchains. They also enjoy high liquidity. Famous examples include <a href="https://thorchain.org/">ThorChain</a>, <a href="https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/">Gravity DEX</a>, and <a href="https://polkadex.trade/">Polkadex</a>.</p> Cross-chain staking protocols <p>Previously, DeFi staking protocols were limited to their native chains. With cross-chain interoperability, users can now stake assets across various networks, participate as validators, and enjoy staking rewards from each network. Cross-staking protocols enable users to earn passive income and contribute to network security across blockchains.</p> Cross-chain lending protocols <p>Lending and borrowing have always been a critical part of Decentralized Finance. With cross-chain lending protocols, users can borrow assets or supply liquidity for borrowers from one blockchain network to the other. Popular cross-chain lending protocols include Compound Finance, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/16/defi-platform-aave-lauches-v3-with-cross-chain-swaps-front-and-center/">Aave Protocol</a>, and Abracadabra.</p> The present state of DeFi interoperability <p>Cross-chain DeFi has gone beyond being a buzz phrase, as several projects are leaning towards facilitating blockchain interoperability. While interoperability has helped drive DeFi adoption on a grand scale and move billions of dollars in liquidity into Decentralized Finance, several factors remind us that the DeFi ecosystem is still in its early days. <br></p> Unsolved bridge vulnerabilities<br> <p>Bridges have also become viable targets for hackers looking to exploit large liquidity pools, and the continued attacks threaten the entire DeFi ecosystem.<br></p><p>According to <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/cross-chain-bridge-hacks-2022/">Chainalysis</a>, funds from cross-chain protocol hacks represented 69% of all the funds stolen in the crypto space in 2022. Recently, hackers attacked cross-chain bridge Nomad and stole over $100 million, representing the seventh major crypto bridge hack this year. Earlier in 2022, a heist on Wormhole (a bridge between Ethereum and Solana) resulted in a $320 million exploit, while the Axie Infinity sidechain Ronin was exploited in March, resulting in the loss of over $622 million. <br></p><p>It’s worth noting that bridge security is a major pending assignment for the crypto community. This is because several factors make bridges inherently attractive for attackers. The most common cross-chain bridge design requires locking native assets on the source chain and minting wrapped-assets on the destination blockchain. Since this model results in a large pool of assets locked on the source chain in a single contract/wallets, malicious actors only need to focus on a single contract to direct their efforts for a potential high reward. <br></p><p>Furthermore, as Vitalik Buterin (Founder of Ethereum) has repeatedly stressed, cross-chain bridges are prone to other security issues, such as their vulnerability in the event of 51% attacks. Vitalik argued in a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/">Reddit post</a> that, in the case of a blockchain network getting 51% attacked, the native assets in user wallets remain safe, whereas bridged assets’ value is prone to getting diluted.<br></p>As it often happens, Vitalik Buterin’s concerns about bridges quickly made headlines across the blockchain community. Overreliance on Ethereum and the EVM<br> <p>Beyond security threats, interoperability is still not mainstream in DeFi. The dApp concentration on Ethereum remains high (78% of all decentralized finance applications are Ethereum-native), and most dApps do not support cross-chain interoperability. <br></p><p>Another barrier limiting the proliferation of cross-chain applications is EVM-compatibility.</p><p>EVM stands for <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>, a virtual component that is contained in every Ethereum node which takes in smart contracts (usually written in high-level languages like Solidity) and converts them into EVM bytecode. <br></p><p>EVM-compatibility means creating a code execution environment that supports EVM bytecode, therefore enabling Ethereum developers to migrate their smart contracts from Ethereum to other chains without having to write code from scratch. Some of the most popular EVM-compatible chain are Polygon, BSC, and Avalanche. Since not all blockchain networks are EVM-compatible, this creates a barrier for developers as their smart contracts cannot be deployed on non-EVM compatible chains. This also puts pressure on developers to stay grounded on EVM-compatible chains, since otherwise they might not be able to port their applications outside their host chain.<br></p> Privacy concerns associated with Layer-1 blockchains<br> <p>Because of the public-open nature of bridges, enabling DeFi interoperability may also come at the expense of privacy, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-economics-of-privacy-an-overview-of-the-economic-consequences-of-total-transparency-fed489e71d47/">transparency</a>, and individual autonomy. Privacy is already a concern for most blockchain network users, but when their transaction records are spread across several blockchains, it becomes even more worrying. Furthermore, guaranteeing seamless interoperability between private and public chains represents its own set of challenges.<br></p><p>With <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/blockchain-network-bridge-hacks/">security</a>, privacy, and slow adoption threatening the progress of DeFi interoperability, Panther proposes a series of alternatives to help cross-chain interoperability go private, finding its next breakthrough.</p> Cross-chain interoperability: What does the future hold? <p>Although cross-chain interoperability in DeFi is getting the much-needed traction it deserves, there is yet a lot of ground to cover before it becomes a norm in the crypto space. Several leading decentralized applications do not support cross-chain transactions, while those that already do face a plethora of challenges.<br></p><p>Cross-chain bridges are the bedrock of DeFi interoperability, and they have increasingly come under attack from hackers recently. While they have helped drive scalability in DeFi, cross-chain solutions increase privacy and transparency risks, and some known bridges even demand <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">KYC verification</a> from potential users.<br></p><p>In the future, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a> will continue to gain a foothold in crypto. Blockchain interoperability will play a significant role in leveling the DeFi playing field for users and protocols. The excess liquidity on Ethereum is also likely to spread across other blockchain networks. Similarly, the development of more blockchain-agnostic solutions like <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> (which aims to build industry-standard private bridges that interconnect DeFi through a series of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-multi-asset-shielded-pools-enabling-heterogeneous-mixing-of-assets-ec165854bf0f/">Multi-Asset Shielded Pools</a>) will be a catalyst for widespread DeFi adoption through interoperability.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Web3 is the new frontline for privacy — here’s how we can fight for&nbsp;it <p>Web3 has become an umbrella term for a range of increasingly disparate visions of the future of the internet. For some people, ‘Web3’ means metaverse-based projects of the sort trumpeted by Meta. For others, it describes new protocols and modes of organisation based on distributed ownership and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Generally speaking, though (and for our purposes), Web3 means the emerging new iteration of digital communication based on the principles of decentralisation. Web3 uses blockchain-based technologies, tokenisation, and cryptography to enable new forms of cooperation and transmission of information. Nascent examples of this include&nbsp;DAOs.</p> Is Web3&nbsp;private? <p>There is no simple answer to this question — and, of course, if you need clarification about whether or not a technology you’re using is truly private, then it almost certainly is&nbsp;not.</p><p>The current iteration of the internet, known as Web2 (or Web 2.0), is characterised by catastrophic centralisation. Power (whether exercised directly, for example through state surveillance and its outcomes, or indirectly, for example through control of the vectors through which information travels) is concentrated in an ever-smaller number of siloes. Control of those siloes is contested; one of the major developments associated with this phase of the web has been the extraordinary rise of tech-enabled non-nation-state actors such as GAFA. These monolithic companies are both challengers to conventional state power and inextricable partners of those states, the latter of which increasingly cannot do without the infrastructural assets of the&nbsp;former.</p><p>Some observers appear to consider Web3 inherently ‘more private’ than the existing model because they associate words like ‘blockchain’ and ‘decentralisation’ with anonymity. Others have a different understanding: to these people Web3 must be inherently ‘less private’ because they associate blockchains and decentralisation with total transparency, presumably because of the oft-repeated but much-misunderstood fact that transactions on a blockchain are immutable and everyone can ‘see’&nbsp;them.</p><p>In reality, of course, the technologies associated with Web3 can and will be deployed in different ways that suit individual use-cases. There are many situations in which some degree of privacy is absolutely critical. Consider, for example, the storage and transmission of medical&nbsp;data.</p><p>Beyond this there are significant questions about the degree to which decentralisation will actually be achieved, at least for the average web user. Consider the crypto exchange model. In order to transact in Bitcoin, for example, most users require an ‘on-ramp’ enabling them to buy coins in exchange for fiat currency — a function that is carried out by huge centralised exchanges with vast data processing power and everyone’s credit card details. This is far from true decentralisation.</p> Can we make Web3&nbsp;private? <p>The examples above give an indication of just some of the first infrastructural pitfalls that Web3 has to overcome in order to achieve anything like its promise of decentralisation and, crucially, to fulfil its potential for privacy. They should highlight that there is no inherent privacy in Web3; there is no ‘baked-in’ privacy protocol, and privacy is not guaranteed by&nbsp;design.</p><p>Privacy will not be achieved in Web3 unless it is taken as the foundational principle of these new modes of communication. In practice, this means the creation of a ‘layer 0’ protocol that guarantees anonymity — that is, a protocol that is private by design. The Web2 analogue here is TCP/IP, the governing protocol of the modern internet, also known as the network layer. Nym is working hard to build this layer 0 privacy protocol for Web3, which also enables interoperability between other protocols and standards (whether blockchain-based or not). But the tech stack of Web3 privacy is broader than just layer&nbsp;0.</p><p><a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> focuses on running private smart contracts which don’t expose user data to the public, unlike most if not all other smart contract systems. <a href="https://www.manta.network/">Manta</a> is relying on a state-of-the-art cryptographic primitive called zk-SNARK to build its decentralised protocols for private payments, token exchanges, loans and synthetic assets. <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec</a> enables users to privately interact with all DeFI services within the Ethereum ecosystem by integrating specific zero knowledge proof circuits in smart contracts already deployed. <a href="https://www.offshift.io/">Offshift </a>and <a href="https://www.railgun.org/#/">Railgun</a> focus on privacy for smart contracts; <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> and <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a> aim to provide privacy in currency transactions… And the list goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>There is a growing community of projects and developers dedicated to making Web3 more private, and to building applications that enable privacy for specific actions and circumstances. The battle to wrest control of the nascent new internet from the clutches of state and corporate actors is going to be a long and difficult one, and privacy requires constant vigilance. Thankfully, there is an <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/live/video?roomId=2100782">emerging coalition</a> of projects dedicated to a private internet. Nym is proud to be among them. We each bring different solutions to the table — but we all share a common&nbsp;vision.</p><p>In order to build a truly private future for digital communication we need cooperation, mutual support, and interoperability. And, perhaps most importantly, we need clear, effective and unified communication about the problem we are&nbsp;solving.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/web3-is-the-new-frontline-for-privacy-heres-how-we-can-fight-for-it-eb4ee785d890">Web3 is the new frontline for privacy — here’s how we can fight for it</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Here are <a href="https://www.tillyone.com/home/">TillyONE’s</a> responses to some questions from the Findora community:  1) Tell Us About&nbsp;Yourself <p>I’m a California-native Systems Administrator. My first PC as a kid was a 486DX (this REALLY dates me&nbsp;:/ ), and I’ve been into technology ever since. More importantly, I’m a father of two great boys &amp; have a wonderful wife who helps guide me, looks out for our family, and cares for those in need every&nbsp;day.</p><p>I’ve managed servers ever since I was 19 (again, I won’t share my age, but trust me, it’s been a long time). Since then, I’ve been in the professional IT industry for 10&nbsp;years.</p> 2) What brought you into crypto/web3 in the first&nbsp;place? <p>My first venture in the crypto-verse was with Eth in 2017. Miss those&nbsp;prices!</p><p>Since then, I’ve mined LTC, CPU &amp; GPU farming pools, experimented with basic ASIC hardware, and anything else to&nbsp;learn.</p><p>These new PoS tech systems like Findora are really the future&nbsp;IMO.</p> 3) What is your experience in validating or web3 in&nbsp;general? <p>I’ve been a validator in one form or another for 11 months now. I’ve learned the growing pains both from being a validator myself and from issues for a chain in general. I’ve also gained the experience to execute proper maintenance and upgrades when needed for minimal downtime on a&nbsp;node.</p> 4) What makes your operation unique? <p>TillyONE from day one has had a real family vibe to it. I really believe while the tech development, investments from VCs and Exchanges, etc. are important, the main question is, “What are we doing this&nbsp;for?”</p><p>For TillyONE, it’s for the family to learn new things about web3/crypto (because it’s evolving and will be a bigger part in one’s life soon) and be a part of&nbsp;it.</p><p>In my growing years as a kid, it was WWW; now for my kids, it’s&nbsp;web3.</p> 5) Why do you want to validate with&nbsp;Findora? <p>I’ve met some really smart and honest people at another initiative.

 <p></p><p>When you hear the term 'credential', what comes to mind? Is it a driver's license, passport,  birth certificate, college degree, state ID? The common thread of these forms of credentials is that they are physical items, verified by recognized centralized bodies like a government agency or accredited university.  </p><p>So how do credentials translate into the digital world where within a few clicks someone can make a fictitious identity? Introducing... verifiable credentials (VCs), a digitally signed electronic credential that follows an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">open standard</a> that lets you create, own, and manage your credentials across a variety of platforms.</p> Why Do We Need Verifiable Credentials?<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Over the course of your digital history, you've likely signed up for hundreds of apps and services with elements of your personal data fragmented, such as your name, email address, or more sensitive information like your date of birth and government ID number. These services then share your data with other third parties that you may not even be aware of - with or without your consent. It's difficult to go back and deactivate your profiles, delete your accounts, or reclaim additional data these services have collected on you. Worse is if there is a data breach in one of these services and now your data is out in the public.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials aim to solve these problems by putting the power to manage your data back into your hands. Imagine being able to own and control your personal data by only allowing access to services that require it and having the authority to disable services that no longer need it. You can even manage your data on your own self-hosted decentralized web node via an identity hub without relying on any centralized third party. </p><p>Additionally, you can own multiple Verifiable Credentials for various use cases such as a student ID, a driver's license, a passport, or a certificate you earned. You can also have one specific Verifiable Credential with multiple <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations">presentation layers</a> such as a passport where certain metadata is presented when used in a given context.</p> How Do Verifiable Credentials Work?<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>You may be wondering who actually issues a Verifiable Credential, how does it get verified and who verifies the verifier? </p><p>Let's look at the following example of the manual way credentials are issued. You've been accepted to your top university of choice and now need a student ID to access both the campus and online resources. Specifically, you want to apply for a campus parking permit as well. </p><p>Typically this process would involve you taking physical copies of multiple forms of ID verification such as a passport, birth certificate, and driver's license to a physical office. Then after a few days of various checks, you're finally issued a physical student ID card from that university. The university trusts the entity that issued your birth certificate, passport, and driver's license to create a student ID for you. They can even look you up by the identification numbers on these documents. </p><p>But what if someone in the admissions office looked up your driver's license and noticed those parking tickets you have? Were they even allowed to do so and could this bias their decision to give you a parking permit?</p><p>The current process looks something like this:</p><p></p><p>Now let’s look at how verifiable credentials could help in this scenario. The university would run verification checks for each document provided (passport, driver’s license, birth certificate, etc) and the credential would be limited to just basic bio data that is required such as a legal name, date of birth, etc. So no one from the student department will be able to see your ticketing history associated with your driver’s license.</p><p></p> Using Verified Credentials<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) work alongside Verifiable Credentials. DIDs are unique identifiers that let us reference various VCs and the entities that also issue those credentials. For example a government or company can have their own unique DID. </p><p>DIDs use the following schema:</p><p>
photo credit: W3C</p><p>DIDs can then be used to create a Verified Credential by digitally signing it and assigning it to a holder, similar to how transactions are cryptographically signed in a blockchain. Depending on the signature format of the credential, the holder (also known as a DID subject) can then choose how much of that credential they want to present to an entity requesting the credential, which is referred to as selective disclosure. </p><p>An example is an employer, Company X, who looks up the DID of your college diploma from University Y. </p><p>Company X queries the issuer of your Diploma Verifiable Credential, in this case University Y, and also looks up the DID of that university in a verifiable data registry (VDR). Think of VDRs as just lists that can be managed and maintained by various parties such as wallets, financial institutions, DAOs, non-profits, etc. If your credentials have valid digital signatures but somehow University Y is on a list of non-accredited institutions in the USA but accredited institutions in Europe, it would be up to the Company X to decide if they want to accept it.</p><p>The diagram below outlines the flow of this process.</p><p>
photo credit: W3C</p> Use Cases for Verifiable Credentials<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>There are several use cases that can be realized with the use of Verifiable Credentials, such as</p>  Employment checks without being invasive   Managing of health records, land titles, etc  Managing of various forms of personal identification such as passports, driver’s licenses, etc   KYC (Know Your Customer) checks for financial institutions and businesses  Managing your gamer profile across different metaverses  Managing Memberships  <p>DIDs and VCs allow us to create identities and credentials in an interoperable ecosystem that allow developers and businesses to build a new wave of products, applications, and services that put users in control.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This is the twentieth post in an <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/">ongoing, regular series</a> describing new and upcoming privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by iOS Privacy Engineer Jacob Sikorski. This post was written by Senior Director of Privacy Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>Recent versions of Brave on iOS include many new privacy features, ensuring that Brave iOS users have the strongest available protections of any iOS browser. Apple-imposed restrictions make it difficult for us to include some of the advanced privacy protections from our Desktop and Android browsers in our iOS browser. However, our new iOS browser works around these limitations, and brings the privacy features on Brave iOS closer into alignment with our other platforms.</p>

 Debouncing and de-AMP-ing to avoid tracking sites 
<p>Since the recent Brave iOS 1.39 release, Brave protects users from a form of tracking where the tracker records what sites you visit by getting between you and the content you want to see. Brave for iOS now includes the <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/11-debouncing/">debouncing</a> and <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/18-de-amp/">de-AMP-ing</a> protections already available on other platforms of the Brave browser.</p>
<p>Google’s AMP system allows Google to learn about your interests by serving content on behalf of the site you intended to view, rather than showing you the site itself. Bounce tracking similarly allows trackers to learn about your interests by getting in the middle of the site you’re coming from and the site you intend to visit. Brave iOS users now have protections against both kinds of tracking.</p>

 Enhanced content blocking for tracker protection 
<p>Brave iOS versions 1.41 and later include additional, advanced tracker blocking capabilities. Brave iOS has always included optimized versions of popular filter lists, applied through <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/creating_a_content_blocker">Apple’s Content Blocking system</a>.</p>
<p>Though useful, Apple’s Content Blocking system has significant limitations, including restrictions on the number and kinds of tracker-blocking rules that can be applied. These restrictions are very similar to the kinds of alarming restrictions Google is pushing through its <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/googles-manifest-v3-still-hurts-privacy-security-innovation">Manifest v3 system</a>. As a result, Brave iOS users have not been able to enjoy the full range of <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust">advanced blocking and content filtering protections</a> available on our Desktop and Android releases.</p>
<p>Starting in version 1.41, Brave iOS <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-ios/pull/5444">includes workarounds for some of the limitations Apple imposes on iOS browsers</a>. These workarounds mean Brave iOS users can enjoy a greater number of the dynamic blocking capabilities already available on Desktop and Android. Future Brave iOS versions will further close the gap between platforms.</p>

 Randomization to protect against browser fingerprinting 
<p>Brave iOS versions 1.38 and later include even stronger protections against browser fingerprinting. Brave iOS previously protected users against browser fingerprinting by disabling vulnerable APIs in third-party frames. This approach was useful, but neither ideal (since it only provided moderate protections in first-party contexts) nor compatible (since it broke some desirable third-party uses of these APIs).</p>
<p>While Brave iOS users were partially protected against fingerprinting because of protections built into WKWebView (the browser engine Apple forces all iOS browsers to use), Apple’s restrictions made it difficult to provide the more robust and compatible protections available in Brave on Desktop and Android.</p>
<p>Starting in version 1.38, Brave iOS included the kinds of <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/4-fingerprinting-defenses-2.0/">fingerprint randomization defenses Brave includes on our other platforms</a>. These protections not only provide <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-ios/pull/5156">even stronger defenses again fingerprinting</a>, but they do so in a more comprehensive (they’re enabled by default in first-and-third-party contexts) and compatible (they maintain benign uses while preventing fingerprinting) manner than was available in earlier iOS versions.</p>

 Why are privacy protections on iOS tricky? 
<p>Brave iOS provides the strongest privacy protections available on iOS browsers. However, Apple’s restrictions prevent us from providing iOS users with the full range of advanced, best-in-class privacy protections Brave includes in its Android and Desktop versions.</p>
<p>On the upside, Apple’s platform restrictions limit the kinds of harm tracking companies can inflict; the worst iOS app is still more private than the worst Android or Desktop app. However, this cuts the other way, too: Apple’s restrictions limit the kinds of extra protections privacy-respecting and protecting companies (like Brave) can provide. Basically, Apple limits both the bad that privacy-harming companies can do, but also limits the good that responsible companies can provide.</p>
<p>We hope that Apple will loosen these restrictions, and provide advanced capabilities to companies like Brave that are dedicated to protecting user privacy.</p>

  <p>A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is preferred over traditional identification methods for its promise of privacy and security by virtue of it living on a public blockchain. This seems theoretically true, for now.</p>
<p>Attacks on public blockchain on which these DIDs are hosted have brought us back to the point of lack of privacy. In other words, we still face the privacy challenges that pushed us to use the DID methods in the first place.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading this summary as it progressed from the cause, impact, and to the solutions to the challenge. However, I came across a <a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/research-summary-summarizing-and-analyzing-the-privacy-preserving-techniques-in-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies/1539">research summary</a> on this forum by <a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/u/tolulope">@Tolulope</a>  which offers interesting solutions like off-chain transactions, Coinjoin, etc., to the studied challenges.</p>
<p>Applying these solutions would go a long way to mitigating the challenges of did:btcr as a decentralized identifier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/u/simin">@simin</a> Do know if there are DID methods present on other blockchains such as Ethereum? Since this research is focused on the impact of privacy attacks on a DID method on the Bitcoin Blockchain, it would be great to extend the research to other blockchains to have a holistic understanding of the impact of privacy attacks on the whole DLT.</p>
<p>If DID methods similar to did:btcr exist on other blockchains, they could be studied to:</p>
 
 
<p>compare with the results obtained from the Bitcoin Blockchain</p>
 
 
<p>make conclusions on the best solutions to apply in solving these privacy issues, since different blockchains have different consensus mechanisms and algorithms.</p>

<p>On 29 July 2022, Circle responded to a consultation issued by the UK’s HM Treasury regarding the Government’s proposed application of the Financial Market Infrastructure Special Administration Regime (FMI SAR) to systemic digital settlement asset (including stablecoin) firms. In its response, Circle reiterated its continued commitment to responsible digital asset regulation, and encouraged HM Treasury to establish a bespoke regulatory and oversight framework for systemic digital settlement asset firms, and for fully-reserved digital currency issuers to be subject to sound prudential regulation. Circle affirmed the need for greater clarity in determining a “systemic” designation for digital settlement asset firms, and questioned whether the FMI SAR was the appropriate regime for these firms given the existence of payments and e-money special administration regimes in the UK. Circle encouraged HM Treasury to thoroughly evaluate the differences between blockchain-based payment systems and traditional inter-bank payment systems prior to establishing a regulatory regime for digital settlement asset firms which may be ill-fitting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 <p></p><p>At TBD, we believe in a decentralized future that returns ownership and control
over your finances, data, and identity. Decentralized Identity is critical to
our mission. It’s what puts people in control of their own data. It is the most
private, secure, and user-centric way to facilitate information exchange and
verification online.</p><p>The <a href="http://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>
(DIF) is a cooperative community that
shares and advances our vision. We’re honored to work alongside members like
<a href="https://spruceid.com/">Spruce</a>, <a href="https://transmute.industries/">Transmute</a>,
and others on open standards which drive this work forward.
Today we're announcing that we’ve achieved another milestone on that journey.</p><p>TBD and Spruce are the first implementers to demonstrate full interoperability
for the JSON Web Signature Test Suite. These tests are a major step towards
vendor interoperability. Interop is what allows standard technologies to play
nicely with one another, regardless of the backing vendor implementation.</p><p>TBD and Spruce now support all
<a href="https://w3id.org/security/suites/jws-2020#jose-conformance">five JWS algorithms</a>
for <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">JSON Web Signature 2020</a>
(Data Integrity Proofs) using
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519">JSON Web Tokens</a> (JWTs)
for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs)
and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">W3C Verifiable Presentations</a>
(VPs).</p><p>We can only realize the full potential of Decentralized Identity if we
have networks of Issuers and Verifiers that can produce and consume one
another’s data. The real power of Decentralized Identity is the controlled
sharing of information directly between individuals and other entities,
which makes interoperability a necessity.</p><p>More details about the Conformance Test Suite that was developed by members
of DIF and our interoperability test reports can be found here:</p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/JWS-Test-Suite/#tbd">TBD’s test results of JWS Test Suite</a>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/JWS-Test-Suite/#spruce">Spruce’s test results of JWS Test Suite</a>  <p>At TBD, we support open standards wherever appropriate, and all of our projects are open source. We know our efforts will only be successful if we work in public with the community. We are grateful to work with folks like Spruce and Transmute in the W3C and DIF. By collaborating on common goals in accordance with our ethos, as this achievement exemplifies, we can accelerate the adoption of Decentralized Identity.</p>

         Nolan Bushnell: Original Gamer                <p>By Michael Gold</p><p>Photography: MICHELLE GROSKOPF</p><p>Published August 11, 2022</p>            <p>Fifty years after co-founding Atari, Nolan Bushnell offers a masterclass in selling fun.</p>       



 
 
   
<p>Nolan Bushnell needs no introduction. When he arrives at Two Bit Circus in downtown Los Angeles, I recognize him as soon as he steps out of his car: the grandfatherly goofball with a shock of white beard, tall and casual in a baseball cap and sneakers.</p>



<p>“I’m so sorry about last time,” he says, referring to the first time we tried to meet and his daughter told me he had just tested positive for covid-19. I demur and follow him into the building where we will conduct our interview.</p>



<p>It is a warehouse filled with gaming stations, baroque furniture, art installations and other sensory stimulants. A life-size Hungry Hungry Hippos awaits players—children and child-like grownups alike—next to massive arcade booths kitted out with dozens of colorful buttons and knobs, their screens still dark as Two Bit Circus prepares to open to the public for the afternoon. An inanimate horse’s rear end from a merry-go-round, gaudily painted in red and gold, offers a seat from beneath a bar in the middle of the cavernous space.</p>



<p>Bushnell’s son, Brent, opened Two Bit Circus in 2018, drawing on a penchant for fun that runs in the family. As the founder of Atari, the elder Bushnell popularized one of the most enduring tools of entertainment-based escapism in history: the video game. Long before that, though, an amusement park job he held in college introduced him to the thrill of selling fun. He loved the role—a true duck-in-water experience that saw him “always just massacring quota,” as he describes it.</p>







 <br>Going with the flow state 



<p>Much of the opportunity for the tech-enabled exploration that fed Bushnell’s instincts arose by happenstance. The military, a big presence in the suburban Utah community of Bushnell’s youth, regularly discarded heaps of kit that Bushnell and his friends would purloin. His neighbor ran a surplus store “full of neat shit.” All this opened a world of machines for him, to the extent that by age ten, he was timing the emergence of sunspots in order to open communication lines over his self-built radio to Japan.</p>



<p>“In junior high school science and physics, I often knew more than the teacher did, and I was not always nice about it,” he laughs.</p>



<p>Yet even amid the explosion of technological innovations taking place in the early 1950s, a career as an entrepreneur was hardly a preordained path. The customary route for technologists during Bushnell’s formative years involved working for the government or a large company. But Bushnell felt his first entrepreneurial itch selling strawberries for his mother at age six. At ten, he repaired TVs, figuring out how to acquire replacement parts and mark them up for less than professionals in the yellow pages while still making a big profit by adolescent terms. “I always disdained the thought of selling time for money,” he says.</p>



<p>It helped that Bushnell felt a profound sense of fulfillment from all this tinkering. Without knowing it, he would enter a “flow state”—also known as being “in the zone”—which holds that when a task is “hard, but not overwhelming, achievable, but not frustrating or boring,” in Bushnell’s words, the brain enters a particularly receptive condition.</p>



<p>“Time dilates; you can play for an hour and think it’s 15 minutes,” he says, his gray eyes flashing with excitement as he explains how the flow state has influenced him throughout his life.</p>



<p>The flow state is precisely what happens during intensive gameplay, a fact that Bushnell recognized as the key to creating an empire out of interactive entertainment. What elevates Bushnell’s creations above normal games emerges from something unique to his technologist demographic: the ability to enter that state when constructing hardware, to land on those time-dilating, brain-expanding conditions when cauterizing metal or fiddling with wires. In addition to shockers, as a young man Bushnell also made a ham radio, a speaker phone, a rudimentary neighborhood telephone network and a system of lights on his bedroom ceiling that would illuminate during storms. Later, he would invent the world’s first functional car navigation system a full decade before the advent of GPS.</p>



<p>Quasi-spiritual motivations like the flow state entered Bushnell’s repertoire soon after he moved to Silicon Valley, whose nascent chip industry of the 1960s attracted him. What influenced him yet more, perhaps, was the counterculture taking hold at the time. “I was very influenced by the hippie movement,” Bushnell says. It would lead him to break rules and challenge conventions at Atari in significant ways, compelling him to overcome hurdles that were far bigger than they appear in hindsight: video games, for one, barely existed as an industry. What did pass for an industry was largely stigmatized and consigned to dark corners of dive bars.</p>



<p>“Early on, there was a lot of controversy about video games,” Bushnell says. “Parents didn’t want their kids going anywhere near them; whole countries banned them.”</p>

 Prankster in chief 



<p>This tide started shifting bit by bit as Pong, Atari’s flagship title, permeated deeper into the world’s cultural fabric. Don Valentine, the storied Sequoia founder, paid several visits to Atari’s Sunnyvale factory amid growing hype around the game before ultimately investing in 1975. The company, under Bushnell’s leadership, was a goofy place: Friday evening beer fests, smoking marijuana at headquarters, even one instance in which Bushnell rented a jet and flew the staff to Disneyland.</p>



<p>Bushnell says much of Atari’s early reputation has been mischaracterized, even though it has had real-world consequences for Bushnell himself: in 2018, activists successfully denied him a prominent video game lifetime achievement award he was slated to receive, accusing him of fostering an environment in Atari at the time that was toxic to women. When I ask him if any employees felt alienated by Atari’s culture back then, Bushnell says, “no, not at all.” And many of Atari’s early female employees have <a href="https://kotaku.com/sex-pong-and-pioneers-what-atari-was-really-like-ac-1822930057">spoken fondly</a> of their experience.</p>



<p>Bushnell reiterates the values of fairness, dignity and camaraderie that he enumerated in a “goals” manifesto published in Atari’s second year. It specifically directed employees to “judge all people on the basis of their skill and contributions, and not tolerate discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, appearance or personal life”—something that many companies still struggle with to this day.</p>



<p>A big element of this system was a more outcomes-driven process of evaluations than was common in the corporate world at the time, one that depended on maintaining a sense of play and fun at work. “As a manager in a highly structured environment, when you’re not working directly on the assembly line, it can be hard to get undoctored feedback, to see where the problems are,” Bushnell says. “Injecting this element of fun as a social lubricant can help lower inhibitions to honesty. This leads to better results.”</p>



<p>It can also serve as a potent recruitment tool, as Bushnell learned when he hired Apple founder Steve Jobs into his first corporate role at 19. Atari’s early working culture—shenanigans and all—would ultimately plant the seeds for the kind of agile, quick-pivot, collegial atmosphere that pervades Silicon Valley and has since spread to startup hubs around the world. While some have adapted this into a “move fast and break things” mantra, Bushnell clarifies that he drew the line at anything illegal or unethical.</p>



<p>“We had one colleague who wanted to grow cannabis on company property,” he says. “I thought that was a bridge too far.”</p>



<p>Pranks, on the other hand, were par for the course. In perhaps one of the most famous in technology history, Bushnell convinced a colleague to design the prototype version of Pong by telling him—falsely—that he had secured a contract from General Electric.</p>



<p>“[Pulling pranks] was part of my DNA,” Bushnell says. “I feel like all rebels have to have a bit of the prankster within them.”</p>

 Be my Valentine 



<p>Bushnell admits that mastering the business side of running a fast-growing company was a harder slog than inspiring people—or, in some instances, pranking them—to discover amazing ways to manipulate technology. This is where mentors like Don Valentine played a role: Valentine, a former semiconductor executive, filled the hard-nosed, analytical side of Atari in a way that helped power the company both before and after Sequoia’s initial investment.</p>



<p>“Don would always ask me tough questions about the numbers,” Bushnell says. “It became a competitive thing with us—I would cram before board meetings just so Don couldn’t stump me.”</p>



<p>This yin-yang relationship between the two men eventually evolved into a full-fledged friendship (Bushnell even hired Don’s kids to work in his garden). The two stayed close after Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in 1976, and Valentine helped fund Chuck E. Cheese in their post-Atari years. Despite Valentine’s reputation as the more business-focused of the two, he wasn’t above participating in the trappings of startup culture quickly taking shape in Silicon Valley: “After we inked the [funding] deal, he brought an iced-up tub of champagne to the party,” Bushnell gushes.</p>



<p>That funding deal, however, could not have happened without the company passing a major turning point: an agreement by Sears to distribute a home version of Pong in its stores. The arrangement, struck in 1975, came together after a long slog to find a retail partner; both Toys”R”Us and Radio Shack had previously turned them down. Bushnell cites several reasons: the failure of a rival game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, to catch on; jitters over the novelty and uncertainty about a new gaming technology; disagreements over the appropriate price point. Culturally, big-box retailers—Sears included—were a poor fit for Atari’s looser style. In one infamous anecdote, a team of Sears executives walked into Atari’s headquarters wearing starched collars and walked out in t-shirts.</p>



<p>“With Sears, it really came down to one buyer—this guy named Tom Quinn—who believed in us,” Bushnell says. “I really credit him for putting Atari on the map.”</p>



<p>On Atari’s side, manufacturing enough consoles in time to hit the coveted holiday shopping period was a nerve-wracking challenge. Here, Valentine’s influence was indispensable, helping Atari acquire a new factory in order to meet demand. “Don definitely believed in the consumer market to a greater extent than he did the coin-op market,” Bushnell says. Sequoia’s partnership would go on to propel Atari from a niche, if buzzy, game maker into one of the most iconic companies in history.</p>







 <br>How to unplug a toilet 



<p>An ability to recognize and lean on the capabilities of peers like Valentine—and to take their advice when warranted—is a hallmark of Bushnell’s success, one that he readily confesses to. “I’m the kind of person who has a million different ideas, and in my best moments I’ve been lucky to find the right teams to execute them.” He describes his current role in business as an “activator” who, like the pinball machines dotting the floor of Two Bit Circus, retracts the spring of an inventive concept and lets others flip the paddles. Among other business plans filling his office right now are a wine-and-canapés light show experience and an idea to seed the ocean to increase its carbon-absorption capacity as a means of combating climate change. He has a lot to say about cryptocurrency—mostly positive, although his key takeaway is that “there will be many trials and tribulations before all the shit is sorted out.”</p>



<p>Education remains his biggest piece of unfinished business. He has long concerned himself with the welfare of children—they are, after all, the core audience for his most popular products. Bushnell’s long-held belief that there are better ways to learn than the conventional methods offered by the establishment led him to create ExoDexa, a San Francisco-based startup founded in 2020. ExoDexa’s tools turn classroom curriculum into video games, compelling students to engage with the material in ways they could not in a purely lecture-based environment. In his telling, learning your ABCs should not entail full-time toil; instead, children should be allowed—nay, encouraged—to play, tinker and experiment, just as he did as a youngster. Unsurprisingly, play has always been something he fostered in his own children: his eldest daughter Alissa was an early tester of Pong.</p>



<p>“I’ve been able to maintain my sense of wonder and play through my children,” he says when asked whether the ability to enjoy fun fades with age. He hopes that by centering education around play, he can help disenfranchised youth become “stealth scholars”: kids that feel motivated to improve by competing against themselves rather than seeking better grades than their peers.</p>



<p>Bushnell views this mission as more than another money-making opportunity. “What I would really like to accomplish in life is fixing education,” he says, slipping in a plug for his forthcoming book on the subject, The School of the Future, which will explain how technology and gaming can cement the Socratic method in classrooms. “What if I could teach 100% of a high school curriculum in six months, with better retention? What would you do with that extra time? You teach entrepreneurship, you teach creativity, you teach life skills. I think everybody should know how to write a business plan, how to balance a checkbook, how to unplug a toilet.”</p>



<p>I leave the rest of the education question for later—for Bushnell’s book, for the deep dive that will emerge in the next chapter of his astounding life. Instead, we spend our last few moments together touring Two Bit Circus’s colorful exhibits. Bushnell takes me to the “bridge” of the Starship Enterprise, where a plastic brain sits suspended under glass, and to an operating theater, where a cartoonish patient looks disconcertingly eager to be sliced and diced. Absorbing his enthusiasm—for education, for play, for gaming, for solving big problems—I start to understand how these seemingly disparate motives fit together. While many entrepreneurs set out to change the world, the path to wisdom, to greatness, to a place in the pantheon, is more often marked by moments of irreverent fun than flashes of great insight. If nothing else, the school of Nolan Bushnell can teach us to enjoy the ride.</p>

    <p>Ethereum has the largest and most diverse public blockchain ecosystem. This makes Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility one of the key ingredients for other blockchains to build a successful ecosystem. The EVM is a runtime environment that allows developers to create applications that can run on any Ethereum-compatible blockchain. This includes Horizen.</p>
 What Exactly is EVM? 
<p>At a high level, virtual machines create a level of abstraction between the executing code and the executing machine. All Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live on <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">EVM</a>. The protocol exists solely to keep this immutable state machine constantly running.</p>
<p>The EVM defines the rules for computing a valid state from one block to the next. EVM is a massive data structure called a modified Merkle Patricia Trie, which links all accounts with hashes, and is reducible to a root hash.</p>
<p>Programs send code to the EVM to process transactions in Ethereum. These EVM opcodes perform standard stack operations and blockchain-specific stack operations. When smart contracts are compiled, they turn into EVM opcodes.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://academy.horizen.io/technology/advanced/evm-ethereum-virtual-machine/">Horizen Academy</a> to learn more about EVM.</p>
 Leveraging the Ethereum Developer Community&nbsp; 
<p>EVM allows new blockchains to leverage the existing Ethereum developer community. These developers are already familiar with EVM and have built a wealth of applications that can run on it. EVM compatibility enables Horizen to tap into the wealth of existing developers who are used to working with Solidity. It’s estimated that there are <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-most-popular-programming-languages-used-in-blockchain-development-5133a0a207dc/#:~:text=Solidity%20is%20a%20contract%2Doriented,is%20estimated%20at%20over%20200%2C000.">over 200,000 developers</a> with experience in Solidity.</p>
<p>When it comes to blockchain development, it’s important to have as many choices as possible. By supporting EVM, Horizen is opening its platform up to a vast community of developers who can create applications that will drive its success..</p>
 Leveraging Existing DeFi Infrastructure 
<p>Another benefit of EVM compatibility is Ethereum’s defi infrastructure. There are well-established Ethereum smart contracts for an enormous range of blockchain-based products, such as automated market makers, decentralized exchanges, peer-to-peer lending protocols, stablecoins, and more.</p>
<p>By leveraging Ethereum’s defi infrastructure, new blockchains and dapps on Horizen can get up and running quickly and easily. This is important for their success, as it lowers the barriers to entry and allows them to focus on building great applications.</p>
 Building Interconnected Ecosystems 
<p>Ultimately, compatibility with the EVM allows new blockchains to build interconnected ecosystems. This is important as it allows them to tap into the resources of other blockchains and benefit from their success.</p>
<p>It also allows them to create a more diverse and inclusive blockchain community. Horizen is helping to build a more open and inclusive blockchain ecosystem that will benefit all participants through supporting EVM.<br></p>
 About Horizen’s EVM Sidechain 
<p>Horizen’s EVM sidechain is coming to testnet soon! Recently, we accomplished a major milestone of the EVM project. This is much more than just an interim step. This is a functioning sidechain, compatible with Ethereum tools and able to execute all Ethereum-compatible smart contracts.</p>
<p>To learn more about the sidechain, check out our <a href="https://youtu.be/DRIm1f9-t6Y">EVM demo video</a>. In this video, Victor and Alberto share some insights into the latest accomplishments with a demo of our EVM Alpha from Oleksandr showing ZEN on MetaMask and some of the basic functionality of the EVM chain.</p>
<p>You can also watch <a href="https://youtu.be/n3cGfULIwRg">Rob’s presentation from Consensus</a>, where he discusses the future vision of Horizen including EVM and <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/tokenmint-is-live-on-mainnet/">TokenMint</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>XST is now available as a wrapped token (namely “wXST”) on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The contract address is 0x5f834Ba9e4E41871F68ee6B431fABd19f406a9A6 and can be found here <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x5f834Ba9e4E41871F68ee6B431fABd19f406a9A6">https://bscscan.com/token/0x5f834Ba9e4E41871F68ee6B431fABd19f406a9A6</a></p><p>The Stealth-BSC swap reserve is protected by 2 of 3 multisignature escrow on the Stealth&nbsp;side.</p><p>Multisignatures ensure that at least two escrow signatories must approve a transaction before BSC-wrapped XST can move back to the native chain. This protection means that compromising one swap key is not enough to threaten the swap&nbsp;reserve.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> How-To <p>Here’s a step by step guide how to swap XST to wXST and vice versa using MetaMask:</p><p>1. Set up a MetaMask wallet and&nbsp;account.</p><p>2. Connect Meta Mask to Binance Smart Chain, here’s a guide how to do that:<br>https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain.</p><p>3. Set up a XST wallet (if you haven’t already), you can use StealthSend desktop and mobile<br>https://www.stealth.org/applications.</p><p>4. Go to <a href="https://wrapping.services/get/stealth/">https://wrapping.services/get/stealth/</a><br>The service is provided by Wrapping Services <a href="https://wrapping.services/.">https://wrapping.services/.</a></p><p>5. Swap XST to&nbsp;wXST</p><p>– Choose the amount you want to swap, the required minimum is 5 USD worth of XST.<br>– The swap from XST to wXST is free, there is no fee.<br>– In the field “wXST Address BSC (BEP20)”, use your own wXST&nbsp;address.</p><p>Here’s how you find your wXST&nbsp;address:</p><p>• Go to Metamask<br>• Select “Smart Chain” from the drop down on top.<br>• Select “import token” at the bottom and use the contract address 0x5f834Ba9e4E41871F68ee6B431fABd19f406a9A6 for the token address.<br>• Once you have imported the token wXST, select the three dots in the top right corner and go to “Account details”. You will see your personal wXST&nbsp;address.</p><p>• Use this address in the field “wXST Address BSC (BEP20)”; this is where the wrapped XST will be sent&nbsp;to.</p><p>6. In the next step you are asked to send XST to the address (multisig address) shown in the dialogue:</p><p>You have 60 seconds to do so until it expires, requiring you to restart the&nbsp;process.</p><p>If you have sent XST within the timeframe you will see a new dialogue, similar to this&nbsp;one:</p><p>You can then close the dialogue, the swap was successful.</p><p>7. After you have sent your XST, you will receive your wXST to the address specified in step 5 within a few&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>You can then go to Pancake Swap <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/swap">https://pancakeswap.finance/swap </a>and trade&nbsp;wXST.</p><p>8. Swap wXST back to&nbsp;XST</p><p>The reverse swap from wXST to XST works similarly. The only difference is that you will need some BNB in your wallet to pay the tx&nbsp;fee.</p><p>Go to <a href="https://wrapping.services/get/stealth">https://wrapping.services/get/stealth</a>/ and simply select “wXST to XST” this time and follow the instructions.</p><p>In the field “XST address” simply use an address where you want the XST to be sent to. You will then have to send wXST to the address specified in the next dialogue, similar to step&nbsp;6.</p><p>After you sent your wXST you will receive XST back on the native&nbsp;chain.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> Caution <p>DO NOT send XST to the contract address itself (0x5f834Ba9e4E41871F68ee6B431fABd19f406a9A6). If you do so, the coins cannot be retrieved. Always make sure your are sending to the correct address, your personal wXST&nbsp;address.</p><p>— — — — — — — — —</p><p>The Stealth&nbsp;team</p><p>— — — — — — — — —</p><p><a href="https://stealth.org/">Website</a> / <a href="http://discord.gg/qGwMQQeRPm">Discord</a> / <a href="https://t.me/stealthsend">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend">Medium</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/stealthsend">Twitter</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthsend">Reddit</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend/wxst-xst-wrapped-on-binance-smart-chain-bsc-d5c8a5f08c77">wXST: XST wrapped on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend">stealthsend</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Better overview of your bonded&nbsp;node <p>Bonding is the act of registering a node in the Nym system by putting up some NYM tokens as stake on that node. Node operators bond a mix node or a gateway into the Nym mixnet. Bonding can be done using the CLI tool or via the Bonding section of the&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>If you are new to the Nym system and want to run a node follow the instructions on the <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/mixnodes/#">docs</a> or watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRMZY6Ez1bA">video</a> on how to bond your node. To know more about Nym’s different node types read&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/choose-your-character-an-overview-of-nym-network-actors-19e6a9808540">this</a>.</p><p>Once your node is successfully bonded and is running you can see the information about it in the new bonding screen as below. Here is where most of the new features in this version of the wallet are. We will be adding more node stats and settings to this page as we go&nbsp;along.</p> 2. Compound and Redeem your rewards from the&nbsp;wallet <p>Operators can now redeem and compound their node rewards using the action menu shown with 3 dots on the right edge of the bonding table (as shown&nbsp;below).</p><p>This is what each of the actions in the action menu&nbsp;does:</p><p>Redeem: Redeem the rewards you have accrued by running your node and transfer the amount to your account&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Compound: In order to get compounded rewards for your node, you will need to compound your rewards manually using this&nbsp;button.</p><p>Unbond: Unbond to remove your node from the&nbsp;network</p><p>Note that all of the above actions require some tiny amount of NYMs to pay for transaction fees. Make sure you always have some NYMs left in your balance to be able to pay for&nbsp;fees.</p> 2. Filters on the explorer to select nodes to delegate&nbsp;to <p>If you hold NYM tokens, you can delegate your tokens to mix nodes operating the mixnet. This boosts the node’s reputation and increases their chances of being in the active set. In return you will earn a share of the rewards the node receives for providing privacy.</p><p>To find a mix node to delegate to, you can now filter them on the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes">Nym network explorer</a>, using Advanced Filters on the top right&nbsp;corner.</p><p>Filter the nodes based on different parameters i.e Stake Saturation, Profit Margin, and Routing Score to narrow them down based on your preferred criteria. You can also browse the delegators channel in the <a href="https://discord.gg/7F6g9cWh">Nym Discord</a> to find good nodes for delegating stake&nbsp;to.</p><p>Once you have selected your preferred mix node(s), use the wallet to delegate to them.

<p>There are a lot of problems in this world. So many important issues could be solved to improve the lives of countless individuals. So why is it that we dedicate so much of our time on building Wasabi Wallet?</p><p>First of all, why do we even work on Bitcoin? Well, because money is an incredibly important good for a prosperous society to function. When you hold money, every entrepreneur in your economy will happily solve any problem you might have. Saving your capital in money helps you sleep better at night, knowing that tomorrow you can buy everything you might need.</p><p>But, there is good money and there is bad money. If anyone forces you to use a specific money, then generally speaking it’s a bad one. Free people will choose a money that they deem good. Bitcoin is a common choice because it has a predefined and unchanging money supply, so nobody can print himself money and hand it out to friends. Cryptography protects the ownership of coins, which makes theft pretty difficult.</p><p>Bitcoin has sound economic principles and powerful cryptographic protocols with an unrestricted free market for anyone to start getting paid in bitcoin. Economically and technically speaking, bitcoin is unstoppable and will eventually be used by the overwhelming majority of all merchants.</p><p>However, there are other important aspects of good money, which currently Bitcoin is not optimally designed for. Specifically, the fungibility of money; that any coin has the same demand as any other coin. Merchants don’t care which specific coin they get paid in, as long as it is valid. But in bitcoin, a coin has a unique transaction history which is publicly known and verified by every node. This transaction history makes each coin a unique and non-fungible unit.</p><p>In the worst case, this open transaction history is the basis for a dystopian surveillance system. Where every transaction of the same person is clustered together and tied to his identity. Now, everyone is spying on everyone else and the choice of what to reveal about yourself to the world is taken from everyone.</p><p>It might be inevitable that bitcoin succeeds economically. But a future where people are in control of whom to tell about their sensitive financial transactions is still uncertain.</p><p>But not all hope is lost. There are so many tricks and strategies to increase the financial privacy of bitcoin users. The best thing is, most of them don’t even require any changes to the bitcoin consensus rules but can already be used today. Tor, block filter synchronization, coinjoin, coin swaps, lightning network and eCash; there are endless ways of improving the privacy, security and usability of everyday bitcoiners.</p><p>This is the reasoning for why we work on bitcoin privacy and why we focus on innovating at the edges with Wasabi, the privacy-focused bitcoin wallet.<br></p>

  While it looks like rocket science when you first come across it, the concept of a zero-knowledge proof is not as confusing as it seems. In fact, it can be summarized as digital accountability.

<div class='wrap'>

<p></p><p>Before going over what a zero-knowledge proof is in several different complexity levels, let’s look at why they’re important.<br></p> Digital accountability <p>As our world becomes increasingly fueled by technology, the use cases and the need for tools that allow us to interact with total strangers increase. Accountability is key to this as, when something happens, someone needs to answer for it. There is a high demand for sources of truth and verified information online.<br></p><p>Accountability is somewhat simple to achieve. However, what’s difficult is to do so when dealing with strangers online. Let’s go through a simple example;<br></p><p>When you pay for a pair of sneakers using your credit or debit card, your bank statement will show how much you spent, when, and what merchant you made the transaction with. Anyone who sees the credit card or bank statement (whether it’s your government in your tax declaration, the shop when you’re issuing a return, or a friend) can confirm what you did —you are accountable. <br></p><p>Now, do you want to share the information about your transaction with others (for a decent enough incentive)? &nbsp;Maybe. Do you want everyone to know everything about the product you bought, your transaction number, and all the info in your bank statement? Maybe not. However, if you wanted to prove you made the purchase, the only way you could fully prove its legitimacy would be through a full statement.<br></p><p>Zero-knowledge proofs are all about reliably achieving accountability on your own terms. In this article, we’ll look at the concept of zero-knowledge proofs, how to understand them in a simple language, and their applications.</p> Understanding what is a zero-knowledge proof A simple illustration of a zero-knowledge proof. (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-are-zero-knowledge-proofs-7ef6aab955fc">Source</a>)<p></p><p>Zero-knowledge proofs are protocols in <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cryptography-and-its-types/">cryptography</a> that tell you that something is true without giving you any other information beyond what you want to prove. This concept is better illustrated through a couple of single analogies:<br></p> How to explain zero-knowledge proofs to a kid <p>A zero-knowledge example that’s easy to gasp even to an 8-year-old is the following:<br></p><p>If you have a closed combination lock, you could simply prove to someone that you hold the right password by unlocking it without revealing the password. By doing this, you have certified that you know certain information without disclosing it (a zero-knowledge proof).<br></p> How to explain zero-knowledge proofs to an adult <p>Let’s now jump to a slightly more mature explanation that’s closer to the context zero-knowledge proofs are commonly used. <br></p><p>Returning to our earlier example, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) could be like bank statements that only answer to yes/no questions. This question could be tailored to specific use cases, such as “does your account contain more than $400?” or “are you over 25 AND purchased a pair of XMODEL Nike shoes?”<br></p><p>The ZKP does not detail how, where, or when you bought your sneakers. If you were to be in possession of such proof, you would be able to show it to anyone you chose to, even link it to your crypto wallet for anyone to verify at will or post it online.<br></p> Attributes of a zero-knowledge proof<br> <p>Apart from ensuring no knowledge is transferred between the two parties, zero-knowledge proofs need to fulfill two conditions:<br></p>  Completeness: If a statement is true, an honest verifier (that is, one following the protocol properly) will be convinced of this fact by an honest prover. This means that the system works to verify a true proof every time.<br>  Soundness: If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince an honest verifier that it is true. In our analogy, soundness means you can only prove you bought a product, if and only if, it is true. This characteristic reflects on the system used to mint zero-knowledge proofs, which needs to be decentralized (i.e. no one can influence it) and reliable (it works as expected every time).   The invention of the zero-knowledge proof <p>ZKPs were invented In 1985 by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff. The trio wrote a paper introducing zero-knowledge proofs titled "<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.419.8132&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof-Systems</a>," which helped lay a solid foundation for the growth of zero-knowledge proofs. In their quest for finding efficient methods of communicating proof, GMR (Goldwasser, Micali, &amp; Rackoff) devised the concept of zero-knowledge proofs – which could be used to prove that a theorem ‘T’ is true without conveying any additional information.<br></p><p>People have used several examples to describe ZKPs since they were created, with one of the most popular ones being the following:<br></p><p>There are two friends, Mike (the prover) and Carlos (the verifier). Carlos is color-blind and cannot tell the difference between two otherwise identic balls of different colors, red and green. When Carlos picks up two balls, Mike tells him he is holding two balls of different colors (green in his left hand and red in his right). Carlos does not believe Mike, and now he needs something besides Mike's words to convince him. <br></p><p>Carlos then devices a zero-knowledge way for Mike to prove his statement, as Carlos cannot gain the ability to see color.<br></p>  Carlos first holds two balls in front of Mike, who can see which ball is in which hand. Carlos is holding a green ball in his left hand and a red ball in his right.<br>  Then, behind his back, Carlos shuffles the balls. Now he knows which ball is in which hand, but Mike doesn’t, since he cannot see them.<br>  Carlos goes on to present the balls to Mike again, asking Mike whether he switched the balls or not. Since Mike can tell both balls apart due to their color, he answers the question easily.<br>  Carlos is not convinced because there are only two balls, which gives Mike a 50% chance of guessing whether he switched the balls or not. Also, both balls could be of the same color, so after one verification, Carlos still doubts the outcome is correct.<br>  However, if Carlos repeats the procedure, the probability for Mike to guess if he switched the balls or not eventually becomes low enough for Carlos to believe him. With many consecutive right answers from Mike, Carlos learns that Mike can actually tell the difference between the two balls. He, however, has not gained the ability to tell apart green objects from red ones.<br>  A video explainer following the color-blind friend analogy. Types of zero-knowledge proofs <p>In the cryptography world, there are two main types of zero-knowledge proofs:</p> Interactive zero-knowledge proofs <p>From the Carlos and Mike example, we can see that both of them continued to speak to each other throughout the exercise. The back and forth conversation helped Mike prove the truth of his claims until Carlos was convinced. This is called an interactive ZKP and it is similar to how the first-ever ZKPs operated.<br></p>A diagram illustrating an Interactive zero-knowledge proof (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Interactive-zero-knowledge-proof_fig3_354455915">Source</a>)<p></p><p>An <a href="https://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/graph/svg.html">interactive zero-knowledge proof</a> involves steady communication between prover and verifier until the former can provide convincing replies to the latter's challenges.</p> Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs <p>Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs do not necessarily need established communication between the prover and verifier beyond a single iteration. When the prover presents proof of knowledge, for instance, the verifier confirms its genuineness within one exchange. This is closer to showing a verifier a bank statement, for instance.<br></p><p>Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof">non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs</a> require only one information exchange, they demand more computing power to produce than interactive zero-knowledge proofs.<br></p><p>However, due to their convenience, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs have gained popularity. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies/">zkSNARKs</a>, for example, are an example of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs.</p> Possible and existing applications of a zero-knowledge proof  Decentralized identity <p>Identity verification exercises are commonplace in today's world, and most institutions in several sectors require you to present documents to verify your identity for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">KYC and AML</a> purposes. Currently, ID verification exercises are slow, sometimes requiring days to process. There are also concerns about having to submit personal documents repeatedly on different occasions and data safety. <br></p>Decentralized identifiers enable digitally-signed verifiable claims. (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Decentralized-identifiers-dids-the-fundamental-building-block-of-selfsovereign-identity-ssi-37-1024_DIDs-enable-digitally-signed-verifiable-claims.jpg">Source</a>)<p></p><p>Through decentralized identifiers built on zero-knowledge proofs and the blockchain, you can store identification documents and materials and decide how much you are willing to share with third parties. Zero-knowledge identity proofs allows you to pass KYC verification just once and then be able to indefinitely, confirm that you meet requirements without revealing your personal information. With <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/03/05/decentralized-identity-using-blockchain/">decentralized identity</a> you also retain control over your data.</p> Blockchain scaling <p>Scalability is a huge challenge for blockchain technology, especially as more people begin using the network. Network congestion often results in increased transaction fees, difficulting the mass adoption of Web3 protocols. Zero-knowledge proofs can help solve the scalability problem on blockchain networks such as the Ethereum mainnet through <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">rollups</a>.<br></p>A diagram illustrating ZK-rollups batching transactions and settling them on the base layer.

By completing computations and state-storage off-chain, ZK-rollups help Layer-1 blockchains process more transactions at reduced fees. Yet, there's more. <br></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">ZK-rollups</a> usually batch-process several thousands of transactions. As most permissionless blockchains require proof of transactions for every on-chain action, ZK-rollups only post minimal summary data on-chain. In this summary data, the ZK-rollup defines the changes that should be made to the blockchain and provides zero-knowledge proof that the changes are correct. Most zero-knowledge rollups use Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge and Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge protocols (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/">SNARKs and STARKs, respectively</a>).</p> Privacy protocols <p>Zero-knowledge proofs power several <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">privacy</a> protocols today, mostly due to their non-disclosure feature. With ZK-proofs, users can currently transact on privacy-enabled blockchains and post proofs that confirm that their transactions are valid, but nothing more.<br></p><p>Popular privacy coin, Zcash, uses <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">zk-SNARK</a> cryptography to restore blockchain anonymity for its users and give them control over their transaction information. For instance, when a <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a> user sends coins to another Zcash user, the only available proof of their privacy-enabled transaction comes with zero knowledge. A third-party observer cannot find any additional information about the nature of the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">transaction</a>, nor the parties and amounts involved. <br></p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io">Panther</a>, on the other hand, aims to create a ZK-SNARK-powered ecosystem in which users can retain full control over their data while being able to use DeFi with default privacy.</p> Conclusion: What’s in zero-knowledge proofs’ future? <p>Several technological innovations have shaped the current landscape of the world's economy. Blockchain technology, the internet, and public key cryptography have all made waves globally, defining change across fields and, most importantly, helping create a global digital permissionless payments system.<br></p><p>Zero-knowledge proofs as a solution are just starting to emerge and we can see them eventually generalized for the benefit of all. In the past couple of years, the interest in ZK-technology has been popping up from various sectors along with a rise in funding for their research and development. The massive upsides and possibilities of use-cases of ZK-technology have everyone excited.<br>Zero-knowledge proofs can count among cryptographic innovations making giant strides in the industry. Powering privacy on the blockchain, ZK-proofs also aid <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/layer-2">Layer-2</a> blockchain scaling solutions and decentralized identifiers.

   Known as the "AWS of Web3", Alchemy's platform powers most of the top web3 applications around the world. The idea came to founders Nikil Viswanathan and Joe Lau following their own frustration when building a crypto analytics tool. Seeing that developers around the world needed a toolkit to enable the next wave of innovation, they set out to build Alchemy. Launched in 2020, the company's platform

<p>Today it was announced the United States Treasury imposed sanctions on virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash, adding it to the OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) SDN list, the list of Specially Designated Nationals with whom Americans and American businesses are not allowed to transact.</p>



<p>We agree with our partners at Coin Center and Blockchain Association that there are concerns about how today’s announcement impacts the civil liberties of United States citizens. We are following developments closely and look forward to continuing our ongoing and productive conversations with regulators and policymakers on behalf of Zcash.</p>



<p>Our mission at Electric Coin Co. (ECC) is to empower economic freedom, and to that end, we contribute to and support a fair, open currency to protect the freedom, dignity, consent, and security of people all over the world.</p>



<p>Sensible policy guidance and education are at the core of our work with socio-political stakeholders, and ECC advocates that privacy is essential for personal, business, and national security. Our partner network in these endeavors includes think tanks, academic research centers, and nonprofits that provide thought leadership and advocacy for issues that affect Zcash users.</p>



<p>Zcash is compliant and fully compatible with global AML/CFT standards, including all final FATF recommendations, the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, and the United States’ Anti-Money Laundering regulations. It is approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), a key requirement for listing on major exchanges, like Gemini and Coinbase.</p>



<p>In 2020, ECC commissioned the RAND Corporation to <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR4418.html">conduct research</a> into Zcash usage for illicit purposes. The research revealed no evidence of any substantive use of Zcash for money laundering, terrorism financing or trade in illicit goods and services. The report also found, “the governance of Zcash and its branding as compliant with the relevant AML/CFT regulations may make it less susceptible to exploitation for illicit or criminal purposes.”</p>

 Major trends among communities and some lessons on how to build during a bear&nbsp;market. <p>If you weren’t able to make it to #EthCC5, we’ve got you covered. The following were some of Findora’s biggest takeaways: new trends, buzzwords, and lessons for how to grow during a bear&nbsp;market.</p><p>No one likes a downturn — but the attendees of EthCC didn’t let it get in the way of a good time. Bear markets are the best time for projects to prove themselves, and Findora isn’t letting this opportunity slip&nbsp;away.</p><p>Even though <a href="https://ethcc.io/">EthCC</a> is a community conference, they held a hackathon and had several solid entries. The ZK-Moles Scavenger hunt was a fun idea that led to some key collaboration and insights discussed below. Findora managed to connect with several future partners, including Ledger, and FRA has enjoyed a surge in price since the convention.</p><p>This is great progress, especially during a bear market. It shows you don’t need to just button down the hatches if the market tanks, you can still grow and build, if you know how and have true value to offer. People, and investors, are taking notice of projects that are pushing through the adverse market conditions.</p><p>It’s the kind of attention any project would want when liquidity starts to evaporate. Though Findora won’t speculate on future market trends, we do think understanding the present is key to success. So, here are some big takeaways Findora community members got from EthCC5 that we think will benefit any project that is building through a bear&nbsp;market.</p> Build Communities through Fun, not&nbsp;Profit <p>There’s an inverse relationship in Web3 between how fun a project is and how much profit it&nbsp;makes.</p>The Fun-Money Matrix<p>It’s just a general trend: during DeFi summer, people worked hard to maximize their yields. Yes, it was a lot of stress, but it was profitable until the winter&nbsp;came.</p><p>In a bear market, when you can’t chase yields, the better investment comes from chasing fun instead of only-up&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>Take this example from Aleo. They had a great presentation at EthCC where they used Zk technology and true randomness to create a <a href="https://github.com/Entropy1729/aleo_roulette">roulette game</a> demonstrating how the technology can be applied. Online games can use ZK to keep people from feeling that the house will always win — it lets games be won by rational&nbsp;actors.</p><p>Will Aleo make money off of this? No, but they’ll build a community because it was a fun idea and they made the code open-source.</p><p>Similarly, Findora’s scavenger hunt during EthCC got a small but dedicated following. We had someone who lived in Paris who couldn’t believe we had hidden NFTs in a place he couldn’t find. This game attracted other communities who thought of new spin-offs.</p><p>For instance, Findora community members brainstorming with <a href="https://wittycreatures.com/#/init-game">Witty Creatures</a> holders, came up with the idea of combing social NFTs with ZK-geocaching. We could create Ethereum maps that lead to Zk-treasure that people have to hunt. Players could wear physical social NFTs so that as they gathered around the same spot, they can strike up a connection and meet new&nbsp;people.</p><p>There are plenty of games with great game mechanics that don’t take much in the way of developer resources to make. True GameFi is probably years away since that’s how long it takes to develop a big, billion-dollar game. But by creating simple but fun games that rely on solid game-mechanics not graphics, it’s possible to jump-start the push toward GameFi, demonstrate your project’s concept, and build community.</p> Privacy and ZK Were Major&nbsp;Themes <p>Since Consensus 2022, there seems to be more and more focus on zero-knowledge projects.</p><p>For instance, the Merge isn’t the only scaling solution Ethereum may have. Both Matter Labs and Polygon announced the release of ZK-Rollups. And there was a lot of excitement surrounding the Starknet hackathon from day 1 of the convention. Findora was able to meet and network with several developers as a&nbsp;result.</p><p>Some <a href="https://ys.finance/">Yellow Submarine</a> community members, a cross-chain ZK project built on Findora, received very positive feedback when they pitched to Ethereum developers. They understood how important it could be for EVM chains to have private crosschain transfer built into existing&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The ZK niche continues to carve out a bigger space at each crypto convention.</p> Give More than&nbsp;MOUs <p>MOUs are out — and Web3 projects need more before they will devote resources to exploring a partnership.</p><p>The loss of liquidity is making projects more choosy about who they work with. It isn’t enough anymore to pledge you’ll work together — people want to know upfront what you can cant can’t do. Having this readily available will be important as projects search for partners and compete for what funding is&nbsp;left.</p> The Merge is&nbsp;coming <p>Being and Ethereum conference, there was a lot of talk about the Merge. Many projects and talks were about that and the effect it might have on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Ethereum developers recently shipped the Merge on the <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/ethereum-inches-closer-the-merge-with-sepolia-testnet-launch/">Sepolia testnet</a>, and it was recently announced that it would be deployed on the <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/160112/ethereum-developers-announce-date-for-goerli-testnet-merger?utm_source=findora&amp;utm_medium=online">Goerli testnet</a> next, starting between August 6th-12th. It looks like after many years and multiple rebrands, Ethereum’s move to proof of stake is finally upon&nbsp;us.</p> The Latest Buzzword is&nbsp;Here <p>The new buzzword in crypto, which was thrown around a lot at EthCC, is the “public&nbsp;good.”</p><p>The idea of a public good is something like a highway or trans-ocean internet fibers or other infrastructure. Everyone benefits equally from its creation, but there isn’t enough profit incentive to create it, so a group, like a government, sets it up&nbsp;instead.</p><p>The new idea is to sponsor public good projects through&nbsp;DAOs.</p><p>The idea is certainly high-minded but also feels to some like another glittery marketing mantra. The skeptics would argue that all things, in crypto or not, are done for profit. Projects like Bitcoin or Ethereum that are meant to be equally beneficial have clear winners and losers. Whether using PoW or PoS, some will have more rewards than others, centralization is always a possibility, and all endeavors must make a return to be worth&nbsp;it.</p><p>The “Public Good” is another high-minded principle, but how well can people really live up to it? That remains to be seen. Perhaps principles are supposed to be out of reach to keep us growing. Whatever one’s opinion of the legitimacy of such a concept, it’s clear the newest buzzword to make crypto broadly appealing is the “public&nbsp;good.”</p> Saying Au Revoir to&nbsp;EthCC <p>Findora made many great connections and added some amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/EasyNode/status/1553870368707944448?s=20&amp;t=403Olyy0FrHG4_PAjyJRpw">new validators</a> to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>It became clear to many that Findora is in this for the long haul and has a strong network that is getting stronger. This is partly why the price of FRA has more than tripled in the weeks following the conference and how we can attract new partners.</p><p>Maybe that’s another great takeaway from EthCC and bear markets: when the markets get tough, the tough get building. And if you can show others you have true value to offer, that you are here for the long haul, and you aren’t flummoxed by price fluctuations — they’ll be excited to build with you&nbsp;too.</p><p>EthCC was a great conference, and we’re looking forward to the progress everyone will make by the time we all meet again next&nbsp;year.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findoras-five-takeaways-from-ethcc5-fd75f581681c">Findora’s Five Takeaways from EthCC5</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Many consider privacy coins to be direct Bitcoin competitors. Is there truth to this statement, or does it miss the point?

<p>There are no clear Bitcoin competitors when it comes to value-oriented blockchains.</p><p>Bitcoin has over <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/blockchain-stats">180 million users</a>, and the network averages hundreds of thousands of daily transactions, facilitating cross-border payments. However, as more people regard Bitcoin as a full-fledged digital asset akin to gold or real estate, the question of who can compete with the orange giant on other terms comes to mind.</p><p>One particular reason behind Bitcoin's global adoption is the pseudonymity that its users enjoy. Beyond being a value store and viewed as a viable long-term investment, Bitcoin allowed people to move money without needing banks and traditional financial infrastructure. Although people could transact under pseudonymous identities—the creator(s) of Bitcoin went by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto—this increasingly represents a challenge.<br>In this write-up, we will explore the concepts of transparency furthered by Bitcoin and most blockchains, and their numerous drawbacks. Additionally, we will analyze the nature of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">privacy-centric</a> blockchain solutions, whether they’re truly Bitcoin competitors, their potential users, and (briefly) how <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> plays a part in this discussion.</p> Why is Bitcoin transparent? <p>Bitcoin aimed to achieve a complete decentralized financial system, one without a centralized body of trust in the middle. Without go-betweens like banks that hold control over users' funds, Bitcoin proposed a replacing system that could drive trust on the network, making every single payment network in the world a Bitcoin competitor.<br></p><p>To do this, Bitcoin puts an emphasis on full transparency and verifiability. Satoshi Nakamoto, shared his vision of the project on October 31, 2008, releasing the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper</a>. This whitepaper outlined a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. <br></p><p>Bitcoin is an open and permissionless blockchain, which makes all the information on the blockchain accessible to anyone. With complete transparency, Bitcoin ensured that network participants (miners, nodes, users) couldn’t collude to manipulate the state of the network. This total transparency also meant that anyone could verify the holdings of each address and the size of all transactions at any given time.</p> What are the benefits of transparency in blockchain? <p>Although the network supports pseudonymity, Bitcoin's transparency has arguably bolstered trust in decentralized blockchain networks, leading to the massive adoption of cryptocurrencies globally. A financial system where anyone can access every record stored on the blockchain is attractive to the everyday person, especially as trust in traditional finance models continues to erode.<br></p><p>The <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">transparency</a> of the Bitcoin network has also helped discourage certain criminal elements from using the blockchain. While regulators were slow to get the cryptocurrency drift, they eventually caught up and have begun to enforce regulations guiding cryptocurrency trading. Due to public blockchains’ transparency, it is easy for law enforcement agencies to track movements of illicit money and maybe tie the wallet addresses to identities. <br></p><p>Transparency, along with permissionlessness has created many blockchain enthusiasts across several sectors. Many have advocated blockchain use in online voting, an exercise that demands utmost transparency. Supply chain operations have also adopted blockchain technology to achieve transparent farm-to-shelf or manufacturing-to-consumer product lifecycle tracking. Digital ownership, decentralized identity, file storage, and other concepts have since adopted the blockchain due to its transparency.</p> The emergence of privacy-centric “Bitcoin competitors” <p>Although Bitcoin's transparency can be considered a strength, concerns over user privacy have led to the creation of several privacy-conserving solutions that aim to provide total anonymity to their users. Coin tumblers or mixers were the earliest of these methods but, as adoption grew, network congestion led to higher transaction fees, which made them too expensive to manage.<br></p>Privacy blockchains compared with public blockchains (<a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/2019-privacy-token-review-c28b6ceef637">Source</a>)<p>Then came privacy coins. These private cryptocurrencies used different cryptographic tools to shield transaction information and user identity. A famous example and one of the most successful private coins is Monero ($XMR). Monero adopted <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies/">ring signatures</a>, stealth addresses, and ring confidential transactions (RingCT) to provide complete anonymity to its users. Monero's success is well-known and has given rise to a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-irs-offers-a-625-000-bounty-to-anyone-who-can-break-monero-and-lightning">bounty</a> by the United States government to anyone who can crack the network’s cryptography.</p><p>Zcash came into the fray almost simultaneously, using zero-knowledge proofs and shielded transactions to provide anonymity. Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">zk-SNARKs</a>) allowed users to present transaction receipts without revealing any information about the nature of the transaction and its participants. However, Zcash was not private by default like Monero, allowing users to transact without privacy at their behest.</p><p>Other privacy coins like Grin, Horizen, ARRR (Pirate Chain), and Verge have also successfully maintained blockchain privacy. However, regulators continue to subject them to scrutiny. Notably, projects like Monero and Pirate chain act in an open-source fashion with pseudonymous teams.</p> What are the downsides of transparency in blockchains? <p>As explained earlier, users have continued to raise concerns about Bitcoin's radical transparency. The primary grouse is the lack of user privacy which, albeit is already a problem for the network, can continue to increase exponentially as the network grows.</p> The threat of hackers <p>One primary problem of the lack of privacy is the exposure of individuals' financial information to bad actors. Hackers and fraudsters can easily monitor their targets' on-chain transactions and construct fraudulent schemes around the available information. </p><p>A criminal can easily access thousands of public addresses, which they can screen for potential victims. While you can view transaction records on a private blockchain solution, you cannot find any additional information on any transaction or the amounts and addresses involved. Some privacy coins like <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> do not disclose wallet balances through public addresses.</p> Government suppression <p>Another challenge that blockchain transparency has led to is the common habit of government suppression through tracking and freezing crypto assets. For example, in February 2022, Canadian truckers began to protest the government's decision to make COVID-19 vaccinations compulsory for them. They even started a fundraiser towards pursuing legal action. After unsuccessful attempts to quash their peaceful protests and intentions to challenge the decision in court, the Canadian government began a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60383385">crackdown</a> on the fundraising efforts and all that contributed to it.</p>Many consider this speech by Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland on the Canadian truckers issue a demonstration of why financial privacy and autonomy are highly necessary. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti7LryfAiF4">Source</a>).<p>In this case, not only did the government freeze regular bank accounts, but they also went after centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like <a href="https://decrypt.co/93243/kraken-cannot-protect-you-from-canadian-government-freezing-crypto-ceo">Kraken</a>, forcing them to comply with the directives to freeze crypto assets. Privacy, of course, is impossible on centralized exchanges, as they must comply with strict KYC/AML regulations. </p><p>The government also extended a similar request to <a href="https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-wallet-nunchuk-scolds-ontario-court-over-order-to-freeze-crypto-assets">Nunchuk's</a> self-custodial wallet provider. However, their attempt was unsuccessful as self-custodial wallets encourage privacy and do not store information on users' assets or identities.</p><p>Governments tracking the finances of their citizens or political enemies is not unheard of, and cryptocurrency transparency only makes this more accessible. When a public address is linked to your identity, the government can easily find out whatever they need to know about your financial dealings whenever they want.</p> Your privacy is important <p>Apart from the threat of hackers and government suppression, keeping your finances private is an individual right and just makes sense to most users. After all, it’s fairly rare for people to openly discuss their financial detail, let alone with strangers. </p><p>Sadly, blockchain transparency, while it serves to drive trust and accountability on the network, also exposes everything about a user's holdings, the value of their assets, and all deposits and withdrawals. Traditional bank accounts are, in fact, more private than public blockchains, as they are only privy to their owners and law enforcement agencies (on special occasions), giving the account owner some measure of privacy.</p><p>A major downside regarding privacy is the possibility of users’ identities being tied to their wallets. Once a user’s identity is tied to their wallet, it’s possible for them to be exposed to consequences (even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-nft-owners-targeted-kidnaps-home-invasions-robberies-2022-2?IR=T">life-threatening</a> ones) since the value of the assets is open for anyone to see.</p><p>While individuals should prioritize their privacy, financial institutions dealing in crypto<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/"> can hardly stay ahead of the competition if </a>all the details of their trades or deals are out in the open. Transparency in blockchain robs them of any competitive advantage they may have.</p><p>Therefore, the quest for "bitcoin competitors" starts when people are yearning for privacy and freedom.</p> Who should consider privacy-maintaining blockchains <p>Private cryptocurrency solutions are becoming increasingly popular, and different categories of individuals have embraced them recently. Privacy and data security activists are one group that readily embraces the use of private cryptocurrencies. This is also helpful as it drives across a statement supporting private blockchain solutions focused on restoring users' control over their digital information.</p><p>Whistleblowers and political activists should also adopt privacy blockchain solutions, seeing that governments will never cease to scrutinize their affairs. Political activism, after all, requires financial support, especially under oppressive governments. Privacy blockchain solutions provide a clear path for ordinary people to support political activists without endangering their finances.</p><p>The case of the Canadian truckers taught a bitter lesson to communities and associations that are politically suppressed. Traditional finance, and even Bitcoin, are too open and can be turned into weapons. While Bitcoin encourages pseudonymity, most points in which it can be exchanged for official currencies require users to provide verifiable identity documents to use their services. </p><p>So-called fiat on-ramps need to comply with existing regulations such as KYC/AML that force them to freeze assets belonging to offenders. Privacy solutions, on the other hand, can help politically oppressed communities raise funds and escape any form of financial backlash due to the anonymity these protocols provide.</p><p>Financial institutions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a> can also retain their competitive advantage and transact without being subject to scrutiny from competitors and regular individuals using privacy solutions. </p><p>Luckily for all the above, there are several different ways to achieve privacy and still benefit from the permissionlessness of blockchain technology.</p> Bitcoin Competitors: Methods to achieve on-chain privacy <p>Since we established the downsides of blockchain transparency and the need for privacy, let’s have a look at Bitcoin competitors that don’t compromise user privacy. </p><p>There are majorly four different mechanisms that achieve on-chain privacy. However, it’s worth noting here that although these mechanisms offer on-chain privacy that Bitcoin lacks, they come with their own set of limitations.</p><p>For example, privacy coins often have trouble with on-off ramps, miss out on some centralized exchange listings, access to the DeFi ecosystem, and so on. Similarly, other bitcoin competitors like coin mixers support only one asset type at a time and only in a determinate amount (e.g. only in batches of 1 BTC at a time per mixer), thus severely limiting their privacy prospect.</p> Method #1: Create private ways to transact (private chains) <p>The most popular method through which on-chain privacy can be achieved is by creating private chains, hosting privacy coins. Unlike public blockchain networks such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, privacy coins can offer greater transaction obscurity.</p><p>Privacy coins preserve users’ privacy by concealing sensitive information involved in transactions from the public eye. They thereby enable users to make transactions without revealing wallet addresses, transaction amounts, senders’ and receivers’ wallet addresses, etc. Some popular examples of privacy coins are Zcash and Monero.</p> Method #2: Private blockchain networks with private ecosystems <p>Private blockchain transaction networks do offer on-chain privacy but miss out in terms of offering DeFi innovation, smart contracts, or an ecosystem. Public blockchain networks, on the other hand, are massively ahead in terms of offering a range of decentralized financial services such as lending, borrowing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin">stablecoins</a>, etc. because of smart contracts. </p>An overview of privacy solutions in crypto (<a href="https://thecontrol.co/an-overview-of-privacy-in-cryptocurrencies-893dc078d0d7">Source</a>)<p>This limits the use of privacy coins to simple transactions, making them less attractive in comparison. Solutions such as <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a>, <a href="https://www.oasislabs.com/">Oasis Labs</a>, <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~buenz/papers/zether.pdf">Zether</a>, and others attempt to solve this by creating ecosystems that enable default privacy.</p><p>Offering private DeFi services is a massive leap forward in innovation when it comes to leveraging blockchain technology. DeFi services are a serious contender to Bitcoin since Bitcoin misses out on smart contract capabilities, thus lacking a DeFi ecosystem. However, Bitcoin’s inability to plug into DeFi does cause the current DeFi ecosystem to lose access to a major source of liquidity. Although this is partially solved through wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), it’s still far from reaping the full benefits of Bitcoin. </p><p>Something can be said, however, about the way private smart contract blockchains create siloed ecosystems. The most popular blockchains, albeit public, have created thriving environments which these solutions try to take users away from, creating a zero-sum game in the opinion of some.</p> Method #3: Utilizing mixers <p>Yet another way of achieving on-chain privacy on public blockchain networks such as Bitcoin is to use <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/06/20/crypto-mixers-what-are-they-how-are-they-used">coin mixers</a>. Coin mixers or tumblers allow you to make untraceable transactions while keeping your dealings away from the public eye, preserving your identity and obscuring sensitive information on the transactions you have made.</p><p>However, just like the past bitcoin competitors, they also have their disadvantages. Coin mixers have their own set of limitations and pose some unique challenges. For example, most crypto mixing services also operate in legal obscurity and might get you in trouble if your jurisdiction introduces a law against them and applies it retrospectively. Additionally, some of the models used by coin mixers can be <a href="https://protos.com/bitcoin-mixing-coinjoin-wasabi-chainalysis-samourai-privacy-wallet/">bypassed</a> with the help of blockchain forensics and analytics firms.</p> Method #4: Find a way to infuse existing systems with privacy <p>The most innovative and user-friendly way to achieve privacy without reinventing the wheel could be to infuse existing systems with privacy. This is where Panther comes into the picture, providing an on-chain privacy solution that fits right along with existing <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-defi">DeFi</a> applications.</p> Panther Protocol: Interoperable privacy for DeFi <p>Panther Protocol seeks to restore privacy and trust <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/cross-chain-defi-possible-or-forever-limited/">across different blockchain networks</a>. The solution creates a level playing field for individuals and institutions alike, helping them foray into decentralized finance while eliminating privacy concerns.</p><p>Panther utilizes zero-knowledge proofs with zkSNARK technology, which allows users to present genuine transaction proofs while keeping sensitive details confidential. Panther also adopts a multi-asset shielding feature that breaks the on-chain trail as users deposit their assets into a pool and mint 1:1 collateralized <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-multi-asset-shielded-pools-enabling-heterogeneous-mixing-of-assets-ec165854bf0f/">zAssets</a>, which allows them to transact privately.</p><p>Unlike most privacy solutions, Panther Protocol is not limited to a particular blockchain network. Panther uniquely offers <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/interoperable-privacy-building-privacy-bridges-to-all-of-defi-2eaa89c9c7ac/">cross-chain solutions</a> with a privacy toggle, allowing users to deposit their favorite cryptocurrencies, mint the corresponding zAssets, and transact across different blockchains.</p><p>Regarding compliance, Panther Protocol balances the equation with zero-knowledge reports that allow users to share data with trusted third-party providers, thus preserving their privacy and remaining compliant with existing regulations. </p> Conclusion: Privacy might not be enough for a project to call itself a Bitcoin competitor <p>It’s impossible to draw a clear winner when it comes to whether privacy coins are truly Bitcoin competitors. On one hand, Bitcoin is the foundation of the crypto economy and the most valuable asset, keeping its crown as a market leader. Competing cryptocurrencies, private or not, on the other hand, aim to offer additional features and some advantages over Bitcoin, but are unlikely to ever take its current place.</p><p>In essence, there are no confirmed winners and losers since the crypto economy is still in a nascent stage. The market will dictate which cryptocurrency is the most useful, and it currently hasn’t decanted for privacy, although privacy proponents argue that their features are more than needed by Bitcoin. However, we may not discard the fact that Bitcoin believers might not consider these features necessary in the first place.</p><p>It seems like we will have to wait and see whether the market starts putting a higher emphasis on Layer-1 transaction privacy to make a final decision.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.<br><br>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>As we conduct research into Proof-of-Stake (POS) and develop a recommendation for Zcash, an outstanding key area is how the issuance schedule for new ZEC would interact with PoS security. In this post, we take a step back from PoS itself, and analyze how issuance and fees support long-term network sustainability. We introduce a proposal, which we call the Zcash Posterity Fund (ZPF), for modifying ZEC issuance in order to improve long-term financial sustainability of the network, while maintaining the 21M ZEC supply cap and approximate issuance rate. This proposal is independent from PoS or any consensus protocol recommendations and could be adopted with the current PoW consensus protocol with the same benefits and drawbacks. We will be gathering feedback from across the Zcash ecosystem about this proposal.</p>



 Why now? 



<p>We believe this proposal could be a beneficial precursor to three promising lines of development for ZEC:</p>



  Improvements to transaction fee mechanisms can use the Zcash Posterity Fund to improve resilience and predictability of the network.  A transition to PoS can rely on this proposal to ensure key properties of the supply and issuance schedule are preserved.  New functionality such as Zcash Shielded Assets can use this proposal for new fee mechanisms that have good incentive alignment for ZEC sustainability.  



<p>Because all three of these nascent improvements are underway, we want to float this proposal now to see if it can benefit all three efforts.</p>



<p>Additionally, this proposal introduces a way to direct funds towards sustaining the network into the future, so adopting the proposal earlier enables that funding mechanism to begin accruing value earlier.</p>



 Funding the network 



<p>The core innovation of Bitcoin which all cryptocurrency inherits is that the network funds itself. In Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many public crypto networks, the built-in funding is paid out to block producers. In Zcash, this funding is split between block producers and the <a href="https://z.cash/zcash-development-and-governance/">Zcash Development Fund</a>, which contributes to education, technology development, and other activities that support and enhance ZEC.</p>



<p>Generally, funding to support a network can either come from within the protocol itself, for example in mining rewards, or from other sources, such as when an organization has raised capital elsewhere and funds development work on the protocol or products.</p>



<p>External funding is important and can have a large impact. However, there’s no guarantee when or where these sources will appear, that these funding sources have incentive alignment with ZEC holders, or that they will remain as dependable sources of funding over a longer period. For all of these reasons, we believe it’s important for ZEC users to focus on maintaining or improving the intrinsic sustainable funding mechanisms in the protocol itself.</p>



<p>This post and the Posterity Fund proposal focus on the sources and amounts of network funding and are agnostic as to the recipients, so they are applicable to the current mining &amp; Dev Fund structure of ZIP-1014, or future changes to infrastructure &amp; development funding, consensus mechanisms, or other changes to funding recipients.</p>



 The Zcash Posterity Fund 



<p>We propose a change to the Zcash issuance system we call the Zcash Posterity Fund to help reduce uncertainty about the long term sustainability of Zcash while maintaining the key properties we believe most ZEC users prioritize. The proposal maintains these properties (along with their benefits and drawbacks):</p>



  The 21M ZEC supply cap,  A disbursement rate that continuously halves every four years,  A non-discretionary issuance rate.  



<p>Meanwhile, this proposal would change these high level features from the current Zcash design:</p>



  The halving epochs would be replaced by a smoothly declining disbursement curve,  Fees which deposit into this mechanism would be distributed over time in block rewards.  



 Zcash Posterity Fund definition 



<p>The specific high level definition of the Zcash Posterity Fund proposal is as follows:</p>



<p>If the proposal is activated, a new Fund would be entirely managed by the protocol. (There are no private keys, wallets, individuals, or organizations controlling this protocol-managed Fund.)</p>



<p>The initial balance of the Fund when created is equal to the number of not-yet-issued coins, or equivalently 21M ZEC minus the current outstanding supply.</p>



<p>Starting from the block of activation, the current block reward rules no longer apply, and instead block rewards come from ZPF Disbursements.</p>



<p>The proposal does not define the recipients of disbursements, which should remain unchanged if this proposal is accepted. Meanwhile, the proposal does restrict the amount of disbursement:</p>



  Disbursements may be no more than a fixed percentage, X%, of the Fund’s current balance in a given block.  The parameter X% is calculated from the block target time so that without any incoming Fund deposits, the balance of the Fund reduces to half over a four year period.  If future changes to consensus rules alter the block target time, or other aspects of transaction finalization timing, those changes must update this X% parameter to fit the “four year half life” rule to the best practical approximation for that new protocol.  Future consensus changes should not alter the balance of the Fund other than by instituting new deposits from the extant supply.  Future consensus changes should not increase the disbursement rate X% beyond the “four year half life” rule.  



<p>The final piece of the ZPF proposal is that it now becomes possible to transfer Funds from the circulating supply back into the Fund via Deposits. Future protocol-enforced fee mechanisms may require fees to do this. This base proposal is not specific to any particular deposit mechanisms.</p>



 Visualizing changes to issuance &amp; supply schedules 



<p>If this change were adopted and there were no deposits, the disbursements would alter issuance away from halvings into a smooth curve. We can visually compare current issuance to disbursements without deposits for a hypothetical activation height:</p>


 
Current issuance vs Zcash Posterity Fund disbursements.<br>This uses a hypothetical activation height after the second halving. 


<p>If there are significant deposits into the Fund, the slope of the disbursement curve would be increased above the line shown. In any period without deposits, the curve would continue to have the same rate of exponential decay with a negative slope.</p>



<p>The impact on the overall supply schedule in the absence of deposits is barely visible at a long time scale:</p>


 
Current supply schedule vs Zcash Posterity Fund disbursements (w/out deposits).<br>This chart uses the same hypothetical activation height as the previous chart. 


<p>In the presence of deposits, the supply will always be equal or less than the line above. With sufficient deposits the supply growth rate can even become negative during that period.</p>



 The Posterity Fund and sustainability 



<p>The essential element of the Posterity Fund is to enable deposits from the circulating supply, which allows a feedback loop from current usage to future funding:</p>


 
<br>Comparing Tokenomics between status quo vs the Zcash Posterity Fund proposal 


<p>Both the status quo and this proposal have a capped supply of 21M. We can think of the proposal as introducing a single new element, deposits, which enable a feedback loop between the circulating supply and future funding.</p>



<p>This does not “solve” long term sustainability by itself, but it provides a framework that focuses the problem of sustainability on finding sufficient sources of deposits to maintain the network. If over longer time scales of years, the rate of deposits is equal to or larger than payouts, the system can run indefinitely. Meanwhile, if over shorter time spans of months or less, the deposits are below the payout rate, the protocol can weather that period for quite some time.</p>



 Sustainability of the status quo 



<p>So far the Zcash network funds itself using the Bitcoin design. New coins are issued on a schedule that approaches a limit of 21M units over time:</p>


 
<br>BTC &amp; ZEC supplies over time 


<p>The issuance over time follows the Bitcoin halving schedule design:</p>


 
<br>ZEC issuance 


 Challenges with the status quo 



<p>As newly issued coins are circulated to users, the amount of future issuance is depleted to maintain the 21M ZEC cap. As this amount dwindles, network funding must come from other sources and the only other current source is transaction fees paid directly to miners.</p>



<p>Transaction fees are dependent on transaction demand, which is highly unpredictable. We believe transaction demand can often become dominated by external events leading to spikes or troughs of usage. This may be ameliorated when there is a large diffuse network of users, but even at the scale of global economies there are extrinsic events that cause payment demand to fluctuate in a highly correlated, yet unpredictable, fashion. Anchoring the operation of the network to the unpredictability of transaction demand makes it difficult to predict how resilient the network can be, which interferes with long term committed planning. This is important for users and especially for the network infrastructure operators themselves, who need to decide how to invest capital into infrastructure improvements.</p>



<p>An additional wrinkle for Proof-of-Work and potentially other non-finalizing protocols, sometimes called “fee sniping”, is that with direct fees as the only revenue source, there’s a miner incentive to rollback blocks with large fee transactions to put those fees into their own block. This could derail safe progress of the chain.2 </p>



<p>The Zcash Posterity Fund proposal addresses this uncertainty by smoothing out disbursements over time. While it does not guarantee that deposits will be enough to maintain or grow the Fund balance to sustain the network indefinitely, it removes short term uncertainty about the rate of disbursements. This allows users, infrastructure operators, and development fund recipients to commit to longer term plans which makes the network itself more resilient.</p>



<p>These kinds of concerns, and this kind of proposal, are also present in Bitcoin and have been discussed throughout its history. The Bitcoin OpTech newsletter summarizes <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2022/07/20/">a recent discussion</a> about these issues among Bitcoin developers.</p>



 Sustainability of deposits 



<p>The Zcash Posterity Fund design reduces network sustainability to a question of sufficient deposits. If deposits over some time period are greater than disbursements, the network is “paying it forward” and supporting future operation and development. If those deposits are smaller than the disbursements, the network is depleting its resources to continue its current operation and development. So with this framework, the key focus for network sustainability is finding a design and usage that contributes sufficient deposits over time on average.</p>



<p>Deposits can come from various fees for using the network. A straightforward example would be to require a portion of current transaction fees to be deposited into the Fund with the remainder going to the miner.</p>



<p>If this proposal were adopted, the community could observe the trend of whether or not deposits over a long enough time window outpace disbursements. If they are below disbursements and there is concern about the Fund balance dwindling too low3, the community would have some amount of time to find sources of larger deposits.</p>



<p>Finding more deposits might come from a variety of strategies. We note that for any set of features, functionality, and use cases, increasing the network capacity would lower transaction fees on average, which can entice more usage of the existing use cases. So long as the existing use cases have some traction and some rate of organic growth limited only by cost, increasing network scalability may often be a good option. Aside from that general strategy, increasing usage by improving existing products and use cases, developing functionality for new use cases, and marketing to potential new users of existing use cases may all be good strategies.</p>



 Next steps 



<p>Now that we’ve shared this proposal, our intent is to gather community feedback and perform market research on this proposal. If the proposal seems to have wide support, we would build on that understanding in a few ways:</p>



  We would tailor our Proof-of-Stake research with an assumption that the Zcash Posterity Fund would constrain the design of issuance. Without obvious support for the Posterity Fund proposal, how to adapt ZEC issuance to PoS protocols remains a more open ended question.  We would begin refining this high-level proposal into a concrete Zcash Improvement Proposal.  We may produce a follow-on proposal for altering transaction fees to improve resilience, UX, and privacy, similar to <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3473">this proposal (Zcash ticket #3473)</a>.  We would encourage new protocol proposals that impact ZEC tokenomics to consider integrating some kind of deposit mechanism. The prominent example is Zcash Shielded Assets.  



<p>Do you have feedback or questions about this proposal? Let us know by discussing in this <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/the-zcash-posterity-fund/42703">forum post</a> dedicated to the Zcash Posterity Fund proposal.</p>



 



  All of the issuance/disbursement and supply charts were generated using <a href="https://github.com/nathan-at-least/zec-issuance-plots">this code</a>.  This concern was first expressed to me by Greg Maxwell at Scaling Bitcoin in Montreal. This concern may be specific to any dynamically available protocol, and may be addressed by finalizing protocols. It may also be addressed by different fee mechanisms as this article proposes.  &nbsp;When the fund balance is large, it is probably acceptable to allow disbursements to outpace deposits: we can think of this as using a portion of the max supply to subsidize a lower cost of usage (e.g. lower transaction fees) for the current users to stimulate adoption and growth.

<p>Dear Panthers,<br></p><p>August is here. We're making steady progress, feeling confident in the results we're achieving, and improving our awareness and understanding of our surrounding environment. <br></p><p>We're thrilled to tell you everything about our work this month and what's to come, so let's jump into our monthly update.<br></p> Tech and Product  Advanced Staking <p>First of all, we're happy to share that after a successful <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">round 3</a>, smart contract testing for Advanced Staking (version 0.5 of the protocol) is now complete. With this finished, the last round of testing shall begin, leading to an upcoming <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">DAO</a> proposal to vote for the upgrade's implementation on Polygon and the Ethereum Mainnet.<br></p><p>Similarly, we have started testing Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) NFT support. We will share more about our findings in this regard in due time.<br></p> The road to v1 <p>As mentioned above, Advanced Staking constitutes the protocol's version 0.5. This is because the components that make it possible play a fundamental structural role in Panther's design.<br></p><p>Along with Advanced Staking testing, our team has started planning the Trusted Ceremony surrounding the launch of v1 contracts. We have also commenced work on specific v1 tasks, such as developing a single-sided AMM used for users to exchange PRPs for $zZKP. <br></p><p>We plan on publishing a detailed semi-technical piece about this soon. Along with it, the necessary documentation and testing of different circuits need refining.<br></p> Ecosystem and community   Trust Wallet and Huobi integrations <p>This month, $ZKP got listed in one of the largest cross-chain wallets - <a href="https://trustwallet.com/es/">Trust Wallet</a>. Users from Trust Wallet can now store, send and receive $ZKP. <br></p><p>$ZKP also became completely available with full capabilities on <a href="https://www.huobi.com/">Huobi</a> as the exchange removed its Pioneer Zone. Non-KYC'd users can now trade $ZKP as long as they are in a non-restricted country. <br><br></p> Panther zTalks #3: Progress Towards v1, DeFi Integration, Research <br> <p>In this 3rd episode of Panther zTalks, we had Saif Akhtar (Head of Product), Andrew Zaichenko (Product Manager), Carlos Cano (Content Creation), and Joris Koopman aka ZORK (Community Manager). <br></p><p>We discussed, among other things:<br></p>  The latest news of the Panther ecosystem.  The progress of Advanced Staking testing.  Progress towards Panther’s v1.  The community's reaction to round 3 of testing.  Panther’s DeFi integration.  Interchain bridging breakthroughs.<br>  <p>Check it out:<br></p> Still leading the CoinMarketCap Community ranking<br> <p>Thanks to our community, Panther Protocol ranked 1st for the second time in the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/">CoinMarketCap Community</a> Rank sorting projects by engagement growth. <br></p><p>We’re also expecting to interact more with the CoinMarketCap community in the near future.<br></p> Dr. Anish Mohammed at EthCC Paris <p></p><p>Our Co-Founder, Chief Scientist, and CTO Anish Mohammed participated in EthCC Paris with his talk “Economic Analysis of Private DeFi”. In it, he breaks down the economic argument for providing privacy. He delves his strategies to understand the marginal cost of privacy, and looks at it from a few different perspectives.</p><p>If you'd prefer to read our rendition of the talk in written format, you <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">can go here.</a></p>"Along with incentives, a dynamic pricing of privacy is also vital. If users have incentives to pay extra for higher privacy (therefore incentivizing strategies that provide privacy to others), it’s possible to lower the price of privacy for all, making the system more robust and attractive." AMA with Bittrex Global <p></p>An AMA you can't miss!<p>Anish also participated in an AMA with the Bittrex Global community to discuss $ZKP and DeFi privacy.

<p>On-chain coin mixing is often labelled as a nefarious service that is making it easier for criminals to hide their illicit activities. This is a gross twist of the truth, and is similar to the stigma Bitcoin has faced since its inception.In its early days, Bitcoin was used for the transaction of goods on the black market, and this association has been tied to it ever since. However, any criminal who understands Bitcoin would realize that it is perfectly traceable, and therefore a poor means to hide your activity. The reality nowadays is that cash is overwhelmingly popular for criminal transactions, and Bitcoin is not under the same scrutiny that it was before. The scrutiny is now on coin mixing services, but for the wrong reasons. These services are striving to make Bitcoin transactions as private as possible, not for the sake of criminality, but for the sake of the individual’s right to privacy. The truth is that the general population has grown accustomed to asking authorities for their privacy, when it should be the other way around, ethically speaking. Coin mixing services like Wasabi are striving to restore this constitutional right.</p><p>The core ethos behind Bitcoin promotes economic empowerment, and the rebalance of power between the individual and the state. This is a concept that is all too unfamiliar for most but is gaining traction as people have experienced their basic freedoms t being taken away during the pandemic. On top of that, out-of-control inflation is now evaporating the wealth of all those who are unaware of how to allocate their wealth properly. These are circumstances that came as a result of unbalanced centralized power at the hand of corporate and government entities. We will always need a degree of centralization in society - it’s just that we need solutions, like Bitcoin, to mitigate the excess of such. Coin mixing mitigates the extent of centralized influence over Bitcoin. If we mitigate this, then we risk not being able to benefit from what Bitcoin has to offer.</p> How do we set the record straight? <p>Not enough people understand the value proposition behind Bitcoin. If they did, then the motivation for coin mixing and coinjoin services would become much more clear. Hence, &nbsp;the first step to destigmatize these services would be through education get people thinking appropriately about Bitcoin to begin with. How to do that is the tricky part. Likely the best that any one of us can do is to keep improving our own understanding of what Bitcoin is all about, and share that with the people that are most relevant to us. Bitcoin is ultimately a shared vision, one that not one person alone will fully understand until it is a shared reality that has arrived.</p><p>The second thing we can do is to educate people about the importance of their privacy. It is understandable that this is so lost on the general population. Before the internet, it was not as easy to keep track of everyone’s activity. Now everyone keeps a computer in their pocket everywhere they go in the form of a cellphone, which means that even your physical location can be tracked at any given moment. Our technologies have seen extremely rapid progress in the 20 years since the internet started going mainstream, and public awareness has not kept up with the ramifications. What are the ramifications? As far as privacy is concerned, they are that detailed information about everyone has inevitably made it into the hands of big tech, and the nation-state powers that be. What this translates into is something approaching a surveillance-state, and the inevitable manipulation of human behavior that it allows.</p><p>A third step is to educate people on the tools they have at their disposal to maintain their privacy. These tools can be anything from using a virtual private network (VPN) service to learning how to mix your Bitcoin transactions. Coin mixing itself is a stretch for the everyday user to start using as it has been reserved for the more technologically savvy. That is why organizations like Wasabi are providing user-friendly solutions to help bridge the gap between the lack of concern people have for their privacy, and being able to access the tools they need when they realize how important their privacy really is.</p> The destigmatization of coin mixing <p>Perhaps one of the most significant drivers of change today is the increased digitization of society, which is epitomized by the advent of Bitcoin. Bitcoin represents an upgrade to the technology of money. Bitcoin also represents a form of “freedom technology” that can break us free from archaic legacy systems that have delayed humanity’s progress. Those legacy systems are clawing for survival as they face their impending downsizing. We don’t need massive corporate structures and government entities to disappear. What we need is a means to enforce an upgrade in their ethical, and practical performance. Bitcoin, as empowered by coin mixing, is one of the best tools we as the people have to enforce our demand for dramatically improved governance and leadership. </p><p>This is why it is important that coin mixing becomes destigmatized. It will take a collective effort to bring our public knowledge up to speed on the urgency of Bitcoin’s adoption, to educate people on the need for coin mixing, and to remind ourselves to take back our constitutional right to privacy. The sooner we can get our heads straight about respecting our own privacy, and the truth behind Bitcoin, the sooner humanity break free from the trappings of the past.<br></p>

 Shade Protocol — Bonds Audit&nbsp;Complete <p>Greetings community,</p><p>Shade Protocol development has continued to progress rapidly with core contracts set to be launched on Secret Network mainnet in fall of 2022. Prior to the launch of the mainnet contracts, Shade Protocol will be releasing Shade Bonds — a privacy-preserving DeFi instrument where users can purchase digital assets from the ShadeDAO by depositing protocol desired cryptocurrencies into a smart contract.</p><blockquote><a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/apps/bonds">Learn About Shade&nbsp;Bounds</a></blockquote><p>Bonds are a powerful mechanism by which the ShadeDAO will be able to grow its set of protocol owned assets which can then be utilized to generate liquidity for Shade Apps as well as yield for the protocol. Because bonds are capable of directly interacting with the minting contracts for <a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/apps/silk">SILK</a> and <a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/">SHD</a> as well as the accrued ShadeDAO treasury assets, the security of the bonds smart contracts are of the upmost importance.</p><a href="https://www.certik.com/">https://www.certik.com/</a><p>Because of our insistence on putting security first, the core protocol contributors are proud to have partnered with <a href="https://www.certik.com/">Certik</a> to have the bonds smart contracts audited for vulnerabilities.</p> Audit <a href="https://www.certik.com/projects/shade-protocol">https://www.certik.com/projects/shade-protocol</a><p>Linked below is the full pdf of the Certik’s Bond audit findings:</p><p><a href="https://2763075352-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FGSBEdPwWy2UsGV3OHPY5%2Fuploads%2FTCcsJl0kZ2khV5Xu34AH%2FBonds.pdf?alt=media&amp;token=6e3fdd9b-0601-42b8-86a6-fa9b8d9f3a34">Full Audit&nbsp;PDF</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/securesecrets/shade/tree/dev/contracts/bonds">Github Code Under&nbsp;Audit</a></p> Findings <p>The Certik security assessment was completed August 1st, 2022. The vulnerability found 1 major, 1 medium, and 2 minor vulnerabilities.</p><p>The major vulnerability was tied to the centralization of bond issuance — because bond issuance is such a powerful mechanism, the auditors were concerned around the centralization of permissioning tied to issuance:</p><p>These centralization concerns will be resolved with the launch of Shade Protocol Governance on mainnet in the fall. The admin role that Certik observed as having direct power over bonds will be directly controlled by Shade Protocol token governance.</p><p>The medium vulnerability was tied to an assumption on oracle price decimals — if the oracle returns an unexpected amount of decimals, there is a chance for dangerous behavior to occur with the interaction between the bonds contract and the depositor.</p><p>Shade Protocol resolves this concern as the handling of inconsistent decimal amount are handled via the Shade Oracle (not the bonds contract) — the oracle will execute the logic to convert data feeds to 18 decimals so that any contract that interacts with the oracle can expect a consistent 18 decimal wrapping, thus resolving this specific&nbsp;concern.</p><p>A minor vulnerability was tied to a lack of input validation which could result in unexpected behavior at&nbsp;runtime.</p><p>The team resolved this concern via the inclusion of the following:</p>contract.rshandle.rshandle.rs<p>The last minor vulnerability was tied to logic dependencies leveraged by oracle, shade admin, issued_asset, and airdrop. Certik advised careful examination of the security of these functional dependencies. This risk was acknowledged by the&nbsp;team.</p> Conclusion <p>With the completion of the Shade Bonds audit, Shade Protocol aims to release the next 10% of the SHD airdrop — launching side by the side with bonds. Front-end UI/UX are the final piece to be completed in order for bonds and part two of the airdrop to be released.</p><p>Shade Protocol puts the security of users above all else, which is why we will continue to internally and externally audit all key contracts that are part of the Shade Protocol&nbsp;suite.</p><blockquote>Speed is great, but accuracy is&nbsp;final.</blockquote><p>We look forward to safely launching bonds — the first of many core privacy-preserving products to be launched by Shade Protocol.</p> Join The Shade Protocol Community <p><a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/">Documentation</a> | <a href="https://shadeprotocol.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs">Medium</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/kBRQJRsP">Discord</a></p>

Security keys are in the user’s&nbsp;wallet.  Users can enhance the security by using a hardware or a cold&nbsp;wallet.  No measure of transaction security. When a transaction is signed by a wallet, there is no record of the type of wallet used (whether it is browser-based, app, hardware, etc.).  Some wallets operate in browsers as plug-ins. This imposes security risks, as browsers don’t typically contain technology to allow the secure storage of user-sensitive data.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Transactions are secure. Security keys are with the&nbsp;user.  Users can enhance the security by buying an ID enabled&nbsp;device.  ZINDEX (or security index) enables users to set different levels of security from low to&nbsp;extreme.  IDs operate as standalone apps.   Privacy <p>Blockchain</p><p>Transactions are public by&nbsp;nature.</p><p>For example, users can check each other’s balances and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Transactions are private by&nbsp;nature.</p><p>For example, users can’t check each other’s balances and&nbsp;assets.</p> Cost Structure <p>Blockchain</p>  Gas fee to miners, i.e., cost per transaction. The fees could add up to high figures depending on the user’s activity during busy&nbsp;times.  Different services can have additional subscription tokens, nonetheless, gas fees are unavoidable.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Subscription fee to ID cloud provider, i.e., all in one fee. No gas&nbsp;fees.  Different services can have additional subscription assets. No gas fees&nbsp;payable.  IDZ envisages that all products and services will become subscription-based in the near future, all manageable from within one’s&nbsp;ID.   Environmental Impact <p>Blockchain</p><p>Blockchains that utilise proof of work algorithms are notoriously resource-intensive and require an ever-increasing amount of computing power. This has a detrimental impact on the environment.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>ID ecosystem transactions are environmentally efficient because there is no need to perform CPU-intensive work to verify transactions.</p> Data Storage <p>Blockchain</p>  Blockchains (not wallets) store links/pointers to the data that is stored in different off-chain data storage solutions (such as&nbsp;IPFS).  While pointers to the data are difficult to find, they are made public on the blockchain.  IPFS networks break the content to “small parts” and store it in “un-encrypted”. If any of the IPFS servers that hold any part of the data goes offline, and there are no copies of the data (unless complex IPFS-clusters are utilised), users will not be able to access their&nbsp;content.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  IDs store the actual data&nbsp;itself.  Third parties (not the users) have pointers to the user’s data which never leaves his/her&nbsp;ID.  The content is stored encrypted as one piece (i.e., not broken to small&nbsp;parts).   Ownership Definition <p>Blockchain</p><p>Blockchain networks define ownership according to the following principles:</p>  Storage: the data sits in storage network (e.g., IPFS), not with the user. Users own pointers to access the data. Users can share these pointers with third&nbsp;parties.  Encryption: user assets are not typically encrypted and instead stored “off-chain”.  Keys with the&nbsp;user.  Open source.  Always immutable.  Public by default. Blockchain could be private if used by companies (i.e., not for public&nbsp;need).  Decentralisation of nodes and&nbsp;miners.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>IDZ defines ownership according to the following principles:</p>  Storage: the data sits on the user’s device or a cloud space fully controlled by the user. Users can give third parties access to the&nbsp;data.  Encryption: asset encryption with unique keys for the whole ecosystem. The data always sits encrypted with the user as one piece, not elsewhere. Users can share access to the data with third parties. For example, in Exchange App, the app only stores pointers to the data which never leaves the ID without the user’s consent. <a href="https://idz.com/use-cases/exchange">Refer to the Exchange use-case</a>.  Keys with the&nbsp;user.  Open-source.  Immutability is optional (depending on access rights). Having the immutability optional ensures flexibility which in return ensures better&nbsp;control.  Always private.  Full control (see&nbsp;below).   Control <p>Blockchain</p>  Wallet address doesn’t store any actual data. It only keeps the links to the data stored elsewhere. Users’ data doesn’t sit with&nbsp;them.  Non-programmer users can’t create crypto assets and smart contracts by themselves.  You can’t delete data on blockchains. It will always be there. If someone manages to get hold of your seed phrase, they can always access the data. If a person passes away, his/her data will forever be on the network with a seed phrase that can decrypt&nbsp;it.  Re-keying of the seed phrase is not possible. If the seed phrase is compromised, users need to move all the assets to another wallet as quickly as possible.  You can’t migrate your wallet address to another network. For example, you can’t use your ETH address on Solana&nbsp;network.  Zero knowledge is optional and rarely utilised as the data is&nbsp;public.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Users give access to apps to use certain data in their ID as opposed to apps giving users access to the data they store for them. Users can manage access to apps at any time. If a user never uses an app again, the data will always be with him and he will not leave any data in any unwanted&nbsp;places.  Non-programmer users can create any assets or contracts in seconds by themselves without the need of any third&nbsp;party.  You can delete the data in your ID. A person can even write a “will” that will trigger the deletion of the data with erasure at a given time in the&nbsp;future.  Re-keying is possible.  You can import, export or migrate your ID and data as you&nbsp;like.  Zero-knowledge is inherent in the ID ecosystem. Assets are encrypted with unique keys under the control of the&nbsp;user.   Decentralisation Definition <p>Blockchain</p><p>Blockchain networks believe that active decentralisation is a prerequisite for data ownership and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Decentralisation is mainly defined as the decentralisation of the machines that process that&nbsp;data.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>IDZ believes that decentralisation is a passive outcome for ownership and control of&nbsp;data.</p><p>Decentralisation is mainly defined as the ability to conduct any transaction peer-to-peer, without the involvement of any external parties. It implies centralising all the powers in the users’&nbsp;hands.</p> Crypto Wallet vs&nbsp;ID  Default name <p>Blockchain</p><p>Wallet addresses are impossible to remember, and users need to copy and paste&nbsp;them.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>IDs are memorable by default. However, user can choose an address-style ID to make it impossible to remember.</p> Vanity names <p>Blockchain</p><p>Can be purchased as an&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Can be purchased as an&nbsp;asset.</p> Identity concept <p>Blockchain</p><p>Avatars to be used in the Metaverse and unique usernames.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>You are your data. ALL your data IS you. Not limited to just avatars and usernames. IDs are for the real world, not only the Metaverse.</p> Identification <p>Blockchain</p>  Federated (using wallet address).  A signed asset can be used as an identifier (e.g., using a certain asset to grant access to an account/channel).  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Federated (using the&nbsp;ID).  ‘Identify’ and share an Asset as an identifier (e.g., using a certain asset to grant access to an account/channel).  <p>IDZ envisages that the terms &amp; conditions of websites and apps will become a contract which governs the exchange of certain assets between IDs (between the user and the service).</p> Offline accessibility <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>You can encrypt your files and save them locally only. You can always access your local file even if you are&nbsp;offline.</p> Portability <p>Blockchain</p><p>Wallet addresses are tied to the network. <br> <br> For example, you can’t migrate your Solana address to use it on the Ethereum&nbsp;network.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>IDs are not tied to the ID provider. They can be portable given that ID clouds have the same structure.</p> Purpose of&nbsp;use <p>Blockchain</p><p>Wallet addresses are developed to be used with decentralised networks&nbsp;only.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>IDs are developed to be used with all services, websites and apps, centralised or decentralised.</p> Corporate ID management <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Corporates can create IDs and assign them to employees. These IDs can contain all the necessary data for the employees to perform their duties (files, access to apps, access to offices, business expenses, etc.).</p><p><a href="https://idz.com/use-cases/employment-agreement">Check the employment agreement — Optimal corporate experience.</a></p> Funds excessiveness &amp; leftovers   To purchase tokens, you need to have excess funds in your wallet to proceed. So, if an asset is $10 and the gas is $0.5, you need $10.75 to&nbsp;proceed.  After purchasing an asset, users are often left with leftover funds in their wallets which can’t be&nbsp;used.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  To purchase an asset, you need the exact amount of currency asset in your ID to proceed. If an asset is $10, you only need $10 to&nbsp;proceed.  You can use a definite number to buy a fixed-price asset without leaving any leftovers in the&nbsp;ID.   Crypto Assets vs&nbsp;Assets  Nature and&nbsp;type <p>Blockchain</p><p>Crypto assets are public and unstructured. They need programming knowledge to be created unless a platform (e.g., OpenSea) is used to create them. This limits the size of the asset universe.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Assets are private and structured. The structure is public for all (see below). No need for programming knowledge to create any kind of asset. Consequently, the asset universe is unlimited. Anything can be an asset, whether it is public or private. For example, user’s music files, consultancy services, pictures, browsing history, health data from wearables, medical records,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Most notably, there is a chat asset so users can own and control their communication.</p> Hardware as an&nbsp;asset <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Assets can be anything even hardware devices. 01 watch is the first hardware asset in the ID ecosystem. Users need to own the digital asset for the physical watch to be&nbsp;active.</p> Asset connectivity <p>Blockchain</p><p>Assets are independent of each&nbsp;other.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Assets talk to each other. If you make changes to one asset, all the other assets which are linked to it will change&nbsp;too.</p><p>For example, if your bank and school get your address from your utility provider (e.g., electricity company), they can use it in their assets. A change in the address held by the utility provider causes the address to change elsewhere. <a href="https://idz.com/use-cases/hotel">Refer to the hotel use case&nbsp;example.</a></p> Structure <p>Blockchain</p><p>Assets don’t follow a public structure.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Asset structure is public, allowing users&nbsp;to:</p>  Create standard assets by simply populating fields (e.g., loyalty cards, tickets).  Request specific properties in known assets (e.g., requesting age property from the driving license&nbsp;asset).   Biometric assets <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Biometric assets ensure that only genuine owners can activate and use these assets. No one else other than the genuine user him/herself can use these assets. This has the following benefits:</p>  <a href="https://idz.com/use-cases/official-documents">Official identification: passport use&nbsp;case.</a>  <a href="https://idz.com/use-cases/secure-signing">Binding agreement: digital signature use&nbsp;case</a>  Apostille service elimination: no need for official witnesses anymore.   Mutability <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Yes, if&nbsp;desired.</p><p>For example, the fitness asset gets updated on a regular basis by the data it receives from the different wearables that collect the user’s fitness data, <a href="https://idz.com/use-cases/doctor">refer to the “at the doctor” use&nbsp;case.</a></p> Asset as a&nbsp;message <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Users can chat with each other by creating chat assets. In the chat asset, they can send and receive text, files, assets and contracts.</p> Crypto Smart Contracts vs Contracts  Structure <p>Blockchain</p>  Crypto smart contracts rely on code. Programming knowledge is necessary for users to be able to build them. They are complicated for non-programmer users.  For two parties who don’t have any programming experience, a third external party is a&nbsp;must.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  ID ecosystem contracts rely on pre-built formulas and models. Users can select from the dropdown lists the IDs and assets involved and build contracts in&nbsp;seconds.  No external third parties are required when building a contract between two parties who don’t have any programming knowledge.   External information in contracts <p>Blockchain</p>  Users can use Oracles to insert external variables in their code which would affect the valuation or execution of the contracts.  Oracles are complicated for non-programmer users, as they need relevant coding experience.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Users can use the key-value-pair section to insert variables in their formulas and models which would affect the valuation or execution of the contracts.  Anyone can use and developers can contribute to the key-value-pair page   Transparency <p>Blockchain</p>  Crypto smart contracts are complex for non-programmers. Only developers can know the possible outcomes of a contract if they decide to dig into the&nbsp;code.  Given that it is not necessary for the contract code to be published on blockchain explorers, users must trust the developer who created the contract.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Contracts are transparent for all users. No grey areas in the middle. Users can know all the possible outcomes of a contract in&nbsp;advance.  For example, if a tenant wants to check all his rights before and after signing the rent contract, he can simply check all the formulas included in the contract, what he can and can’t do, and what the landlord can and can’t do, all without needing to read a whole legal agreement.   Mutability <p>Blockchain</p><p>Crypto smart contracts are immutable.</p><p>For example, if a contract between an employer and employee needs to be amended to reflect a pay rise, a new contract needs to be written from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Ethereum supports smart contract versioning.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Contracts are mutable with the consent of all parties involved.</p><p>For example, if a contract between an employer and employee needs to be amended to reflect a pay rise, they can simply amend the old contract.</p><p>ID cloud providers support contract versioning.</p><p>Users can also build immutable contracts if they&nbsp;wish.</p> Escrow and binary execution <p>Blockchain</p><p>Non-programmer users can’t check which assets the contract requests and/or sends to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Many users fall victims to scam contracts which drain all their wallets without sending any assets in&nbsp;return.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Contracts act in a binary manner that ensures justice for all parties involved.</p><p>For example, check the exchange use&nbsp;case.</p> Contract as a&nbsp;message <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Users can chat with each other by creating chat assets. In the chat asset, they can send and receive text, files, assets and contracts. Contracts can be executed on the spot inside the&nbsp;chat.</p> Privacy <p>Blockchain</p><p>Crypto smart contracts are&nbsp;public.</p><p>For example, if a user sells his house, all users could know about&nbsp;it.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Contracts are&nbsp;private.</p><p>For example, if a user sells his house, the information is kept private, not available to the&nbsp;public.</p> Speed of execution <p>Blockchain</p>  Crypto smart contracts are slow as they need to be verified by different nodes.  Users can get scammed by a contract that requires all assets at once, as they can’t verify the code and the assets involved.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Execution is&nbsp;instant.  Full execution of the whole contract (regardless of the number of assets involved) is one click away. Users can check all the assets involved before they share. Check the cinema use&nbsp;case.   Identity verification in contracts <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Biometric assets can be used to sign contracts. This ensures users it is really the genuine people who are signing the contract as they are the only ones who are able to use these&nbsp;assets.  For example, a user can use a biometric passport asset issued by a government body which only s/he can activate/use to sign a contract.   Contract execution by&nbsp;hardware <p>Blockchain</p><p>No.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Yes.</p><p>For example, a user can unlock his/her car (i.e., execute the contract that governs locking/unlocking the car) with his 01&nbsp;watch.</p> Payment reference and discount&nbsp;coupons <p>Blockchain</p><p>There is no payment reference, so users rely on the transaction hash to confirm the payment. It will not be viable to rely on transaction hash if blockchain were to be adopted by all&nbsp;people.</p><p>Some services offer “notes” with payment, these notes are usually public and subject to&nbsp;abuse.</p><p>Users can’t apply discount coupons for the assets they want to purchase. Early adopters of a token can’t benefit from a discount that applies to them&nbsp;only.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Payment references are available and&nbsp;private</p><p>Discount coupons are available and&nbsp;private.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today we’re releasing an update for our desktop browser (v1.42), which includes two exciting additions that give Brave Wallet users more choice with crypto transactions:</p>
 
 
<p>Aurora, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) built on the NEAR protocol, is now available as a preloaded blockchain for all Brave Wallet users, enabling access to fast, low-fee transactions</p>
 
 
<p>Desktop Wallet users can now purchase the Basic Attention Token (BAT) on Solana and Polygon, via the Ramp network</p>
 
 

 Aurora EVM now available as a preloaded blockchain&nbsp; 
<p>First announced at <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022/">Coindesk Consensus</a>, Brave is offering more choice to Brave Wallet users with the addition of a new pre-loaded chain: <a href="https://aurora.dev/">Aurora</a>, an <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/">Ethereum L2</a> that taps into the scalability of the <a href="https://near.org/">NEAR protocol</a>. Aurora provides up to 1000x lower gas fees, and up to 50x faster transactions than Ethereum.</p>
<p>As an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Aurora offers a familiar user experience and compatibility with dozens of <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC-20 assets</a>. It also brings higher throughput at near zero-cost transactions, allowing users to take full advantage of new, more sophisticated <a>decentralized apps</a> (DApps). This means more accessible DeFi and <a>NFTs</a>, and better DApp discovery for Brave Wallet users.</p>
<p>Users can easily bridge to Aurora via the <a href="https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer">Rainbow Bridge</a>, which currently offers the ability to transfer tokens to / from NEAR, Aurora, and Ethereum. Once assets have been transferred to Aurora, users will find popular decentralized protocols and DApps that have been deployed on the network—such as <a href="https://curve.fi/">Curve</a>, <a href="https://dodoex.io/">DODO</a>, <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Gnosis Safe</a>, and <a href="https://beefy.finance/">Beefy Finance</a>—and new native products like <a href="https://bastionprotocol.com/">Bastion</a> and <a href="https://www.trisolaris.io/">Trisolaris</a>. Together, these protocols have amassed $258M in total value locked (TVL) in smart contracts on Aurora.</p>
<p>As the Aurora ecosystem evolves, Brave’s native token (BAT) will also become available for use in DeFi via integrations in decentralized exchanges, lending markets, and more. We also have plans to bring Aurora network token swaps and streamlined bridging to Brave Wallet. Stay tuned!</p>

 Buy BAT on Solana and Polygon, via Ramp 
<p>In today’s desktop release, we’re also adding more ways for Brave Wallet users to buy the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token</a> (BAT), via our partnership with <a href="https://ramp.network/">Ramp</a>. Wallet users can now buy wrapped BAT on <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a> and <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> using the fiat-to-crypto feature, powered by Ramp.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 
<p>By expanding the number of chains that support BAT, we’re continuing to grow the scope of the attention economy beyond the native use case of <a>Brave Rewards</a>. With each new partnership, BAT becomes easier and more flexible in DeFi and crypto marketplaces.</p>
<p>Ramp’s mission is to make Web3 accessible for all by offering fiat-to-crypto buying solutions in 140 countries and for <a href="https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/432-supported-crypto-assets">more than 45 assets</a>. Together, Brave and Ramp are making the process of buying crypto easier than ever, with affordable options and a streamlined user experience.</p>

 Follow our Wallet Partner announcements 
<p>Brave will announce <a>new partnerships</a> and integrations—and introduce new utility for both Wallet and BAT—almost every month. Stay tuned for more updates.</p>
<p>Not using Brave Wallet yet? It’s easy to get started…</p>
<p>If you already use the Brave browser, just click the  in the address bar. If you’re not using Brave, <a>download it for desktop, Android, or iOS</a>, and ditch Big Tech for good. It only takes 60 seconds to switch.</p>

   The best technology products are those that emulate human nature rather than try to change it. Most of the time, technology strikes a chord with us when it reflects our own nature back at us. The design-first approach is the overarching driver of innovation in several industries, and one that investor Maya Frai believes will spur many successful startups.

<blockquote><p>Is Meta monopolising the Metaverse? Mark Zuckerberg is being criticised by industry experts for potentially trying to take over the whole virtual reality industry.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently filed a complaint against the tech giant for acquiring Within, the company that produced the VR game Supernatural. The reason behind the case was that Meta already owned the ever-so-popular VR game Beat Saber, which very well could have been a direct competition to Supernatural.</p></blockquote>



<p>The recent decision of the FTC to file a complaint against Meta has raised various reactions, and Mark Zuckerberg’s company denied the charges by claiming that “the FTC case is based on ideology and speculation, not evidence.”</p>



<p>Contacted by EM360, our CEO and founder, Kavya Pearlman, commented that “Looking at this case in isolation and the surface level may lead to the conclusion that it is just a normal case of Merger &amp; Acquisition (M&amp;A). But to understand why this type of acquisition is detrimental to building healthy competition, we have to dig deeper into Meta’s acquisition and other anti-competitive practices”.</p>



<p>Kristina Podnar, chair of the <a href="https://metaverserealitycheck.org/">Metaverse Reality Check</a>, welcomed FTC’s efforts to keep the Metaverse a fair playing field where all the companies, big or small, have an equal opportunity to progress. “I welcome FTC’s action as I see it as coming at a critical time with regards to frontier technologies,” says Kristina. “Most governments are challenged to define and sustain a sound regulatory framework that balances business creativity and innovation with citizen privacy and safety.”</p>

It is a place to apply for grants, build and test new Privacy Enhanced Applications (PEApps) in experimental mode. Shipyard works as an onramp to privacy preserving applications, designed to support developers from early ideas all the way through to having a market ready application running in the Nym privacy ecosystem — graduating to the Nym Innovation Fund.</p><p>What many people might not be aware of is that the mixnet is already usable with familiar applications many of us use everyday: Electrum wallet, Keybase and soon Telegram!</p><p>To facilitate use and increase overall access to privacy enhancement of wallet and chat apps, Shipyard has launched with a number of Service Grants. These incentivize the community to set up <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">gateway</a> / <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">network requester</a> pairs to facilitate the privacy enhancement of an initial set of applications. With overwhelming response, the deadline is closing on the 1st of August. However, another round of larger grants will be rolled out under Shipyard in the coming weeks, so stay tuned and <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">sign&nbsp;up</a>.</p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">Read more</a>…</p> NymConnect — join the Beta&nbsp;testing! <p><a href="http://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/nym-connect">Shipyard</a> is also where people can test early stage applications in the Nym ecosystem.

The team is currently analysing how the proposed e-cash schemes compare with other existing solutions for privacy e-cash, like zkSNARKs.</p> Improved cover and sender anonymity <p>The research team has designed and implemented a new cover traffic strategy for the Nym client which provides even better resistance against traffic analysis attacks (15% better results). The proposed technique is simple, yet very robust. The team is now working on adding anonymous replies to the Nym network, which will results in enhanced sender anonymity. Research is ongoing to explore different approaches, including the use of Single User Reply Blocks as well as the concept of drop boxes. Finally, now that the network is live, work on mixnet parametrisation has been kickstarted, to ensure that the mixing delay, volume of cover traffic, packet size and placement of the mix nodes within layers provide optimal privacy for the Nym users at the current stages of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>If you want a run-down of the many events our team members attended during the summer, make sure to check out our recent <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-summer-events-recap-9d199bb21bac">blog&nbsp;post</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-july-updates-d4f975bee0b0">Nym July Updates</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Our plan for delivering ABCI++</p><p>The Tendermint Core project is one which, relative to other software in the space, is long in the tooth. While Tendermint remains the industry standard in consensus engines, its journey has seen many iterations of the core development team. This lack of continuity has led to subsequent knowledge loss, the latest playing a key role in the <a href="https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/discontinuing-tendermint-v0-35-a-postmortem-on-the-new-networking-layer-3696c811dabc">discontinued v0.35&nbsp;release</a>.</p><p>In response to this, a group of experienced Tendermint Core contributors, from across the Cosmos Ecosystem, have formed the Cosmos Consensus Council. The Council’s objective is to accelerate development, guide product direction and provide continuity for Tendermint Core, working alongside both users and core contributors.</p><p>The immediate focus of the Council is the delivery of the much anticipated ABCI++. This is a collection of ergonomic changes to the interface between the application and Tendermint Core that will give the application far greater control of how the consensus engine conducts state machine replication. More information of what exactly ABCI++ does and what it unlocks will be released in a subsequent blog&nbsp;post.</p><p>The new release structure will start with getting the lowest risk pieces of ABCI++ into the hands of users first. PrepareProposal and ProcessProposal methods will be delivered on top of v0.34 as the next release. We aim to begin integrating this release with the Cosmos SDK within the next couple of weeks. This will be followed by FinalizeBlock and the vote extension logic.</p><p>Our goal is to fully deliver ABCI++ by the end of 2022, while focusing on quality of life improvements, performance and stability. As part of this, we have decided to <a href="https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/discontinuing-tendermint-v0-35-a-postmortem-on-the-new-networking-layer-3696c811dabc">discontinue support of v0.35</a>. Features from v0.35, such as the improvements to state sync and the storage engine, will slowly be assessed and ported into upcoming releases.</p><p>Follow the latest developments of Tendermint Core on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/discussions">GitHub</a>.</p><p>The Cosmos Consensus Council is a community initiative, formed and coordinated by contributors of Tendermint Core from across the Cosmos Ecosystem. While the council makes recommendations on the product roadmap and helps coordinate development efforts, it is not associated or led by the Interchain Foundation or Interchain GmbH.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/the-tendermint-council-and-the-path-to-delivering-abci-d6deb9e0fc7f">The Cosmos Consensus Council and the path to delivering ABCI++</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

These updates have been written by <a href="mailto:kian@parity.io">Kian Paimani</a> and <a href="mailto:ross@parity.io">Ross Bulat</a> from <a href="http://parity.io">Parity Technologies</a>.</p><p>Reach out to us for any comment or feedback!</p> Staking at Polkadot Decoded <p>The biggest Polkadot event of the year happened in multiple locations worldwide in late June, and there were 3 main talks discussing the cutting edge initiatives of Polkadot staking.</p><p>The recordings of these talks are now publicly available on Youtube</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_wjAYivFQBU">Nomination Pools and The Story of The Polkadot's NPoS</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/kianenigma">Kian Paimani</a>   <a href="https://youtu.be/H1WGu6mf1Ls">Polkadot Staking Dashboard Demo</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/rossbulat">Ross Bulat</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ym8t6cVHhgY">Recommending Validators Using an Active Learning Algorithm</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/GehrleinJonas">Jonas Gehrlein</a>   Nomination Pools Bug Fixes Update <p>A number of bugs were found in nomination pools during their test-run on Kusama — all of which have now all been fixed in Substrate master and are awaiting to be deployed on Kusama again, proposed for the next release.</p><p>The most notable of these bugs are:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11746">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11746</a>  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11669">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11669</a>  <p>Once a release, including these two, is merged and working well on Kusama for some period of time, we can propose that governance merge the pending pull request to add nomination pools to Polkadot.</p><p>To facilitate those who are interested in building on top of nomination pools:</p>  There’s a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/21/views/1">dedicated github project</a> for nomination pools now.  There’s a <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io">dedicated element room</a> for support and discussion.   Notable Contributors   A <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11831">custom runtime API</a> to fetch the pending rewards of a member in a pool by an external contributor. This can also be used over the RPC by wallets.  More efficient <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11767">re-bonding of unclaimed rewards</a>.  <p>Thinking about contributing?

With this in mind, we would like validators to benefit from this new app and the potentials it is unlocking as early as possible.</p><p>We are taking our first steps towards doing so today.</p><p>We are excited to announce that validators can now utilize the dashboard and add themselves to the new <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard/#/community">community</a> page.</p><p>The community page is a new initiative to promote the visibility of not only validator nodes, but the entities and individuals behind the nodes that ensure their uptime and maintenance.</p><p>We are referring to these crucially important validator operators as “validator entities”.</p>A temporary validator entity example hosted on the Community page.<p>If you run validators on Polkadot, you are eligible to add your entity. Let’s explore entities in more detail.</p> About Validator Entities <p>As a validator entity, you can host:</p>  A custom avatar to reflect your identity and brand  Contact details: currently supports an email address, twitter handle and website URL  A short bio of who you are, limited to 300 characters or less.  And, crucially, a list of validator nodes that you are managing.  <p>The entity details will appear on the community page. The entity’s bio can be opened in an overlay, and the list of validators are displayed by clicking the entity’s Validators button.</p><p>Clicking the Validators button will open a subsection of the page that only displays details for that particular entity:</p>A temporary validator entity node list hosted on the Community page.<p>This list of an entity’s validators uses the same components used in the main <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard/#/validators">validator list</a>, with pagination, filters, identity syncing, favorite toggling, and metrics all supported; there are no compromises with validator entity lists.</p> Entity Setup Instructions <p>To add your entity, just submit a PR on the staking dashboard’s <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard">Github repo</a>. Within your PR, simply provide an avatar SVG and add your details to a JSON file.</p><p>Detailed instructions on how to add a validator entity are documented in the dashboard’s Readme document on Github, <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard#validator-entity-setup-guide">found here</a>.</p> Ensuring Fairness <p>Validator entities are shuffled every time someone visits the dashboard, so there is no preference or bias towards a particular entity.</p><p>In addition, the validator nodes themselves are shuffled every time they are visited, for the same reasons.</p> Next Steps <p>With this month’s update the aim is to spread the word of this new feature, hoping that a vibrant list of validator entities will be added in the near future.</p><p>We are keen to expand the community page itself with ordering and filtering functionality as adoption increases.</p><p>As always, feedback and suggestions are always welcome. You can easily post feedback on the <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard/#/feedback">Feedback</a> section of the dashboard.</p><p>Lastly, reach out to Ross for additional assistance at <a href="mailto:ross@parity.io">ross@parity.io</a></p>

  You can be an active part of the Panther community in more ways than you think. Let's look at Panther's DAO participation and other strategies.

<p>At Panther, we are lucky to have community members always eager to participate in bringing privacy to DeFi.</p><p>Different aspects of our mission require distinct but coordinated efforts and, within them, plenty of roles arise for our community to fill. Each role has its duties and rewards, which creates a crucial balance that we strive to maintain. We attempt to make all roles equally enticing. It’s up to you to decide which one interests you the most.</p><p>Let’s examine a few strategies for you to get involved in Panther right now or in the future and help us enable privacy and trust in DeFi:</p> Strategy #1: Vote on DAO proposals <p>The <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/governance/dao">Panther DAO</a>, not our team, has the final say on all major decisions in Panther. As such, all $ZKP holders can vote on DAO proposals conducted through <a href="http://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot.org</a>.</p><p>DAO proposals range from definitions on our roadmap (e.g., <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x969138dfe31faeb2cde3b10fe4e3fe40d3ad571974d1e566b5257229488a937b">launch Staking</a> or <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x6723c96c0ded4557fc70a4a8e3be54edd2c359895df3c88e7c645fcb0447063e">deploy to Polygon</a>) to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x5b854f288f407562265f6fd701e8e50564e4e936d36fb3784664195f763434a0">bug fixes</a> and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/launchdao.eth/proposal/0x2440b546cecc6292c56f55539942f10108831a1d6eff3b90a3603a9a157dbeae">launch timing</a>. We request community before every move, so voting is the best way for you to take an active role in the future of Panther.</p>All $ZKP holders with staked tokens can participate in voting.<p>Your $ZKP must be <a href="https://staking.pantherprotocol.io/">staked</a> to count towards voting power, regardless of the network (Ethereum or Polygon). We always announce new DAO proposals on <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/">Panther’s blog</a> and through social media.</p> Strategy #2: Become a member of our community <p>Panther frequently relies on our community members on Discord, Telegram, and Twitter to get feedback on many of our initiatives and help disseminate the word about what Panther is building. In exchange for that, we make sure our community members are always in the loop regarding our more recent releases, undertakings, and marketing activities. </p><p>Our policy of full transparency is conducted through these official channels. We invite you to join them in order to become a full-fledged member of the Panther community:</p>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">https://t.me/pantherprotocol</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">https://twitter.com/ZkPanther</a>  <p>We have also established a number of local Panther communities through our Ambassadors in order to reach users, investors, and believers outside the anglosphere. The local communities currently live are:</p>  French: <a href="https://t.me/PantherFranceOfficiel">t.me/PantherFranceOfficiel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpantherFR">twitter.com/zkpantherFR</a>  Spanish: <a href="https://t.me/pantherespanoloficial">https://t.me/pantherespanoloficial</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpantherES">twitter.com/zkpantherES</a>  Turkish: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocolturkish">https://t.me/pantherprotocolturkish</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherTR">twitter.com/zkpantherTR</a>  Japanese: <a href="https://t.me/PantherJapanOfficial">https://t.me/PantherJapanOfficial</a>  Italian: <a href="https://t.me/PantherItaliaOfficial">https://t.me/PantherItaliaOfficial</a>  Russian: <a href="https://t.me/PantherRussianOfficial">https://t.me/PantherRussianOfficial</a>  Africa: <a href="https://t.me/PantherAfricaOfficial">https://t.me/PantherAfricaOfficial</a>  India: <a href="https://t.me/PantherIndiaOfficial">https://t.me/PantherIndiaOfficial</a>   Strategy #3: Providing liquidity in Uniswap <p>Liquidity is very important in a DEX setting.</p><p>High liquidity allows investors to trade quickly, smoothly, and with less slippage. Liquidity providers earn fees from trades executed through liquidity pools. When a project has plenty of liquidity, volatility is better absorbed, making its price movements less abrupt.</p><p>Although anyone can create a Uniswap pool for any pair of assets, most of the time, it’s best to join existing pools that already enjoy some liquidity. There are currently four $ZKP liquidity pools live: a <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x909E34d3f6124C324ac83DccA84b74398a6fa173/ETH/3000?chain=mainnet">ETH-ZKP pool</a> (in the Ethereum Mainnet), and <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x9A06Db14D639796B25A6ceC6A1bf614fd98815EC/0xc2132D05D31c914a87C6611C10748AEb04B58e8F/3000?chain=polygon">USDT-ZKP</a>, <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x9A06Db14D639796B25A6ceC6A1bf614fd98815EC/0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174/10000?chain=polygon">USDC-ZKP</a>, and <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x9A06Db14D639796B25A6ceC6A1bf614fd98815EC/ETH/10000?chain=polygon">MATIC-ZKP</a> pools (in Polygon).</p><p>All of them are Uniswap v3 pools, meaning you must select a price range in which to concentrate your liquidity. You will earn fees for trades only when $ZKP is within your selected price range, and the narrower it is, the faster you will accumulate fees.</p> How to provide liquidity for $ZKP in Uniswap <p>To become a liquidity provider and earn fees in Uniswap, follow the steps below. Note that we only recommend for advanced users to do this, as you need to be aware of <a href="https://www.blockchain-council.org/defi/impermanent-loss/">impermanent loss</a>, know what you’re doing, and be prepared for the possibility of financial losses.</p><p>To provide liquidity in Uniswap:</p><p>1. Go to <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/">Uniswap’s dApp</a> and connect your wallet to the correct network.</p><p>2. Select the “Pool” tab, and click on the “New Position” button. Alternatively, follow one of the links above to the pool to which you want to provide liquidity.</p><p>3. Select the token pair you want to provide liquidity to. In this case, we selected $USDT/$ZKP. You might need to manually add $ZKP as a custom token to your Uniswap interface if you’ve never traded it in the decentralized exchange.</p><p>4. The “Edit” button (highlighted in yellow) in the screenshot below allows you to select a fee tier to deposit liquidity into. While you can choose a higher fee tier, users prefer to trade in pools with lower fees and more liquidity. For this reason, most users choose to adhere to the default option.</p>Adding liquidity to Uniswap pairs (in here, $ZKP/USDT).<p>5. As explained above, the fields highlighted in red are the bounds of the price range into which you will concentrate your liquidity. Highlighted in green is the button to provide liquidity at a full price range (zero to infinity). This is not recommended, however, as fee income will accumulate very slowly. You might want to set a wide but finite range to optimize your participation in the pool without worrying about $ZKP’s price range.</p><p>6. At last, type in how much $ZKP you want to provide. You will need to the pairing asset ($USDT in the image) in an amount that equals the same value. Uniswap will calculate the exact quantity you need to enter after you input your $ZKP amount.</p><p>7. You might need to approve your Metamask to spend $ZKP and your pairing asset if you have never used them in Uniswap. If you don’t see the “Approve” buttons, just skip this step.</p><p>8. Click “Preview” and “Add” to finish adding liquidity.</p> Strategy #4: Participate in product testing (Panther Zafari) <p>Panther Zafari is the name of Panther’s Incentivized Testnet. It <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b/">debuted</a> on May 19th, 2022, inviting our community to join the team’s efforts to test $ZKP Advanced Staking in the Mumbai Polygon Testnet, with rewards amounting to a total of 100,000 $ZKP.</p>We have received an enormous amount of feedback from all participants in Zafari for Advanced Staking testing. Decentralizing testing is a powerful way to dramatically increase our testing capabilities at a manageable cost.<p>Testing happens in the Polygon’s and Ethereum’s Testnets, with instructions in each test round’s announcement. Test $ZKP tokens are provided through a faucet when necessary.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b">first</a>, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/round-2-of-incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-94aaff689332">second</a>, and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">third</a> testing rounds for Advanced Staking are currently closed for new participants. Later Zafari rounds and testing of other features will be made public through our blog, so keep a close eye to avoid missing the next Zafari announcement!</p> Strategy #5: Become a partner <p>Strategic partnerships are essential for a nascent project’s success in the blockchain industry. Although competition is a major force that drives innovation, cooperation can be even more impactful in this space.</p>Panther aims to be the focal point through which Interchain private transactions are made possible. We prioritize our partners to deliver this critical private infrastructure.<p>Panther is always on the lookout for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/tag/partnerships/">partnerships</a> that contribute toward our goals for privacy in DeFi. If you’re involved with another project in the blockchain space and you believe we can mutually benefit from joining forces, you can reach out to our team through <a href="mailto:partnerships@pantherprotocol.io">partnerships@pantherprotocol.io</a>. We’re also always looking forward to hearing from:</p>  Other members of the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9/">PriFi</a> scene.  Projects wanting to infuse their protocols with privacy.  Infrastructure/data protocols.  Builders looking to use Panther’s primitives (see our section on upcoming SDKs/APIs for more about this!)   Strategy #6: Apply to be a Panther Ambassador <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/introducing-the-panther-ambassador-program-7cfc198a20a2/">Panther Ambassadors</a> are leaders all over the world who play a pivotal role in disseminating Panther amongst broader audiences. Thanks to them, the Panther community can continue to grow and provide feedback to improve our products, systems, and procedures.</p><p>Besides our team, Panther Ambassadors are the first to access product previews and exclusive events. Ambassadors work independently but can count on our team’s support as necessary for their endeavors. </p><p>Here are some examples of activities a Panther Ambassador can perform:</p>  Creating and moderating local communities  Organizing local events and meetups  Translating or creating Panther content, including but not limited to:  Twitter threads  Blog posts  Videos  Memes (yes, please)  Infographics  Podcasts  Assisting with the promotion and moderation of social media accounts. In fact, as of July 2022, we made a move to allow notable Panther Ambassadors to help moderate our Discord and Telegram channels, as opposed to a third-party firm. This has had the side effect of drastically increasing moderation quality and moderator knowledge!  Connect us with other players in the space for potential partnerships and collaborations.  Offer input to the Panther team on certain strategic decisions.   How are Panther Ambassadors compensated? <p>At the moment, for a few hours a month, Ambassadors may receive a monthly compensation varying on account of one’s cost of living and the extent of their contributions, among other factors. This program is designed to help motivated and driven ambassadors thrive as they increasingly support Panther.</p><p>Ambassadors can be reimbursed for pre-approved expenses incurred while representing Panther. They are also qualified to receive exclusive Panther swag you’ll receive for personal use and distribution.</p> How does one become a Panther Ambassador? <p>While Panther Ambassadors are still very much a part of our community, we are currently not actively looking for them. However, if you have a proposal for us, feel free to message the Panther team through our official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a>.</p> A lot more is coming <p>Panther is building a whole infrastructure to enable privacy and trust in DeFi and Web3. This is done through a complex ecosystem of products and services and, as such, in the future, you will be able to participate in Panther in many more ways. Some of them will be:</p> Providing liquidity to Multi-Asset Shielded Pools <p>By using Panther’s privacy solutions, you contribute to Panther’s privacy set and assist in making shielded transactions even harder to track. Depositing assets into <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-multi-asset-shielded-pools-enabling-heterogeneous-mixing-of-assets-ec165854bf0f/">MASPs</a> is a straightforward way to participate and strengthen the privacy offered by the protocol. Here is how it works:</p><p>After locking their assets into a vault, users receive fully-collateralized zAssets with which to privately transact through Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pools. As the number of transactions within a pool increases, it becomes increasingly harder to uncover the sender of any transaction. MASPs will reward those that add tokens even if they don’t make shielded transactions, as locking their assets also contributes to shielding.</p><p>MASPs are a part of Panther’s v1, which will be released sometime in 2022.</p> Advanced Staking <p>Currently, users are <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">testing Advanced Staking</a>, which is a mechanism that will help the Panther team test the way MASPs accrue and control rewards. Advanced Staking introduces the first zAsset, $zZKP. For this very reason, Advanced Staking requires a great deal of the infrastructure necessary for MASPs to be ready and deployed. </p><p>Our team has come to call Advanced Staking by the nickname “Panther v0.5,” a succinct way to describe what this feature means on Panther’s roadmap. The release of Advanced Staking is a huge milestone and just a few weeks away, so stay tuned!</p> Building on top of Panther <p>Panther is building public goods for a future where privacy is the default throughout in DeFi. By interacting with our smart contracts, developers can build more complex systems that rely on Panther as a basic building block. We commit to making this as easy as possible by releasing comprehensive and easy-to-understand <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/home/">documentation</a> on our smart contracts.</p><p>Our robust DeFi privacy suite relies on a number of state-of-the-art <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">cryptographic primitives</a> not widely available in a ready-to-use form. Our team intends to make them available through SDKs (software development kits) for developers to build privacy-oriented applications and dApps.</p> Interact with the Panther DAO <p>Since our launch, Panther has made decentralization one of our highest priorities and a key principle. The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Panther DAO</a> regularly conducts votes to approve the deployment of Panther’s new developments. As time passes, the responsibilities of the Panther Foundation and Stellium will be progressively passed over to the Panther DAO. </p><p>We are currently setting up the stage for users to get more actively involved in Panther’s governance and contribute to it more broadly.</p> Become a Service/Trust Provider <p>Some of Panther’s features rely on the participation of <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Service Providers and Trust Providers</a>. Service Providers are entities offering applications that interact with <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol/protocol/panthers-core-components/zassets">zAssets</a> or <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol/protocol/panthers-core-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals">Panther Reveals</a>. Trust Providers are entities capable of providing attestations (verifiable statements) in the form of Panther Reveals, revealing the least possible (or none at all) underlying information. Through these attestations, Service Providers can build trust with their users.</p><p>As these features become commonplace, the Panther team will open the door for more and more Trust and Service Providers to join the ecosystem.</p> Ask not what Panther can do for you… <p>At the end of the day, Panther can only go as far as its community takes it.</p><p>On our end, our job is to build the best system possible that aligns all incentives for Panther to <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">compete with other centralized and decentralized alternatives.</a> Our ultimate goal is to build an ecosystem that supports users contributing, building, and improving their privacy without the need to be told so.</p><p>By joining early, you get to be one of the very first to reap the benefits of participating in a larger mission.</p><p>We hope to see you around our communities very soon!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Communication is the foundation of the Internet. Social media, news, shopping, and educational platforms are all underpinned by the ability to communicate across the world, at any time, with anyone. We form relationships, we learn, we grow, and we share our lives and our secrets online – and up until now, we’ve done it by selling our identities to the most powerful companies in the world.</p>



<p>The xx network is a revolution in the way we build and use the communications platforms that make the Internet so ubiquitous in our daily lives. The xx network provides private communications infrastructure that isn’t owned by a corporation, individual, or government. On top of that, the xx network can’t scoop up your data or your identity, and it can’t be censored – nor be discovered – even by the most determined actors. Ensured by cryptography, the xx network is owned and operated by its users, meaning you can run the servers and make the decisions.</p>



<p>The xx coin represents your voice in the network. It’s used to vote, exchange value, and incentivize you to run a server or node, and it gives uncensorable access to the most private decentralized communications network in the world. The full rundown on <a href="https://xx.network/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xx-economics-v1.2.pdf">the xx network’s tokenomics can be found here</a>, and we’ve put together a high-level overview of the xx coin below for those of you who are interested in helping build a truly protected digital society.</p>



 What is xx coin? 



<p>xx coin is the native digital currency of the xx network. This secure digital currency can be traded among individuals and institutions and all xx coin wallets are embedded with quantum-secure keys which will protect your assets in the event of a quantum computing breakthrough.</p>



<p>On top of that, xx coin plays an essential role in incentivizing network participation and decentralized governance through xx network’s multifaceted, tokenized reward structure.</p>



 xx Governance &amp; Rewards 



<p>The xx chain uses a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) protocol to secure the network economically. The network’s decentralized governance mechanisms allow every xx coin holder to propose, second, and vote in the referendums that shape the network. These referendums may modify the code of the network, add new features, change economic structures, and control just about every aspect of the platform.</p>



<p>More specifically, the xx network will use nominated staking to incentivize all coin holders to participate in node selection, operation, bonding, and governance. There are four main ways to contribute to the xx network and start earning xx coins:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://xx.network/nodes/">Run an active node</a>: xx coin holders can become an xx network node operator and earn xx coins in exchange for helping secure the network. Prospective validators must stake a minimum of 1,000 xx coins and attract nominations and stakes from the community to be elected. Once elected, every validator is equal, meaning their xx coin staking rewards are not proportional to the validator’s stake, but rather determined by a point-based system that measures each validator’s relative blockchain performance (uptime, block production, etc.). Today, it takes over 100k xx in nominations to become a node on the xx network blockchain.  <a href="https://xxnetwork.wiki/How_to_Nominate">Nominate an active node</a>: xx network users who do not want to become validators can stake their coins and nominate validators in order to vote on governance proposals and nominate nodes in the network. These Nominators earn interest on the tokens they have staked on active nodes every “era” according to an interest rate curve and the specific commission and performance of the node.  <a href="https://xxfoundation.org/archive/xx-foundation-announces-the-xx-dapps-grant-program/">Build an xx app</a>: The xx Foundation has launched a special grant initiative to jumpstart the development and deployment of privacy preserving&nbsp; dApps using the xxDK. The program will award individual grants of up to 1,000,000 xx coins for each successful submission, from an initial pool of 10,000,000 xx coins, and the Elixxir team will also be involved as advisors for every grant project accepted at this stage.  <a href="https://xx.network/welcome/">Grow the xx ecosystem</a>: the xx network’s treasury was created to fund bounties and rewards for ongoing development of the xx ecosystem through activities proposed by the council, the tech committee, or the community at large. <a href="https://discord.gg/Y8pCkbK">Join the xx Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/xxnetwork">Telegram</a> to learn more about new community initiatives and contribute new ideas for how to grow the xx ecosystem.  



<p>xx nodes are essential to the security and core operations of the xx network, and node rewards are composed of a share of the fees paid into the network plus an inflationary reward of newly minted xx coins. That said, we understand that running a full node requires some expertise, time, and money to acquire and maintain the requisite computing hardware and minimum bond amount. That’s why we’ve incorporated node nominations and other reward mechanisms – so every active xx user has the ability to participate in xx network’s governance and development and earn xx coins for their contributions.</p>



 xx coin Ecosystem Usage 



<p>The xx network was founded on the belief that no matter where you are in the world, you should be able to communicate and transact privately without worrying about whether your digital footprint can be viewed or compromised by any external party. That’s why our open-source technology is designed to enable two primary functions: private communications and secure payments, both of which are planned to rely on a mix of free and paid “postage,” the unit that quantifies the amount of computing power and bandwidth required to transmit data privately across the xx network.</p>



  Private communications: Usage of the xx network’s private communication layer is designed to be accessible to anyone with a suitable mobile phone. The system is currently designed to be free to use for xx user accounts who stake or burn a small number of xx coins in order to acquire free postage.&nbsp;  



<p>This allotted free postage is sufficient for most users’ day-to-day messaging needs. However, organizations and independent developers who want to deploy and operate dApps and smart contracts on the xx network will need to pay for additional bandwidth using xx coins. In the future, we will roll out additional mechanisms for acquiring and using free postage in order to benefit regular xx users, but the demand for xx coin will continue to grow as more privacy-minded businesses and builders use the xx network to communicate en masse.</p>



  Secure payments: Every xx coin on the network is held in an account or wallet that is seeded with the strongest type of quantum-secure cryptography known. This ensures that, unlike traditional banking or other cryptocurrencies, not only are your individual coins protected from the rapid development of quantum computers, but just as importantly the infrastructure securing your coins is protected from systemic risk.  



<p>While xx network messaging is currently free to use, the xx community may adopt a postage system in which all xx coin holders would have rate-limited access to the network depending on their needs. As envisioned, all xx accounts would automatically accrue free postage gradually over time to ensure that xx network remains universally accessible. Advanced messaging functionality, enterprise adoption, and integration with other blockchains or dApps will require additional postage gained by purchasing xx coins. The xx network’s unique network architecture is structured in a way that enables every new node to provide additional transaction processing power and relay capacity. This means that as the number of xx nodes increases, both security and performance improve. These scaling characteristics thereby enable a virtuous cycle of growth, in which validator revenue increases as network utilization increases, which then allows the network to onboard and support additional nodes and further increase capacity.</p>



 xx coin Distribution 



<p>One of the xx network’s goals is to broadly distribute coin ownership in order to enhance network security and establish egalitarian incentives across the xx network’s entire privacy-enhancing ecosystem.</p>



<p>1 billion xx coins were created during genesis following the xx network’s mainnet launch on November 16, 2021. Less than 5% of these were immediately put into circulation at genesis, and token distribution was allocated according to the below distribution.</p>



<p>xx coin Distribution</p>



Allocation% SupplyVestingPurposeBetaNet Rewards5%Coins earned have a 1-year lockup from the month they are earnedAllocated to BetaNet node operators and community airdrops. All remaining xx coins will be used to pay nodes running the canary test network.Staking Rewards30%No lockup or vest but are subject to a 28-day unbonding period when unstakedAlgorithmically distributed to stakers in the xx network to incentivize users to stake in the MainNet.&nbsp;Coin Sales30%1-year lockup for coins purchased during BetaNetAllocated for public and private sales. Roughly 12% have already been sold or used to fulfill obligations to early SAFE and options holders, and all remaining coins after the public sale will be re-allocated towards staking rewards (70%) and the Foundation (30%).Team &amp; Partners25%3-year vesting period, 10% of locked coins are stakeable for rewards on the MainNetAllocated to project creators. Many team coins will initially be used to stake members of the BetaNet node community.Foundation10%20% initial vesting period; 3-year vesting for remaining 80%Allocated to grow the xx network ecosystem via partnerships, marketing and promotions, exchange listings and distribution, dApp development and events.



<p>From the start, over 90% of the xx network coin holders voluntarily locked their coins into 6-12 month vesting schedules starting at genesis and are staking those coins for rewards. xx coin will follow a deflationary supply curve for the first 5-6 years it is in circulation, with a small percentage of coins automatically burned at regular intervals in the xx network’s on-chain treasury. Afterwards, the xx network will gradually transition to an inflationary model with a maximum annual coin supply inflation rate of 6.5%, which will be distributed via block rewards to all xx coin holders staking on active nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>xx coin’s inflation rate will follow a curve, starting with higher inflation to support the early network before tapering down to maintain the network. The majority of the inflationary reward is given to the nodes and coin holders and a portion is transferred to the on-chain treasury, which is controlled by xx coin holders.</p>



 xx coin and the Future of Privacy 



<p><a href="https://xx.network/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xx-economics-v1.2.pdf">xx network’s economic model</a> is designed to accelerate the inherent utility of a scalable, quantum-secure coin and leverage the growth and versatility of the platform’s native private messaging functionalities. In that respect, we believe the xx coin is essential to the future of online privacy.</p>



<p>We believe that your financial life and activity should be enriched and not threatened by technology, and our entire privacy-enhancing ecosystem is underpinned by xx coin, in terms of both on-chain governance and dApp development and usage. The positive flywheel effects made possible through the xx network’s quantum-resistant, stake-based consensus protocols enable the user growth and scale required to create a truly global, truly decentralized community of users.</p>

         New Economies, New Stories                 <p>By Allison Keeley</p><p>Photography: WENDY HUYNH</p><p>Published July 28, 2022</p>            <p>How Trevor McFedries is creating new incentives for creatives</p>       



 
 
   
<p>Trevor McFedries’ ’89 light-blue BMW was a mess. Standing at a garage in the West Adams neighborhood of Los Angeles, he was waiting for an update on repairs he knew he couldn’t afford when his phone buzzed. His heart leaped. It was 2017, and this call could change his life. McFedries was almost broke. He’d run through his savings while pitching his big idea to 60 investors who’d gone cold, and one who’d given him a few hundred thousand dollars, which was quickly disappearing into keeping his big idea alive. The caller was Stephanie Zhan, a partner at Sequoia Capital. McFedries hurried into the parking lot away from the shop noise and he started talking.</p>



<p>He told Zhan that he wanted to explode out the opportunities for art and culture to be monetized, changing everything about how creative work is done and who is compensated—from the incentives to create, to the mechanisms for making art, to the distribution of wealth. He would start with his own company, Brud, which he envisioned as a more modern Marvel, where stories are shaped and told by communities empowered to co-produce content and share in the profit, all built on a new version of the web. McFedries told her he based Brud’s first project on his years working as a producer and DJ, collaborating with stars like Katy Perry and Steve Aoki and working at Spotify and JJ Abrams’ production company, Bad Robot: Brud would reinvent celebrity. Not to replace McFedries’ famous friends entirely, but to build a more egalitarian system alongside them.</p>



<p>He already had a solid proof-of-concept for how to do this, he told Zhan. He’d designed a character named Lil’ Miquela, or Miquela Sousa, a 19 year-old creative based in Downey, California, that Brud launched on Instagram in 2016. Her account followed a proven influencer formula: candid selfies of her eating ice cream and going to the movies, and confessional videos talking about falling in love or venting about the challenges of making music. At the time of the parking lot call, it was not totally clear to fans that Lil’ Miquela was CGI. Lil’ Miquela was a modest, mysterious Instagram presence with a sprinkle of freckles and notably full lips. Zhan had heard about her as a low-key phenomenon: Was she real? Was she fake? Did it matter? And why were her bangs such an awkward length?</p>



<p>Awkward was the point, explained McFedries. Lil’ Miquela had been designed anticipating a new kind of relationship between celebrities and the public, one in which a celebrity is aspirational, but the artifice is clear. The bangs are both a signifier of authenticity, like magazine spreads reading, “Stars: They’re Just Like Us,” as well as somehow too perfect and air-brushed. Her ethnically ambiguous look was intended to resonate with a diverse generation that expects to see itself reflected in culture like no previous one. “I knew from the beginning that Trevor was special—he had a deep understanding of consumer psychology and an instinct for creating pop culture,” Zhan says. “He was often ahead of the game, and always had a sense for what was next.”</p>


 Lil’ Miquela 2022 


<p></p>



<p>What was next, according to McFedries, was actually going to be two innovations. The first was this new kind of celebrity. McFedries saw, and still sees, some celebrities as auteurs, with powerful new ideas, but he also sees many celebrities as the center of an ecosystem in which the real value comes from the edges: songwriters, designers and writers. But celebrities, and the companies they work with, keep most of the value. If you replaced the middleman celebrity with a virtual celebrity, McFedries imagined, you could distribute value to the people on the edges. By 2016, he knew the technology to create a believable, relatable avatar like Lil’ Miquela existed, and he sensed that consumers would be willing to interact with her. From the manufactured stars of his childhood—he cites the cartoons Alvin and the Chipmunks and Jem and the Holograms, and the human duo Milli Vanilli—McFedries saw that people could love an illustration or a band with a fake backstory. And now that interactions with “real” celebrities were almost exclusively through phone screens—perfect for an avatar—he saw that technology and consumer psychology had converged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second innovation was a new kind of process. McFedries was into cryptocurrency by 2013 and felt like its ability to assign value to new kinds of products, services and transactions made it uniquely suited for his ultimate goal: To distribute wealth to people on the edges. He figured the how of it all would be worked out as he went, but McFedries had a vision for digital goods running on a blockchain that could allow this virtual celebrity, or any piece of creative work, to be made by a collective working collaboratively as part of an organization across platforms and benefiting directly from the content’s sales or licensing. McFedries’ vision was more opportunity and wealth for the armies of creatives who currently make a fraction of the wealth that a movie, album, TV show or celebrity generates. “I’m really concerned with building better futures for innovators and creative people,” McFedries says. He bet that those improved futures would be built atop virtual economies. He felt that the economies themselves were inevitable—digital tokens were already being accepted as money—and became obsessed with making sure these new economies would not incentivize the same dynamics of traditional economies. He wanted to shift value to the edges of creative communities, even if he wasn’t yet totally sure how that would happen. “There are so many talented people that don’t have a shot,” McFedries says, “so I think about it every day.” Zhan could see the trajectory from Lil’ Miquela to Marvel, but more so, she said she trusted McFedries to create something that could appeal to many.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And she was right to. Today, Lil’ Miquela, who McFedries created alone before joining with collaborator Sara Decou, has 3 million Instagram followers. She is repped by the Hollywood agency CAA, appearing as a CGI avatar in a Calvin Klein video kissing Bella Hadid, modeling for Prada on her Instagram, and releasing singles on Spotify with millions of streams. Sequoia came in as an early investor, backing Brud in 2018, the same year Lil’ Miquela was named one of Time magazine’s most influential people on the internet. By 2021, Brud was valued at $125 million before it was acquired by blockchain game designers Dapper Labs. Today, Lil’ Miquela is one of many avatars creating a new ecosystem of content. But for McFedries, she was his first crucial step toward the new creative economy that he’s building now.</p>

<p>As a skateboarding, X-Men-loving Black kid growing up in Davenport, Iowa, McFedries said he was both a “techno-optimist” and “socio-anarchist.” Davenport is a port town on the Mississippi River; McFedries’ grandfather drove a tugboat and his other grandparents were auctioneers. His mother had tried to make it in Los Angeles as a model and actress, but after McFedries was born, she and his dad split up and she returned home to the Midwest with her 1-year-old. A single mom, she worked in factories for years before studying nursing at community college and later working as a nurse. McFedries remembers how Davenport was so completely defined by its economy—even down to its smell. “Often at night in the summer, you would just smell rotting pigs in the sewers,” he remembers, a result of runoff from the Oscar Mayer plant. That was oddly coupled with the pleasant, familiar smell of the Wonder Bread factory that he would pick up on cross-town drives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McFedries loved Davenport. He started coding as a hobby and helped his grandparents auction items on eBay, but he had to go to Iowa City to find his scene at a record store. He knew the world was so much bigger outside Davenport, and he wanted to be part of it. Through pop culture—the movie “Hackers,” the WIRED writing of Kevin Kelly—McFedries immersed himself in the nascent internet culture of the ’90s: information wanted to be free, technology could change the world for the better. He was also drawn to more anti-capitalist ideas, listening to a lot of Rage Against the Machine and hardcore punk. He was listening to bands that emphasized overthrowing systems and empowering the poor, “literally eco-terrorists were like playing punk rock about tearing it all down,” he says. Then, in 2002, in the middle of high school, his mother suggested he move to Los Angeles to live with his father. He was a talented athlete, and she said he’d have more opportunities to play sports in college if he moved to a big city. “It was always clear that Davenport wasn’t the center of what’s happening,” says McFedries. “I think I wanted to participate in that center, but I think the only vehicle for me to understand how to do that as a young person was through athletics.” So, at 16, he started making friends and playing football at Beverly Hills High School.</p>



<p>His new friends invited him to their homes, and suddenly he found himself sitting on the couches of the West Coast elite. Some of his friends’ parents were helming massive companies shaping American fashion and culture. He says at first, “there was still this kind of idea that these titans of industry surely must have a skill set that you didn’t.” But, listening to them tell stories, McFedries realized the key to getting paid to be creative was capital, not skills. He saw that they already had money to cushion them by the time they took creative risks. “And so I was like, okay, I need capital,” he says, “and I need the opportunity to take those kinds of risks. I feel like I’m as capable as they are.”</p>



<p>After high school, he received a football scholarship to San José State and began studying software engineering, but he dropped out to move back to Los Angeles and build a reputation—social capital— that he could leverage for actual capital. Like many L.A. strivers before him, McFedries wanted to be seen as a man who had vision, who could forecast a trend or choose the right music or art before, or better than, anyone else. And he could. He DJed Katy Perry concerts and the entire 2008 Warped Tour. That same year he put out a top 10 album as a member of the group Shwayze. He worked in A&amp;R for Photo Finish Records and directed music videos for Steve Aoki and NERVO. He hosted an iHeartRadio show for Dim Mak Records and became a spokesman for VitaminWater. He worked with singers BANKS and Ke$ha. He was an artist advocate at Spotify and an entrepreneur-in-residence at Bad Robot. As McFedries closed in on 30, he decided he’d generated enough social capital to start trading on it. At the same time, he’d developed a new understanding of celebrity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Celebrities are “a team sport,” he says, but only players connected to the biggest names win. The limited opportunity for financial success in creative industries broadly disincentivizes people from joining creative fields, McFedries says. If only a tiny segment of poets, artists or fashion designers can make a living, why try? Why create, especially without a cushion of capital to fall back on? McFedries says flourishing in a creative field is about where you live, and who you know. McFedries can name friends who might’ve been great art directors but, without a path to opportunity, they ended up hanging drywall in Iowa. He can think of bands that might’ve been on par with Red Hot Chili Peppers, but without the social capital of Southern California to propel them, they stalled in Davenport. McFedries doesn’t just see this as a problem for artists; he sees it as a problem for American culture writ large.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This idea of capitalizing on talent, this idea that, as a nation, we should be identifying people who are talented and maximizing their skillset, obviously is one that we fall short of where we should be in the United States.” Without incentives to create, “there are no new ideas,” he says, no new stories from new kinds of people with new perspectives. Instead, old ideas are repackaged, retold and resold by those who own the rights, with the same traditional narratives and limited cast of characters. “All I’m thinking about all day is how to create better incentives for creative people,” McFedries says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rihanna or Ariana Grande, or whoever they are,” he explains, are “effectively the vehicles for a lot of creative people, whether it’s choreographers or songwriters or producers.” He figured if you could create a digital vehicle, and have it collectively owned by its creators, “there actually would be more margin for creative people and for the business itself.” He envisioned a future of virtual stars who speak any language, with stories and styles built not around the tastes of a few industry executives, but curated by countless creative people, all with a financial and artistic stake in the virtual celebrity. “You could create these celebrities that could create a ton of value,” McFedries says. So he founded Brud in 2014 to prove that avatars could connect with fans and drive value for collaborators.</p>



<p>And it worked. By April 2018, Lil’ Miquela had almost a million followers, enough to beget brand sponsorships and account monetization. She’d shown that, unlike one celebrity who only needs so many makeup artists or choreographers, Lil’ Miquela could do endless work on any number of platforms, creating exponential opportunities for people to work on projects featuring her. McFedries started to expand his team, and in 2018, he invited Nicole de Ayora on board as director of operations. The two bonded over having grown up in small towns and how that shaped their understanding of the internet. “We both really relied on the internet as a way of connecting with people outside of our small communities,” says Nicole. “It was a way of escaping a lot of what we were experiencing at a young age.” She was eager to join McFedries and his small team, now working to grow Lil’ Miquela so the avatar could do more than work with brands and post compelling selfies. The team at Brud wanted her to be able to tell meaningful stories to more people around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brud filled its offices with photographers, writers and CGI artists, and Lil’ Miquela’s online identity grew more elaborate, with new friends and more complex stories. At the same time, she was bumping up against the limits of her world—the platforms on which she was interacting with her fans. The influence of algorithms was becoming more obvious to consumers, hemming in people’s experiences by choosing what they would see, as opposed to people just seeing what popped up in a chronological timeline, or via their own curiosities. McFedries saw this as creating distance between creators and fans. The platforms themselves were increasingly seen as the new economy’s new middlemen, shilling ads, collecting data and soaking up profits. There was pushback against these practices, in the form of laws focused on protecting consumers’ data. In 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation law went into effect in the E.U. and in 2020 California followed suit with its own Consumer Privacy Act. McFedries and de Ayora were looking for a solution that let fans connect and participate more directly. They imagined a future where contributors and fans owned Lil’ Miquela and her projects outright, as a collective, where a limitless amount of creative work could be done across the world, simultaneously and collaboratively. He needed an online cooperative system, not a company, one that could serve thousands of people making all kinds of contributions.</p>



<p>He knew there was a work model for this, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO. A DAO is a collective that uses cryptocurrency tokens to vote on how to run itself, from putting value on anything created or contributed, to deciding how any profits are distributed. Today, there are thousands of DAOs, some controlling up to billions of dollars in assets, focused on topics including sports gaming, cryptocurrency and governance. The DAOs could solve these collaboration and ownership needs. But as he’s wont to do, McFedries had an even bigger idea. He wanted to enable people to be paid for work typically seen as intangible or non-monetizable. He wanted people to get paid for things like being fun at a party, offering a suggestion on a photo shoot or encouraging a friend with a smart insight.</p>



<p>To bring these ideas together and test them, McFedries co-founded the Friends With Benefits DAO in 2020. He wanted to see if, by inviting the right people to make the right vibes and creative projects, many more people than the DAO could accommodate would want to join, thus driving up the value of the tokens and giving those vibes a tangible worth. “Having a point of view is hard to measure,” says McFedries, “and should be valued. And we should create economic systems that value those things, because otherwise, we’re just perpetuating the same structures of the past.” McFedries has compared a DAO to a Facebook community where the people posting content, those responsible for making the platform interesting and attractive to more people, also share in the value those posts create—rather than that value accruing to a central corporate entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To flourish financially, the DAO must flourish creatively. McFedries knows creative work is most likely to surface in spaces where people have real relationships and feel supported to try new things. He is working to foster trust and engagement by setting up community principles, organizing people around potential creative projects, with chapters in London, New York and Los Angeles. Today Friends With Benefits has a waitlist and about 6,000 active members, including musicians Erykah Badu and Azealia Banks, as well as lawyers and software engineers. So far, they’ve collaborated to make real-world art and digital art in the form of NFTs. They’ve started a fellowship program for creatives from underrepresented communities, which will offset the entrance free of more than $3,000, and they’re discussing launching a beverage businesses, writing essays on the history of decentralized “benevolent anarchic” organizations (like Alcoholics Anonymous) and forming friendships, all value that McFedries says is being captured in the DAO’s token.&nbsp;</p>


 Trevor McFedries stands against whitewash in Paris. 


<p><br>But even as Friends With Benefits proves his value-to-vibes idea, building new things is always going to get messy, McFedries admits. In 2021, the service that hosted the Friends With Benefits cryptocurrency token was hacked and the token lost 99 percent of its value, essentially making the collective worthless. But the members regrouped, issued a new token and today its price is $11.80, down from a high of just over $186. That, coupled with how Friends With Benefits has been labeled “<a href="https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/trash-electricity-cryptocurrency-backyard-restaurant/friends-with-benefits-tokens">the digital Soho House</a>,” means it’s under pressure to live up to the hype. If it doesn’t create notable work, or it’s not fun, the tokens will lose their worth and the DAO becomes just another Discord chat with some meetups. But living near this edge, where value is being assigned to new things in new ways, some of which are still being tested, doesn’t faze McFedries. After reading “Debt: The First 5,000 Years of Money” by the late anarchist anthropologist David Graeber, he found himself asking, “like what the fuck is value?” and he followed that destabilizing thought to a liberating conclusion: It’s whatever we collectively decide it is. “One of the reasons that I love crypto, or an internet of value, is that we have really antiquated vehicles for representing value,” he says. He believes crypto enables better instruments for assigning value to all things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web3 proponents are sometimes dismissed as wanting to decentralize the web just enough to get some of the power that corporations and celebrities now have for themselves. For example, some people dismiss Lil’ Miquela as just another spokesmodel, and Brud as manipulative of her fans. But with Dapper Labs’ purchase of Brud, McFedries has a mandate to figure this out and help build the tools and habits to make DAOs mainstream enough to realize their promise. He’s the CEO of the new Dapper Collectives. A near-term order of business is handing Lil’ Miquela over to her fans. McFedries and his team are turning Brud the company into Brud the DAO, which he says is scheduled to open to the public at the end of August. Lil’ Miquela will be at its center. Brud will ask members to help write her storylines and contribute to her computer-generated design and 3D artwork. Fans, now collective members, will receive writing and design credits tracked through on-chain resumes. There will be incentives for DAO members to share content to be sold, and then all token-holders will get a cut. As de Ayora, now CPO of Dapper Collectives, puts it, “At the end of the day, we created Lil’ Miquela but they gave her value and meaning.”</p>



<p>For the next while, McFedries cautions, things will look much as they do now, with platforms like TikTok or Instagram capturing a lot of the value of the DAO’s creative work. But if DAOs and other components of Web3 take off, “there will be virtual goods and economies that would be bigger than (people) could ever dream of…we’re starting to cross that chasm now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this is taking McFedries, and maybe the rest of us, toward his biggest goals: sustainable financial futures for creative people and connecting everyday people, like the ones he grew up with in Davenport, with the kinds of opportunity he saw when he moved to Beverly Hills. “If you can…reach out across the divide, and give them the opportunities and the language…, we can have this improved capitalization of talent,” he says.</p>



<p>There are success stories in these new budding economies: an FWB artist went from being broke to buying a house during the pandemic. A writer sold an NFT of his essay for about $150,000. Outside FWB, artists have found that DAOs have kept them in the creative game longer than they’d imagined possible. McFedries knows this is just the start of something, a potential alternative to the systems that he sees countless people trapped in. He also knows it’s an urgently needed alternative. He thinks constantly about all the people who never earn the real value of the work they do. All the people who can’t afford to take the big risks his high school friends’ parents did, or who never left Davenport and instead watched its factories close. He knows he got lucky when he moved to L.A., to the center of a scene he fit into and shaped—and that most people never get that chance. Ask him how often he’s hit with the realization that his friends back in Davenport might’ve been just as successful as the creators he knows in L.A. and he doesn’t hesitate: “It really happens every day,” he says. “And that’s why I want to make big things.”</p>

<p>As we mentioned in our <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">last blog post</a> regarding release 5.1.0, the Zcash network is processing a significantly increased number of shielded transactions. The network remains stable and secure, transactions are being processed normally, and we are making additional performance improvements to both the <code>zcashd</code> wallet and full node as part of release 5.2.0.</p>



<p>We also have a cross-functional team working on performance improvements to our mobile wallet SDKs. Upcoming releases will focus on performance improvements in the SDK, which should translate to improved performance of third-party mobile wallets.</p>



 Node performance improvements 



<p>Transactions are fully checked by nodes when they are received on the network, whether they appear first in the mempool or in a block. However, some of these checks are expensive, so it’s best to perform them once and cache the results. If the checks are successful, they are not performed again.</p>



<p>As of this release, Sapling and Orchard zk-SNARK proofs are now leveraging this caching mechanism to avoid redundant verification costs and reduce block-verification time. This speeds up block propagation on the network (as this release is adopted by users) and improves the performance of nodes which produce block templates for miners.</p>



<p>In addition, this release backports more efficient caching and SHA256 implementations from upstream Bitcoin.</p>



 Wallet performance improvements 



<p>The wallet now performs trial decryption of Sapling outputs in batches and parallelizes these batches to improve scanning performance.</p>



<p>In addition, some inefficiencies in the <code>zcashd</code> wallet were identified and fixed in this release.</p>



 RPC interface changes 



<p>This release adds a version field to the <code>gettransaction</code> RPC call so that users do not need to make an extra <code>getrawtransaction</code> call just to receive the version of a transaction.</p>



<p>The<a href="https://z.cash/support/schedule/"> Zcash Schedule page</a> will be updated to reflect the 5.2.0 release.</p>

<p></p><p>In order to reach its long-term goal of becoming a universal currency, bitcoin needs to acquire two qualities that are essential to every form of sound money: privacy and fungibility. In the case of privacy, it’s important that the identities of the BTC transaction sender and receiver remain unknown to every unwanted third party. For fungibility, every bitcoin amount needs to have the same degree of acceptance for payments, regardless of the money’s origins. In other words, we need to make this global digital currency work just like physical cash.</p><p>This article will explain the current asymmetry between privacy and fungibility, while also introducing the ways in which the new Wasabi 2.0 wallet can bridge the two worlds. The problem: privacy vs fungibility.</p><p>Given the open ledger architecture of the Bitcoin network, watching all transactions is one of the features which guarantees the integrity of the financial policy. Seeing the amount getting sent in every transaction reassures every node that nobody breaks the rules by introducing unwanted inflation into the monetary system. And in some cases, revealing the identity behind an address creates an extra level of trust – as is the case of big exchanges, investment funds, charity foundations and fundraisers. Yet the issue is that every time &nbsp;the identity of an active address is revealed, everyone else’s privacy gets damaged. This is why obfuscation mechanisms are required.</p><p>CoinJoins are a great way to increase the privacy of bitcoin senders, as they break the link between the current owner and the previous transactions. However, this obfuscation technique is observable on the public blockchain, almost always finds itself in a numeric minority as compared to other transactions and can therefore create fungibility issues.</p><p>In a perfect world, privacy should improve fungibility. But if there are only a few privacy users, then they can get rejected by other participants. In order for privacy to create fungibility, a certain tipping point needs to be reached: bitcoiners must mix their coins in an overwhelming majority and thus successfully obliterate any claim that using privacy hides criminal actions. Similarly, Bitcoin at large has managed to break away from its Silk Road reputation by onboarding more users with no criminal record, who transact in good faith in a completely legal way.</p><p>Another side of the debate concerns the fact that fungibility is a pretty utopian concept for technical, practical and economic reasons. Technically, not all bitcoins are created equal: they carry different cryptographic hashes, get added to the supply by different competing miners and change hands in different patterns that may please some users while displeasing others. Practically every Bitcoin node has its own blacklist and every miner can choose to not include transactions that come from unwanted addresses. Bitcoin enables censorship by design and it’s only through incentives and social norms that fungibility can work.</p><p>But then again, cash also gets tainted by every user’s fingerprints and may get censored according to serial numbers. Yet it’s thanks to everyone’s agreement that a one - dollar bill is equal with every other one - dollar bill &nbsp;regardless of its origins that we have economic fungibility and privacy is one of the socially-accepted benefits.</p><p>Last but not least, there’s the economic dimension of BTC fungibility. There are two extremes involved in this debate: the users of non-custodial wallets and the regulated custodians (exchanges, banks, and mutual funds). If all the coins get withdrawn from custodians, then there won’t be any government-controlled entities to undergo financial censorship – and therefore bitcoin becomes fungible within the technical and practical limits described above. On the other hand, the coins can also become fungible is the custodians get their hands on every unit – ironically, centralized KYC exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase are actually pretty good mixers which also grant the funds a fairly certain degree of fungibility. But fungibility must not come at the expense of turning bitcoin into an Orwellian money system, in which custodians have absolute control.</p><p>The bad news is that the amount of bitcoins deposited on exchanges has been constantly high for the last 5 years. These exchanges have become increasingly draconian in terms of rejecting specific transactions, and established policies against transaction privacy even in the absence of clear regulatory frameworks. The good news is that there is balance between the custodially-owned and the sovereign bitcoins and the amount of coins on exchanges doesn’t seem to increase too greatly. But since none of the ownership extremes is winning and we want a situation in which privacy generates fungibility, we need to start building bridges. In this design, we must consider the properties of cash and build both the tools and the social norms which help us always agree that every bitcoin unit is equal to any other one. Wasabi 2.0 marks a promising beginning in this direction. </p> Bridging Bitcoins with Wasabi 2.0 <p>Launched in 2018 on the 10th anniversary of the Bitcoin White Paper, Wasabi 1.0 has proven to every privacy enthusiast that BTC is the only currency that they should be using. The combined power of the non custodial experience, the automatic routing of the internet connection via Tor, the sovereign setup which puts users in control of their public key without having to trust a third party and the easy CoinJoins still makes blockchain analysts scratch their heads in an attempt to make guesses. Furthermore, users can also access their hardware wallets in Wasabi – thus granting them a greater amount of privacy than most of the native applications. Nonetheless, the design of Wasabi 1.0 isn’t perfect. Users can still make privacy-damaging mistakes such as reusing addresses or combining private UTXOs with tracked ones for disastrous outcomes that reveal a lot of information. Another big mistake is also that of recombining UTXOs after a CoinJoin – it basically defeats the purpose as the previous state of the coins gets reconstructed and a careful analyst will simply bypass the CoinJoin part to keep on following the money. Then there are the deterring reasons which have &nbsp;kept users away from Wasabi. The biggest one being the minimum amount to CoinJoin: back in late 2018, 0.1 BTC was approximately $400; but at the new all-time high of $69k, one tenth of a bitcoin was equivalent to $6900.</p><p>Many users didn’t CoinJoin with Wasabi specifically because they could not afford to but thanks to the WabiSabi protocol that’s embedded in version 2.0, smaller amounts are welcome to get mixed with the bigger ones coming from whales. Also, there’s the privacy FUD which made bitcoiners fear the idea of mixing. It’s exactly the “your BTC might get dirtier” argument that influencers such as Trace Mayer have been pushing for years. The idea behind CoinJoins is to make every monetary unit just as clean and just as dirty – and therefore fungible. Wasabi 2.0 definitely makes it easier for every user to CoinJoin, thanks to the auto-pilot experience which automatically makes the best decisions for your privacy. The software is open source and you’re strongly encouraged to verify it, so every ounce of trust gets replaced by the certainty of good faith.</p><p>Last but not least, the issue of zkSNACKs' censorship-friendly CoinJoin coordinator needs to be addressed. This is where everyone must understand the difference between the free open source software and the company behind it. Wasabi 2.0 is a non-custodial privacy wallet which doesn’t know who you are and empowers any individual or organization to run their own coordinator. If the default coordinator must abide by certain rules that don’t please certain privacy advocates, it doesn’t mean that these privacy advocates can’t tailor the software to suit their needs. As a matter of fact, having multiple coordinators for CoinJoins is largely beneficial for bitcoin privacy.</p><p>To zkSNACKs, the main priority is to be able to incentivize the 80+ developers and code contributors to keep on working towards building the best privacy wallet technology. Everyone is free to use Wasabi 2.0 however they please, there are certainly use cases that a registered company can’t support or endorse, and this is why you can switch the CoinJoin coordinator without needing to fork the code or make any other modifications. The bootstrapping of alternative Wasabi 2.0 CoinJoin coordination servers is instantaneous and easy.</p><p>As a side effect of the blacklisting of certain UTXOs that are associated with criminal activities, the fungibility of the mixes might get boosted. Previously, exchanges and other regulated businesses would flag incoming transactions whose immediate history is associated with CoinJoin rounds specifically because they needed to verify that the money doesn’t come from illegal activities. Now that the ZK Snacks coordinator will automatically decline UTXOs that exchanges don’t like, the exchanges themselves will have no excuse to reject any CoinJoins from this coordinator. This means that the CoinJoins will have the potential to go mainstream and help users transferring BTC from Coinbase to Kraken without informing the two entities about the ways in which some of the money might have been previously spent.</p><p>Wasabi 2.0 is a bridge for three reasons: it makes privacy easier, more affordable, and more acceptable. Anyone will be able to use the wallet correctly without making rookie consolidation mistakes that ruin the CoinJoin effort. Everyone will be able to use the open-source software with the CoinJoin coordinator that they like the most and poses the smallest amount of compromises. And thanks to a &nbsp;less popular move, exchanges will have no valid reasons to reject or even flag CoinJoin transactions.</p><p>Wasabi 2.0 bridges regulated institutions and cypherpunks. It bridges privacy advocates with the software that they’re going to want to use to coordinate their own mixes. And ultimately, it bridges privacy and fungibility.

<p>As cryptocurrencies opened the door for a new generation of users of financial products, we’re witnessing the increasing extent of regulations that are gradually coming into play. On one hand, the crypto ecosystem and participants see KYC/AML practices as a threat to privacy, data security, and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a>. Meanwhile, regulators are more concerned with terrorism financing and other activities that involve money laundering.</p><p>Regulatory compliance is an everyday discussion for those working in crypto and the traditional financial sector. As the rate of financial crimes <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/04/05/2416357/0/en/Feedzai-s-Financial-Crime-Report-233-Increase-in-Online-Fraud-Attack-Rates.html">continues to rise</a> and financial systems progressively digitalize, governments are trying to eradicate money laundering, terrorism financing and prevent financial breaches.</p><p>In this article, we will make a case for and against the concept of two of the most well-known regulatory practices, KYC and AML, and explore innovations that restore the public's trust in regulation and achieve compliance without sacrificing users’ right to privacy.</p> What are KYC/AML practices? <p>KYC and AML practices are standard regulatory policies guiding the operations of financial institutions. They are part of the laid-down rules for businesses that offer financial services to the public within a particular geographical area, e.g., cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>KYC and AML are terms often used interchangeably, yet they do not share the same meaning. KYC is only one of the several steps that financial institutions and businesses in general take to comply with AML regulations.</p><p>KYC, short for Know-Your-Customer, refers to the checks and steps that a business conducts/takes to know who their customers are, confirm their identities, and understand the risk that each customer poses to the business. Usually, the first phase of KYC procedures requires collecting customer information, followed by customer due diligence, which involves identity verification, watchlist screening, and risk assessment. For high-risk customers or high-value transactions, KYC via enhanced due diligence policies comes into play.</p><p>AML, short for Anti-Money-Laundering, is the wider set of steps that financial institutions and businesses take to prevent bad actors from moving their illicit gains. Principally, AML regulations hinder global criminal activities like terrorist financing and block the movement of funds owned by drug rings, human traffickers, and other criminals. Typical AML programs involve transaction monitoring, Know-Your-Customer practices, identifying and reporting suspicious transactions to regulators, record keeping and auditing, etc.</p> Why are crypto believers often against KYC/AML? <p>KYC and AML practices are common in crypto, with centralized exchanges readily adopting them to comply with global financial regulations. It is not unusual for big exchanges like Coinbase or Binance to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/12/so-many-locked-out-binance-users-say-their-accounts-have-been-frozen-for-months/">suspend accounts</a> and pause withdrawals for some users due to suspicious account activity under the pretense of complying with these regulations.</p><p>These measures, as well as the large amounts of data users need to provide to comply, as well as data breaches in the space, have raised concerns in the crypto space, where user privacy and decentralization are founding concepts and seen as the highest standards. However, critics have a hard time explaining how else bad actors could be discouraged from 'cleaning' illicit money through cryptocurrencies.</p> Arguments for &amp; against KYC/AML <p>As the popular saying goes, every coin has two sides. The common KYC/AML practices solve many regulatory and compliance issues for financial institutions but create problems with data laws, data security, and privacy.</p> In favor of KYC/AML  Regulation <p>Money laundering and other financial crimes usually have to go through banks, and one way to prevent or combat these crimes is to regulate the money flowing through institutions. Without KYC/AML, bad actors would have a field day when moving proceeds from illegal businesses. Because of this, most jurisdictions frown at platforms that require no identity disclosure.</p> Compliance <p>As regulators in the financial sector and governments seek to combat financial crime, terrorism financing, and the movement of illicit money, they hold banks and exchanges responsible for their customers' actions. When a financial institution partners with individuals or organizations without being fully aware of their past and present business dealings, it leaves them prone to being hit by lawsuits and fines. Between 2008 and 2018, financial institutions have had to pay over $25 billion in <a href="https://go.fenergo.com/global-regulatory-fines-2018.html">penalties</a> due to KYC/AML violations and other slipups related to global sanctions.</p><p>No business has the ultimate goal of losing money to such avoidable incidents; hence, the strict implementation of KYC/AML. If only for their own benefit, institutions try to remain compliant with financial laws. In this sense, you could say that incentives are set in place for marketplaces, banks, and crypto exchanges to stay on top of the activity going on within them.</p> Against KYC/AML  Privacy <p>Most of the benefits of effective KYC and AML practices go to the businesses enforcing them, while users are left with several doubts and questions. Today, many see KYC and AML requirements as data harvesting endeavors, with concerns over data safety, security, and usage growing. Many believe that in providing personal information to pass KYC verification exercises, users give away their privacy rights.</p><p>Once too often data breaches from these platforms have ended up in the hands of malicious actors. Users’ sensitive data getting <a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/biggest-data-breaches">hacked</a> or leaked from big organizations has become almost a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/data-breaches-are-almost-the-norm-for-many-businesses-these-days">norm lately</a>. Because of this, many have genuine concerns regarding data protection and questions about the rationale of KYC practices.</p><p>In the crypto space, pseudonymity is precious, but most big exchanges require customers to fulfill KYC verification to access their services or increase their capabilities. Most users also believe these businesses leverage their personal information in untoward ways, such as to sell them to advertisers.</p> Data Security <p>As we have seen above, data breaches are fairly common. This worries more than one user, as criminals can access sensitive information like credit card details or addresses by hacking into financial institutions' databases. </p>The top 50 biggest data breaches from 2004 to 2021. (<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/visualizing-the-50-biggest-data-breaches-from-2004-2021/">Source</a>)<p>Since KYC/AML practices require users to provide sensitive information to third parties, individuals are worried over companies' ability to keep their data safe and away from the reach of fraudsters. It’s worth noting that data is often not just reviewed once and then discarded, but goes on to form part of data bases forever.</p> Data Laws <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>) law came into force in 2018, forcing regulated institutions to review their operations regarding customer data. <br></p><p>On the surface, the GDPR appears to contradict KYC/AML practices. Yet, the regulation only insists on the right ways to collect, use, and secure customer data, in which some KYC/AML procedures fail the compliance test. In other words, these procedures often do not store and handle user data following legal specifications.</p>Scope of GDPR. (<a href="https://www.onelogin.com/compliance/gdpr">Source</a>)<p>The seven principles of the GDPR are as follows:</p>  Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.  Purpose limitation.  Data minimization.  Accuracy.  Storage limitation.  Integrity and confidentiality (security).  Accountability.  <p>KYC and AML practices depend on data sharing, especially between companies and third parties, e.g., foreign entities. Also, some businesses outsource their KYC procedures. </p><p>Data sharing and KYC outsourcing directly contradict the GDPR, which only permits data transfers for important reasons of public interest. Some institutions alo hold customer information for unspecified periods after their partnerships have ended, directly contradicting the storage limitation principle of the GDPR.</p> ZK proofs &amp; decentralized identifiers: The future of KYC/AML <p>As the concepts of KYC/AML practices and privacy concerns continue to be debated, organizations are beginning to devise new methods to remain compliant with KYC, AML and GDPR laws. Companies have begun to deploy innovations like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> and secure multi-party computation to enhance customer privacy and allow access to the information needed for KYC and AML procedures.</p><p>The crypto space, however, continues to be skeptical about these new methods, as they fail to give users control over their digital identity. Instead of them, other more decentralized options are under development, some of which can allow users to gain more control over their data.</p><p>For example, self-sovereign identity on the blockchain has been endlessly quoted as &nbsp;“the future of digital identification”. Other cryptographic innovations like <a href="https://hackernoon.com/eli5-zero-knowledge-proof-78a276db9eff">zero-knowledge proofs</a> (ZK Proofs) and <a href="https://tykn.tech/decentralized-identifiers-dids/">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) also lead the way in the race to replace traditional KYC/AML procedures.</p> How ZK Proofs will replace KYC/AML <p>Popular for its successful implementation in creating privacy on the blockchain, the concept of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) is a proven way of confirming a transaction/ownership without revealing sensitive information about its underlying data. Identity solutions based on this, such as Polygon’s <a href="https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-polygon-id-zero-knowledge-own-your-identity-for-web3/">Polygon ID</a>, utilize ZKPs.</p><p>ZKP-based KYC solutions are superior to their traditional counterparts in that traditional KYC solutions require users to share their information across several platforms repeatedly. With ZKPs, users can present all needed documents to a trusted KYC provider to verify their identities and issue a ZKP. This proof can then be used for subsequent KYC verification exercises without sharing the information therein.</p>Proving a true statement without revealing the data by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. (<a href="https://anteelo.com/zero-knowledge-proof-its-role-in-the-blockchain-world/">Source</a>)<p>ZK Proofs are on-chain activities, and blockchain ledgers are immutable, which implies that whatever information the zero-knowledge proof holds is true and has remained unchanged since its verification. Trust is restored between KYC providers, businesses, and the end-users, and individuals can remain in full control of their data. </p><p>ZKPs also allow for selective disclosures: in special circumstances only, and with users' consent, a KYC provider may disclose users' information to a trusted third party like law enforcement agencies. For example, <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Panther Protocol</a> enables users to leverage features such as Panther <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol/protocol/panthers-core-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals">Reveals</a> which generate zero-knowledge reports to voluntarily disclose compliance with select counterparties.</p> How Decentralized Identifiers can replace KYC/AML <p>A decentralized identifier, DID, refers to a cryptographically verifiable framework that consists of information (documents, certificates, and other personally identifiable information) unique to an individual or organization. With a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/03/05/decentralized-identity-using-blockchain/">DID</a>, users can store identifiers like government-issued identity documents, etc., in a private wallet built on a public blockchain.</p><p>Traditional KYC practices require users to submit information which in turn is verified by a centralized registration authority. Decentralized identifiers do a similar job, with the difference that the user can control how much information they give out. Entities can then verify the information provided via a blockchain-based ledger to determine its authenticity.</p>The standard elements of a DID doc. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier">Source</a>)<p>With DIDs, users can prove they are above a certain age limit, for instance, without disclosing their exact date of birth. Since users can create identifiers using trusted systems on the blockchain, private data exchange between individuals and businesses is possible. Thanks to this, traditional KYC/AML practices can give way to a more practical framework, where businesses can remain compliant with regulations and collect data without threatening privacy, data security, and breaching data laws.</p> Closing Thoughts <p>Most crypto users are increasingly concerned with identity verification or KYC procedures. However, most importantly, they are concerned with whatever happens to their data after it is collected. Especially when it comes to users’ sensitive data associated with their financial transactions, KYC procedures are being questioned by privacy and security advocates. </p><p>With cryptographic concepts like zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized identifiers (DID), individuals can pass KYC checks without giving out sensitive information and yet achieve regulatory compliance.</p><p>By leveraging zero-knowledge technology, banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, and other regulated institutions can access customer information without violating their privacy, prevent data breaches, and stay compliant with data protection laws — a win-win situation for everyone.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Privacy in DeFi is much needed. </p><p>In an ecosystem that grows bigger and more composable every day, the possibility for attackers to take advantage of blockchains' transparency to attack users increases. In contrast, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">automatic MEV attacks</a> become more common by the day. If we want adoption to increase by orders of magnitude, users need to be guaranteed a base degree of privacy.</p><p>So, why has nobody succeeded (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9/">yet</a>) in providing a base level of privacy? In this article, based on <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed">Anish Mohammed</a>'s (Panther Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist) <a href="https://youtu.be/_6O_C6fiuQg">talk at EthCC Paris 2022</a>, we'll look into:</p>  The economic challenges behind private DeFi.  How to price privacy correctly.  The adversarial games that keep the clock ticking for blockchain privacy.  What a solution to the current challenges might look like.  <p></p> Illustrating the base difficulties of privacy in DeFi <p>To understand why DeFi privacy is inherently challenging, let’s look at one of the most widespread, straightforward models –Automated Market Makers.</p><p>In an <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm">AMM</a>, there are two pools of assets, which users trade against. By withdrawing assets from one side of the pool and adding to the other, users drive price fluctuations for both assets, which stabilize the system through arbitrage opportunities.</p><p>Privacy for AMMs is difficult because obscuring balance and trade amounts from possible attackers is insufficient: by looking into on-chain data, it’s still possible to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01193.pdf">reconstruct</a> the history of transactions.</p><p>To mitigate this, some proposed strategies include:</p>  Batching: It’s possible to merge a set of transactions into a batch. Rollups are essentially batching mechanisms with scalability and possibly privacy advantages.  <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">ZK rollups</a>, which can provide privacy and batch transactions by default. In a batching scenario, an attacker doesn’t have information about individual transactions anymore, only about their average.  Adding randomness in price: Akin to a noise-generation function, adding an element of uncertainty —essentially an error margin— can increase privacy. This occurs on each block, as a random offset is added to the price the constant function would give based on the pool’s parameters. An attacker would be <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1101.pdf">no longer able</a> to estimate the pool’s balance or trade amounts from the price difference between two blocks. This solution's costs mainly affect liquidity providers, as the user exchanging assets would know the price before making the trade.  Differential privacy: <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~franklin/ecs289/2010/dwork_2008.pdf">Differential privacy,</a> similarly to added randomness, muffles information about individual transactions while guaranteeing that the general properties of the dataset are not changed. This could be applied to many parts of the DeFi algorithm, with one <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1101.pdf">implementation</a> already theorized. Large trades within a block could be broken down into smaller trades and reordered, maintaining the average impact and protecting a user against being front-run.  <p></p> Problems with batching (including batching in rollups) <p>One obvious issue with batching is that, by being unable to execute in real-time, DeFi users miss out on time-critical strategies, which become unfeasible with batching. In other words, in the time that it takes for a batch to gather all participants’ transactions, MEV attacks or other traders get a larger-than-usual window of opportunity.</p><p>Additionally, due to averages and the inability of traders to know the order of transactions in a batch, some participants will enjoy better prices than others. We can think of this as an associated inefficiency.</p>Graphical representation of the problem discussed above. While, on average, users within a rollup or batch cause the same overall impact on the system, their personal outcomes can be very unpredictable and vary wildly.<p></p> Problems with differential privacy in decentralized settings <p>Privacy under a decentralized setting has inherent cost disadvantages against privacy in centralized systems. It is harder to achieve privacy in decentralized systems because:</p>  Decentralized consensus has a cost. In a setting with no trusted parties, efforts need to be concentrated on making sure that the system is attack-proof. In other words, centralized systems only need to worry about executing a task and maintaining public trust, while decentralized systems have to bear the non-negligible cost of keeping decentralized.  Unlike what is usually believed, communication overhead can also have a significant cost, especially for time-critical applications. Decentralized consensus requires that all participants are informed of everything going on, while a centralized service provider simply keeps a single, efficient internal database. The former requires constant communication between hundreds or thousands of participants, while the latter is virtually free of that overhead. An aggravating factor is that, at times, communication costs <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04234.pdf">do not rise linearly</a>; they worsen as the number of participants in a system increases.  <p>The above considerations create an economic dilemma: assuming either no regulatory requirements such as GDPR, or that their impact is negligible, the cost of maintaining a private system is higher than that of maintaining a system without privacy. Similarly, decentralized privacy is more expensive to achieve than centralized privacy, albeit a centrally-controlled private system creates obvious less-than-ideal power dynamics.</p><p>Adversarial dynamics can be seen in <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning">technology</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08862">healthcare</a>, and other areas of daily life. Corporations that (advertently or otherwise) collect data from users <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/10/20/how-is-big-data-analytics-using-machine-learning/">get to benefit</a> from machine learning applications to improve their products and targeting.</p><p>Because of this, even in centralized competition, the honest competitor faces a disadvantage. However, there is a hope that, in a decentralized solution, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2012/04/16/the-big-cost-of-big-data/">lack of overhead</a> and cost spread can drive the “privacy disadvantage” to be lower than the added costs of collecting and processing data.</p><p></p> The need to price privacy <p>To succeed, at least from an economic standpoint, a decentralized privacy system must:</p>  Spread its costs as much as possible. It’s possible that a decentralized private system will never be the cheapest option available, but the cost could become bearable enough for its advantages to beat the associated costs (e.g., if the cost would be $0.1 per transaction). Users need to bear these costs for the system to be truly decentralized.  Privacy comes in many layers. The costs of privacy will naturally be higher in extremely private applications. Nonetheless, each user’s risk tolerance will determine whether a weaker privacy solution is sufficient to shield them against their most likely attackers. Privacy tools should ideally be as flexible as possible to allow this privacy price discovery and maximize participation.  Derive its privacy from user-driven actions. Similar to how Bitcoin miners earn from verifying blocks, a decentralized ecosystem can reward users for participating in a protocol, which aids overall privacy. In this system, users being rewarded for “feeding” a privacy algorithm substitutes the need to add artificial randomness.  <p>In the condition set above, private system users “pay” for the rewards that the rest receive for creating the right conditions. As such, it’s even possible to devise a system in which there are several “tiers” of privacy, each with a separate cost, to create even more desirable conditions. This is illustrated in the table below, following the example of how data could be used to improve targeting and products:</p>While a “sweet spot” can be desirable for most, there are certainly cases in which a user may desire no privacy. Or, on the opposite, they might desire for their data to be fully scrapped of all utility to gain privacy.<p></p> A tool to solve seemingly contradicting needs <p>The privacy problem in DeFi presents the need for a tool that satisfies radically different –even contradictory– needs. </p><p>On the one hand, the radical transparency of Layer-1 blockchains has helped them arrive at their current growth stage in a decentralized fashion. On the other, privacy is the only way users can be fully safe utilizing them. </p><p>There is one way in which DeFi users can access total privacy that is fully compliant while retaining full control and ownership of their data. And as this technology and its game-theoretical design are no small feature, they are often referred to as moon math.</p><p></p> Introducing zero-knowledge proofs <p><a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf">First introduced in 1989</a>, zero-knowledge proofs are a relatively new concept in the context of mathematics, cryptography, and computer science. In the last decade, the advancements in this field have been numerous. These breakthroughs allowed many practical applications to be developed, especially in the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>For those not already familiar with the term, a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a proof for a statement that does not convey more knowledge than the mere fact that the statement is true. </p><p>Imagine magician A wants to prove to person B that A can leave a room without using the only door, but doesn’t want to reveal his secrets. A can simply ask to be let inside the room, for B to lock the door and keep an eye on it from outside, and then somehow A will appear outside the room. This proves the claim was correct, but no extra information about A’s methods was revealed: a zero-knowledge proof.</p><p></p> What are ZKPs good for? <p>Zero-knowledge proofs have been some of the most powerful tools to build crypto privacy solutions. Currently, they’re being utilized to scale blockchains by applying ZKPs to batch transactions off-chain, having privacy as an auspicious side-effect. Although, as we have seen, rollups create issues of their own.</p><p>The gains in scalability due to using rollups can be significant, as demonstrated by the table below:</p>Currently, ZK rollups are the scalability solution that affords the highest transaction output. (Source: <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">vitalik.ca</a>)<p>The current applications for zero-knowledge proofs have just barely scratched the surface of what’s possible for them. As a general-purpose tool, ZKPs can be used in any situation that requires users to provide proof of status/ownership. They also enable them to prove the above without disclosing the underlying data, which from an economic and privacy perspective means that:</p>  DeFi users can be protected by default privacy (or access it in different layers) and then progressively pay for subsequent disclosures.  These solutions can be accessed in a scalable, more affordable manner.  A system with the right incentives can rely on ZKPs to create private batched transactions.  <p>It remains a matter of speculation what the creation of such a system can achieve in a real-world setting. However, if executed correctly, it could result in an end-to-end private experience of utilizing DeFi for users, as well as a mechanism to put a price on privacy organically.</p><p></p> Conclusion <p>As we have seen, there is no such thing as a free lunch when it comes to blockchain privacy.</p><p>Competing on price with centralized systems is non-trivial, as existing privacy-preserving tech applications are not efficient enough. Alternatives like zkSNARKs and scalability solutions, however, make it more likely that this problem can be solved when approached from the right angle.</p><p>In a race to the bottom between privacy-preserving and non-privacy-preserving solutions, incentives are key to making the former stand a chance against products that can grow and iterate faster, becoming stronger.</p><p>Along with incentives, a dynamic pricing of privacy is also vital. If users have incentives to pay extra for higher privacy (therefore incentivizing strategies that provide privacy to others), it’s possible to lower the price of privacy for all, making the system more robust and attractive.</p><p>We are at a breaking point for the development and application of ZKPs. The next few years will be key in determining how far privacy in DeFi goes when aided by them.</p><p></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Thank you for your message. I will copy the questions and put the answers after them.</p>
<p>Is the categorization unique to Bitcoin (or UTXO blockchains)? That is, consider a non-UTXO coin, or even, a privacy coin, would all 4 categories remain, or how would it change?</p>
<p>Indeed, not all privacy attack categories can be applied to other blockchains. Some of the attacks are specific to Bitcoin. For instance, the multi-input ownership heuristic relates to the UTXO-based blockchains; however, in privacy coins such as Zcash or Monero, it is not considered. Zcash and Monoro tried to solve the problems by ZKP (in Zcash) and RingCT (in Monero). Therefore, the attacker can not assume that all the inputs belong to the same user. Actually, in Zcash shielded pool, none of the inputs can be detected. However, it can perfectly work in Zcash’s non-shielded pool because the non-shielded pool is similar to Bitcoin, where everyone can see the inputs.</p>
<p>What is the story behind using RFC6973 as a criterion for (sort of) defining and standardizing what are the particular characteristics of privacy for internet protocols?</p>
<p>We used RFC6973 for this paper since the Internet protocol documents are widely used in the DIDs community. We tried to map these privacy issues to what the community considers.</p>
<p>Are there other criteria widely discussed in the space, and if so, how was RFC6973 selected for the research?</p>
<p>Indeed in blockchain privacy, we have to refer to the related scientific papers; however, the terminology provided by Pfitzmann and Hansen in <a href="https://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.28.pdf">Anon-Terminology</a> is an excellent source for privacy criteria. These criteria can be adopted and reformulated in the blockchain area.</p>

         New Partnership: From Spring Reflections to Summer Health            <p>Ellen and her team are making health care accessible with one simple text.</p>  <p>By Alfred Lin</p><p>Published July 25, 2022</p>       



      Alfred and Ellen at Sequoia Base Camp.      



 
 
   
<p>We had heard about a young powerhouse executive at Hims &amp; Hers, but we didn’t get to meet Ellen DaSilva until April 2020. Our originally scheduled coffee meeting, planned to discuss her potentially joining Sequoia’s Scout program, moved to Zoom in the midst of the chaos and lockdowns of COVID. It would have been understandable if she had canceled or postponed. It also would have been understandable if the tone of the meeting was pessimistic, awkward or dark. But that wouldn’t be Ellen. Even with a bunch of curve balls thrown at her, her effervescence came through Zoom. She spoke with enthusiasm for consumer health businesses and clearly believed people were being underserved by most current options. We were blown away by her clarity of thought, and invited her to be a Scout.</p>



<p>A year later, Ellen and her husband welcomed their second child. A casual reach out to send warm wishes to her and her family led to a mutual gripe session over Zoom about our health system, and in particular, pediatrics. As a mother, Ellen has spent hours at urgent care and waiting by the phone for her primary pediatrician’s office to call her back for a quick consult. Again, it would have been understandable for her to feel dejected—but that wouldn’t be Ellen. All she saw was opportunity.</p>



<p>Ellen observed, researched and asked, “Why?” During that brief conversation with her, we learned that the average American waits more than two hours at the emergency room, and—as Ellen had recently experienced firsthand—two weeks to see their primary doctor. Particularly for families with young children, the time adds up quickly: the average parent accesses their pediatrician an average of <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx">10 times per year in the first two years of their child’s life, and 4 times per year thereafter</a>. As she dug into these stats and more, Ellen was full of enthusiasm about finding a better solution.</p>



<p>After those spring reflections in 2021, Ellen continued to learn more about our health system from both parents’ and pediatricians’ perspectives, speaking to as many people from each group as she could find. By summer, she was asking herself two questions: Was she ready to dedicate her life to helping people access care, perhaps starting with pediatrics? And if so, how could she best accomplish her mission? These were the musings of Ellen DaSilva on maternity leave.</p>



<p>Fall was back to work at Hims &amp; Hers, an organization where she had started as employee #8 and helped it grow into a public company. At first, she was glad to be back, seeing familiar faces and getting some professional​​—and adult—interactions. (We all love our kids, but they drive us nuts, too.) While it was energizing to reunite with friends and colleagues, the same nagging question kept popping up in Ellen’s mind. How can we radically simplify access to pediatrics care?</p>



<p>As the cold November winds settled into NYC, Ellen asked herself what she would regret more: Pursuing that dream and striking out, or continuing her steady climb in the world of major public healthcare companies but never taking a swing? Founding moments start with the daring to overcome your fears—and Ellen knew she would regret not trying far more.</p>



<p>After telling her family and friends around Thanksgiving, Founder Ellen incorporated Summer Health in December 2021, and Sequoia was fortunate enough to become the company’s first outside shareholder. With that initial check of $1M, Ellen built out the alpha version of her product to test her hypotheses, recruited co-founder Matthew Woo and a small crackerjack team of seven, and rebuilt and launched the beta product while onboarding the first parents and pediatricians. Just more than six months in, families in all 50​​ states are now able to connect with a Summer Health provider via a simple text message—and get treatment, prescriptions, referrals and more in just 15 minutes. This velocity in execution speaks for itself, both for Ellen as a highly effective founder and for Summer Health as a highly compelling offering that’s instantly seen clinical and customer demand.</p>



<p>Today, we are thrilled to <a href="https://www.summerhealth.com/">make the product available to everyone through the public beta</a> and announce that Summer Health has raised $7.5M in total seed funding, co-led by Sequoia Capital and Lux Capital. But while this is a milestone worth celebrating, we are most excited to see how Ellen and her team will continue working toward a universally powerful mission: to radically simplify access to care.</p>

     The Cobalt wallet is Horizen’s new web extension wallet that enables you to create, receive, and send tokens on TokenMint!&nbsp; 
<p>In this guide, we show you how to send ZEN to your Cobalt wallet to process your transactions and create your own tokens. ZEN is used as gas for TokenMint transactions.</p>
 About TokenMint 
<p>The TokenMint platform is designed to provide a seamless, simple, and intuitive user experience. In the alpha version, there are four components available to launch your token:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – a sidechain built on the Horizen network 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">Token Generator</a>&nbsp;– a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics. 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a>&nbsp;– a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint Block explorer</a>&nbsp;– a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
 Send ZEN to a Cobalt wallet 
<p>When sending ZEN from your Sphere wallet to a Cobalt wallet, you are actually sending a transaction to a sidechain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you begin the send transaction, make sure that you have the Cobalt wallet’s address to send ZEN and the password to confirm the transaction.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<p>1. In your Sphere Wallet, click on the wallet you wish to send ZEN from.</p>
<p>2. Select the appropriate address by clicking on the info icon to copy it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two icons: one to Receive and the other to Send.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Click the Send icon. (Red Up Arrow) The Send page appears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Make sure that the Sidechain transaction toggle is enabled, which displays the Sidechain field.</p>
<p>5. In the Sidechain field, use the pull-down menu to select the appropriate sidechain.</p>
<p>6. In the Send to field, paste the Cobalt wallet’s address.</p>
<p>7. In the Amount field, enter the amount of ZEN you want to send.</p>
<p>8. In the Transaction Fee pane, the Standard radio button is enabled by default. Click Custom if you want to specify a custom fee.</p>
<p>9. Optionally, in the Description field, enter a brief statement about this transaction.</p>
<p>10. Click Confirm. Then enter the wallet password to confirm the field appears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note: If you enter the wrong password, an error message will appear.</p>
<p>11. Enter your Sphere wallet password. The Send page displays a success notification.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12. Click View on Blockchain to verify that the transaction is successful. The <a href="https://explorer.zensystem.io/">Block Explorer</a> webpage appears.</p>
<p>13. Click the Search button on the top of the page using the search criteria of address, transaction, or blocks if your transaction is not displayed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>14. Check the Cobalt wallet for the newly received transaction. You should see a transaction of received ZEN from Horizen mainchain.</p>

     TokenMint makes tokenization streamlined and accessible to everyone. Anyone can create their own token now! 
<p>TokenMint is a platform that allows anyone to easily and quickly create a token with custom tokenomics. No programming knowledge is needed for creating a token using TokenMint. The alpha version of the TokenMint platform offers the basics for creating a fungible token.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 About TokenMint 
<p>The TokenMint platform is designed to provide a seamless, simple, and intuitive user experience. In the alpha version, there are four components available to launch your token:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – a sidechain built on the Horizen network 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">Token Generator</a> – a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics. 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a> – a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint Block explorer</a> – a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
 How to Use Token Generator to Create a Token 
<p>To begin the process of creating a token, you MUST:</p>
 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt-by-horizen/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Install the latest version of Cobalt wallet</a>, or you will not be able to use the token generator 
 Have <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/">ZEN in your Cobalt wallet</a>, or you will not be able to connect your wallet to the TokenMint website.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The TokenMint token generator is very easy to use.&nbsp; Simply head to the <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint website</a> and follow these easy steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 1. Launch the token generator from the <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint website</a> by clicking Launch The App.</p>
<p></p>
<p>STEP 2. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt-by-horizen/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Download the latest Cobalt wallet</a> and connect your Cobalt wallet.</p>
<p>You must install the latest Cobalt wallet. Otherwise, the token generator won’t connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a Cobalt wallet, make sure you update the extension from your web browser settings menu. Please follow<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/"> this guide</a> if you need help.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You must have sufficient ZEN in your Cobalt wallet to pay for network fees. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/">Follow this guide if you need help to know how to send ZEN to Cobalt</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 3. Once your wallet is connected, click Create a token and follow the steps shown on the app to create your token.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>STEP 4. After you create your token, you will be able to see your token in your Cobalt wallet and the <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint block explorer</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You can now find your tokens on the TokenMint site. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 5. Mint your token! After your token is created, you will need to mint your token to the wallet of your choice. To begin, select Mint token. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 6. On the Mint token page, enter the desired amount of your token to mint and the wallet address you would like to mint to then select Confirm. Minting tokens currently cost 1 ZEN. The transaction can take up to 5 minutes to complete the minting of your token.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the confirmation is complete, you will receive the identified quantity of tokens to your designated wallet and you are ready to send your tokens to the world!</p>

 Do not take pictures of your seed phrase 
 Do not save it in files such as notepads, third-party-owned documents, etc.

 Confirm your seed phrase by clicking on the words in the exact order they were listed when you created your seed phrase.&nbsp; 
 Click Confirm 
 
<p></p>
 Import an Existing Wallet

  <p>Thank you <a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/u/simin">@simin</a> for the fascinating summary of your work. Welcome to the forum, and it’s so great to have you here.</p>
<p>There are at least two things that I find particularly interesting.</p>
<p>The first is the classification of Bitcoin privacy attacks. In your work, there are 4 categories, and under each section are several important threats. This seems like a careful design and is thus an important reference for the potential attacks that both developers and users need to stay aware of.</p>
<p>Is the categorization unique to Bitcoin (or UTXO blockchains)? That is, consider a non-UTXO coin, or even, a privacy coin, would all 4 categories remain, or how would it change?</p>
<p>The second relates to the discussion and key takeaways section, where you dive into how the threats map back to privacy criteria. It seems important since defining a problem is a prerequisite to identifying solutions.</p>
<p>For me, it is a great resource to have it spelled out specifically why users of the blockchain are at risk of privacy breaches. Having the criteria laid out side-by-side with the characteristics of the blockchain is fascinating.</p>
<p>With that said, I must ask: Being new to the space, I wonder what is the story behind using RFC6973 as a criterion for (sort of) defining and standardizing what are the particular characteristics of privacy for internet protocols? Are there other criteria that are widely discussed in the space, and if so, how was RFC6973 selected for the research?</p>

  What if I told you that it’s gotten super easy to make Bitcoin payments without anyone being able to link them all to you?

   <p>They said that Bitcoin isn't private, that you couldn't use it without telling everyone about your payments. They said that you had to be an expert before you had a chance to protect your sensitive financial information.</p><p>Well, what if I told you that they were wrong and that it’s gotten super easy to make Bitcoin payments without anyone being able to link them all to you? Interested ? Keep reading.</p><p>First and foremost, you have to download the latest and greatest Wasabi Wallet 2.0. For many that’s the actual step one, but hey, I know you’re cool and are already running the mighty Wasabi, so you can skip and reclaim your privacy that much quicker.</p><p>Maybe you’re a whale, or maybe you’re a pleb, but anyone worth a sat has got a wallet these days, so type in your recovery words to import your keys to Wasabi. If you’re one of those future-coiners who hasn’t got a wallet yet. First, slap yourself and try to wake up. But don’t stress it, you can easily create a new wallet in Wasabi directly. Write down the 12 words and you’re good to go!</p><p>Now comes arguably the toughest part. You gotta convince someone to send you some magical internet money. It ain’t easy, ‘cause nobody has enough sats, and everyone wants to stack some more. But I’m sure you’re a fine entrepreneur, so go be productive and earn yourself some treasure worth protecting. That part is easy as pi in Wasabi. Just click “Receive”, write who is sending you that hoard and show him that address. Voila, you've now got more sats than yesterday, that’s what I’d call a good day.</p><p>Earning sats is already difficult enough; if you think about it, waiting to spend it can be even more difficult. I know you really wanna have that delicious steak, that fast boat and that hidden citadel. But patience is a virtue (that most of us lack); however it’s all you need at this step. While you are dreaming about how delicious that steak is gonna be, Wasabi is doing magic for you in the background. Who knows what exactly is going on under the hood but the crazy thing is, in just a short amount of time, the coins that other people knew were yours are gone and you got new coins that nobody knows are yours. Magic indeed.</p><p>Now that you are fully equipped with truly anonymous money, you can frivolously spend it without worrying that those who paid you sats, know where you spend them. But oh well, maybe, just maybe, that short lesson in waiting has made you realize that indeed, you could continue fasting a little more, not buy that steak but hold on to those precious sats just a little longer instead. Who knows, your great grandchildren could buy themselves a spaceship to the stars with those sats.</p><p>Earn sats, wait, spend sats.

<p>Brave’s multichain crypto wallet makes it easier for users to onboard to Web3 with new integrations from Beefy.finance, Elk Finance, Elpis Battles, Lido, Tulip, and Venus Protocol</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Last month we announced our <a>Wallet Partner Program</a> and a roster of six inaugural partners who integrated Brave Wallet connection in their DApps (ApeSwap, Arken, Bogged, DODO, Open Ocean, and Skiff). We are thrilled to announce six additional leading DApps (decentralized applications) spanning over 10 networks joining the program in July.</p>
<p>Partnering with the most widely-used decentralized applications in Web3 underlines Brave Wallet’s ease of use and rich set of features. These include decentralized swaps, multi-chain portfolio view, simple fiat-to-crypto purchases with Ramp and Wyre, and continuous updates and additions to make Web3 more accessible. Importantly, partners in the program benefit from co-promotion of their DApps among Brave’s 62+ million users via our blog, community channels, social media, and Brave Ads.</p>
<p>We are excited about the opportunities these partnerships can create for BAT utility and Brave Wallet users, including better access to decentralized finance (DeFi), privacy tools, lively social communities, and more. Each new addition deepens our commitment to providing the leading secure, multi-chain wallet, that we hope will onboard millions of users to Web3.</p>

 Beefy 
<p><a href="https://beefy.finance/">Beefy</a> is one of the largest and most-used yield-aggregators, with smart contract vaults that help users earn more yield on their liquidity positions across 16 different networks and dozens of decentralized exchanges. They hold the top position in terms of total value locked (TVL) among yield-aggregators on several major EVM-compatible chains and Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, including Polygon, Arbitrum, and Cronos.</p>
<p>“Integrating Beefy’s services into a platform like Brave with a community of millions is a perfect use case for increased adoption. Earning APY through DeFi opportunities shouldn’t just be for the few, and tapping into Brave’s ecosystem will help more people earn than ever before,” said Weso, Beefy’s Lead Developer and Strategic Partnership Coordinator.</p>

 Elk Finance 
<p><a href="https://elk.finance/">ElkNet</a>, the core product offered by Elk Finance, is a multi-chain bridge network that connects 19 EVM-compatible chains, allowing users to quickly and safely move their tokens from one chain to another. In addition to moving assets, Elk is adding cross-chain swaps, which offers users the choice to receive their bridged assets as a different token. “Our motto is Any chain, anytime, anywhere,” said the Elk Team.</p>

 Elpis Battle 
<p><a href="https://elpis.game/">Elpis Battle</a> is a turn-based RPG NFT Game implemented on the Binance Smart Chain network, which is developed by ZEGO Studio—a gaming studio in Southeast Asia. By combining cryptocurrency, NFT gaming, and DeFi, Elpis’s developers want to create a new kind of gaming experience for Elpis Battle players. Elpis is a world where players can not only explore stories about an imaginary kingdom but also create value, exchange, buy, and sell assets as participants in the economy of Elpis.</p>
<p>“A common vision toward bigger goals is the foundation of our partnership. We envision this cross-platform partnership will help users be able to manage, grow, and swap their crypto portfolio from a single wallet securely and comfortably,” said the Elpis Battle Team.</p>

 Lido 
<p>With over $5 billion in value locked between Ethereum and Solana alone, <a href="https://lido.fi/">Lido</a> is by far the most widely used liquid staking protocol available today. Lido makes it easy for anyone to participate in the proof of stake consensus while simultaneously allowing users to interact with DeFi protocols. This liquidity lets users find the best DeFi strategies for themselves while also securing some of industry’s biggest blockchains: Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, and Kusama.</p>
<p>“A platform like Brave with a community in the millions will be critical for Lido to bring DeFi to the next generation and increase the resilience of the systems it is built upon. This was the entire reason that Lido and liquid staking was created in the first place and what has helped Lido become the leading liquid staking provider globally,” said Jacob Blish, Head of Business Development at Lido.</p>

 Tulip 
<p><a href="https://tulip.garden/#home">Tulip Protocol</a> was the first yield aggregation platform built on Solana with auto-compounding vault strategies. The DApp is designed to take advantage of Solana’s low cost, high efficiency blockchain. It allows vault strategies to compound frequently—which benefits yield farms with higher APYs—without&nbsp; requiring active management. It also has lower gas fees. Tulip now offers a wide variety of strategies for its users: Lending, Auto-compounding Vaults, Leveraged Yield Farming, and their newly launched Strategy Vaults.</p>
<p>​​"Tulip believes in simplifying yield for all end users. A partnership with Brave brings us closer to our ideals as we can help Brave Wallet users tap into single-click yield generation with our protocol. We’re excited to continue to work with Brave in the future," said Senx, Co-Founder at Tulip Protocol.</p>

 Venus Protocol 
<p><a href="https://venus.io/">Venus</a> is the leading DeFi market for lending and borrowing, and second largest decentralized application in terms of TVL on BNB Chain. Users can use their many pools (including XVS, BTCB, ETH, BNB) and a variety of stablecoins to borrow and lend assets at variable interest rates. Borrowers can benefit from on-demand access to a range of tokens with low interest rates, while depositors can earn yield on their idle assets. Venus currently supports 22 different cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>“By integrating Venus with Brave, two DeFi leaders come together to fling open the doors of financial inclusion to millions of users. It’s just the beginning for making open finance a reality around the globe,” said Brad Harrison, CEO of Venus.</p>
<p>For the current phase of the Brave Wallet Partner Program, Brave is approaching leading DApps in each vertical to invite them to the program. We also aim to adapt and scale the program to become public-facing later this year. Once this happens, additional DApps can submit requests to participate.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you’re a developer interested in simply integrating Brave Wallet into your DApp, we’ve created <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">detailed developer documentation</a>.</p>

  Read the proposal for Polkadot's next-generation governance system - currently known as Gov2 - to discover how it aims to advance the decentralization of the network.

<p>Polkadot’s first decentralised governance system was pretty interesting at the time: a tri-cameral (three-chamber) structure with a technocratic committee managing upgrade timelines, an approval-voted, elected executive “government” to manage parameters, admin and spending proposals as well as a general voting system for everything else which rewarded long-term stakeholders with increased influence. It was loosely based on parliamentary democracy and has been functioning reasonably well over the first 2–3 years of operation, helping ensure good use of treasury funds, keeping a fast clip with the rollout of upgrades, and managing the deployment of more critical fixes in a timely fashion. However, it has its drawbacks.</p><p>The elected executive (known as the Council) is centralised and generally not anonymous. This puts both the protocol in some degree of risk as well as the individual councillors who may find themselves pressured to act one way or another. The Technical Committee, while wielding substantially less power, has similar exposure and greater centralisation. In a world where authorities across society (both benign and malevolent), decentralisation is increasingly needed for both the safety and security of all participants.</p><p>Furthermore, there exists only a single “all or nothing” referendum model — all referenda carry the maximum amount of power. Partly due to this, there can only be one referendum voted at a time and these votes last multiple weeks by default. This, and the limited bandwidth of the Council means that overall the system favours deep consideration of very few proposals rather than broad consideration of very many. Rather than leveraging the power of the crowd, it inadvertently limits it in its efforts to manage the volume of potential decision throughput.</p><p>The nature of coarse-grained delegation means that the system has a degree of exclusivity built-in to it. Barriers to entry within the effective political framework are high, reducing inclusivity and diversity, hurting turnout and legitimacy.</p><p>It was always clear that the first version of Polkadot’s governance was just that: something to be iterated on over time. Now, I’m happy to be able to describe in detail our proposal for the next generation of governance within the Polkadot ecosystem.</p> Introducing Gov2 <p>Polkadot’s next-generation governance system, known while in development as Gov2, aims to solve the issues with the current system. First, what it doesn’t change: it does not break from the original Polkadot governance tenet, which holds that 50% of the total stake in the system should, if they have sufficient strength of conviction in their opinion, be able ultimately to command the system’s future. Similarly, it doesn’t break away from the Conviction Voting pioneered in Polkadot giving greater weight to those who are willing to lock their tokens into the system for longer. Furthermore, there is still use for a technocratic collective, albeit it is somewhat different in importance, size, composition and membership mechanics than the current Technical Committee.</p><p>Where it differs most is how it manages the practical means of day-to-day decision-making, making the repercussions of referenda better scoped and agile in order to dramatically increase the number of collective decisions the system is able to take. Let’s look a little deeper into how it works.</p> Lower the Barriers <p>Gov2 is actually a lot simpler in many ways than the current governance. There are no additional bodies which act as “first class citizens” in the governance such as the Council and Technical Committee. There is no alternating timetable of proposals. There is no public proposal queue. Instead, we only have one first-class decision-making mechanism: the referendum. The main difference in Gov2 is that there can be lots of them — perhaps even thousands —all happening simultaneously.</p><p>In Gov2, anyone is able to start a referendum at any time, and they can do this as many times as they wish. Anyone can also vote on these referenda. There are no explicit limits on the number of referenda which are open to vote on at any time.</p><p>But this could result in more things to vote on that a normal person with a reasonable amount of time could possibly evaluate. This could reduce both inclusivity and security. So, in order make this potential plethora of things to vote on manageable for mere humans, we introduce some interesting novel features to the referendum process.</p> Origins and Tracks <p>All referenda are based on a proposal, which is really just another way of saying “an operation” in Polkadot. This is the same kind of thing as what gets described and executed when you make a transaction and it gets included in a block. There are all kinds of operations which Polkadot can do, but a couple which you’re probably already familiar with are <code>transfer</code> which can move assets between accounts and <code>stake</code> which lets an account stake. There are very many others. The thing that makes this governance functionality special is not these proposals/operations, but rather the Origin with which they are executed.</p><p>You can think of an Origin as a sort of rich descriptor for a privilege level. It gets passed in when an operation is executed, and the operation’s logic will usually check that it is what it should be. When a regular transaction executes, the Origin parameter is set to a variant known as Signed. This implies that a specific account in the system authorised (generally through signing the transaction) the operation to happen, and it runs with this privilege, further implying e.g. that funds controlled by this account and this account only may be spent.</p><p>Governance-level stuff works to allow operations to run with other, more privileged, Origins. The most privileged of them all is the Root Origin, which is all-powerful. This is the Origin from which the proposals of all approved referenda in the old governance system were dispatched. In Gov2, we have many different Origins, all enjoying some exotic privileges, but with many being significantly less powerful and more niche than Root.</p><p>In Gov2, we allow the proposer to specify which Origin they would like their proposal to be executed with. Every supported Origin is associated with a single referendum class (i.e. a type of referenda), and most of these classes will correspond to exactly one origin, but there might be some which are comprised of multiple Origins. Each class has its own Track, which is basically a pipeline in which the proposal lives in and proceeds through, and it is completely independent from other class’s tracks.</p><p>Having independent tracks allows us to tailor the dynamics of referenda based upon their implied privilege level. Referenda which execute their proposals from more powerful (read: dangerous!) Origins will have more stringent safeguards, higher thresholds and longer consideration periods. The Root Origin has the highest such thresholds and safeguards. Those Origins which convey relatively little power (e.g. the Tip Origin, able to spend at most 10 DOT from the treasury), have accordingly shorter consideration periods and lower thresholds for approval.</p> Kicking off <p>When a referendum is initially created, it is immediately votable by anyone in the community. However, it is not in a state where it can end, or otherwise have its votes counted, be approved and summarily enacted. Instead, referenda must fulfil a number of criteria before they are moved into a state known as Deciding. Until they are in this state, they remain undecided.</p><p>The criteria which need to be met are threefold: Firstly, all referenda have a lead-in period. This is an amount of time which must have elapsed after proposal before deciding can begin. This provides for an initial notice period in which votes can be submitted to mitigate against the possibility of “decision sniping” where an attacker controlling a substantial amount of voting power might seek to have a proposal passed soon after proposing it, not allowing the overall voting population time to consider and vote.</p><p>Secondly, there must be room for the decision. All tracks have their own limit on the number of referenda which can be deciding simultaneously. The more potent the Origins allowed on the track, then the lower this limit. The Root level Origin has a limit of one, implying that only a single über-dangerous proposal may be being decided at once. Conversely, the rather underpowered Tipping track has far less stringent limits since any damage done through over-population of is minimal and it is far more useful to have many tips being decided at once over many Root-level calls. When there is space available, then it is the (otherwise eligible) referendum of the class which has the most votes in favour of approval which is elevated into the deciding state.</p><p>Finally, a Decision Deposit must be paid. Creating a referendum is cheap, with the deposit needing to be paid relating only to the on-chain storage needed to track it. However, having a referendum be decided upon carries greater risk and uses up limited space since we limit the number of referenda which can be being decided simultaneously on each track. Thus a larger (though refundable) deposit must be paid to mitigate against spamming or bloating the system.</p> Deciding and Confirming a Proposal <p>Once a referendum enters the state of deciding, then it is eligible to be approved. This eligibility lasts only a finite time (28 days on Polkadot), at which point if it is not approved then it is rejected by default. To be approved, it must fulfil two criteria (in which case we say it is passing) and it must continue fulfilling these criteria for a minimum of the Confirmation Period. Different tracks have different lengths of Confirmation Period, with the more powerful ones taking longer to confirm. This is additional defence against a whale voter attempting to “snipe” the referendum by placing a large enough vote that approval criteria are hit unexpectedly.</p><p>The two passing criteria relate to approval and support. Gone is the adaptive quorum biasing of past referendums. Now we have a more flexible system where these requirements may be customised at a much more fine-grained level. Approval is defined as the share of approval vote-weight (i.e. after adjustment for conviction) against the total number of vote-weight (for both approval and rejection). Support is the total number of votes in approval (i.e. ignoring any adjustment for conviction) compared to the total possible amount of votes that could be made in the system.</p><p>Each class of referendum has different requirements for these values. However what is most interesting is that these requirements are able to reduce over time on a well-defined schedule. What this means is that as the voting proceeds over the 28 days, we can configure things so that an increasingly lower amount of support and overall approval for the proposal are needed for it to pass. In general, they will always begin and end in roughly the same way, starting with the highest thresholds and ending with the lowest which are still in line with the overall tenets: at least 50% approval.</p><p>What happens in between determines how easy it is for an approval to be made before the 28-day deadline. With proposals which use less privileged origins (e.g. the Tip class, which is only able to command a payment from the treasury of up to 10 DOT) it is far more reasonable to drop the required turnout to a more realistic amount earlier than those which use highly privileged classes such as Root. Similarly, classes which command more political significance will tend to accept less controversy (and thus require a higher approval) early on.</p> After Approval <p>Proposals which are not approved after 28 days are considered rejected by default. At this point, the Decision Deposit can be refunded. If, on the other hand, the proposal manages to become and remain passing for the Confirmation Period during these 28 days, then it is considered approved and it is scheduled to execute from the origin is was duly proposed with, after some Enactment Period.</p><p>The Enactment Period is also specified when the referendum is proposed but is subject to a minimum value which is dependent on the track. Some of the more powerful tracks force a larger Enactment Period to ensure the network has ample time to prepare for any changes that the proposal might bring.</p> Interventions <p>Sometimes it becomes apparent that a proposal which is already being voted on (and perhaps is already passing) contains a problem and it is desirable to cancel it. An example of this would be a chain upgrade which was later discovered to contain some sort of issue. While this is not very common, it is also not entirely unheard of.</p><p>In Gov2, there is a special operation for intervening in this way known as Cancelation. This operation immediately rejects an ongoing referendum regardless of its status. It actually comes in two forms, with one just doing the bare operation and the other also slashing the initial proposer of the deposit(s) paid for the referendum.</p><p>Cancelation is itself a governance operation which must be voted upon by the network in order to execute. This poses a possible problem of timeline, and in order to be useful, getting a cancelation proposal passed must generally be quite a lot faster than any possible target proposal passed. As such, cancelation comes with its own Origin and track, which has a low lead-time and approval/support curves with slightly sharper reductions in their thresholds for passing.</p> Agile Delegation <p>In a perfect world, where everyone had unlimited time and virtuosity, everybody would research, discuss, consider and carefully vote on every proposal. However, in a perfect world we do not live. Not everyone has the time or inclination to make a well-researched vote on every matter. Out of this realisation, the Council was born into Polkadot’s original governance: a body delegated by voters to make up for the fact that many of them did not want to take part in the day-to-day of governance. However, with the Council gone in Gov2, we need an alternative means of ensuring “passive” voters are heard.</p><p>The original governance system had a feature called Vote Delegation, which we have retained and improved upon in Gov2. For those not familiar, this is similar to premise of liquid democracy: you are able to delegate your voting power to another voter in the system. When your delegate votes, they wield not just their own voting power but yours too. This works with conviction voting, allowing you to lock up your tokens in order to increase the level of voting power your delegate wields on your behalf. Of course the tokens in question never leave your control and you are free to switch delegates or regain direct control back whenever you please.</p><p>Gov2, however, improves on this with a rather special feature called Multirole Delegation. This allows you to specify a different delegate for every class of referendum in the system. If you do not want to delegate for a particular class of referendum then you can also retain direct control for that class.</p><p>This means you can delegate to one individual for any referenda on dealing out small tips to ecosystem contributors, another entity for referenda on more substantial treasury spending, another entity for purely technical network upgrades and parameterisations and finally retain direct control for any other decisions!</p> The Fellowship and Whitelist <p>Well-informed “expert” opinion plays an important role in any well-functioning governance system. A technocracy comes with its own rather serious flaws and thus we would not want “experts” to be placed in a position of command: it introduces risks of centralisation, unaccountable authority and lays the groundwork for what could become ultimately a ruling cabal. It was for this reason that Polkadot’s original governance’s Technical Committee has no “deciding power” but only the ability to reduce the voting period.</p><p>That all said, oraclising well-informed opinion and allowing it to help optimise the decision-making process, even if it has no direct effect on the decision-making outcome seems like a reasonable goal to strive for. Crucially, and for the sake of all involved, it must not be possible in any way for the expert body to subvert the overall stakeholder decision.</p><p>Root-Origin proposals are the sort which are needed for upgrades, fixes and rescues, but which necessarily have the power to arbitrarily break and corrupt the system. In Gov2, because they are so dangerous, we err on the side of safety and have extremely high levels of approval and support needed for early-passing and which reduce to their final levels only slowly. The lead-in and enactment periods are also large. In general the process is slow, and this is to give everybody in Polkadot the maximum amount of notice to ensure that bad proposals don’t make it through.</p><p>However, there are occasions where it is important to roll out a fix, upgrade or rescue logic in a shorter period of time. We may be able to assume there is broad consensus in these times, but the safeguards on the voting process above mean that executing such a fix can be difficult or impractical due to time constraints alone. Oraclising the idea that “the experts agree: this is both safe and time-critical” can be a very useful tool in forming a clear process which is well-considered in the general case but able to make decisions on a tight timeline when there is good reason to believe that circumstances require it.</p><p>There remain two big questions to answer here: how could the chain (a deterministic blob of logic with no inherent ability to express or observe concepts as “safe” and “time-critical”? And even if it could know of such circumstances, how do we adapt our logic without compromising our overall tractability and simplicity?</p> The Fellowship <p>The answer to the first question lies in a new governance body. For those familiar with the old governance system, this body can be thought of as the logic successor to the Technical Committee.</p><p>It is named the Polkadot Fellowship, and in totality is a sufficiently rich and sophisticated structure that it will form the subject of a whole other article. It will initially run on the Kusama network, since Gov2 will be deployed there for live-testing purposes, however it will be migrated over to Polkadot with the final Gov2 deployment and once there it will serve both networks via the Polkadot/Kusama bridge.</p><p>The Fellowship is a mostly self-governing expert body with a primary goal of representing the humans who embody and contain the technical knowledge base of the Polkadot network and protocol. Unlike the current Technical Collective it is designed to be far broader in membership (i.e. to work well with even tens of thousands of members) and with far lower in barriers to entry (both in terms of administrative process flow and expectations of expertise). Becoming a candidate member in the Fellowship is as easy as placing a small deposit.</p><p>In order to help ensure a high quality of collective decisions in light of such a broad membership, members are associated with a rank to designate the degree to which the system expects their opinion to be well-informed, of a sound technical basis and in line with the interests of Polkadot. The members of the Fellowship can vote on any given Fellowship proposal and the aggregate opinion of the members (weighted by their rank) constitutes the Fellowship’s considered opinion.</p><p>Beautifully enough, the technical means by which the Fellowship votes is actually exactly the same code (Substrate pallet) as the means by which the Polkadot stakeholders vote in a referendum and it has exactly the same facilities (multiple tracks, agile delegation, &amp;c).</p> Ranks and Pitfalls <p>Introducing the concept of rank is fraught with pitfalls. However, we are presented with relatively few options if decentralisation, accountability and safety for all involved are our requirements. We believe it is reasonable to utilise the openness, transparency and corruption-resistance that decentralised consensus brings to ensure that any “rulers” are not themselves above the “rules” and that rank comes with clear expectations, rules and accountability. The downsides of rank are not just bad for the network but also, in light of some recent decentralised-technology policy positions of politicians, are also bad for the participants: if rank allowed a small group of participants to have effective control over the network they could be considered in effective control of it and thus responsible for what happened on it.</p><p>As such, we adhere to three principles: firstly, the Fellowship must never have hard power over the network: it cannot change parameters, conduct rescues, or move assets. Concerning governance over the network, the only thing in its power is to reduce the effective timeline on which a referendum takes place.</p><p>Secondly, the rank system and weights must be designed so that we would not expect small groups of individuals to be able to capture and control overall decision-making capacity. While the Fellowship weights those with higher rank more in the aggregate opinion, the weight should not be so high as to make a small number of higher members’ opinions be insurmountable when compared to a coherent opinion coming from lower-ranked membership.</p><p>Thirdly, the Fellowship should be designed to grow and develop its membership and their aggregate levels of expertise and in doing ensure that its overall decision-making capacity gets stronger over time. For long-term success, the Fellowship must be an effective meritocracy where those with commitment, talent and expertise rise to greater levels of influence. To achieve this, we must give clarity and transparency to the process of entry and promotion through the ranks. To the highest degree possible, an individual’s identity should not form a consideration, only their ability.</p><p>In light of this, the Fellowship will have a constitution which describes in specific terms the requirements and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank. Higher ranks are able to vote and promote lower ranks voting based on this constitution. Demotion happens automatically after a period in which a member is unable to defend their position to their peers. Suspension can happen only through general (Polkadot) referendum, providing a means of ensuring that controversy or unpopularity within the Fellowship does not (necessarily) result in expulsion. Furthermore, to guard against the chance of the Fellowship becoming a cabal, entrance into the top tiers of ranks also requires a full (Polkadot) referendum and cannot be bestowed merely by ones Fellowship peers.</p> The Whitelist <p>While the Fellowship may be able to represent Polkadot’s body of human experts on-chain and provide a piece of deterministic logic from which to source their aggregate opinion, it may be unclear how we can integrate this into the overall referendum system. In fact, this is achieved using a combination of concepts we already know and a wonderfully simple piece of on-chain logic called the Whitelist pallet.</p><p>The Whitelist pallet does one thing: it allows one Origin to escalate the privilege level of another Origin for a certain operation. In terms of Gov2, it allows the Fellowship to authorise a new origin (which we will call Whitelisted-Root) to be executed with Root-level privileges. You can think of it as a sort of Unix <code>sudo</code>, except that it only works with specific commands that the Fellowship have pre-authorised. What this means is that we can have a new track in Polkadot’s governance which is for proposals which will have been whitelisted by the Fellowship. If the referendum passes, then they will be executed inside of the Whitelist pallet with this Whitelisted-Root origin. The Whitelist pallet verifies two things: that this origin really is the Whitelisted-Root (i.e. that the referendum passed on this track) and that the proposal has indeed been whitelisted by the Fellowship. If so then it goes ahead and executes the operation with Root-level privileges.</p><p>With this we don’t need to change anything about how the referendum system works (yey!). We now have a new track (for the Whitelisted-Root origin) whose parameters allow for a shorter voting turnaround, safe in the knowledge that through an open and transparent process, a body of global experts on the Polkadot protocol has determined that this is both safe and time-critical.</p> Timeline &amp; Future work <p>Gov2 is set to launch on Kusama imminently, following final professional audit of its code. Once tested on Kusama, a proposal will be made for the Polkadot network to vote on.</p><p>An update to this overall governance system, codenamed “Gov2.5”, is planned for eventual deployment some months afterwards. It will two bring key features: firstly a “collect-call” feature for vote delegation, essentially allowing users (via their wallets) to offer their funds up for delegation without paying any transaction fees; instead the delegate would be able to optionally pay the transaction fees to get the funds delegated. Secondly, a free undelegation transaction will be introduced, able to be used in a limited capacity by all delegating users. Together these features enable wallets to offer a highly streamlined and zero-cost governance integration to their users, which we hope will entice more involvement in the overall governance process from users.</p>

<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#tldr-2"></a>TLDR 
 
 Blockchain technology enables decentralized and self-sovereign identities including new mechanisms for creating, resolving, and revoking them. 
 The public availability of data records has allowed attacks that combine sophisticated heuristics with auxiliary information to compromise users’ privacy and deanonymize their identities. 
 We review and categorize Bitcoin privacy attacks, investigate their impact on one of the Bitcoin-based identity methods namely did:btcr, and analyze and discuss its privacy properties. 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#core-research-question-3"></a>Core Research Question 
<p>How can we categorize Bitcoin privacy attacks, and investigate privacy issues in did:btcr?</p>

<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#background-5"></a>Background 
<p>Entities (e.g., users and organizations), use global unique identifiers such as telephone numbers, ID, or URLs. However, these identifiers are often issued and managed by central authorities. Blockchain-based decentralized identifiers have been proposed to prove an identifier’s ownership without having to rely on a trusted entity.</p>
 
 
Decentralized identifier (DID): A string that includes three main parts: the scheme, the DID method, and the DID method identifier, which should be unique within the DID method. 
 
DID document: Contains information about the verification methods and the service endpoints required to interact with the DID subjects. 
 
DID subject: The entity that is identified by the DID, and can be a person, an object or an organization. 
 
DID method: Defines how DIDs are created, resolved, updated, and revoked. 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#summary-6"></a>Summary 
 
 We review and categorize privacy attacks on the Bitcoin blockchain, which may reveal the links between addresses and real-world identities, and also correlate between different identities. 
 We address Bitcoin privacy attacks’ impact on the DID method did:btcr. 
 We adopted the privacy terminology from RFC 6973. 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#method-7"></a>Method 
<p>Four main steps for collecting and selecting relevant literature:</p>
 
 research questions identification 
 literature search 
 literature selection 
 data extraction 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#results-8"></a>Results 
 
 
<p>We categorized Bitcoin privacy attacks into four main categories (i) heuristics, (ii) side channel attacks, (iii) flow analysis, and (iv) auxiliary information.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
<p>We showed how data analysis of Bitcoin public records, in combination with auxiliary information can be exploited using sophisticated heuristics, to reveal or correlate transactions, identities, or addresses of users.</p>
 
 
<p>This study has demonstrated that although BTCR provides some advantages such as protection against censorship, integrity, access, and a degree of decentralization; it still lacks methods to deal with the privacy issues identified in this paper.</p>
 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#discussion-and-key-takeaways-9"></a>Discussion and Key Takeaways 
<p>We investigate the privacy of the method did:btcr based on the criteria adopted from RFC 6973.</p>
 
 
Surveillance: Any kind of observation and monitoring of the users, whether the users are aware of the surveillance or not, can influence a user’s the privacy.
 
 Auxiliary information is obtained through the interactions with services using DIDs. 
 Blockchain is immutable, no way to delete the history. 
 
 
 
Correlation: The combination of different information, which relates to one user.
 
 Using the same DID or DID document for interacting with different services helps to trace and correlate user activities. 
 Using the same public keys in different DID documents can reveal the link between the corresponding DIDs. 
 The IP address of an entity can compromise the relationship of common controls, linking between different DIDs. 
 Timing analysis can correlate users’ activities using the same service endpoint in the DID documents. 
 
 
 
Identification: Relating the information to a specific user.
 
 If the Bitcoin address associated to a DID is later spent, it can link the address used for DID to other addresses owned by the user. 
 The visibility of the DID document can leak the metadata about the attributes and provide information about the service endpoints. 
 If the DID document is stored in the third-party server, the latter may identify the real DID owner. 
 If the DID document is stored on a user’s own server, it can correlate the user IP address with the DID document. 
 
 
 
Secondary Use: Collecting the information about a user without their consent and using it for purposes other than that which the information was collected for.
 
 Read/resolve makes it possible to trace the DID use if it is accessed by third party services (e.g., universal DID resolver). 
 The verifier can trace the transaction flow, check the history of the UTXOs! 
 DID real identity can be compromised if used in services that require information about the users or their activities (e.g., social networks). 
 
 
 
Disclosure: Exposure of information about a user which violates the confidentiality of the shared data.
 
 Privacy may be lost in the economic activities for the services authenticated by DIDs. 
 BTCR updates reveal the public key of the previous DID or changing the access control. 
 
 
 
Misattribution: Whenever a user’s data or communications are attributed to another, which can consequently affect the user’s reputation.
 
 Using indistinguishable mixing techniques can relate the users’ UTXOs to someone else. 
 
 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#implications-and-follow-ups-10"></a>Implications and Follow-Ups 
<p>Future research will consist of elaborating and developing new methods, or using existing privacy-enhancing techniques (e.g., mixing techniques, zero-knowledge proofs) to address the aforementioned privacy issues.</p>
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#applicability-11"></a>Applicability 
 
 This work can improve privacy countermeasures for DIDs BTCR. 
 It can also provide comprehensive privacy attacks for privacy threat modeling. 
 Our future work contains privacy threat modeling based on LINDDUN. The paper will appear on <a href="https://ptmworkshop.gitlab.io/#/proceedings">PTM Workshop</a> under the name “User-Centric Public Blockchain Privacy Threats”.

 The Veil community is dear to us 

<p>At the Veil Project we consider all contributors to be part of the Veil family, whether an Original Generation team member, or one who joined us later, and they are very welcome to contribute again to Veil, whenever possible.</p>

<p>There are some staff who are no longer able to be involved as team members. codeofalltrades, dango and mados, we appreciate the work they have done, especially most recently, codeofalltrades, who has made significant contributions to the robustness of Veil’s core software. Cavespectre also has had to curtail his active development, as you may notice if checking Github.</p>

<p>While this blog has evidently been sadly neglected, it should change from this time onward. To catch up on other  staff changes, please welcome us77ipis (Github ID) Johns5937 (on Discord) for his recent and ongoing contributions as an evidently motivated Bounty Developer. We are currently considering a reduction in the ProgPow DAG GPU memory size and are aware of arguments for and against this. If you would like to weigh in on the subject, please feel free to join our Discord mining channel, and/or our Veil-Dev Discord if you are able to contribute to writing code and testing submissions on our test and development networks.</p>

<p>Also please welcome Zannick. Although we have not yet got around to creating a staff page for him, he has been a developer in the team since 2021, contributed some important bug fixes, reviewing other devs’ code submissions, and is working on the future RingCT staking upgrade.</p>

<p>Steel97 (Github ID) IVAN (on Discord), also no staff profile page yet, should be recognised for his neat replacement of the Veil block explorers, which brings efficiency improvements.</p>

 Light wallet is coming (with the Zelcore desktop wallet — later will be the mobile wallet) 

<p>Blondfrogs currently has a  major upgrade in progress for the inclusion of Veil in the awesome Zelcore wallet. This is a light wallet, so it does not require the Veil user to maintain the full blockchain history on their own computer. Furthermore, Veil’s inclusion will be using RingCT anonymous transactions! When this is available, it will be announced in our NEWS updates. Although Blondfrogs is an OG Veil developer, this submission he is working on is done in his capacity as a developer for the Zelcore team, so he is not expected, although is very welcome, to do other regular contributions to Veil’s code.</p>

  Brave's new system STAR protects user privacy by ensuring the data users contribute are never unique to that user. This property, sometimes called k-anonymity, ensures that the data collector can only see a submitted value if the same value has also been submitted by some number of other users.

<p>This is the nineteenth post in an <a>ongoing, regular series</a> describing new and upcoming privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Alex Davidson, Peter Snyder, eV Quirk, Joseph Genereux, Benjamin Livshits, and Hamed Haddadi. This post was written by Senior Director of Privacy Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>Researchers at Brave have developed <a>STAR</a><a>1</a>, a system that allows users to participate in private data collection, under cryptographic guarantees that their data will be readable only if other users have contributed the exact same values. Such systems are important for performing privacy-protecting, Web-scale measurements of software (sometimes referred to as analytics or telemetry).</p>
<p>STAR’s main goals are to provide strong privacy guarantees while still being usable and affordable for small-to-medium sized companies. Existing systems<a>2</a> are extremely expensive to deploy (making them unusable for all but the largest companies), require trusted third-parties or special hardware, and/or require millions of users to achieve useful results. STAR, by contrast, provides privacy guarantees similar to, or better than, existing systems, while being practical and affordable for projects and organizations serving anywhere from dozens to millions of users.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10074">STAR system</a> will be presented at the <a href="https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2022/">2022 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS)</a> in Los Angeles, and is being discussed for possible standardization in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dss-star/">IETF</a>. STAR is available in an <a href="https://github.com/brave/sta-rs">open source Rust implementation</a>, and will be used to protect user privacy in many current and future Brave products.</p>

 Privacy-preserving data collection through k-anonymity&nbsp; 
<p>Collecting data on how software is used in detail can be helpful for both developers and users. Developers can use this information to fix bugs and optimize code; users benefit from better software.</p>
<p>But capturing this user data carries the ethical and often legal responsibility of collecting it in a privacy preserving way. We emphasize that collecting data in a privacy-protecting manner is a necessary, but not sufficient, part of ethical data collection. Users should always be in control and aware when contributing data.</p>
<p>Brave’s new system STAR protects user privacy by ensuring the data users contribute are never unique to that user. This property, sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity">k-anonymity</a>, ensures that the data collector can only see a submitted value if the same value has also been submitted by some number of other users. K-anonymity (and thus the STAR system) prevents the data collector from ever seeing values that are unique—this means the values can’t be used to identify users.</p>
<p>K-anonymity is one of many approaches for ensuring privacy during data collection<a>3</a>, each with different strengths and weaknesses. STAR adopts k-anonymity because:</p>
 
 It embodies an easy to understand approach to privacy. 
 It successfully allows the data collector to learn the “heavy hitters” (i.e., the most commonly shared values) without requiring very large user bases. 
 The applications targeted by STAR are not the kinds of cases where k-anonymity systems have been attacked in the past. 
 

 A simple k-anonymity example: ice cream 
<p>As an example of how k-anonymity protects user privacy, consider this fake example:</p>
<p>An organization wants to learn about their employees’ favorite ice cream flavor. But people only want to participate in this ice-cream survey if they’re assured the organization can’t learn whether they voted. Participants want anonymity.</p>
<p>People who cast ballots for chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry (or other common flavors) aren’t at risk—many&nbsp; people like these flavors, so the organization can’t learn much about who voted, if they voted for a common flavor.</p>
<p>However, votes for uncommon flavors of ice cream do risk revealing who gave that answer. If everyone knows a person’s favorite flavor of ice cream is olive—and if that person completed the survey—the organization will be pretty confident about who submitted that answer.</p>
<p>With k-anonymity, the “olive” answer would be removed before the data is ever analyzed.</p>
<p>At essence, k-anonymity is an approach to data collection that builds on the ice cream example: It allows the party collecting data to see common, popular values, but does not allow the data collector to see rare (and therefore potentially identifying) values.</p>

 K-anonymity is difficult in practice 
<p>K-anonymity is simple in concept, but difficult to build in practice. For example, who decides (and how) which values are common or rare without revealing the potentially identifying values in the first place?</p>
<p>One sub-optimal option would be to let a neutral third-party count the values first, before those values are shared with the data collector. But that only introduces a “shell game” of trusting privacy to the third-party instead of the data collector; the same privacy risk still exists.</p>
<p>There are many other similar difficulties when trying to implement real-world k-anonymity systems.</p>
<p>With STAR, we’ve found a way to achieve k-anonymity without these suboptimal verifications.</p>

 STAR achieves k-anonymity cheaply and securely 
<p>STAR is a practical, effective, and cheap way to build data collection systems that protect k-anonymity. STAR differs from existing systems by being the first deployed system to achieve each of the following goals:</p>
<p>Cheap to deploy: STAR is extremely fast and does not require special hardware. This means that STAR can be deployed by everything from small hobbyist projects to large, multi-million-user software projects. In our simulations, STAR is 24 times cheaper than the existing state-of-the-art approach<a>4</a>.</p>
<p>Easy to understand: STAR uses a unique combination of existing, vetted, and well understood cryptographic tools (i.e., symmetric encryption to encrypt data, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing">Shamir secret sharing</a> to enforce k-anonymity, and verifiable oblivious pseudorandom functions to boost randomness). Using existing cryptographic tools (rather than relying on novel cryptographic primitives) means more people can safely implement, deploy, and audit STAR systems.</p>
<p>Strong privacy guarantees: STAR delivers privacy similar or superior to existing state-of-the-art systems, including fallback protections in the case of server compromise<a>5</a>.</p>
<p>Accurate results with small user bases: STAR provides strong accuracy guarantees, even with small numbers of users. This is unlike other existing approaches<a>6</a> that provide accurate results only when thousands or millions of users contribute results.</p>
<p>Doesn’t require special hardware: STAR runs on standard computing hardware, and can thus be deployed on personal servers, standard cloud infrastructure, or any other stock hardware. This ensures STAR can be used by more projects, especially those with smaller budgets (unlike some existing systems that rely on special “trusted” hardware, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/">AWS Nitro</a> or <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html">Intel SGX</a>).</p>

 Using STAR to protect user privacy 
<p>Brave has developed STAR as a practical, real-world focused system for improving user privacy. While we hope others will use STAR to protect privacy in their own projects, the primary aim was to allow users to share data with Brave in a way that still preserves privacy.</p>
<p>To that end, Brave is making three commitments with STAR:</p>
<p>First, Brave will use STAR in its own products, in cases where we give users the option to allow data collection. For example, Brave’s <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-">Web Discovery Project</a> uses a form of STAR to allow users to share browsing information to help build the Brave Search index. Similarly, we’ve incorporated STAR into the <a>“Privacy Preserving Product Analytics” (P3A)</a> system that allows users to share browser usage data with Brave.</p>
<p>More important, even with STAR’s protections, Brave users will always have the option not to share data with Brave. STAR is intended only to add additional privacy protections to data that users want to share, rather than to allow Brave to collect more data about users.</p>
<p>Second, Brave is developing STAR in the open, for other projects to use, adopt, or modify as they choose. Brave maintains both <a href="https://github.com/brave/sta-rs">Rust</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brave/sta-rs/blob/main/star-wasm/src/lib.rs">WASM</a> versions of STAR, and both are published under the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/">Mozilla Public License v2</a>.</p>
<p>Third, Brave is working to standardize STAR in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as part of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ppm/about/">Privacy Preserving Measurements</a> working group. Our goal is to ensure that there is a standards-based way for small organizations to collect data in a privacy-respecting way.</p>
<p>For specifics on how STAR works, and how it delivers k-anonymity protections safely and efficiently, <a>please see our full research paper</a>.</p>

         The Listeners                <p>By Lacy Warner</p><p>Photography: MARK DAVIS</p><p>Published July 14, 2022</p>            <p>For Deepika Bodapati and Tanay Tandon of Athelas, paying attention is a superpower.</p>       



 
 
   
<p>Four years ago, Deepika Bodapati was up late, staring at her computer and doing something rather unusual for a founder of a startup soon to achieve unicorn status: she was reading all the support tickets that came through her company, Athelas’, website. “Once in a while, we’ll have our employees’ parents write in,” Bodapati says with a laugh. “But I read every single thing because I just thought it was super interesting.” As Bodapati waded through the queries and suggestions, studying how her sales team handled issues, she noticed one woman, Dr. Deanna Kelly, writing in again and again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She was very persistent,” Bodapati recalls. Dr. Kelly, Chief and Director of the Treatment Research Program at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, was asking to study the Athelas One device, claiming she could help Bodapati further develop and test the machine. Bodapati knew that she and her co-founder, Tanay Tandon, were looking at an arduous application process for their second FDA clearance and would need all the support they could get. So Bodapati did what she was best at: she picked up the phone and listened to what Dr. Kelly had to say. This approach has come to define her ability to build both a better product and a better business.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Listening has always been central to Bodapati’s creative process. Listening closely to both the data and her intuition led to the Athelas One, which is the only FDA-approved, internet-connected finger-prick device that tests white blood cell and neutrophil counts at home and then shares that information directly with healthcare providers. The Athelas One is a small black cylinder, similar in appearance to an Alexa device. In a traditional lab, pathologists take a drop of blood, put it on a slide, smear and stain it and place it under a microscope to determine cell counts. Athelas One uses computer vision and machine learning to automate the process, and then sends the information to a healthcare team. Athelas is a leader in producing portable devices for remote patient monitoring (RPM), a growing sector of the global healthcare market that may be worth more than $175.2 billion by 2027. The need for such an industry was revealed during the pandemic, but RPM can benefit anyone from patients with chronic diseases who need to consistently track their medical data, to elderly or disabled individuals for whom a trip to the doctor’s office can be cumbersome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As lifelong scientists, the founders knew Athelas One needed data proving, beyond doubt, that it worked consistently and accurately; as entrepreneurs, they knew a trial, as soon as possible, would be essential for the company’s development. When the duo participated in Y Combinator, they found themselves among a handful of potential competitors—but none of them had run a clinical trial yet. Bodapati and Tandon knew this could make them stand out to potential customers, partners and collaborators. “There was no option,” Bodapati says. “There would be no company if there was no trial.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Setting up a clinical trial is complicated, and, through an acquaintance, Bodapati had a lead on a hospital in Juarez, Mexico, a city of 1.5 million across the border from El Paso, Texas. In 2016, Bodapati and Tandon conducted their first clinical trial for Athelas One.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati says that the hospital instantly saw the value in the Athelas One device for their patients. “We were able to set up a table, where, on one side we had our device, and on the other side was the nurse who was drawing blood to compare with the Athelas One samples (to make sure they were accurate). And then we told them, ‘Free blood testing for anyone for the next three days.’” Bodapati sat at a table in the hallway with the Athelas One and its finger-pricking lancets and glass test strips, and Tandon sat in another room reviewing the results on a computer monitor. The response was overwhelming. Patients came from all over, alone at first, and then the next day with their families. One patient, at the hospital for a routine appointment with their doctor, had blood drawn at the Athelas table on a whim—a whim that would be life altering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Tandon saw this patient’s blood cell images on his laptop, he knew instantly that something was wrong. Over several days, he’d been reviewing hundreds of blood test results, all displaying the normal range of white blood cells, between 6,000 and 8,000, but this patient had a count of well over 40,000. Tandon immediately got up to show Bodapati the results. The two also saw that the cells were immature, which indicated mass proliferation of leukocytes, a type of white blood cell. Tandon and Bodapati knew what this meant: the patient had leukemia. But because Athelas One had yet to receive FDA approval as a diagnostic tool, they couldn’t speak directly to the patient. They were, however, able to alert the hospital staff that the patient needed to be tested for cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati remembers flying back to California days later and sitting quietly next to Tandon, both of them struck by the force of what had happened. She felt the weight of the results, presented in such a personal way to someone they’d seen face-to-face. Though the two were mainly silent on the flight, Bodapati was listening to something—an inner voice describing not only the future of her company, but possibilities for the good she could do, the change she could drive in the healthcare industry more broadly. “Imagine if you could do that all the time with really cheap tools?” Bodapati asks. “You go in, you sign your name, you prick your finger. You get told right there. You don’t have to go to your appointment, then go to a different place and get your lab drawn.” It took another three weeks for the hospital to confirm the patient’s leukemia diagnosis that Bodapati and Tandon saw in minutes. Tandon was haunted by the fact that the patient had come in for a regular doctor’s appointment, “But because healthcare today is not quantitative, it’s traditional, you come in, you get some symptomatic analysis and they’ll tell you to go home and rest.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s when it clicked,” Bodapati recalls, referencing that solemn flight. “It’s this concept of making tools so cheap, so usable, that people can do it all the time. Only then can you actually get preventive care.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia Capital who collaborates closely with Athelas, happened to already be questioning the landscape of available medical testing technology when he met the co-founders while they were participating in the Y Combinator startup accelerator. Lin’s father was undergoing chemotherapy, and Lin was frustrated that the most reliable method of testing whether his father had an infection was to take his temperature. If a chemotherapy patient has a fever that spikes above 101.3, they’re told to go to the emergency room. But to Lin, the thermometer felt like an inadequate diagnostic tool, based on what always happened next. “I just found that so silly. What if it’s 101.2 and it’s not .3?” Lin asks. “The first thing that happened every time I took my father to the emergency room was they take his temperature, his blood pressure and look at his vitals. And then the next immediate thing they did was to take a full blood count.” Lin, like Bodapati and Tandon, felt there had to be a faster, more accurate way of putting the needs of the patient first: “Tanay and Deepika were on a mission to figure out a more comprehensive test than a thermometer,” Lin says</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Sometimes the signals Bodapati is listening for come from places like support tickets; other times they’re literally knocking on the door. The company wouldn’t be where it is today had Bodapati and Tandon not been pursued by their first test user, a Stanford University student and basketball player named Michael Morris. “Michael was an inventor at heart,” Tandon tells me, “A lot of the ideas around how we could make the device user-friendly came from him.” Morris was also a cancer patient who needed constant monitoring of his white blood cell count. When he heard about how two of his college classmates were experimenting with a machine that might help him, he showed up at their office in Mountain View—a barely refurbished liquor store—ready to be their guinea pig. Tanay and Bodapati had been building since their high school science fair days, and—with Tanay’s background in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and Bodapati’s time spent internering at her uncle Dr. Sanjiv Gambhir’s molecular imaging research lab at Stanford—the two friends were able to make a prototype for an in-home blood testing kit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[Morris] brought this energy with him that would just take over the office,” Tandon says. “And it was so helpful for the early team of 4 or 5 people to see an actual patient talk about how important this was, and how much you wanted to track these critical metrics.” Using Athelas One consistently over the next couple of months, Morris noticed a disturbing trend in his cell count. His cancer therapy wasn’t working anymore. “He asked us to go to a doctor’s appointment with him,” Bodapati reveals. “It felt so personal because he was showing the doctor his results, and telling him that the cancer was back.” In that office, supporting her friend—a sick man holding tightly to his wife’s hand—Bodapati saw again how valuable Athelas could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after this moment, the FDA sent Bodapati and Tandon an additional information request for Athelas One, a kind of auditing the agency does to further analyze efficacy. The Jaurez trial proved to Bodapati and Tandon that Athelas One worked, and that they were right to believe in their new business. But the FDA wanted more, including other trials. Though it’s fairly standard to receive such a request, the 40-plus line questionnaire was daunting, demanding another 8 months of data collection and an additional trial, which still wouldn’t guarantee FDA approval. Yet Bodapati says Morris’ belief in the device kept them going, with the paperwork and the eventual second trial that led to their FDA approval. His constant presence energized the staff, and his input on how to better Athelas One for its users was crucial, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, Michael Morris passed away. “Michael really believed in it,” Bodapati says, naming him as one of their first true advocates; a guiding light urging them forward. “He told us, ‘It’s too late for me, but make sure you bring it to other people.’”</p>



<p>Bodapati has been hearing those words ever since.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flights have been their own recurring theme during Bodapati and Tandon’s long friendship. They first bonded on a flight as teenagers when competing on the elite science fair circuit, an extracurricular they participated in with such intensity that they joke about it being a competitive sport. (As a preteen Bodapati even invented a test strip that could detect whether vegetables were contaminated with salmonella and E. coli. It was her first foray into microfluidics, working with and studying how fluids move in miniature devices and the spaces within them, which later came to play a large part in the development of Athelas One.) The experience of going from competitors to friends and collaborators eventually brought Bodapati and Tandon together as co-founders. “I know his strengths. He knows my strengths. We knew one another when we were competing, so it was the rawest form of each other,” Bodapati says. Lin even recalls the two of them finishing each other’s sentences, describing Tandon as verbose while Bodapati is a grounding presence. If Bodapati is the listener, then Tandon is the talker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati has been honing her listening skills since childhood—both in her family home and in her uncle’s Stanford research lab. Her parents were small tech business owners with companies in the United States and India, and because of the time difference, they were often on the phone with their teams abroad while dropping Bodapati off at school. Sitting in the backseat, Bodapati could hear the chatter of business deals considered, strategies debated, negotiations made. Bodapati’s brother, Sunil, also remembers, “After dinner, we would hear them get on the phone to kick off early meetings with the India team, and we were able to listen to how they approached deals, how they structured them. We were there when deals went through, there when deals fell through, there when employees quit. So we got to see what it was like to go through the highs of the lows [of running a business] in a very visceral way.”</p>



<p>Bodapati tells me that sometimes the training was more explicit, though; her father would encourage the family to have what he called “pitch night,” teaching the kids how to really sell their latest science experiment. “My dad would always tell us, ‘You can’t just explain the science; convey it in a way that is compelling—what’s the practical implication of the project?’” Sunil, who is the CEO of his own healthcare startup, Enable Medicine, says that while he and his sister learned business from their parents, it was their beloved uncle, Dr. Gambhir, who instilled in them a love of science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Gambhir, chair of radiology at Stanford and a pioneer in advancing techniques for molecular imaging and early detection of cancer, died of cancer in 2020 at 57. Bodapati tells me that she believes if her uncle were still alive he would be awarded for his work with a Nobel Prize. He wanted not just to innovate, she says, but also to truly improve the lives of those affected by cancer. Bodapati’s years spent working in her uncle’s lab and listening to his stories and advice, led her to want to revolutionize preventive care, to improve people’s lives holistically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, Dr. Gambhir’s work and research became deeply personal: his teenage son, Milan, was diagnosed with the aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme—the exact tumor type Dr. Gambhir had been studying. Tragically, Milan died two years later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati shares the story his uncle told the lab the first time he returned after Milan’s death and how she internalized it, becoming ever more motivated to create positive change, even from terrible loss. Dr. Gambhir gathered his staff at the office and told them a fable credited to several Native American tribes: a grandfather is teaching his grandson about life and reveals that every person has two warring wolves within them. One wolf represents resentment, petty jealousy and sorrow, while the other is hope, compassion and faith. The grandson asks his grandfather which wolf wins in the end; the grandfather responds, “Whichever one we feed.” With that, Dr. Gambhir turned to his colleagues, bowed his head and said, “Let’s remember that’s what we’re doing here.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Dr. Gambhir continued to research early cancer detection, he became a leader in developing tools that could passively monitor patient health by collecting data in minimally intrusive ways, like a smart toilet that tests stool and urine for early signs of disease. Gambhir dreamed of a proactive healthcare system, one preventive and holistic, rather than focused on fixing problems individually as they arise. Today, Bodapati is working to make this a reality. “Part of who I am now is because of the work that I did with him and his lab,” Bodapati says. Sunil underscores his sister’s feelings: “You know that if you can move the needle in a significant way for human progress, then you kind of have an obligation to do that.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>On the opposite side of the country, in the suburbs of Baltimore, Dr. Deanna Kelly, Director and Chief of the Treatment Research Program at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, was trying to develop or find a point-of-care device that would help her treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients gain access to the antipsychotic drug clozapine. One of clozapine’s side effects is neutropenia—too few white blood cells to fight off infection—and tracking a patient’s white blood cell count requires regular testing. When the FDA cleared clozapine for use, it did so with the mandate that patients get labs drawn every week for the first 6 months, then every two weeks for the next 6 months, then once a month for their course of treatment, which, for most patients, is a lifetime. This would be a difficult task for anyone, let alone someone suffering from paranoia and delusion.</p>



<p>For the last 20 years Dr. Kelly had been working with clozapine, and believed it would be life-changing for many people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. She believed that the drug could be the difference between a patient living in a closed facility or leading an independent life with a steady job and stable relationships. “Often doctors believe that though this drug would be life changing for their patient, it’s just too much of a liability to have them on it’” Bodapati says. “Or patients feel that even though they know the drug is good for them, they simply can’t manage all these steps.’”</p>



<p>Dr. Kelly says up to 30 percent, or more, of people diagnosed with schizophrenia are labeled “treatment resistant,” and it doesn’t take much for a patient to receive such a designation. “The guidelines tell us that [after] two failed trials of antipsychotics, someone should be considered treatment resistant,” Dr. Kelly says.</p>



<p>Dr. Kelly and her colleagues at University of Maryland College Park were experimenting with electrochemical detection for monitoring blood levels and neutrophil counts, but they weren’t getting far. “Once I heard about Athelas, I was like, I don’t know if this is too good to be true,” Dr. Kelly recalls. “Then I kept reaching out and kept thinking this is going to be a major advantage and a major breakthrough to revolutionize our care.” Fortunately for her, Bodapati listened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Kelly was thrilled when Athelas One received its second FDA clearance for at-home use. This allows the results to be instantaneously sent to a doctor and a pharmacist, who then ships the medication directly to the patient—meaning the patient has to do little more than prick their finger in the privacy of their own bedroom. Dr. Kelly says some of her patients are poor, lack transportation, or have cognitive impairments, things that make participating in a traditional healthcare system nearly impossible. “The way Athelas did it was clever: merging these results that you get back to the [risk evaluation management] system, coupled with the ability to order in a pharmacy. That’s a game changer.”</p>



<p>Bodapati and her team worked to get Athelas One in California state hospitals, specifically in forensic facilities and county medical facilities that treat a significant number of homeless patients with drug-resistant schizophrenia. By this time, HLS Therapeutics, one of the makers of clozapine, heard about Bodapati and Tandon’s work and offered the duo a rare opportunity to partner, broadening their reach into mental healthcare and beyond oncology in ways they never expected.</p>



<p>Cliff Weitzman is CEO of the text-to-speech audio reader Speechify, and has been part of a support network for a friend who hasn’t responded to most antipsychotics. Weitzman describes this experience as hopeless. “What Athelas gave us was hope. When this happens, you lose control. When someone breaks their arm you can see it, but when it’s mental it’s scary” he says. “They might stop eating, stop drinking, stop being able to function. You lose all control, and that’s very scary. And there’s nothing you can do. And then you go to doctors, and there’s nothing that doctors can do either. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wietzman took time off work and flew all over America to speak with top psychiatrists. After that year, he discovered the potential of clozapine in a Facebook group. “The first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth doctor you talked to does not bring up clozapine,” Weitzman says. “We went on Facebook groups of patients who have similar problems, and the only success stories we heard often were from patients who use clozapine. And we’re like, well, what is clozapine?” Weitzman believes that clozapine wasn’t even considered by the patient’s medical team because it’s not only difficult for the user, but it’s also a burden for the doctor prescribing it. “It’s a lot of work because the doctor every week has to go to the portal, click the button, make sure that the regulation is there. Doctors don’t want to do that. That’s not why they went to medical school.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Athelas One had broken down the primary barrier to doctors prescribing clozapine. “Now it’s a realistic thing that we can use,” says Weitzman. He believes the company has the ability not only to help millions of people with previously untreatable diagnoses, but also to offer relief to their support networks, helping them to reconnect with their loved ones. “You’ve gone from a state of scary, helpless, hopeless, to empowered, assisted, supported, hopeful. So it gives hope. That’s a very special thing that very few companies can say they succeed in doing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>When the pandemic hit, Bodapati found herself listening again, this time for insight on how Athelas could transition from diagnostic to preventive care. “We realized we had an opportunity where the world is on pause, and we’ve collected all of these interesting lessons from getting this FDA clearance and then launching in some of these incredible health systems and clinics,” says Tandon. “We can continue to operate as a traditional biotech or we can synthesize this knowledge and turn it into something a lot bigger that can really serve the population that we touch and help them work through COVID, but also create this transition to preventive health.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati spotted an opportunity when she was on a sales call with a psychiatrist named Dr. Gustavo Alva from southern California. Bodapati asked him to tell her about his other patients, those who weren’t on clozapine—what were their needs? Dr. Alva said he had thousands of patients, a large percentage of whom were on medications with side effects like weight gain, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. When Bodapati asked how he was monitoring his patients’ long-term health, he replied that it was often left up to the primary care doctor. Bodapati didn’t hesitate. She asked Dr. Alva to connect her to some of his patients who would be open to chatting so she could discern if Athelas could help. On the calls, she heard that they often didn’t see a GP, just their specialist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on these calls, Bodapati and Tandon started building a suite of predictive, internet-connected tools that worked together to monitor a patient’s health. Shortly, she went back to Dr. Alva and asked him how valuable it would be if she could give specific patients glucometers, weight scales and blood pressure cuffs that all recorded the patient’s results at home and sent the results to a healthcare team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the call ended, the two had roughed out a path toward a collaboration that led to an order for more than 800 patients. The Athelas team got to work, reaching out to potential patients, getting them the devices and onboarding them. Then the Athelas team set the patients up with a nursing team. “Once we got them on the program and they were continuously testing, [Dr. Alva]&nbsp; told us how powerful it was to engage these chronically ill patients from their homes. It was something he had been attempting for decades,” Bodapati says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati and Tandon then developed an app that allows the patients to record their information and schedule appointments. “That’s how our product grew,” says Bodapati. “And overnight, our average deal size went from 10 patients to 600.” The co-founders have also created a pill tracker that works in tandem with the Athelas One for any patient for whom tracking their medication is a burden—a device that can help the provider as well as the patient to determine whether the medication is working or if it’s not being taken correctly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As soon as Bodapati attempted to bill for the remote patient monitoring Athelas was now offering, she started to wade through the insurance coding maze and realized how opaque the current medical billing system really is: “As a business, you need to know how much money you’re making, and as the CEO of the business, you need to have that information within 30 seconds. It was very clear that the doctors had no idea,” says Bodapati “You don’t really know where your money is coming from, how it’s segmented. It’s a black box.” Again, Bodapati saw a need and developed a solution; Athelas is now an innovator in remote patient monitoring and in revenue cycle management (RCM), helping private practices and provider groups bill appropriately and consistently. Now Bodapati says that RCM has become a core part of Athelas’ future, joining a $126.1 billion industry.</p>



<p>Lin sees a future of Athelas that goes beyond monitoring the sick to one connecting all people with preventive care. Now Bodapati is scaling up teams and connecting with as many hospital systems and provider groups as she can, having already partnered with Palomar Health System and Horizon Family Medical, which, she says, together represent approximately 100,000 patients. “What’s been most rewarding working with Deepika and Tanay, when they get close to their vision, they’re always very, very good at expanding it,” Lin says.&nbsp;Bodapati believes that improving the healthcare industry and making it more accessible is simply a matter of finding the people who need help and listening to them. What she doesn’t mention is the hard work, the designing, fabricating and testing that the listening leads to. This work has shepherded Athelas to become, in Bodapati’s words, the sensor and software infrastructure for running a modern healthcare business, with a unique value proposition of identifying “hard to discern” commonalities between stakeholders. Her insights are the key to this success. “We found that people are so much more willing to innovate, systems are willing to innovate, insurance companies are willing to innovate. Patients are willing to try new technologies,” Bodapati says. “We would talk to patients, asking them, ‘What can we do to make this the easiest possible experience for you?’ And they’ll tell you exactly what they need and what they want. Once you unlock that, it becomes really powerful. Because then you just keep building and building and building.”</p>
   



   
<blockquote><p>“Once I heard about Athelas, I was like, I don’t know if this is too good to be true. Then I kept reaching out and kept thinking this is going to be a major advantage and a major breakthrough to revolutionize our care.”</p>Dr. Deanna Kelly</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“We realized we had an opportunity where the world is on pause, and we’ve collected all of these interesting lessons from getting this FDA clearance and then launching in some of these incredible health systems and clinics.”</p>Tanay Tandon</blockquote>

<p></p><p>WabiSabi is a novel communication protocol for creating bitcoin coinjoin transactions with arbitrary amounts. It is a concept with roots going back to the early days of bitcoin, even the earliest beginnings of digital payments. Over the last two years, we have researched, designed and implemented this protocol. Now that we have finally released Wasabi Wallet 2.0, here is the history of this monumental advancement in bitcoin privacy.</p><p>Wasabi Wallet 1.0 solved a lot of difficult problems out of the box. Tor was natively integrated, protecting user IP addresses. Block filters were used to synchronize wallets without anyone else learning about the transaction history. The best available zerolink coinjoin protocol with Chaumian blind signatures provided privacy on the blockchain.</p><p>However, the Chaumian blind signature protocol had limitations that lead to a bad user experience and excessive blockspace usage. The minimum denomination was too large for many users, denying them access to the service. But for others it was too small, resulting in many coins in the wallet, which is expensive. If a user wanted to consolidate many inputs in the same coinjoin transaction, he had to tell the coordinator which belonged together. Even though the coordinator could not link the inputs of one user to the equal amount output he received, it was public knowledge which non-equal change output the user received.</p><p>Some of these concerns were improved with marginal upgrades to the protocol during the Wasabi 1.0 life cycle. However, in order to truly solve these issues, a fundamental solution was required. But at this point, we did not know what technology existed that could be applied at scale.</p><p>A group of developers, cryptographers and enthusiasts got together in the Wasabi Research Club, a weekly meeting to define, discuss and solve this complex problem. Initially, a different academic paper was chosen as the topic for each week. We invited the authors of each paper to join us, and many did, giving ample opportunity to ask questions. One of the researchers, usually Aviv Milner, started the call with a short presentation to introduce and summarize the paper. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPwc75tPMdsgTYlu9dJZlosCm0s7WmIpF">recordings</a> of these calls are available on the Wasabi Wallet YouTube channel.</p><p>A breakthrough moment was when Jonas Nick suggested that keyed verified anonymous credentials might be a great fit for our specific use case. There are numerous different cryptographic schemes in this category, like Brands’ credentials, Mercurial signatures, anonymous credentials light and keyed verified anonymous credentials. The specific paper Jonas brought to our attention was <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1416">The Signal Private Group System and Anonymous Credentials Supporting Efficient Verifiable Encryption, written by Melissa Chase, Trevor Perrin and Greg Zaverucha</a>.</p><p>This cryptography allows a central server to issue tokens which can have many attributes. Each of these attributes can be blindly committed to, then selectively revealed at a later point. These tokens can be transferred anonymously. The trick we use in WabiSabi specifically, is that one attribute of these credentials is a blinded value of sats. Pedersen commitments are used so that the coordinator never learns how many sats one token has attributed, but he can still ensure that nobody is creating more money than he spent.</p><p>These anonymous digital bearer certificates are the access rights to the new bitcoin transaction that is being built. The coordinator issues tokens and gives it to anyone who provides an input. And later, any anonymous user who provides such a token, can write an output address and amount to the transaction. These tokens ensure nobody is writing more outputs than inputs, without the users having to sacrifice their privacy to the central server.</p><p>At this point, we had a pretty solid idea of the problem and how flexible anonymous eCash tokens can be used to solve it. This was a sufficient advancement to document in a new paper, <a href="https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/releases/latest/download/WabiSabi.pdf">WabiSabi: Centrally Coordinated CoinJoins with Variable Amounts</a>, which was peer reviewed and published. This paper was finalized mainly by Adam Ficsor, Yuval Kogman, Lucas Ontivero and István András Seres.</p><p>A crucial next step was to implement the cryptography that makes the system possible. Lucas Ontivero, Yuval Kogman and David Molnar dedicated months to building, testing and reviewing this critical part of the codebase. An independent security firm was hired to audit the code base and several outside contributors have reviewed it as well. In the following months, Wasabi’s client and server code were upgraded and sometimes entirely rewritten to support this new protocol.</p><p>With the protocol designed, the cryptography implemented and the client and server code well on its way, we realized that some of the most difficult questions are still unanswered. Now that the coordinator no longer dictates the minimum value of inputs and what output values to register, what exactly should the client do now? With great power, comes great responsibility. For the first time in the history of bitcoin coinjoin, the client can basically do whatever it wants. This turned out to be rather uncharted territory, with conflicting ideas of how to approach the subject.</p><p>Anonymity likes company meaning that it’s a good idea to hide in a crowd. So a coinjoin transaction should have many coins with the exact same amount of sats. However, every transaction should have many different equal amounts. One of Yuval’s many insights was to use low Hamming weight standard denominations. Only a few of these amounts are required to sum up to any arbitrary value. Specifically, these standard denominations are powers of two, powers of three, and 1, 2, and 5 times the powers of ten. Between 5000 sats and 1 bitcoin, there are 41 of these standard denominations. If all clients prefer to create outputs in only those standard denominations, then there are going to be a higher number of equal amount inputs and outputs.</p><p>These developments are why Wabisabi has improved upon the original Zerolink protocol of Wasabi 1.0 and how Wasabi 2.0, powered by Wabisabi are breaking records everyday for facilitating some of the largest coinjoins ever while provided even the newest Bitcoin user access to the highest level of privacy.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology is evolving accounting through cryptography by providing an immutable, tamper-proof record of the chain’s transaction history. In this article, we explore the history of accounting, define the concept of triple-entry accounting, and discuss how decentralised technology has proven to be the magic ingredient in creating a new accounting paradigm.</p>



 Blockchain as a catalyst for change in accounting practices 



<p>While a necessary evil in business, bookkeeping is hardly one of the most exciting topics to discuss. In times past, the practice was associated with unassuming, bespectacled individuals using a quill to make detailed entries on an oversized, black-leather bound ledger book. The world has long since stopped using quills, but the essential mechanics of bookkeeping have remained surprisingly unchanged for centuries.</p>



<p>Decentralised technology has infused bookkeeping with a new lease of life by adding cryptographic methodologies that add a much-needed layer of transparency and security.&nbsp;</p>



 A brief history of accounting 



<p>During the second half of the 15th century, Franciscan friar and mathematician Luca Pacioli enjoyed a life of traveling around his native Italy. He spent time teaching at the universities of Rome, Naples, and Perugia, sharing his knowledge and passion for education. In 1494, Pacioli published Summa, an influential book that compiled most of the mathematical knowledge of the era. But what cemented this wayward friar’s place in history was his seminal contribution to the accounting field. Pacioli was the first person to publish a paper on the double-entry system for bookkeeping. This work earned Pacioli the title of ‘Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pacioli’s work became a landmark moment in the field’s history. Businesses around Italy adopted double-entry accounting to improve their efficiency and bottom line. Soon, Pacioli’s knowledge was printed internationally and used as an accounting textbook well into the 16th century. Double-entry accountancy has endured the test of time, as it has changed very little since the time that Luca Pacioli put the principles to paper (likely using a quill) hundreds of years ago.</p>



 What is double-entry accounting? 



<p>The core principle of double-entry accounting (or double-entry bookkeeping, as it’s sometimes referred to) is relatively simple. In this system, each financial transaction requires three things:</p>



  At least one debit and one credit  The transaction affects at least two accounts  The system must always balance, that is, the debits and credits must be equal  



<p>Archaeological data suggests that accounting methods were used as early as 300 BC in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq, Kuwait, Turkey, and Syria). But double-entry accounting would not see widespread use until the introduction of Pacioli’s work in the late 15th century. Most businesses use this system today.</p>



 Double-entry accounting: the perfect measure against fraud? 



<p>The double-entry system is designed to prevent financial errors and fraud, though it’s far from ironclad.</p>



<p>The inherent problem with accountancy is its centralised nature. Historically and typically, a very reduced number of people would be involved in a firm’s accounting, at least in earlier times. Maybe one or two people would be in control of the books, which meant that, should these individuals decide to engage in fraudulent activities, it would be relatively easy to carry out, conceal, and perpetuate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraudulent accounting is not limited to small firms though. The fall of the energy giant Enron is one of the best-known cases of financial malfeasance leading to complete collapse. Following years of financial mismanagement and fraudulent accounting practices, Enron filed for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. Analysts estimated that the combined losses involved in Enron’s long collapse amounted to some $1.5tn and change.</p>



 From single-entry to triple-entry accounting 



<p>Fast forward to the present. More and more use cases are adopting blockchain technology and accounting is no exception. Decentralised technology facilitates triple-entry accounting by adding the inherent traits of transparency and immutability.</p>



<p>In earlier times, folk would use clay tablets to account for stuff. They would carve the amount on a piece of clay and leave it out in the sun to dry. Once dried, the clay tablet would become the immutable proof of the transaction. Some historians refer to this as ‘single-entry accounting.’ Then came Pacioli’s work, whose principles of double-entry bookkeeping have endured to the present day more or less unchanged.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology represents the next evolutionary step in the accounting industry.</p>



<p>In single- and double-entry systems, an accountant (or accounting team) must check and balance the books. In other words, a very small number of people get to decide whether or not the books are correct. This, in turn, poses obvious security risks. ‘Cooking’ the books is relatively easy, and can have devastating consequences, as the fall of Enron -and many others- starkly revealed.</p>



<p>Decentralised technology removes the need for a middleman (an accountant, or team of accountants), and therefore, the single point of failure. Now, it is the community itself that reaches a consensus on the correctness of the numbers. Falsifying this information is futile, as the community would know right away. Triple-entry accounting uses cryptographic signatures to validate the figures, independent of the consensus protocol used by the underlying chain.</p>



 Triple-entry accounting: redefining financial structures 



<p>There often are multiple reasons why a company goes bankrupt. Poor management, bad decision-making, and even natural disasters can hasten a firm’s collapse. But financial mismanagement, whether by poor decision making, incompetence, or outright fraud, tends to be one of the main culprits of a company’s untimely demise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Triple-entry accounting presents a variety of use cases, both for private enterprises and governments. Because of blockchain’s inherent traits of transparency and immutability, it is no longer possible to ‘cook’ the books, so triple-entry bookkeeping renders fraud impossible. In other words, we can trust the numbers, so any ecosystem built on top of this principle of financial trust already stands on very solid ground. Such a trust environment also means that the identities on such a system can be trusted, so no fake social media accounts, for example.&nbsp;</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Could triple-entry accounting have prevented the disaster that unfolded at Enron? One can only speculate. In hindsight, transparent accounting practices would certainly have revealed what was going on very early in the process. Had this occurred, and had corrective action been taken, Enron might still be in business today.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology wasn’t around back then, however. Even the internet was in its infancy, in comparative terms. Today, blockchain is available, and though it is also a relatively nascent technology, triple-entry accounting -and, by extension, blockchain-&nbsp;has the potential to revolutionize entire financial structures and become the next evolutionary step in accounting.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



  Double-entry accounting has changed very little over the last 500 years  Triple-entry accounting removes the need for a middleman (an accountant) to determine whether or not the numbers are correct  In triple-entry accounting, the community reaches consensus on the numbers, so you can trust the figures  Zaisan helps international clients to create a safe financial environment through <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/blockchain-consultancy/">blockchain consultancy</a>

<p>While the deadline for the Beyond Inclusion Scholarship application is approaching (<a href="https://cyberxr.org/beyond-inclusion-scholarship/">Have you applied? It takes just a few minutes and you can start clicking here!</a>), VentureBeat reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/deantak">Dean Takahashi</a> covered the initiative aimed at removing entry barriers in the XR industry.</p>

<p>“Representation matters. We’re committed to reaching a candidate pool that is as broad and diverse as possible, which is why we are proud to support the Beyond Inclusion Scholarship Program,” said Rob Sherman, deputy chief privacy officer at Meta, in a statement. “As companies and organizations build for the metaverse, it’s important that people from underrepresented communities have a seat at the table from the beginning — influencing product strategies, policies and perspective.”</p>



<p>Here’s what our CEO, Kavya Pearlman, said to Mr Takahashi. </p>



<p>“To create fair and equal work opportunities, we need to eliminate financial barriers to entry in immersive technologies and provide equitable measures like fully funded scholarships,” Pearlman said. “We need corporations to fulfil their social responsibility and collectively go beyond just inclusion by committing to increase the representation of underrepresented identity groups. This benefits not just the marginalized community but the entire technology ecosystem.”</p>

    <p>We’ve wrapped up Q2 2022, and we are excited to continue the growth of the Horizen ecosystem through new product launches, including <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint on testnet</a> and our new <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet!</a> We have also added five new integration pairs and exchange listings.</p>
 Q2 Highlights&nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>Now is an exciting time for our ecosystem. Since the launch of <a href="https://horizen.io/zendoo">Zendoo</a>, our team has focused on launching products and adding new capabilities to our platform. This quarter we focused on the launch of our tokenization platform, TokenMint, and EVM compatibility, and our community growth has seen a huge increase because of it!</p>
 Products and Engineering Development 
 TokenMint on Testnet 
<p>This quarter, we launched our no-code necessary tokenization platform, TokenMint, to testnet. TokenMint is an easy-to-use platform for anyone to launch a token using custom tokenomics without having to know a single line of code. It streamlines and simplifies the tokenization process which makes creating a fungible token very easy and quick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TokenMint platform lives on TokenMint Chain, which is a sidechain built on Horizen. The testnet launch of the TokenMint platform comprised the launch of:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – an independent blockchain built on the Horizen sidechain platform, Zendoo.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt Wallet</a> – a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">Token Generator</a> – a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint Block explorer</a> – a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Over 550 tokens were created by our community, and the user feedback we received from our community helped us refine TokenMint features for its upcoming mainnet launch this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also airdropped our own testnet tokens called Test Zenny (TZNY) and testnet CAKE (TCAKE) as a way to reward community participation in testing and other community activities. Over 8000 unique addresses received TZNY as of July 5th.&nbsp;</p>
 Cobalt Wallet 
<p>Along with <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a>, we launched the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a>. Cobalt is a web browser extension for Chrome and Brave browsers that mints, stores, and manages all tokens created on TokenMint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cobalt currently only supports TokenMint tokens as well as ZEN transfers between Horizen mainchain and TokenMint Chain. The team aims to extend Cobalt’s capability to support interoperability among different blockchain ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 EVM Sidechain Progress 
<p>The sidechain engineering team worked on the launch of our EVM sidechain. This upcoming sidechain will enable people to easily create their own Ethereum-based dapps on our ecosystem or bridge to existing dapps on other EVM-compatible platforms. We are excited to launch this sidechain in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
 Community Growth &amp; Updates 
<p></p>
<p>The community saw incredible growth this quarter, especially on Discord. We saw a 111.7% increase in total Discord members since Q1. The excitement and feedback received from the community about our latest products were incredible. Our community was also able to get a special new Discord Role (Test Pilots) for helping us test TokenMint and Cobalt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we welcomed a lot of new members to our community, the engagement rate increased tremendously, especially on Discord, with a soaring increase of 2,453% in monthly average new active communicators.&nbsp; Our other social media community also saw a large increase in engagement with an 86.6% increase on Linkedin, 29.5% increase on Twitter, and 18.6% on Facebook. Our most liked content focused on the release of TokenMint to testnet and the announcement of the activities we planned around the launch! The team will continue to plan additional activities around the mainnet launch of TokenMint, so be sure to look out for these in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also had a bump in activity on <a href="https://hde.horizen.io/">HDE tasks</a>, with our most popular tasks being creating content about TokenMint and testing the platform. The number of people signed up to test the TokenMint platform exceeded the task limit within the first few days of the task release! <br><br>We also welcomed a couple of new members to the <a href="https://www.horizen.io/ambassadors/">ambassador program</a>. We are excited that our long-time community members, Ghost and DeFi Money Printer, chose to join the program to help our community through social platforms and helpful content creation!</p>
<p>We also saw growth on the web, with a 6.5% increase in overall site traffic, a 5.9% increase in organic keyword rankings, and a 5.8% increase in referring domains. Social referral traffic was up 234% in Q2, with a 170% increase in blog traffic, a 120% increase in HEAP traffic, and a 24% increase in HDE traffic.</p>

 Events 
 Paris Blockchain Week 
<p></p>
<p>The Horizen team was at Paris Blockchain Week April 12-14! Our booth was packed during all three days of the event. We discussed our upcoming EVM-compatible sidechain and NFTs, and learned about a lot of exciting new projects in the space. Liat also spoke on several panels about NFTs and blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
 Consensus 
<p></p>
<p>The Horizen team was in Austin, Texas, for Consensus 2022, where we had a fantastic time! We had a booth set up where we were able to give live demos of TokenMint; many attendees stopped by and created their own tokens in only 5 minutes, learning how the token generator works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Co-Founder and Team Lead Rob Viglione presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cGfULIwRg&amp;t=3s">“From Cypherpunk to Solving the Blockchain Trilemma Through zkSNARKS”</a> at Consensus to a packed audience while also conducting a fireside chat on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2JjEdrpM9g&amp;t=1s">“How Zero-Knowledge Proofs Change the Narrative Around Privacy.”</a></p>
<p>Horizen, along with Horizen Labs, hosted a side event with our partner, Halborn Security at Consensus, where guests enjoyed food, drink, and networking! We saw many longtime community members at the event, and it was a good chance for much of the team to network and catch up with each other during the busy event week.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 NFT NYC 
<p></p>
<p>This year, Zain Cheng Horizen’s VP of Engineering, presented on the future of NFTs during this major event in NYC. Zain’s panel discussion was one of our favorite talks during the event and covered his opinions on what the future of NFTs could look like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs hosted a Happy Hour event during NFT.NYC and welcomed hundreds of guests and Horizen community members.&nbsp;</p>

Anyone can launch (no programming needed) blockchains and currencies. Including DeFi at the protocol layer and a non-custodial Eth-bridge.

There is extra work being done on an additional security mechanism for chain notarizations on top of the ones that are already in place.

It was a successful conference for the community, lots of fun, lots of heads turned, and lots of interest. Many community members attended, and for most of us it was the first time we all met in real life! It was an absolute pleasure and privilege meeting fellow community members and making friends along the way. The conference ignited a renewed sense of urgency for the continuation of the Verus mission. A public good for all of humanity, enabling novel ways for people to work together and create value. The future is bright. Thanks to everyone who donated that made this a possibility!</p><p>📖 ➡️ <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AYgIxMOU7B7A-LHzN33Eh6O1KL5tQh4f/view?usp=sharing">Community member tango808 wrote a summary of all that was happening.
