<p>AI algorithms are built on the past two decades of intensive mass-surveillance. And yet, when trying out the latest new models like stable diffusion and GPT-4 many of us nevertheless find them to be awesome. So where do we go from&nbsp;here?</p><p>AI is everywhere lately, but has a less famous sibling in the world of digital technology namely cryptography, that can unlock more socially embedded forms of artificial intelligences (yes, in plural) by placing the power to decide in the hands of people. Strong privacy protections holds the keys to truly revolutionising AI from a societal perspective.</p><p>It is time to privacy-pill the AI debate. And it goes a little something like&nbsp;this…</p> 1 Enhancing privacy in&nbsp;AI <p>AI algorithms are essentially statistics on steroids. They calculate statistical probabilities on large data sets, which means they need large volumes of data in order to calculate more accurately what the next word in a sentence might be, the next pixel in an image, the next movement in a moving image and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Where does all this data come from? So far, this huge appetite for data has been mostly fed by decades of digital surveillance. In this sense, AI is a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0263276411417430?journalCode=tcsa">data derivative</a>. In fact, as it is today, AI is a <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/signals-new-president-messaging-apps-long-term-sustainability/">surveillance derivative</a>. From scraping of public LinkedIn and Twitter data, to the far more ethically dubious use of <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300264630/atlas-of-ai/">prison mugshots</a> to train facial recognition algorithms, even supposedly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artist-finds-private-medical-record-photos-in-popular-ai-training-data-set/">private medical records</a> have cropped up in these vast data sets. AI has been built on a digital industry fuelled by involuntary datafication of us&nbsp;all.</p><p>The issue of privacy is starting to crop up in the debates on AI. But there is a danger that advanced cryptography and privacy tech will be used to “privacy wash” otherwise harmful AI. Differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation can help protect sensitive data and maintain individual privacy while still allowing for AI training. This means individual people can maintain their privacy while nevertheless allowing us to develop AI models. However, this raises an important question: is it not still surveillance if your data is read by a&nbsp;machine?</p><p>The answer is yes. Even if an individual’s privacy is protected, when their data is fed to AI algorithms, this can and will contribute to systems of mass surveillance and control. <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/feature/a-relational-theory-of-data-governance">Protecting an individual’s privacy is not enough</a> because their encrypted data can train an AI that could go on to be used to enhance the surveillance and control of others elsewhere.</p><p>But it does not have to be that way. Securing privacy by default across communications is the first step towards tipping the balances of power when it comes to AI. End-to-end encryption, mixnets as well as zero-knowledge proof cryptography all contribute to radically reducing the amount of personal data gathered and sold by unaccountable companies. Strong privacy protections is the first step towards tipping the balances of power in favour of ordinary people, paving the way for meaningful consent and the ability to withdraw&nbsp;it.</p> 2 Paving the way for Consensual AI <p>Consensual AI is a term coined by artists Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst who have been developing tools to make it a reality in practice: with their group <a href="https://spawning.ai/">Spawning</a>, they set up the project “have I been trained” where artists can search large open datasets for their images and request to opt out. This is in partnership with <a href="https://laion.ai/faq">LAION</a>, a non-profit large-scale image datasets.</p><p>In the case of Spawning, the emphasis is on revoking consent after the fact. But going forward, privacy enhancing techniques such as selective disclosure (including <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">zk-nyms</a>), as well as secure federated learning can empower consensual practices in advance, and enable people to securely share data on their own terms. Data can even be processed on distributed devices without leaving their local storage, allowing multiple entities to collaborate on a common goal without sharing sensitive data. Such techniques can pave the way for active, consensual contribution to AIs by ordinary people, communities and groups, rather than being bought and sold in obscure data&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Privacy technologies secure the possibility for meaningful consent in data and AI. There are already a few flourishing projects that are actively working to ensure that the development of AI is an <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/ethics-soc-3">open</a>, consensual and <a href="https://cip.org/s4d">democratic process</a>. But the ability to decide about data is not just about consent, it is also about who gets to determine what kind of AI is being trained in the first&nbsp;place…</p> 3 Enabling sovereignty and decentralisation <p>Data, data sets and AI are not neutral. The creation and recording of data always entails a perspective about what matters in the world, whether and how it should be recorded. A few years ago an important <a href="https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/986506/7/Indigenous_Protocol_and_AI_2020.pdf">position paper</a> on Indigenous AI was published by The Initiative for Indigenous Futures and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR). The authors discuss how AI might serve the specific worldviews and epistemologies of indigenous people from Aotearoa, Australia, North America, and the Pacific. Practical uses included <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/22/1050394/artificial-intelligence-for-the-people/">reviving near-extinct languages and amplifying worldviews</a>. The implications of this Indigenous AI report are relevant for anyone interested in AI. Importantly, it highlights how AIs are in fact plural, in the sense that its real potential is in the many ways data and algorithms can be used to amplify a kaleidoscope of meaning and intelligences.</p><p>OpenAI, in their recent release of GPT-4, compares its capabilities to human capabilities: “while less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.” The US bar exam was one of the benchmarks used to assess the performance of GPT-4. Its training has been heavily weighted towards the English language and US culture, humour, legal framework and habits. In other words a specific culture and set of tasks. There is no universal “artificial intelligence” in competition with a universal “human”. The cultural habit of framing the debate as a competitive race between “humans” and “machines”is a deeply disappointing and destructive habit for a set of technologies that have far more interesting potential — if we just get this right. The real question here is not whether AI works like a human or not, but rather who it works&nbsp;for.</p><p>The ability to discern what does or does not matter is exactly what makes AI work, and this is a deeply cultural and situated question that should be under the sovereign decisions of the people affected. Cryptographic techniques for enabling effective data governance and verification are therefore essential so that people can actively participate in deciding what should matter or&nbsp;not…</p> 4 Preventing mis/disinformation and deep-fakes <p>Cryptographic proofs and verification techniques can be used to verify the accuracy and source of information. And this becomes increasingly important for enabling sovereignty of knowledge and information by people in the face of a dominant culture. It is also essential for secure verification of information. Chelsea Manning <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-can-be-defeated-with-cryptography-says-chelsea-manning-at-sxsw">recently pointed out in an interview</a> that AI tools are unleashing a whole new set of problems from mis/disinformation and deep-fakes. There are cases where GPT-4 has essentially invented fictions based on entirely unverified datasets (that even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/05/chatgpt-lies/">led to false stories</a> with severe personal consequences). AI models are “dumb” in the sense that they simply draw on data, and are unable to discern or engage with whether something is true and real or&nbsp;not.</p><p>Communities like <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> are already emerging around curating, labelling and sharing open datasets and collaborating on models. Public blockchains can contribute to such efforts by providing untamperable ledgers of verified data&nbsp;, as well as consensus mechanisms for adding the data to the ledger. People can thereby take part in shaping their shared records of truth and have a say in how AI is trained — through whichever governance methods serve them best: new forms of DAOs, guilds or modernized libraries? Because let’s face it, these are collective issues and not something that individual people have time for in their day-to-day lives.</p> 5 Protecting the freedom to be different — the cypherpunk perspective <p>What is at stake in the future of AI is nothing less than the freedom to be different and not subject to a centralised understanding of what matters in the world. In the late 1980s and 1990s the cypherpunk subculture already foresaw a future where the internet would become a vehicle for mass surveillance and centralised control. A less appreciated aspect of this cypherpunk premonition is its positive contribution by advocating for privacy as enabling the possibility to be different.</p><p>The idea of “AGM” or “Singularity” draw on totalitarian fantasies of deferring authority to some centralised machinic intelligence. And these fantasies lead quickly to deranged justifications about why some humans deserve to survive a future with AI and others not. (In fact, computer scientist <a href="https://abebabirhane.com/">Abeba Birhane</a> has <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/ai-weekly-ai-phrenology-is-racist-nonsense-so-of-course-it-doesnt-work/">written extensively</a> about how AI/AGM has revived the racist pseudoscience of phrenology, again repackaging it as scientific and universal claims). Without privacy, the statistical tyranny of AI will turn anomalies into targets, leading to oppressive systems of manipulation and&nbsp;control.</p><p>As it stands, it is impossible to know whether your data is feeding medical research, click-baiting, racist “predictive policing” or drone strikes. The nature of mass surveillance and AI is that it is collective and relational. Your data is calculated in relation to other people’s data in order to find probabilities and norms in ways that are usually quite hard to trace. For this reason, AI has to be addressed collectively and include privacy as the default for all communications. Only then can people make meaningful decisions about how their data should be used. Privacy enhancing tech protects the freedom to be different and can revolutionise AI by decentralising the power to decide on its development — in the process unlocking a kaleidoscope of intelligences.</p>  Tune in to Chelsea’s Manning’s keynote on AI and Privacy — Monday the 10th at <a href="https://www.talent-land.mx/en/home/">TalentLand, Mexico</a>  Join the Nym masterclass on AI and privacy — WebSummit in Rio in May <a href="https://zealy.io/c/nymportugus-6948/">Win&nbsp;tickets</a>!

<p>The following is a livestream I did late last night after struggling in the comments of a Youtube video I posted with a short, five-minute talk by Queen Maxima of the Netherlands on financial inclusion (fin-clusion) presented as part of the recent Bank for International Settlement Innovation Summit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her speech, which I will share below was one of the most succinct demonstrations of what is planned with the use of programmable money as a backbone of human and natural capital finance. She even spoke of digital crop insurance, a topic that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy5rho92XQk">Leo Saraceno</a> has covered extensively. The Netherlands is an anchor for digital identity efforts (<a href="https://decodeproject.eu/partners.html">DeCode</a> and <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>), early trackable money pilots (Bijlmer Euro), and biodiversity cataloging (<a href="https://www.arise-biodiversity.nl/">Arise</a>). I see all these efforts as an extension of the Dutch East India company, colonization, financial speculation, and the commodification of natural life. Queen Maxima is the UN Secretary General’s special advocate for finclusion. This is significant.</p>
Source Link: <a href="https://www.unsgsa.org/">https://www.unsgsa.org/</a>
<p></p>
<p>Queen Maxima is a member of an influential Argentine family with a questionable past. Some people wanted to talk bloodlines. I will restate that I don’t care about that. What I care about it how aspects of her story and the information presented can inform my understanding of the structure that is unfolding. I’m not so much interested in people as people, because let’s be honest, most of the public figures who are put before us are to one degree or another actors / avatars in the spectacle. I see people, documents, webinars, tweets as puzzle pieces. We don’t have to judge them, only turn them around, look closely, and see where they fit. If you know my work you know that I’d be much more interested in the queen’s former career as an investment banker than how far removed she is from the House of Windsor. Or even her ties to Catholic church given that an Argentinian Jesuit is now Pope, and the Vatican has been a leader in the social impact finance space for the past decade.</p>

<p>I’ve learned over the past decade the importance of trusting your gut. If you have pieces that really don’t fit,&nbsp; set them aside. Eventually they may be the start of a new puzzle. We can keep information on the back burner knowing that eventually we will find more pieces that provide the context to help us figure out the plot line and the sub plots. Trust your intuition. When you come across something that seems “off,” make a mental note of it. You’ll figure it out eventually. The clarity comes more quickly if you can look at the unfolding story without being emotionally triggered. What I’m looking for in comments isn’t how viewers “feel” about a given video. I’m not posting things to make people “feel” a certain way. I’m presenting puzzle pieces and clues. When you see a video I post, you should presume I have a reason for posting it. Sometimes I use these clips in presentations. I make them public so you can examine them, too. Consider my channel a dynamic, curated list of things I’m thinking about. Consider it a starting point, not an ending point.</p>
<p>In my opinion, social media is dumbing people down and creating passive consumers of digital content. Consider the clips I post as an invitation to do a bit of research on your own and engage in a conversation that is collaborative. That’s what I’m hoping for. It’s not difficult to look up a person in a video or one of the projects referenced and come up with an original thought to share that expands the conversation and helps us frame out our understanding of the larger program together. You CAN do it, but the algorithms are incentivizing you to scroll and click – anything but ground yourself in sense-making aligned to your internal compass. They want you to direct your gaze outward with fear and blame. That isn’t going to get us where we need to go. If we want to diffuse cybernetic entanglements, we’re going to have to learn to steer our own ship and to practice until we build up our stamina and muscle memory. Most people roaming digital landscapes have been intentionally de-conditioned and unmoored.</p>
<p>Webs of relationships, if that’s all they are, are not all that useful until they add something to the story. Saying a person is connected to such and such a lineage and therefore they are tied to the shadowy bond holders…ok, so then what? Is it about measuring the “evil” embodied in said person? Does that connection add anything to your awareness? Because we already know that powerful dynasties exist, exerting their influence behind the scenes. There’s nothing new about that. Right? So, I think rather than devoting time to ancestral genealogies we should focus on analyzing the particular natures of these new forms of domination and control so that we can more clearly articulate them to others in a non-panicked way, thus reducing their potency. Because really, if people knew, they wouldn’t agree to such a future.</p>
<p>What I’m asking of people who care to engage with my channel and blog is that you move beyond the behaviors that have been programmed for us. The “let’s track the Rothschilds” fox hunt keeps many people busy – add in alien storylines and child sacrifice and you’ve got the titillation that will punch up the dopamine receptors and dial up the distraction. It takes a measure of personal initiative to begin to learn the ins and outs of Web3 and token engineering and radar beacons and markets in data for machine learning and democracy innovations and evolutionary development biology and morphogenesis. But you know what? If you have a curious mind, it’s worth it. Once you are able to set down the “let’s identify the bad guys” and unleash our digital emotionality on them, you are able to pursue what I think will be a more rewarding course of action.</p>
<p>So this video from late last night was somewhat off the cuff, but I included what will hopefully be a useful set of five slides that offer a conceptual framework for how I look at things – for now with the information I have assembled thus far. Rather than trying to keep pace with all the facts that I’ve internalized from years of research, I’m suggesting you take a look at the concepts I think are important and see if they make sense to you. If they do, use them as a lens when consuming other media. Compare content and see if there are places where items of interest easily plug in or places where there isn’t a good fit and perhaps a new category should be made.</p>
<p>I caution you that much of the “noise” of the distraction machine is not going to fit into this template. I’m looking at other things, elements I think are more pertinent to the underlying structure of the cybernetic, bio-hybrid social supercomputer program.</p>

<p>I streamed the fifth installment of our Flow Life series with Brandi a little over a week ago, but neglected to post it here until now. I just received a comment on my youtube from a viewer who’s a caregiver for her parents at a Florida planned community. It recently introduced smart locks and robots in the dining room.&nbsp; I have at least one more installment in the works that will center of “pay for success” and insurance industry investments in managed “wellness” with a focus on the Spokane, Washington region. That should be ready in the net few weeks.</p>

      Building the Business of Bloodlines        <p>By Michael Gold</p><p>Photography: KATIE THOMPSON</p><p>Published April 6, 2023</p>        Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe’s breakthroughs prove persistence pays off.      



 
<p>A stubborn streak runs through Anne Wojcicki’s family. She traces this back to her great-grandmother, a talented singer who spent all her money going to the opera in Tsarist St. Petersburg. Wojcicki makes this out to be an all-consuming obsession: nothing could stop Leah Srubinsky from blowing the conjugal nest egg to watch people unload their lungs on stage.</p>



<p>“Her relatives finally said, ‘enough! The only way to stop you is to move to Siberia,’” Wojcicki says during an interview at her hillside home on the outskirts of Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>Pressed on whether her family had really moved all the way to Siberia because of opera, she insists it’s true. “Apparently the only way to control that DNA was total isolation,” she laughs.</p>



<p>As anyone who has taken grade-school biology knows, 23 pairs of chromosomes populate most cells in the human body; DNA and the four letters that comprise it—A, T, G and C—form the building blocks of life. Wojcicki, founder of pioneering DNA testing company 23andMe, sees much of the world—stubbornness included—through the lens of genetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You have genes and you have environment,” Wojcicki says, reclining on her balcony in the casual garb that has long defined her personal style—puffy jacket, workout shorts and Crocs. “Your environment is always going to play a huge influence, but I do believe you’re born in certain ways.”</p>



<p>Wojcicki herself was born in a certain way, with the kind of background that someone who believes in fate could easily see as charting her future in advance. The product of a Polish Catholic father and Russian Jewish mother (she of the opera-loving stock), Wojcicki grew up in a household that respected tradition and prioritized connecting with one’s roots. Stories passed down about the trials her family endured during Europe’s mid-century conflicts fostered her fascination with “what-ifs” and alternate paths her forebears could have taken.</p>



<p>“Most of the people on my father’s side were farmers, but my grandfather was a ‘breakaway child’,” she says. “He managed to get an education and became a judge. Then he entered politics, and eventually became Secretary of the Polish People’s Party. He resisted Communism to the point that he was sent into prison, and later house arrest. While his wife and son—my father—were able to escape and come to America, my grandfather never managed to leave his home country.” While discussing this episode, she emphasizes the “random people” who helped her grandfather obtain an education in his youth, contrasting his lucky break against the zillion possible lives he could have led but didn’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details of this story came to life when Wojcicki visited Poland during a gap year between high school and college, before starting a career that would see her race to the frontiers of DNA-based biotech. 23andMe has, since its founding in 2006, helped more than 13 million people uncover details about their backgrounds and <a href="https://www.dataminingdna.com/who-has-the-largest-dna-database/">amassed</a> the second-largest genetic database of any company in the world. Wojcicki believes that big data can help solve the mysteries of DNA, but in both her Poland experience and a later backpacking trip to old family stomping grounds in Siberia, she connected most deeply with the small things: the sights, sounds and smells that shaped her ancestors.</p>



<p>“I was interested in a level of detail that wasn’t just surface,” she says. “I wanted to imagine myself living in those places.”</p>



<p>The Siberia expedition especially was a trip back in time: Wojcicki rode a train across the steppe, looking to emulate the horseback travel her ancestors had to resort to in order to escape the pogroms that saw countless Russian Jews killed or forced into exile. During this expedition, the voices of her grandparents echoed in her head, their upbringings already half-formed in her mind.</p>



<p>“I find that people, as they get older—especially when they’re closer to dying—start telling stories about their childhoods,” she says. “It was really interesting to see those come to life.”</p>



<p>This episode helped plant the seed for 23andMe’s mission. It occurred during the recession of the early 2000s, when Wojcicki, who had been working as an investor, needed to “totally detox from the Wall Street world.” Ironically, it was her early foray in finance that exposed her to the concept of health as business. Employed by the Wallenbergs, a wealthy Swedish family that ran a startup fund, she worked on their biotech portfolio, dabbling in exotic fields like xenotransplantation—inserting organs from animals (usually pigs) into humans.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I was fascinated by questions of what you’re born with versus what you gain from your experiences.”</p>
anne wojcicki</blockquote>



<p>It was genes, however, that most enthralled her. “I was always super interested in twin studies—looking at how twins raised in different environments differ and overlap in various aspects of their lives,” she says. “I was fascinated by questions of what you’re born with versus what you gain from your experiences.”</p>



<p>In 2006 Wojcicki turned her need to answer these questions into 23andMe. The <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project">mapping</a> of the human genome three years earlier had driven a wave of interest in genetic technology, and Wojcicki’s company grabbed attention instantly when it launched. 23andMe’s early publicity efforts were largely eye-catching gimmicks, such as hosting a celebrity-studded “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2008/sep/18/genetic.testing">spit party</a>” at New York Fashion Week (the company collects its DNA samples from customers’ saliva) and launching a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/11/23andme-zeppelin-hanging-out-above-my-house-creeping-me-out/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN7tCwcP18Gm4dEy7VxL1D-vRT_7DFu6W6T1TWnAfo5cBEtNcDnyjX7Tof57XZji-xsy1WVU7KVctjuUjwQx-Xk15dVSUgJqds624auVUa9kYifPBaVCS0OsL7Yy6WwbCpyQvts2UZzsIG5F8VcLf2Xz1ztjqrx4aE8rzEqxxV4v">blimp</a> over Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>Wojcicki characterizes these stunts as part of a gut-feel visibility blitz that she presided over directly. “I was the marketing department in those days,” she says, describing early advertisements she bought herself that her team still stumbles upon occasionally. Fortunately, she had a personal network seeped in the fast-moving world of Silicon Valley tech to learn from—her sister, Susan, was one of Google’s earliest employees (and served as CEO of YouTube until this year). Her husband at the time was Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder.</p>



<p>“Sergey’s advice at the time was basically to just put things out there and see how people react,” Wojcicki says. This freewheeling attitude also reflected a trademark disdain for corporate stiffness that persists to this day—indeed, during one of our interviews, Wojcicki wears a joke sweatshirt with a boat sailing toward the horizon that says “F*** this, I’m out.”</p>



<p>Not everyone at the company embraced the early marketing approach. The scientists in particular were skeptical about it, wary of undermining the company’s credibility. At the time, the term “DNA” was rapidly entering the marketing lexicon of firms across the corporate spectrum, threatening to cheapen the image of offerings that genuinely did have DNA as their DNA.</p>



<p>“Our scientists would cringe at the idea of doing an infomercial, say,” Wojcicki says, citing the shopping network QVC as an example of a sales channel the company shied away from at first.</p>



<p>23andMe’s offbeat marketing efforts did work initially, helping sell around 1,000 test kits on their first day—an early tsunami which quickly became a trickle as the novelty wore off. Sales soon slowed to a mere handful of kits per day. Facing a still-nascent appetite for genetic technology, Wojcicki and her team doubled down on product development and user experience. Eventually a more mainstream audience caught on, drawn particularly by the prospect of discovering one’s roots, much as Anne had done on those early trips overseas. This helped the company return to a state of relatively steady growth over the next few years.</p>



<p>Indeed, the concept of ancestry continues to play an important role for the company today. It is the thread that connects its early trajectory to Wojcicki’s own sojourns. The connections she made with people in her ancestral homeland underscored how much potential lay in popularizing this kind of self-discovery. “I lived in a dorm when I went to Poland, and people would tell me I look more Polish than most Poles,” Wojcicki says.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I feel like I can’t keep up with all the family that we’ve found.”</p>
Anne Wojcicki</blockquote>



<p>Unsurprisingly for someone who made a career helping millions construct family trees, her own family tree has expanded over the years, encompassing relatives from Australia to South Africa to Argentina. Ten years ago, Wojcicki’s father wrote a book about his own lineage, although no one in the family has been tasked with keeping track of every new addition to the bloodline.</p>



<p>“I feel like I can’t keep up with all the family that we’ve found,” she says, acknowledging that her own company’s product could potentially help her further explore her family tree’s branches and leaves. “It’s almost like there’s a present sitting at the door, but we haven’t opened it yet,” she muses. “In general, though, I’m more interested in expanding the depth, rather than the width of the tree—with making real relationships with the family members I meet.”</p>



<p>For her customers, gaining visibility into their own family backgrounds is a big selling point of 23andMe. (Quirky tidbits like whether they are likely to enjoy cilantro, wake up early, fear public speaking or a number of other traits come included, too.). However, more weighty assessments, such as likelihood of developing Type 2 diabetes and other more serious health conditions, are featured in its most popular service. In the years after its founding, the company expanded the repertoire of genetic conditions it screened for. Helping its customers interpret these results became a guiding principle for Wojcicki and her team.</p>



<p>“You have to take what’s in that raw, scientific brain and translate it to consumers,” she says, describing the late 2000s and early 2010s as a time when the company was starting to hit its stride in both its scientific mission and place in the broader discourse, when the company’s North Star—to help average people gain access to their genetic information, without what Wojcicki sees as heavy-handed intermediation by the medical establishment—was on the rise.</p>







<p>23andMe had defined a new category, becoming synonymous with at-home genetic testing. But along with success came detractors—including influential members of the medical community. To its skeptics, 23andMe was overly casual about revealing medical risk factors to people without giving them access to professionals who could help them handle the information. Some also question to what extent genetic analysis can truly predict diseases. Wojcicki describes attending a dinner in which a medical adviser for George W. Bush “walked out in disgust” after learning about the company’s product, and another instance in which the company was rejected from a convention held by a “major medical society” when it applied for a booth.</p>



<p>“I’ve been surprised by all the controversy that’s followed us,” Wojcicki says. She turns the criticism back to the healthcare industry, contrasting 23andMe’s work of promoting radical transparency with the industry’s habit of collecting patients’ data without any recourse to opt-out. “People should have choice,” she says. “The potential of genetics is really to help people know, ‘hey, here’s what your risks are, and can you actually do anything that mitigates those risks?’ I think there’s an incredible opportunity for that. You need to have the right information and awareness around [your risks], and [we can] help people understand that a probability is not the same as a predetermined outcome.”</p>



<p>Wojcicki has never been shy about the fact that winning over the medical establishment is not her top priority. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, is another matter.</p>



<p>The regulatory status of 23andMe’s genetic tests was always murky in those early years. Consumer genetics was such a new space, and regulators had almost no precedent on which to base rules. Still, the relationship between 23andMe and the FDA started out amicably: Wojcicki counts David Kessler, who served as the agency’s head from 1990–97, as a friend and close advisor. The company maintained open lines of communication with the FDA throughout its rise, even as the agency maintained a relatively hands-off stance.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When it was just a few Silicon Valley nerds buying these kits online, no one cared.”</p>
kathy hibbs</blockquote>



<p>This started to change in 2010, when a rival company began selling genetic tests at Walgreens. As Kathy Hibbs, 23andMe’s head of legal, describes it, this caused a range of power brokers—from lawmakers to regulators—to perk up their ears.</p>



<p>“When it was just a few Silicon Valley nerds buying these kits online, no one cared,” Hibbs says. “When it starts to look like a mass consumer product—that’s when people pay attention.”</p>



<p>Government engagements—including a grilling from US senators—started filling Wojcicki’s calendar. As the highest-profile consumer genetic testing company, 23andMe attracted the brightest spotlight. But the company also proved uniquely willing to place itself under scrutiny. After the FDA announced it would devise a set of rules for how such firms should engage with customers, 23andMe offered to help with the task—a big mistake, in Hibbs’ telling. “In hindsight, the company probably should’ve just stayed quiet.”</p>



<p>This is because it provided an opening for regulators to request ever more copious data from the company and for them to look askance at every perceived slip-up. 23andMe’s rapid growth targets and relatively lean resources during this time meant that fulfilling sales orders took priority over the cumbersome process of filling out regulatory documents. “They didn’t brush off the FDA intentionally,” Hibbs says. “It was more, ‘We’re a small company and have to get ready for the holidays.’”</p>



<p>As the FDA started growing impatient, 23andMe failed to grasp the agency’s increasingly strident tone. “They simply didn’t speak the same language,” Hibbs explains. “Someone should do dramatic readings of the calls from that time—you could have John Lithgow on one side and Glenn Close on the other. They were really talking past each other.”</p>



<p>The FDA’s restraint eventually crumbled. It was Friday, November 22, 2013. 23andMe was flush with optimism: it had recently broken a sales goal and was sitting on over $100 million in venture funding. Wojcicki was at a company offsite when her assistant texted that she’d received a letter from the FDA. Wojcicki immediately had a bad feeling. “Don’t sign for it,” she texted back, preferring for it to languish in a mail storage facility so “I could at least enjoy my weekend,” she says with a laugh.</p>



<p>But Wojcicki was too late. The letter was a strongly-worded order for 23andMe to immediately stop promoting its product. Its intent and tone were crystal clear. “Some of the uses for which [the product] is intended are particularly concerning,” the letter read. “Even after many interactions with 23andMe, we still do not have any assurance that the firm has analytically or clinically validated [the product] for its intended uses. Therefore, 23andMe must immediately discontinue marketing [it] until such time as it receives FDA marketing authorization.”</p>



<p>Wojcicki’s first instinct was to fight. She thought of suing the FDA. Her second instinct was to call everyone she knew who might be able to help. This proved wise: when she spoke with Kessler, the former FDA commissioner, he told her in no uncertain terms that if she defied the order, she would go to jail. Hibbs hedges on this somewhat, but agrees that criminal charges could follow. “It was like a bad breakup letter,” Hibbs says. “Most companies don’t come back from letters like that.”</p>

anne Wojcicki</blockquote>



<p>The insult turned into injury when, in an unusual move, the agency posted the letter on its website the following Monday, attracting widespread media coverage. A sense of crisis swept through the company. Its then-head of communications resigned. But Wojcicki held firm. “They were insinuating that our product was harmful,” she says. “I’m so used to being the straight-A student—I became obsessed with proving them wrong.”</p>



<p>Tapping her personal network, she poached Hibbs from her post at another genetic testing company, tasking her with leading the effort to win FDA approval. The crux of the challenge was proving that consumers could grasp the implications of uncovering facts about their genome without a doctor in the chain of communication. It is a hurdle makers of over-the-counter pills like Tylenol have to overcome every time they market a new product: can shoppers understand how to take the medication? Do they appreciate the risks and know how to minimize them?</p>



<p>No maker of direct-to-consumer DNA tests had ever grappled with these kinds of questions. According to Wojcicki, many of them employ a “doc in the box” model, in which an invisible doctor rubber-stamps the delivery of a genetic report every time an average Jane requests it. This raises cost and inconvenience. Worse yet, it presumes people are incapable of digesting fundamental information about their own genome. Hibbs compares this to the heavy resistance healthcare bigwigs showed toward at-home pregnancy tests when they first emerged. “The medical establishment fought those tests for years,” Hibbs says. “They honestly thought women could not handle receiving this information at home alone. It is ironic that this situation was playing out again even after people fought so hard to let women read their own pregnancy tests.”</p>



<p>The months following the FDA letter were a hectic scramble to collect this user data through comprehension studies—focus groups where people demonstrate their understanding of a medical product. The data has to be collected in a way that satisfies the FDA’s requirements for diversity, rigor and statistical significance. All told, 23andMe surveyed thousands of people across a wide demographic, even as it was losing money and unable to bring in new revenue due to the moratorium on marketing.</p>



<p>Frustration simmered within the company throughout the saga. Wojcicki, however, was determined to see the setback as an opportunity to not just tick regulatory boxes, but to spark a paradigm shift in the relationship between consumers and their medical information. “The average FDA submission of this type is a few hundred pages; ours was over 7,000,” Wojcicki says—a deluge of data that was meant to prod exactly this kind of broader reckoning. Wojcicki now believes that it paved the way for more breakthroughs in data transparency, such as a federal regulation issued in 2014 that requires medical providers to send patients their lab results the same time they send them to the doctor.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m the kind of person who snaps into action in these kinds of situations.”</p>
anne Wojcicki</blockquote>



<p>Ultimately, what might have constituted an existential crisis to a less committed CEO never rattled Wojcicki. “I’m the kind of person who snaps into action in these kinds of situations,” she says. “My only real worry was how long it was going to take.” Indeed, the company spent well over a year in the wilderness: after painstakingly collecting the data in the months after receiving the cease-and-desist letter, it submitted its application to the FDA in June 2014. In February 2015, it received regulatory authorization to market a genetic health test directly to consumers.</p>



<p>“I have a level of stubbornness that’s apparent to anyone who knows me,” Wojcicki says. Roelof Botha, the Sequoia partner who works with 23andMe and helped it go public in 2021, cites this mix of pragmatism and dogged determination among Wojcicki’s best qualities. “She’s unconventional, but she’s also totally unpretentious,” he says. “She has obviously been very successful, and she is just who she is and very comfortable in her own skin—what you see is what you get. And that makes for a very efficient business relationship, because there’s very little pretense, very little bravado. She’s just direct.”</p>



<p>Botha now sees promise in 23andMe’s current mandate to leverage its massive genetic database to develop treatments for illnesses; in 2018 the company entered into a <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-announces-extension-gsk-collaboration-and-update-joint">partnership</a> with British pharmaceuticals giant GSK to discover and develop drugs based on genetic information in 23andMe’s DNA library from customers who agreed it could be used for this purpose. “I look forward to having several blockbuster drugs a decade from now,” Botha says. “That to me is the real vision and potential of the company.”</p>



<p>That 23andMe not only continues to dominate its field but could eventually evolve into a pharmaceuticals powerhouse is a testament to its integrity in an industry where principles and profit sometimes make for uneasy bedfellows. Our conversations take place during the trial of Elizabeth Holmes, of Theranos infamy—a cautionary tale about how wrong things can go in biotech without a commitment to integrity. Many have placed gender at the heart of the Theranos controversy. Wojcicki permits that gender played a role in the scandal but is hesitant to ascribe specific meaning to it. “I have no doubt it would have been different if she was a man, but I don’t know exactly how,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question of gender has followed Wojcicki’s own career since it started. She emphasizes the importance of elevating women in her organization, even agreeing when asked if she would prefer that the next leader of 23andMe—as far off as that might be—is a woman. Equality is her top priority, however, and she acknowledges that the pendulum can swing too far in the opposite direction: in 23andMe’s early days, the company had “too many women,” as Wojcicki puts it. “We reached a point where I was like, ‘I need men to balance it out!’,” she recalls. “Women tend to flock to work with other women, especially when they’re coming from these heavily male-dominated places.”</p>



<p>One place that certainly was not male dominated was Wojcicki’s childhood home, where she and her two sisters enjoyed a relationship with their parents in which the very idea of “dominance” was completely alien. Her mother Esther, a former teacher who recently published a book about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Raise-Successful-People-Lessons/dp/1328974863">raising successful children</a>, frequently writes and speaks about the importance of questioning authority and challenging preconceived notions of who gets to call the shots.</p>



<p>This ethos forms the core of how Wojcicki now leads 23andMe, whose culture she describes as one of cooperation and willingness to participate in non-ego driven pursuits. It is also one where scientific inquisitiveness and a desire to constantly push the boundaries of discovery are more important than always finding the “right” answer.</p>



<p>“We are very much about recognizing interesting problems and coming up with collective solutions. Sometimes I find people with the right DNA for us, who didn’t flourish because they weren’t in the right environment, but who go on to flourish with us.”</p>



<p>Framing her management ethos in terms of those age-old dance partners—DNA and environment—is of a piece with Wojcicki’s overall worldview, one in which genes and circumstances interact to create a whole human being, in which exploring where one factor begins and the other ends is worthy of a category-defining company and mountains of scientific innovation. Yet despite this audacious ambition, the energy in Wojcicki’s voice as she describes her experiences discovering her roots belies a more down-to-earth motivation: the need to simply and deeply comprehend one’s place in the world.</p>



<p>“Going back to see my father’s hometown, to the apartment he lived in, to taste the food he ate…in the back of my mind I was always thinking, ‘what if it was me?’”</p>

<p>The unprecedented speed and success of mRNA vaccines in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the demand for mRNA as a next-generation nucleic acid therapy. Hundreds of ongoing clinical trials are currently testing mRNA across more than 20 disease categories. The current production process, called In Vitro Transcription (IVT), has been successfully scaled up but produces immunostimulatory byproducts such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), is limited to shorter mRNA products and requires expensive reagents, including very pure DNA plasmids and proprietary enzymes to catalyze the reactions. Sensible Bio has developed a proprietary system to produce mRNA in living cells. By leveraging natural internal cellular processes combined with synthetic biology and biomimetic approaches, Sensible’s platform aims to produce longer mRNA, free of immunogenic contaminants (such as dsRNA), while enabling the production of mRNA with natural modifications, all key attributes for mRNA therapeutics — while lowering production costs by an order of magnitude.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>The mRNA therapeutics market exceeded $40 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow to $130 billion by 2030. We believe that Sensible Bio’s mRNA production platform could potentially replace today’s In Vitro Transcription method for many applications, especially in mRNA therapeutics that require longer mRNA and higher doses. While the company’s initial focus will be on manufacturing best-in-class mRNA and partnering with biotech companies developing mRNA therapeutics, over time they could potentially integrate mRNA design and delivery systems, creating an end-to-end mRNA platform.</p><p>We look forward to joining <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslavgasparek/">Miro</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marian-kupculak-34468a85/">Marian</a> and the <a href="https://www.sensible.bio/">Sensible Bio</a> team on their journey.

 In some parts of the world, access to credit and debt financing is relatively easy for promising businesses to obtain. But in much of the world and most emerging markets, access to capital can be heavily restricted, even for businesses in good financial health and with strong cash flows.

<p>In some parts of the world, access to credit and debt financing is relatively easy for promising businesses to obtain. But in much of the world and most emerging markets, access to capital can be heavily restricted, even for businesses in good financial health and with strong cash flows.</p>

<p>This is a guest post from a contact in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So many images from recent years are jarring and upsetting: little children kept isolated in individual chalk circles on a school yard, or an elderly couple, masked, separated, clutching each other through the barrier of a plastic sheet. Some images look harmless, even decorative and attractive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I’d had a weather-eye open, looking around the immediate vicinity at what was going on in this little corner of the labyrinth. I didn’t have to look far. As the leaves fell in the Autumn of 2021, I started to see brightly coloured symbols appear on the pavements in my neighbourhood, only a few metres from my home: hot pink diamonds, bright blue hexagons, sets of vivid footprints, all bonded to the grey tarmac at my feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Later, in the park, cute cartoon insects and hopscotch grids popped up along the paths. I believe that many of the same folks who would be dismayed at the sight of primary school children in virtual reality headsets would support the idea of anything that encourages children to go outdoors, to go to the park, and to play hopscotch. Who wouldn’t want to see kids playing hopscotch?&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Symbols have power. The diamonds, hexagons, and cartoon critters are part of three ‘health walks’ around two of the poorest areas of <a href="https://www.cherwell.gov.uk/info/3/leisure-and-wellbeing/246/countryside-walks-and-health-routes/4">Banbury</a>, in Oxfordshire, UK (Grimsbury, on the other side of town, got green stars on its pavements). The health walks are, apparently, meant to support the local community ‘to recover from covid by encouraging more outdoor activity and improving general wellbeing in a safe environment’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The scheme was paid for by the UK government’s Contain Outbreak Management Fund (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contain-outbreak-management-fund-2021-to-2022/contain-outbreak-management-fund-guidance-financial-year-2021-to-2022">COMF</a>): a disconcertingly sinister-sounding title to lie directly behind smiley honeybees and goofy wriggly earthworm paintings in a kids’ playground. Between 2020 and 2022, COMF paid more than £2 billion to local authorities in England to fund their covid-19 ‘test, trace and contain’ activity, and, specifically, ‘compliance and enforcement’ measures. Payments were based partly on an area’s level of deprivation, because ‘projections’ showed that economically deprived areas had high covid infection and transmission rates (essentially “poor people spread diseases” given a 21st century update).</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am willing to look, and I have eyes to see; what I find extremely difficult is to look with compassion. The main thing I feel is raw anger. I have to search hard for the compassion within me. I start to feel a little more compassion (and more humility, too) when I remember how relatively recently it was that the branding of a charity or an NGO would fool me. Those green leaf mandala motifs and panda bear logos really work! I was suckered. I was extremely surprised when the powers-that-be announced they’d decided to stop pillaging the Earth and save her instead, but very pleased too…as switched on as I thought I was, I took it at face value, and only started to see the truth in recent years.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am quite sure that the vast majority of the men and women unwittingly hired to build the apparatus of the panopticon believe that they are involved in something good and worthwhile and beneficial. Back in 2017, Bicester, an Oxfordshire town to the east of Banbury, got the first of three ‘<a href="https://democracy.witney-tc.gov.uk/documents/s1873/Bicester%20Healthy%20New%20Town_Health%20Routes%20case%20study_NHSE%20final.pdf">blue line health walks</a>’- basically, three circular routes of 5 kilometres each (perfect for the NHS ‘Couch to 5K’ app). The ‘health walks’ are one of the innovations in the built environment which is being trialed in Bicester as part of a public-private partnership called <a href="https://www.activeoxfordshire.org/uploads/rosie-rowe---healthy-place-shaping-powerpoint.pdf">Healthy New Towns</a> (HNT). During the covid lockdowns, the Bicester health walks saw a surge in use, presumably when citizens left their houses for their permitted hour of exercise. The routes are marked by a wide blue line painted on the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel compassion when I see the photo of the council worker pushing the machine which paints the blue line along the route. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/healthybicester/posts/5k-health-routes-get-new-appregular-users-of-the-blue-lines-in-bicester-will-not/2178022365638628/">next phase</a> included hiring a third party to develop an app and installing geolocated signage along the routes to allow users to log-on to the health route at any of the km points, allowing the app to track people’s progress between scans of QR codes. Individual users would be located either via multilateration of radio signals between cell towers (Bicester has several, which allows for a good degree of accuracy) or via GPS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2018, human-powered outdoor gym equipment which can be used to charge mobile phones and with Bluetooth capability to<a href="https://www.tgogc.com/smart-technology-and-dashboard"> record exertion on the equipment</a> was installed in three locations, including in the new Bicester ‘eco town’ of Elmsbrook. The gym equipment is made by TGO (The Great Outdoor Gym Company) whose recent clients include the BBC, the <a href="https://www.tgogc.com/news-article/tgo-sustainable-cities-united-nations">United Nations</a>, and the NHS. TGO was hired to build an outdoor gym in the grounds of the <a href="https://maudsleycharity.org/case-studies/bethlem-outdoor-gym/">Bethlem Royal</a> psychiatric hospital in London, with the aim of ‘helping patients manage difficult emotions and encourage smoking cessation’.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another town in the county, Kidlington, has its own ‘health routes’ including five ‘Zoo Walks’, marked out in paw prints and the like, a nod to Kidlington being home to Oxford Zoo in the 1930s. The ‘Zoo Walks’ were funded by Sport England. Sport England, a non-governmental public body which gets three-quarters of its funding from the UK National Lottery (a ‘good cause’ that people buying a lotto ticket are supporting) hired <a href="https://www.hopscotchconsulting.co.uk/">Hopscotch Consulting</a> on an unrelated project called <a href="https://www.studio-you.co.uk/about-studio-you">Studio You</a>, a video platform used by PE (physical education) teachers in schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studio You is designed for teenage girls who have been deemed ‘less active’ (ie, who don’t engage in 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity a day). Hopscotch Consulting is a social impact agency and is the only specialist education consultancy on the Government Communication Services roster.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hopscotchconsulting.co.uk/"></a></p>
<p>Names have power. Healthy New Towns (HNT) is a programme funded by the National Health Service (NHS) and involving a wide range of ‘partners’ from the public, private and third sector. It was launched in 2015. Ten locations were chosen across England to act as <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/innovation/healthy-new-towns/demonstrator-sites/eco-bicester/">demonstrator sites</a>, and Bicester is one of them. As part of the HNT programme, 13,000 new houses will be built in the town (on greenfield land) over the next 20 years. 6,000 of these new houses will be the North West Bicester ‘eco town’ of which Elmsbrook is the first phase, comprising nearly 400 houses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HNT programme uses population growth as an opportunity to test innovations in the built environment, new models of care, and ‘community activation’ and identify the impact they have on public health, and then to replicate these innovations throughout the county and the country. Or, as the then Chief Executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/01/ten-new-healthy-towns-to-be-built-in-england">put it</a>: “As these new neighbourhoods and towns are built, we’ll kick ourselves if in ten years’ time we look back having missed the opportunity to ‘design out’ the obesogenic environment, and ‘design in’ health and wellbeing.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each one of the HNT developments has its own set of priorities; for example, one priority for the Whyndyke Garden Village development in Lancashire is ‘Pushing the telehealth care agenda’ (and with a <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/innovation/healthy-new-towns/demonstrator-sites/whyndyke/">direct quote</a> from the NHS like that, who needs conspiracy theories?) The stated vision for Bicester is ‘To create a healthy community by making it easy, attractive and affordable for people of all ages to live healthy, sustainable lifestyles and to replicate the learning to elsewhere.’&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/innovation/healthy-new-towns/demonstrator-sites/whyndyke/"></a></p>
<p>Bicester’s HNT priorities are to increase activity levels and reduce the weight of adults and children, and reduce the number of people who feel lonely or socially isolated ‘in order to improve their mental wellbeing’. And they’ve got the statistics to prove it: apparently, in Bicester, 1 in 4 children age 2-10, 58% of women, and 65% of men are overweight or obese. The lack of compunction these policy-makers have about reducing people to a set of numbers based on very narrow, questionable measurements (Body Mass Index scores, etc) is palpable. Other ‘innovations’ being tested include a mental health website for teenagers and parents, and a <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/diabetes/digital-innovations-to-support-diabetes-outcomes/nhs-diabetes-prevention-programme-digital-stream/">new diabetes pathway</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a stated HNT aim is to test ‘new digital technologies and health related applications to promote self-diagnosis, self-monitoring and self-care’ it seems likely that this new diabetes pathway will be a ‘digital stream’ of an existing face-to-face programme launched in 2016 which, through personalised diet, exercise, and lifestyle advice, targets people at high risk of type 2 diabetes. The digital version of this programme, which will be trialed in Bicester and other locations, is aimed at the same at-risk group but will involve wearable technologies that monitor levels of exercise, apps which allow users to access health coaches, online peer support groups, and the setting and monitoring of goals electronically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Elmsbrook development uses the ‘<a href="https://www.bioregional.com/one-planet-living">One Planet Living</a>’ framework and includes what is said to be the first ‘One Planet’ school in the UK. ‘One Planet Living’ is a joint initiative of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and BioRegional, a UK-based consultancy charity and social enterprise who ‘create and support alliances aimed at driving home the UN Sustainable Development Goals both in the UK and globally.’&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ‘One Planet’ logo is immediately reminiscent of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) logo, and indeed BioRegional boast on their website that they were involved in the<a href="https://www.bioregional.com/projects-and-services/case-studies/championing-the-sustainable-development-goals-from-2011"> negotiation of the SDGs</a> and ‘showed up to every UN meeting handing out leaflets with our brightly coloured One Planet Living principles’. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vGpMiFBP_s">promotional material</a> for Elmsbrook eco-village is replete with meadows, parks, nature reserves, bird-houses, community allotments, communal herb boxes, beehives, bug hotels, turf roofs, childrens’ play areas, outdoor gyms, footpaths, and cycle-lanes lush with trees.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sounds great, right? Homes in Elmsbrook receive a tablet installed with a home information system called <a href="https://www.ribaj.com/products/eco-homes-take-a-shimmy">Shimmy</a>, which displays real-time energy use and costs for electricity, heating and hot water, plus real-time bus travel updates and enabling users to make bookings at the local car club. The Shimmy also acts as a form of social media portal, communicating updates to residents on local meetings and events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today when I see the pink diamonds and the blue hexagons, and other little signs and symbols here and there, I have a sense that I’m seeing the very tips of the tentacles of a huge nameless entity, an indication that something much much bigger lurks under the surface, something gigantic yet hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ribaj.com/products/eco-homes-take-a-shimmy"></a></p>
<p>Would anything change if people knew? If people knew that the colourful symbols their children skipped along came courtesy of the Contain Outbreak Management Fund? If people knew that their desirable energy-efficient eco-home in a pleasant, leafy new village was, in reality, <a href="https://pilotfeasibilitystudies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40814-020-0550-2#Sec25">an experiment</a> in the best ways to induce behaviour change and compliance, and a massive data-gathering exercise?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or has consent been manufactured so effectively that even if people knew, they would be OK with it? Are we OK with being lab rats, as long as our cages and our mazes are warm and comfortable? The image of the labyrinth is a potent one, and my understanding of its relevance to the place we currently collectively find ourselves has deepened as I wrote this piece: so many times as I kept reading and following links to this or that organisation’s ‘partners’ website, the same names kept appearing, the same symbols, the same phrases, the same words…words with double meanings, words whose meaning has been changed; so no matter which way I turned, I always seemed to end up back at the same place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can’t get out, yet I can’t find my way to the dark heart of it. It’s like going round in circles…</p>

<p>Integration of Nym with Woleet’s platform to advance privacy by default in French&nbsp;tech</p><p>Paris, France — Wednesday, 05 April 2023: Today, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym</a>, the leader in network layer privacy, and <a href="https://www.woleet.io/">Woleet</a>, the proof system for modern companies, have announced a partnership that will benefit thousands of users of Woleet’s file certification tool&nbsp;suite.</p><p>This partnership of two French companies will first launch with an integration of the Nym mixnet with the Woleet platform as a transport layer to enhance the privacy of Woleet users, which include multinational corporations like <a href="https://www.kering.com/en/">Kering</a>, <a href="https://www.danone.com">Danone</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chanel.com/">Chanel</a>.</p><p>Nym COO Alexis Roussel said, “We have been using Woleet’s e-signatory tool as a long term customer. We are very satisfied by the technology used by Woleet. This partnership is an organic extension of ensuring the privacy-preserving tools that we use get the maximum privacy protection which is by using&nbsp;Nym.”</p><p>“Following our <a href="https://nymtech.medium.com/privacy-and-the-future-of-french-tech-81cac26e52c1">recent official launch of Nym France</a> at Paris Blockchain Week, securing a partnership with a prolific French tech company is a step in the right direction and validates our decision to invest in France.” adds&nbsp;Alexis.</p><p>Woleet Founder &amp; CEO Gilles Cadignan said, “One of the biggest advantages of using Woleet compared to other competitors in the digital trust space, has always been privacy. Thanks to cryptography we are able to protect enterprise data without accessing their actual content.”</p><p>“With this partnership with Nym, Woleet aims to push forward towards even more privacy for our users, having in mind the ultimate goal of empowering users with more control over their sensitive data,” he&nbsp;adds.</p><p>A second, larger, integration will explore the use of Nym’s anonymous credentials system, <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">zk-nyms</a>, in <a href="https://doc.woleet.io/docs/woleetid-server">Woleet’s ID server</a>. This will allow users to sign documents without leaking unnecessary personal information.</p><p>Both Nym and Woleet have a long-standing reputation for privacy-first in their services, which run on blockchain technology. In particular, Woleet uses the Bitcoin blockchain to timestamp files that are certified by their platform.</p><p>Combining privacy technology with Web3 serves to provide a robust solution that allows users to retain data sovereignty while benefiting from the security and digital tamper-resistance properties of decentralisation. These are all integral to both large corporations and small startups, who have turned fully digital and need to protect their customers.</p><p>Woleet users can expect their services to fully run on the Nym mixnet within the&nbsp;year.</p><p>- END&nbsp;-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance.</p><p>About Woleet</p><p>Woleet is a French startup created in 2016. The goal is to democratize digital security and minimize centralized trust. Woleet provides a new approach to digital trust based on the Bitcoin protocol. With Woleet, all companies are able to create irrefutable and international evidence of electronic signature and time&nbsp;stamp.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Candice Teo, <a href="mailto:candice@nymtech.net">candice@nymtech.net</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-brings-enhanced-privacy-to-woleets-secured-file-certification-platform-635416d79753">Press release: Nym brings enhanced privacy to Woleet’s secured file certification platform</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

     Q1 was a quarter full of growth and exciting new milestones for the Horizen ecosystem, including the launch of our EVM-compatible sidechain EON on various testnet stages, bringing an influx of developer activity onto Horizen; enhanced the security of the Horizen network by fixing a vulnerability in our node application; and approved an important ZenIP that will make Horizen more resilient and scalable.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>We launched several new products and upgrades, grew the team, welcomed our EVM sidechain, EON, to testnet, and more! We are excited to continue meeting new milestones with our growing community.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>We achieved several major milestones in the development of EON, Horizen’s public EVM-compatible sidechain and smart contracting platform. These milestones include the releases of two separate testnet environments, Dune and Yuma; a new version of Cobalt wallet to support EON testnet functionalities; and other developer tools such as explorers and test token faucet.</p>
<p>Also during Q1, we released three core software upgrades with functionalities to support EON, and <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zend-node-application-disclosure-and-fixes/">fixed a security vulnerability</a> in the ZEND node application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p></p>
 EON Testnet Environments – Dune and Yuma 
<p>Dune is the pre-alpha and invite-only testnet for EON. It was launched on January 18 and welcomed a small group of 90+ developers to test the platform.<a href="https://yuma.horizen.io"> Yuma</a> is the temporary public testnet for EON that came after Dune. Yuma testnet is public and accessible for anyone to test and try out Horizen’s first public EVM. We were excited to see an even larger influx of developer activities on Yuma, releasing the testnet to a wider pool of testers. Much of their feedback was tremendously helpful in gearing up for our permanent public testnet, Gobi! </p>
<p>Both testnets are important milestones before launching EON to Gobi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yuma testnet is a big upgrade of Dune with key new capabilities and improvements:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Learn more about these new capabilities on Yuma<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-evm-eon-is-now-live-on-yuma-public-testnet/"> here</a>.</p>
 EON Developer Tools and Resources 
<p>We released a set of easy-to-use developer and end-user tools to the EON platform:</p>
 
 <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">EON App</a> with support for <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/cross-chain-transactions/#backward-transfers">backward transfer</a>&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://faucet.horizen.io">Test token faucet&nbsp;</a> 
 <a href="https://horizen.io/wallets/cobalt">Cobalt wallet</a> with built-in testnet faucet and other EVM support 
 <a href="https://yuma.horizen.io">Testnet status dashboards</a> 
 <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/docs">EON documentation</a> 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhZisbhyYIXI4IPY072Q6HDDLi1hAYAp_">EON tutorials</a> 
 
 EON Partnership and Integrations 
<p></p>
<p>In addition to the tools built-in-house, the EON platform is integrated with supported by popular 3rd party tools and products that provide developers and users a streamlined and easy user experience.&nbsp;</p>
 
 ThirdWeb: A low-code web3 development platform, offering smart contract libraries and deployments along with a series of SDKs and APIs including connectivity with Shopify. 
 Revoke.Cash: A preventative tool that helps users practice proper wallet hygiene.&nbsp; 
 Chainlist: Chainlist is a list of EVM networks. Users can use the information to connect their wallets and Web3 middleware providers to the appropriate Chain ID and Network ID to connect to the correct chain. 
 BlockScout: The first fully-featured open-source blockchain explorer available for use by any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain 
 Web3.js: Ethereum JavaScript API 
 Remix: The Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) with a GUI for developing smart contracts. 
 Truffle: A popular development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for developing applications on EVM-based blockchains. 
 Hardhat: A popular Ethereum development environment for developers 
 MetaMask: A popular self-custodial wallet that interacts with the Ethereum and EMV-compatible blockchains. 
 
 
 Multichain: A popular cross-chain bridge with high transaction speeds and no-slippage swaps. 
 
<p>More integrations and products are being added to the EON ecosystem.</p>
 What’s Next for EON – Gobi &amp; Mainnet Preview 
<p>With Yuma, we have registered the first non-ceasable sidechain in testnet. We had to fork the mainchain to upgrade ZEND ahead of time. Gobi will be non-ceasable as well and on the official track.</p>
<p>Gobi will be registered with a setup that will be the same as we will have in mainnet.</p>
<p>47 validators will be active in securing the chain, while there will be more nodes to serve our public RPC other than the nodes dedicated to the EON block explorer.</p>
<p>Among the new features Gobi will bring:</p>
 
 Improved performance 
 Websocket support 
 Security improvements 
 Autoscaling RPC nodes based on demand 
 
<p>When the EON chain is up and running, the team will bring the secure enclave for certificate signing as well.</p>
<p>We will also be launching a bug bounty program and developer grant program in the next phases.</p>

					Making zero-knowledge applications Faster		    
     
 


 
         
    <p>There are two industry-significant updates from the <a href="https://horizenlabs.io">Horizen Labs</a> cryptography team:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/323">Poseidon2:</a> The Horizen Labs team has upgraded the default hash function for zero-knowledge (zk) applications by introducing Poseidon2, an enhanced version of Poseidon.</p>
<p>The Poseidon hash function is currently the default choice for zero-knowledge applications such as zkEVMs, zkVMs, Mina, and various applications within Polygon. Poseidon2 can replace any instance of Poseidon in all zero-knowledge applications, bringing faster hashing speeds to all.</p>
<p>RC64, is another new hash function. There are two scenarios where hashes are needed, in&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) everyday (cryptographic) plain computations, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) circuit (re: SNARK) computations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen Labs cryptography team created the new RC64 hash function that works best for both scenarios. If there is a need for both everyday and circuit computations, using RC64 is preferable over Poseidon2.&nbsp;</p>

 ZenIP 42204: Deprecation of Shielded Pools from Horizen Mainchain 
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204</a>&nbsp;proposed the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain.&nbsp;The purpose of ZenIP 42204 is to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risks.&nbsp;It proposes a solution to eliminate technical debt and avoid regulatory threats that can prevent the greater Horizen community from fully and freely participating in our ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenIP 42204 was met with&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/community-survey-results-are-in-for-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">overwhelmingly positive support from the community</a>, when asked if they are in agreement with ZenIP 42204, 75.3% of survey takers are favorable, 12.7% are neutral, and 11.9% are not favorable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the majority of votes and feedback we have received are in agreement with ZenIP 42204, we will be moving forward with this proposal and plan the changes into a future ZEND software release.&nbsp;<a href="https://podcast.horizen.io/episode/2-removal-of-shielded-pools">Episode 2 of our Beyond the Horizen Podcast</a>&nbsp;goes into further detail on ZenIP 42204 and next steps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>March 28, 2023</p>
<p>Dear Alison, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are my final notes of Wolfgang Smith’s Theistic Evolution. It is a bit longer than I had intended as I had originally decided to leave out chapter eight but changed my mind as I thought some of the points might be useful. I have left out the chapters that most directly relate to Christian doctrine, but, as these final notes show, it is really impossible to understand Teilhard without some reference to his Catholic context.</p>
 Chapter Eight: The New Eschaton in Historical Perspective 
<p>The title of this chapter is a bit off-putting! It really describes the historical context in which Teilhard was able to re-define the aim of God’s divine plan for humanity. In Teilhard’s ideas we have effectively abandoned the centuries-old quest for God and replaced it with the idea of an evolutionary collective human utopia. We have now endowed “progress” with a kind of mysticism and have even begun to worship it as a futuristic new world region that is intended to replace all other religions. This shift began before Teilhard, and is the context in which he emerged.</p>
<p>Very briefly, during the Renaissance some influential Christians attempted to fuse neo-paganism with Christianity. This had massive and multiple ramifications for the West, but one product of this attempted fusion was secular humanism which in part furnished the path for the ascendance of rationalism (which is actually is rooted in developments in the 14th century) and then of modern science in the 18th century Enlightenment. The West came to be dominated by the quest for knowledge of the material world which gradually left no room for metaphysical speculation and thus the “above” of heaven.</p>
<p>From this point on the natural world began to look like a closed and self-sufficient system. No longer did we look for causes in a transcendent realm and life became&nbsp; flattened onto the horizontal plane. Humanity then had nowhere else to go but forward and the futuristic cult of progress became inevitable.</p>
<p>Enlightenment thinkers, especially Descartes and Newton, made the world into “a self-moving machine, governed by mechanical laws.” It’s not a long way from this to the inside-out robot!</p>
<p>Whilst the discoveries and speculations of Newton and Descartes allowed us to measure and manipulate the material world in new ways, they have been shown to be not necessarily that useful in the explanation of the true causes and nature of things. Discoveries in quantum physics since the early twentieth century have particularly brought into question the true nature of reality. Thus, the author is able to say there exist very few absolutely established scientific facts and much of what we call science is highly coloured by human subjectivism.</p>
<p>“Science” has a valid place within human knowledge, but it is not the only way of knowing the world. In many ways, it traps us in a world of “models” of reality that actually separate us from the true experience of multi-layered human existence. It has even changed our view of the past as our ancestors now seem superstitious and “unliberated” because they chose to subject themselves to the rules imposed by God. So, now we are to be treated to the “liberation” implicit in the new religion of evolutionary, scientific humanism.</p>
<p>The author argues that there are two main reasons that the majority of people are allowing themselves to be herded into this new enclosure. The first are the “miracles of technology” and the second is that the Darwinist theory of evolution is now accepted as an established fact by the vast majority of the Western population.</p>
<p>This is the context in which Teilhard appeared. However, the scientist-theologian has taken us a step further from the secular credo of progress to “Point Omega, the New Eschaton.” That is to say, he shifts this apparently godless worldview into the yet more dangerous territory where these developments become the divinely ordained climax of history. These are not just natural processes – they are the unfolding of God’s plan for mankind in which we as a collective become subsumed into God Himself through the processes described by Teilhard.</p>
<p>Teilhard enters an almost drunken “ecstasy” in his promotion of science. For him, science and not God is “the source of life” and he exults in “the divine taste of its fruit.” As the author highlights, this is an interesting choice of words with somewhat sinister echoes of the story of the Fall of mankind as told in the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>He clearly asserts that research is the religious function and that science will “absorb the spirit of war and shine with the light of religions.” Thus, Teilhard says that Science will eventually become the one world religion, and those who wish to share in this glorious spirit “must die and be reborn.”</p>
<p>There is nothing in Christianity that suggests that the way of salvation is even remotely related to natural philosophy or scientific research. Indeed, Christ seems to teach the opposite as those who wish to share in the life of the kingdom to come must be like small children.</p>
<p>Teilhard goes beyond the tradition of Francis Bacon which emphasizes the amassing and transmission of knowledge as central to the establishment of a secular New Jerusalem on earth. For Teilhard, such activities seem to contain the very spirit of humanity itself and thus become semi-mystical. Moreover, transmitted knowledge is becoming ever more narrowed into only those channels that are acceptable to modern science. This marks a radical departure from the traditional ways of transmitting knowledge as we jettison all older ways of knowing.</p>
<p>In effect we are now reduced to interpretations of reality that conform to Teilhard’s Law of Complexity. In fact, we owe our very ability to interpret the world to this process as complexity begets consciousness.</p>
<p>The individual human has now evolved as far as it can go in the “old” way. The only evolution now open to us is the collective one of the further complexification of socialization which has now become&nbsp; a biological process that gets us back on the evolutive course towards an encounter with God. And science and technology are apparently the means by which the birth of this new super-organism will be achieved.</p>
 Chapter Nine: Socialization and the Super-Organism 
<p>According to Teilhard, human evolution can only continue through the formation of social groupings from which a biological phenomenon will arise, namely the production of a collective psyche.</p>
<p>In the absence of any proof, he argues that the increasingly rapid transmission of thought in telephone wires and radio transmitters amounts to a global “nervous system”. But this is quite clearly not an organic entity in the sense that our nervous systems are organic. There is a clear separation in kind between the artificial and the biological. Teilhard appears not to notice this.</p>
<p>But his portrayal of socialization and technological processes in terms of the biological is absolutely central to his doctrine. He believes that there is a growing compulsion for us to act collectively which is a sign that out of this aggregation of biological human organisms a super consciousness is arising. Moreover, rather than subsuming our personalities in the collective, this is giving us “a greater awareness of our own personality”.</p>
<p>Teilhard is able to make this leap because he identifies the thinker as being the thought process. This takes Descartes’ maxim “I think therefore I am” a step further than the philosopher intended. For Descartes thought indicates the presence of a thinker who is executing the thought, for Teilhard the thought is the thinker. So, in this sense, the aggregate of all our thoughts is an aggregate of biological entities. This allows Teilhard to say that total identification with becoming part of the collective intensifies the personalization of the individual. But how do you further “personalize” an organism that is already a person?</p>
<p>What he seems to be referring to is the absorption of and self-identification with images and information taken in by electronic means such as the television. As we take in pictures from around the world this, in a sense, gives us a global consciousness. The sense of self is then expanded by including all other selves. The author suggests that the somewhat banal concept of “socialization” has taken on a more mystical air than it deserves and has led Teilhard enthusiasts to over-estimate the nature of a global collective consciousness. He suggests that Teilhard (consciously or unconsciously) encouraged this attribution of almost mystical qualities to this new consciousness.</p>
<p>In Christianity, personhood is breathed into humanity by God. It is a spiritual essence and thus not subject to evolution. But Teilhard is arguing that this personhood is now going to evolve due to “socialization”, and that this is some kind of biological evolution. The author argues that the legitimate development of personality is essentially a question of spiritual development and that by severing us from the “above” Teilhard has removed this possibility from us. In fact, he argues that true personalization will be achieved only by those able to swim against the tide of collectivization. Thus, ultimately Teilhard’s socialization does not personalize.</p>
<p>In removing us from the invisible spiritual realms Teilhard has also effectively wiped out all belief in the “spiritual influences” be they beneficial or malefic. Angels, demons and spirits no longer exist and Smith argues that this produces within us a spiritual blindness that is potentially disastrous.</p>
<p>Teilhard has brought about this vulnerability by making “spirit” merely a product of the Law of Complexity which has become the key to everything. We now only see spirit in terms of quantity—of more or less. As spirit cannot be seen in qualitative terms we can no longer talk in terms of good and evil spirits. However, he sees Evolution producing only that which is “good”. Thus, the spirit produced through the processes he describes can only be “good.” In one fell swoop we have become blinded to evil.</p>
<p>So, we must value all forms of human collectivism, no matter how brutal, as they are aspects of the complexification that will eventually lead to the good. We must recall his law of the conservation of personality in which he argues that any level of collective personalization (spirit) that is achieved in such efforts will be forever conserved. He even argues that all human activity is directed by the risen Christ and thus the totalitarian efforts of a Hitler or a Stalin are legitimate in the quest for spiritualization. Teilhard has thus managed to abolish all the malefic powers, including Satan himself!</p>
<p>For Teilhard the only legitimate human endeavor now is to build the technological super-state. We must now evolve as a collective in order to ensure the survival of the species. Smith comments:“To act, to produce and even to think collectively—that is the ‘growing compulsion’ from which there is supposedly no escape.”</p>
<p>In a speech given at the French Embassy in Peking in 1945&nbsp; Teilhard talks of the “recent totalitarian experiments” and their descent into sub-humanity as merely the result of “clumsy” and “incomplete” execution. But despite the recent failures of Hitler and Stalin it is clear he believes that sooner or later the experiment must succeed.</p>
<p>All human drives are now subsumed within one neo-humanist religion which leads inexorably to convergence. Indeed, Teilhard argues that the Christian is essentially involved in a struggle to attain “a supreme center of consciousness which calls to him; the evolution of the earth ending in an act of union.” In so claiming, Teilhard places himself in opposition to over two thousand years of orthodox Christian teaching.</p>
<p>In his re-making of Christian doctrine, he opposes this collective “Christian spirit” to (his version) of the promethean who Teilhard maintains will steal knowledge from the gods for his own selfish and egotistical ends. He transforms the “Christian spirit” into an acquiescence to collectivism as “the spirit of love” itself. Thus, to place oneself in opposition to his teachings is to oppose Christ Himself! The author rightly asks if the development of a super-organism and its expression in the super-state is really an act of love? Is the evolution of the earth through whatever totalitarian means necessary really the essence of the teaching of Christ? Is this not, in truth, the real Promethean spirit – pitting mankind against God and ultimately forcing us to worship human evolution?</p>
<p>Teilhard was predictably enraptured by the development of nuclear power. Which</p>
<p>“…having afforded us access to the heart of the atom, would lead us to overthrow, one by one, the many other strongholds which science is already besieging. The vitalization of matter by the creation of super-molecules. The remodeling of the human organism by means of hormones. Control of heredity and sex by manipulation of genes and chromosomes. The readjustment and internal liberation of our souls by direct action upon springs gradually brought to light by psychoanalysis. The arousing and harnessing of the unfathomable intellectual and effective power still latent in the human mass.”</p>
<p>Smith highlights that this “Faustian fantasy” is followed by the increasingly frenzied language of the fanatic: “In laying hands on the very core of matter we have disclosed to human existence a supreme purpose: the purpose of pursuing ever further, to the very end, the forces of Life. In exploding the atom we took our first bite at the fruit of the great discovery, and this was enough for a taste to enter our mouths that can never be washed away.”</p>
<p>He has his eye on the tree of Life. It does not seem to perturb him in the slightest that in Christian teaching mankind was ejected from Eden precisely to keep us away from this tree!</p>
<p>Teilhard is clearly influenced by the teaching of St Paul regarding the Mystical Body of Christ. He seems to want to build a biological equivalent to this spiritual body in the noosphere. So, now we seem to have two super-organisms, one supernatural and the other natural. Final unity would be achieved for Teilhard when these two entities came together.</p>
<p>Smith points out that the Bible does indeed allude to a second super-organism and asks if this is the one to be built through the collective efforts of men. These efforts were clearly introduced in the story of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11). It is also clear that human collective communication plays a central role in that story. Are Teilhard’s attempts to build a single planetary nervous system, facilitating global communication attempts to subvert God’s actions at Babel?</p>
<p>For Smith, Teilhard’s work is located within that “vast counter-movement to Christianity” that is spoken of by the apocalyptic discourses of Christ and in the Book of Revelation. Teilhard’s collective human organism “…replete with its own Antichristic ‘center of attraction’: it will in all respects be a caricature, a kind of satanic imitation or inverted image of the true Mystical Body of Christ. And this super-organism will grow and wax great by deceiving vast multitudes with its clever lies and marvelous feats. And in the end it will hoist religious colors and proclaim itself Divine.”</p>
<p>Teilhard proclaimed that the final convergence would involve the merging of the supernatural body of Christ and the biotechnological convergence of humanity through evolution. Yet in reality he disavows belief in the supernatural. In his true vision the only true mystical body is being developed under the power of Christ through scientific and technological means. Thus, the mystical body is the emergent super-organism.</p>
 Chapter Ten: The New Religion 
<p>Until Teilhard emerged on the scene the Darwinists believed that they had put paid to religion. But he recognised a distinctly religious element in the emerging alliance between neo-humanism and science, declaring, “A religion of the earth is being mobilised against the religion of heaven.”</p>
<p>This religion is the one and only true religion. It is the manifestation of this new evolutionary progression on the collective human plane, harmonized with Christianity. Having apparently outmaneuvered the atheism of traditional Darwinism, he received a rapturous response from within the Church. He had lifted Christianity out of the dust of the past and made it into the thing of the future!</p>
<p>However, only an already theologically weakened Church could have overlooked the fact that his doctrines were actually implacably hostile to Christianity. In personal letters he embraces his role not as the saviour of Christianity but as the founder of a new religion: a religion that could only be founded after Darwin had planted his seeds in the human heart.</p>
<p>The secularizing impact of this Teilhardian dogma can be seen in all Christian denominations. The author quotes the Catholic ecclesiastic Albert Drexl who talks about the connection of Teilhard’s ideas to the Second Vatican Council and gives a chilling summary of how they have formed the basis of this new religion: “Inasmuch as he turned his back to the past, fused God and the supernatural with the process of a universal evolutionism and proclaimed religion to be an active participation in a progressive development ending in Point Omega, the basis was given for a humanist cult of the secular.”</p>
<p>This is notwithstanding the fact that there is no firmly established scientific basis for his theories. He relegated all Christian doctrines to a subsidiary role to his three articles of faith:</p>
 
 Faith in the (personalizing) personality of God, the focus of the world 
 Faith in the divinity of the divinity of the historic Christ (not only prophet and perfect man but also object of love and worship). 
 Faith in the reality of the Church phylum in which and around which Christ continues to develop, in the world his total personality. 
 
<p>In these seemingly innocuous statements, we find hidden Teilhard’s basic doctrine. Christ’s divinity is activated by the love and worship of humanity and he fulfills His role as the “focus of humanity.” But in Teilhard’s world we have seen that Christ and the focus of the world are in fact Point Omega. The “personalizing” God is the point of convergence: faith in the God of the Omega Point is the only true religion.</p>
<p>Teilhard’s choice of the word phylum in the third article indicates that the “Church” is a biological phenomenon—freed of all infantile supernaturalism it is now nothing more than a biologically living organism made up of all its collective human cells. He has deified evolution; infused it with religious significance and turned it into a dangerous cult masquerading as Christianity. And this “newly-hatched anti-creed has come to be accepted by millions as the true Christianity.” This notwithstanding that even if Point Omega did exist, it could not be proven that it had any connection whatsoever with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>In Teilhard’s hands the narrow Way of the Cross has become the broad road upon which the entire population of the planet is being shepherded. Bereft of an “above,” all of humanity is now trapped on the horizontal path and is being inexorably driven to some future point of which the majority are not even aware let alone understand. What this point truly is and where it will end no one knows for Teilhard’s science hardly stands up to scrutiny and his evolutionary religion is seriously ontologically deficient.</p>
<p>How did he come to be so fanatically driven to attempt this symbiosis of religion and science? In order to cast a little light on this question, the author draws our attention to Teilhard’s’ role as a mystic. Teilhard explains that Cosmic and Christic convergence “made themselves felt in the very core of my being”. However, as he looked around him, he found that he was “the only one to have seen”. Nevertheless, his faith in the collective consciousness of mankind was such that he believed that once this “fusion of love of God and faith in the world” had been ignited in one mind that “sooner or later there will be a chain reaction.” And nothing could stop the Truth being spread through the universal mind and “setting everything ablaze.”</p>
<p>But where did this “Truth” come from? Smith concludes his book with reference to one of Teilhard’s early works, The Spiritual Power of Matter written in 1919 but which he appends to one of his last works, The Heart of Matter. Here, Teilhard gives a dramatized account of a mystical experience. He describes a man walking in the desert being swooped upon by “the Thing” which penetrated his soul. It poured the sap of all living beings into him, renewing all the “enfeebled fibres of his being.” The young man felt the rapture of ceasing to be himself but also the oppression of some superhuman peril. This force was also “equivocal, turbid, the combined essence of all evil and all goodness.”</p>
<p>“The thing” says to the young man, “You called me; here I am.” It goes on to say, “grown weary of abstractions, of attenuations, of the wordiness of social life, you wanted to pit yourself against Reality entire and untamed.” It also tells the young man that he was waiting for him “in order to be made holy” and that “now I am established on you for life or for death…He who has once seen me can never forget me: he must either damn himself with me or save me with himself.”</p>
<p>So, we may well ask what strange being had thus impressed himself on the mind of the young man? And one last personal remark before we rush to judgment. This was written only two years after he had been subjected to the unimaginable horrors of the trenches of the Great War. Who knows what evil the young Jesuit had brought back from this hell on earth? But by the time that he was extolling the virtues of the totalitarian super-state this was an evil that had persuaded its victim that it did not exist.</p>

<p>Today, Brave is launching its Self-Serve Ads Program. These new tools allow brands to set up and run advertising for their products and services within the privacy-preserving Brave Ads and Rewards ecosystem. This is an important next step on our roadmap for Brave and the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token</a> (BAT) to provide effective advertising that protects users’ privacy.</p>
<p>The Brave Ads Self-Serve Program allows brands to set up and run ad campaigns in the Brave Browser and Search ecosystem with minimal assistance from the Brave team. Initially, the Brave Ads Self-Serve Program invites brands to run English-language campaigns in <a>countries currently supported by Brave Ads</a>. We plan to introduce support for additional languages over time.</p>
<p>The program is also an opportunity for brands who are new to Brave to join, and provide feedback and to improve our Brave Ads products.</p>
<p>The Self-Serve Program offers the ability for brands to purchase campaigns to run in the Brave Ads Push Notification ad unit. Over time, the team will be introducing Brave News Ads and Brave Search Ads units to self-serve to be available to directly purchase within the platform.</p>
<p>Advertisers participating in the program will also receive beta access to new self-serve features as we introduce them into the system over time, and will have the opportunity to provide direct feedback and have access to our Brave Ads Product and Brave Research teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave’s direct sales team will continue to sell New Tab Takeovers (formerly named Sponsored Images). These assets will not be available within self-serve given the curated image selection and approval process. However, if program participants express interest in purchasing Sponsored Images, they will be connected with our Sales team to help facilitate that process.</p>
<p>A minimum campaign spend of $1,000 USD per month is required to participate in the self-serve program. Advertisers are required to pre-pay, with either BAT or USD.</p>
<p>Advertisers enrolled in the Brave Ads Self-Serve Program are eligible to receive a 50% discount on their first campaign, <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/10800687258637-How-do-I-buy-crypto-with-Brave-Wallet-">if they purchase their campaign with BAT</a>. Additional campaign discounts for purchasing campaigns with BAT will be available throughout the program.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a>Our current advertising policies</a> will apply to brands in the program; human review will remain a part of the process to ensure the safety of Brave’s users, and preserve the integrity of our brand and product.</p>

 Background 
<p>Brave Ads were first launched in early 2019, available to Brave users who opted-in to <a>Brave Rewards</a>, from Brave’s <a href="https://www.investinblockchain.com/brave-browser-surpasses-5-million/">5.5 million monthly active user</a> base at the time. The concept of advertising with privacy was new to most advertisers (and Brave’s ad platform remains a unique offering still in 2023), so Brave Ads were brought to market as a managed service to help educate and learn with our customers. Brave’s teams of sellers, account managers, operations, finance, and engineering work together to bring in customers and deploy their campaigns into the Brave ecosystem. The managed service approach helps Brave provide white glove service with education on Brave and Brave Ads, while keeping an established onboarding and payment process in place that brands are familiar with.</p>
<p>Brave has since grown significantly, with our user base now at 57 million monthly and 21 million daily active users. The Brave Ads platform and offerings have also grown from one ad unit to <a>four ad units</a> across various Brave products that brands can use to communicate their story and grow their customer base. Brave Search ads are also rolling out and will get access to our 23 million daily queries and over 8 billion annualized queries.</p>
<p>Brave Ads campaigns have also been supported in nearly 200 countries with over 7.5 billion ad confirmation events to date, and there have been over 6,600 campaigns since the inception from over 900 advertisers, from mainstream brands such as Ford, PayPal, Toyota, Mastercard, Intel, Chipotle, Crocs, BMW, Keurig, American Express, Budweiser, Walmart, Amazon, and The Home Depot, as well as from crypto giants like Binance, Coinbase, eToro, Ledger, NEAR, and Solana. The time has come for Brave to bring the Brave Ads Self-Serve Program to market, and grow the ecosystem even further.</p>

 Getting Started 
<p>Brands looking to participate in the program can head over to our Brave Ads <a>Self-Serve Program page</a> to learn more, or to complete and submit the form to join the program’s waitlist. The Brave Ads team will be onboarding groups of advertisers from the waitlist, based on available supply across Brave Ads inventory.</p>
<p>We are excited to enter the next phase of the Brave Ads and Rewards ecosystem with the introduction of the Self-Serve Program, as the Ads platform becomes easily accessible to a broader range of global brands and marketers.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>In this end-of-quarter update, we are delighted to showcase the milestones and accomplishments that have shaped our progress over the past month. Along with our regular monthly progress update, we are also happy to review our performance over Q1 2023 against our freshly-published roadmap.</p><p>As we continue to grow and innovate, we remain grateful for the unwavering support of our thriving community. Let’s take a good look at March 2023!<br></p> Roadmap and Quarterly achievements  Say hi to our new Roadmap! <p></p>Panther Protocol’s first three quarters of 2023.<p>This month, we released our <a href="https://t.co/1e5oSU11CX?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">roadmap for 2023-2024</a>! It outlines all the upcoming milestones for Panther’s v1 deployment. Dive into <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1634108708950097921?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">our recent Twitter thread</a> to see the different components and use cases that we plan to roll out in the journey toward v1. <br></p><p>As Q1 2023 is coming to an end, let’s see how we fared in meeting our quarterly goals for it.<br></p> Q1 2023 <p>As we enter Q2, we are thrilled to announce the successful implementation of some key initiatives that mark a significant milestone in our journey toward decentralization and privacy solutions for institutions and retail users alike.<br></p> New website<br> <p>Firstly, our new website is being coded into existence as you read this. And…<br></p>Ta-da! We’re debuting a new image and style for our revamped site.<p>The new site introduces a style, brand, and messaging change. As Product and compliance design are cemented and brought into life, we’re increasingly confident in the utility Panther can and will have for institutions. This look is meant to reflect it. Accordingly, the contents of the website will reflect a more comprehensive look at our Product’s capabilities and use cases.<br></p><p>As per “a chain-agnostic privacy layer,” we believe this term nicely overcomes one of our most complex branding and marketing challenges to date: explaining Panther in a short sentence. “Chain-agnostic” refers to how you will be able to access Panther’s privacy from many different chains, with no preference towards any L1 or L2, while also being able to move between chains. Meanwhile, “privacy layer” refers to how Panther’s ecosystem benefits from a shared privacy set, allowing users of different chains to privately access DeFi while having the right to opt between privacy and transparency, getting in and out of the privacy layer.<br></p><p>We can’t wait for you to see the rest of the changes we’re introducing!<br></p> Improved documentation<br> A sneak peek into our new documentation structure (but there is more!)<p>In addition to the website revamp, we have also finished updates to Panther’s documentation, marking the beginning of a new era where documentation will be a live process with constant updates and growth.<br></p><p>Our updated documentation is more intuitive and user-friendly, with sections dedicated to stakeholders, retail users, and financial institutions. Furthermore, the new documentation covers essential topics such as Panther’s approach to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and zk-SNARKS. We've also updated critical sections on MASPs, fee structures, DeFi adaptors, and cryptographic primitives.<br></p><p>While some sections are still a work in progress, this approach marks a significant departure from our previous static documentation approach and underscores our commitment to continuous improvement. The documentation itself is experiencing its final review and will be live for you to see it soon!<br></p> $ZKP is being listed in MEXC <p></p>PIP-12 on Snapshot<p>In February, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x742a7667af3d6277d88817c8a3d4ec70006575154d36a4a67bcbe4f5e536d1aa">PIP-12</a> was passed with an approval rating of 98.97%. This proposal involved listing <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/token/about?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/MEXC_Global?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">MEXC Global</a>, a well-known and trusted centralized exchange. In light of this, we initiated the listing process.<br></p><p>The MEXC listing is particularly significant as it will allow Panther users to deposit and withdraw ZKP on Polygon, which complements Panther’s v1 release.<br></p><p>Moreover, the Panther DAO sees the decision to list on MEXC as a strategic move to enhance the Panther ecosystem’s liquidity. <br></p><p>On their side, MEXC Global has commenced voting for the listing of $ZKP as part of its pre-launch listing campaign. This process allows users to stake tokens and cast their votes in support of their preferred project, with the chance to get some tokens airdropped to them. MEXC's goal is to identify and promote high-quality projects to its community, and this listing campaign serves as a crucial filter for achieving that objective. The voting period for $ZKP's listing runs from 2023-04-04 at 12:00 to 2023-04-04 at 21:50 (UTC).<br></p>MEXC’s Community Voting for $ZKP on MEXC’s Kickstarter platform is now live. Governance framework development<br> <p>Finally, as part of Phase 2 of our decentralization phase, we have made solid steps towards formalizing a much-awaited governance framework.<br></p><p>The Panther community has settled on appointing a Council as the last step toward formalizing this framework. The Council will have the core responsibility of vetting which DAO proposals are suitable to move into voting by the Panther community i.e., whether they can be objectively beneficial for the project in the long term.<br></p><p>This discussion is still ongoing on <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s Discourse forum</a>, with the community discussing the onboarding process and metrics. Feel free to join it and participate!<br></p> Technology updates<br>  A busy month as we prepare for v1’s Testnet<br> <p>As our Roadmap shows, Q2 2023 will see the release of Panther’s v1 Testnet, and, as such, many things are developing behind the scenes.<br></p><p>Among these milestones are critical components of smart contracts for fees and rewards on v1, which have already been developed and are pending connection to a Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP). &nbsp;Panther is currently clarifying the parameters for rewarding to crystallize the model before v1's MASP is finished. Contracts are almost finalized, and progress is ongoing in the area of data modeling.<br></p><p>On the KYC/KYT integration front, Panther is currently interacting with other specialists in the DeFi ecosystem to build a comprehensive solution to support compliance attestations and disclosures. We’re getting ready for a significant informational release regarding this component that will be core to Panther disrupting the PriFi scene.<br></p><p>Simultaneously, planning for the v1 dApp continues, with major progress on the UI front. This means that the development of the fully-planned dApp is expected to begin soon.<br></p><p>Panther's DeFi Adaptors design has also been solidified and is ready to become a functional interface. Additional UTXO variable functionalities were added to production too, which we will discuss in greater detail in an upcoming article.<br></p><p>By the way, did you see this <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1639324727364681737?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">alpha drop</a> related to Panther’s cryptography research?<br></p>Panther’s SNARK Research paper will be presented in Istanbul this month. v0.5.2 Upgrades and UI Development<br> <p>A DAO proposal is underway to introduce a community deployment of v0.5.2, an upgrade that features several improvements vital to building v1.<br></p><p>Simultaneously, the Panther community is discussing terms for extending the v0.5 Advanced Staking program.<br></p> Ecosystem<br>  Governance <p>Recently, the community shared a DEX liquidity PIP draft and discussed extending the Advanced Staking program for an additional four months. Keep an eye out for a proposal in the near future!<br></p>Panther’s Discourse Forum‌ ‌<p>Remember to head over to <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">the discussion forum</a> if you want to stay up to date and get involved in the Panther ecosystem's governance.<br></p> zSwap <p>For those interested in learning more about Panther's v1, our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ama-transcript-road-to-v1-w-oliver-gale-saif-akhtar/">AMA transcript</a> provides specific details on the zSwap launch, DeFi integrations, and go-to-market strategy.</p>Road to V1 Ask-Me-Anything<p>If you're curious about how zSwap could potentially address one of the biggest concerns for the future development of the Ethereum and Polygon ecosystems, read this <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1631342447933419520?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Thread🧵</a>.<br></p><p>We have also made the full recording of our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ama-transcript-road-to-v1-w-oliver-gale-saif-akhtar/">Road to v1 Ask-Me-Anything</a> available, complete with subtitles!<br></p><p></p> Media and AMAs<br> <p>Last year, Panther became a proud member of the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/r/5254f285?m=eebf5e16-f447-40b1-a284-b2d55b27ee62">Leading Privacy Alliance</a> to help make privacy-first an industry standard.

<p>Bonjour la France! Nym France officially opens at Paris Blockchain Week.</p><p>Nym has reached a new milestone with the official opening of Nym France during last week’s Paris Blockchain Week.</p><p>Nym has had close ties to France for a while now being an alumni of Station F, noted as the world’s largest startup campus. Nym CEO Harry Halpin was a visiting researcher at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris">INRIA Paris</a> where he led the <a href="https://nextleap.eu/">NEXTLEAP project</a> which laid the foundations for what became&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>Nym France is the first company in France to be set up purely in Bitcoin, without a traditional bank account! This is a revolutionary step which sets the pace for Nym’s ambition in the French tech ecosystem.</p><p>The foundation on the discourse of privacy has been built in French tech through projects like <a href="https://www.ledger.com/fr">Ledger</a> and <a href="https://www.arianee.org/">Arianee</a>. Nym’s vision is to further advance and push privacy firmly to the forefront alongside other French tech&nbsp;giants.</p><p>We had a phenomenal line-up of quality panelists, on Nym’s privacy work, web3 and privacy, entrepreneurship and investing in privacy projects.</p><p>Read on for the&nbsp;TL;DR…</p><p>Introduction to Nym&nbsp;France</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/igq_4MHdMwQ?feature=share&amp;t=1562">Watch the keynote</a>&nbsp;(French)</p><p>Nym COO Alexis Roussel opened with an introduction to the Nym mixnet, work done so far in privacy tech, and our vision for&nbsp;France:</p><p>Nym has a history and links with France, meaning an official set-up is the natural next step following our “graduation” from the Station F program. A strategic regional approach allows us to localise our work stream through language, culture and economy. With our headquarters in Switzerland and an office in London, Paris is ideally located as a key connector.</p><p>In establishing a French entity and therefore being in the E.U, there will be an increase in research and development opportunities, strategic partnership opportunities and access to E.U. research grants. All of these will play a key role in advancing privacy by default across the European digital&nbsp;space.</p><p>There is no Web3 without&nbsp;privacy</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/igq_4MHdMwQ?feature=share&amp;t=2624">Watch the full fireside chat</a> (English)</p><p>The highlight of the evening was a fireside chat between Chelsea Manning, famous whistleblower and Nym’s Security Consultant with Nym CSO Jaya Klara Brekke. Moderating the session was Paris Bureau Chief of Bloomberg, Alan&nbsp;Katz.</p><p>An insightful discussion was held&nbsp;on:</p>  Chelsea’s experience and insights on privacy and surveillance  Ensuring digital technologies serve ordinary people with privacy central to&nbsp;it  The effectiveness of&nbsp;GDPR  AI and cryptography  CBDCs and what it means in terms of surveillance  The data of money and who’s going to control&nbsp;it  Next type of data that may be targeted by governments following Tornado cash and the impact on a broader adoption of&nbsp;privacy  <p>Unlocking the value of&nbsp;privacy</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/igq_4MHdMwQ?feature=share&amp;t=5544">Watch full video</a>&nbsp;(French)</p><p>Next was a stellar entrepreneur panel of high profile French web3 projects. Frédéric Montagnon, Chairman and Co-founder of <a href="https://www.arianee.org/">Arianee</a> and Charles Guillemet, CTO of <a href="https://www.ledger.com/fr">Ledger</a> joined Harry Halpin, CEO of Nym, diving into the state of privacy and role of businesses and the right business models for securing&nbsp;privacy:</p>  Why privacy is important  The rise of a highly digitalised life  Data leaks and manipulation of&nbsp;data  Is privacy really a priority or just pure marketing  Capitalism by Big&nbsp;Tech  Surveillance capitalism in free&nbsp;services  Barriers to entry for small/medium businesses  The role of entrepreneurs today  Balancing three parameters: Collective interests, regulatory and&nbsp;clients  <p>Moderated by Gregory Raymond, Co-founder of <a href="https://en.thebigwhale.io/">The Big Whale</a>, France’s top web3 media outlet, the session drew many questions from the interested audience.</p><p>How can Web3 advance&nbsp;privacy?</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/igq_4MHdMwQ?feature=share&amp;t=7954">Watch full fireside chat</a>&nbsp;(French)</p><p>Nym COO Alexis Roussel and Waffle, BD of <a href="https://www.scrtlabs.com/">Secret Labs</a> explored the technical side of privacy and what tools are available today including that of Nym and Secret. The fireside chat was moderated by the one and only Blue Touff, Founder of <a href="https://reflets.info/">Reflets Info</a>, a French investigative and information hacking online media, discussion points&nbsp;include:</p>  Exploring uses cases for privacy in&nbsp;web3  Regulatory issues  Auditable privacy for the&nbsp;user  Breaking cryptography and the Nym&nbsp;network  The role and weakness of&nbsp;VPNs  Data logging in web&nbsp;browsers  Centralised vs decentralised privacy  Transparency in economic transactions  Digital identities  <p>Growing a secure digital ecosystem</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/igq_4MHdMwQ?feature=share&amp;t=9934">Watch the full panel</a> (English)</p><p>The evening’s discussions ended with a dynamic investors panel on investing in privacy preserving projects and how it ensures a secure digital ecosystem that&nbsp;scales.</p><p>On the panel was Luc Jodet, Partner of <a href="https://www.xange.vc/">XAnge</a>, Lior Messika, Founder &amp; Managing Partner of <a href="https://www.edenblock.com/">Eden Block</a>, Michiel Lescrauwaet, Managing Director of <a href="https://tioga.capital/">Tioga Capital Partners</a>, Pierre Husson,Blockchain/Crypto of <a href="https://www.bpifrance.fr/">Bpifrance</a>. The panel was moderated by Fabrice Epelboin, author of the French version of ReadWriteWeb and professor of information warfare at Science Po&nbsp;Paris.</p><p>The panel&nbsp;covered:</p>  How privacy is a larger opportunity that Web3&nbsp;itself  Balancing sovereignty for individuals and profits in the long&nbsp;term  Privacy as an investment: private (VC) and public investment  Backing missionaries and not mercenaries  Pain points across compliance, industries and&nbsp;sectors  How pre-seed/seed funding comes from Europe and then it scales in the&nbsp;US  New market disruptors  Justification of&nbsp;returns  Why B2B non-crypto cybersecurity funding is&nbsp;growing  <p>La vie&nbsp;privée</p><p>Privacy in French “la vie privée” literally translates to “the private life”. Indeed, our lives are now made up of the physical and digital realm, but all too often our integrity in the digital realm is violated.</p><p>The mission of Nym is to enable everyone’s right to privacy and digital integrity as the default. The launch of Nym France opens up further community growth and partnerships in the Francophone region uniting a movement to make privacy the default&nbsp;online.</p><p>“The way we think of privacy when in the physical realm is often seen as being different from privacy in the digital realm. For instance, it isn’t often very seen as controversial to lock your door or close your blinds. Whereas in the digital realm there’s essentially an entire business structure that’s designed around peeking through the blinds.” Chelsea&nbsp;Manning</p>The Nym team in&nbsp;France Useful links <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p><a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/">Blog</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NymFrance">French Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymfrench">French Telegram</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/privacy-and-the-future-of-french-tech-81cac26e52c1">Privacy and the future of French tech</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Tokenisation is one of the latest web3 trends to emerge. It has taken the world by storm through its relatively simple yet practical use cases in a wide range of industries. In this article, we will explain what it means to tokenise real world assets, the key aspects of tokenising real world assets, the process of tokenising a real world asset, and the benefits and disadvantages of tokenising real world assets.</p>



 Key takeaways  



 
 The tokenisation of real world assets is the process of creating a (fractionalised) digital twin of a physical asset that can be held, bought, and traded on a blockchain. 



 The tokenisation process consists of 3 steps, namely pre-tokenisation step, which refers to all the steps that happen in the real, non-digital, world before the asset is tokenised and put on a chain. The tokenisation step refers to putting all relevant data and data pointers on a blockchain and creating the tokens. And lastly, the post-tokenisation step refers to the distribution of the tokens and the management of the physical asset and tokens. 



 There are 5 key aspects of tokenisation that need to be considered during the process of tokenising and securitising real world assets: technology, secondary markets &amp; liquidity, legal &amp; compliance, custody &amp; settlements, and dispute resolution. 



 The benefits of tokenising real world assets are the fractionalisation of assets, greater liquidity, increased transparency, and lower transaction costs. 



 The disadvantages and possible risks of tokenising real world assets are the fragmentation of ownership, regulatory uncertainty, technical complexity, and counterparty risk. 



 The future of tokenisation is uncertain as there are many challenges ahead before tokenisation can become mainstream but with the right people leading the way tokenisation can become the future of asset management, given the great potential of the tokenisation of real world assets. 
 







<p>Let’s start with what the tokenisation of real world assets actually means!</p>



 What is the tokenisation of real world assets?  



<p>The tokenisation of real world assets refers to the process of creating a (fractionalised) digital twin of a real world asset that can be traded on a blockchain network. The tokenisation process comes with a variety of benefits. Such are the ability to exchange and own the asset in a more secure and transparent manner. But also things like the provenance of the asset, as well as proofs of labor, and more.</p>



<p>The tokenisation of assets also allows them to be divided into smaller parts, making them available to a wider range of investors. Additionally, these assets can easily be traded on global marketplaces increasing their availability to a wide range of investors even further.</p>



<p>Real world asset tokenisation is not limited to certain types of asset classes either. Instead, tokenisation has the potential to benefit a diverse range of asset classes such as tangible assets like real estate, art, precious metals, and luxury goods, as well as intangible assets such as financial instruments, <a href="https://zaisan.io/invoice-financing-tokenisation/">invoices</a>, and carbon credits.</p>



<p>Fractional ownership of properties, for instance, is possible through the tokenisation of real estate, allowing investors to buy and sell small percentages of high-value properties. Similarly, the tokenisation of art can make art investments more accessible to a broader range of investors by allowing them to buy and sell fractions of high-value pieces.</p>



<p>Lastly, tokenisation can potentially solve some of the challenges linked with traditional ownership structures. Tokenisation enables more transparent and efficient ownership structures that can reduce expenses, fraud, and disputes. Smart contracts can also automate many of the processes associated with asset ownership, including transfers, payments, and maintenance.</p>



 How the tokenisation of real world assets works 



<p>Now it’s clear what the tokenisation of real world assets actually means. Let’s take a look at what the process of tokenising a real world asset looks like.<br>In short, the process can be described in 3 main steps, namely the pre-tokenisation, tokenisation, and post-tokenisation steps. Let’s explain this further!</p>



 Pre-tokenisation 



<p>Pre-tokenisation refers to all the steps that happen in the real, non-digital, world before the asset is tokenised and put on a chain. The main parts of this step depend on the type of asset that is being tokenised. It can generally be divided into formalising the value of the asset, verifying ownership of the asset, and ensuring the right processes are in place in order to take care of the maintenance and management of the physical asset, as well as legal processes in case of liquidations, dispute resolutions, and enforcement.</p>



 Tokenisation 



<p>Once the pre-tokenisation step has been completed. It is time to make a digital representation of the asset in the form of tokens. The main part of this step is making sure all relevant information about the asset is either put on a blockchain or pointed to from the blockchain and then creating the tokens of the real world asset.</p>



<p>The connection between relevant data in traditional databases and data on the blockchain is facilitated through the use of (decentralised) oracles in order to ensure all relevant information is accurately represented on the blockchain. These oracles collect data from traditional databases and broadcast it to the blockchain. Furthermore, decentralised oracles do the same but do this collectively in order to reach a consensus on the accuracy and validity of the data being broadcasted to the blockchain.</p>



 Post-tokenisation 



<p>After the previous steps have been completed and the tokenised asset has been created, it’s time to start distributing/selling the tokenised assets. This is typically done through marketplaces or offerings specialised in these kinds of assets. Part of this step is also the perpetual management of both the physical asset and the tokens based on the rules previously set. For something like an art piece this could include the storage of the piece, maintenance of the piece, insurance of the piece, etc., as well as the management of the tokens, including the management of the information about the token.</p>



 Key aspects of the tokenisation of real world assets  



<p>During the tokenisation process the value chain with its stakeholders remains central. Here are 5 key aspects of tokenisation that need to be considered during the process of tokenising and securitising real world assets which all play a role in the success of the whole process. They can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Technology  



 Secondary markets &amp; Liquidity  



 Legal &amp; Compliance  



 Custody &amp; Settlement  



 Dispute resolution  
 



<p>Let’s take a look at each of these aspects!</p>



 1. Technology 



<p>One of the first and foremost aspects of the tokenisation process is the technology aspect. This refers to all the technical questions such as which blockchain will be used, what data standards will be used, if the tokens will be fungible or non-fungible, and more.</p>



<p>The type of blockchain that is best suited for tokenising an asset usually depends on the goals one has in mind when tokenising an asset. Different blockchains have different data standards suited for specific purposes and different marketplaces which facilitate the trading of tokens of real world assets. Additionally, the costs of deploying a tokenised asset on a certain blockchain is of importance. Another key component is smart contract support and the preferred programming language of the smart contracts. And lastly, specific communities on a blockchain can also influence if a tokenised asset is likely to succeed in a certain ecosystem.</p>



<p>All of these considerations combined, along with the decision to go for a certain data standard which determines whether you will end up with a fungible or non-fungible token can be a key determining factor of the success of the tokenised asset.</p>



 2. Secondary markets &amp; Liquidity  



<p>The second aspect to consider during the tokenisation process is the availability of secondary markets and liquidity. This is usually closely related to the choice of blockchain, as most marketplaces tend to support tokens or assets from a single blockchain. Although this is likely to change with a multi-chain future around the corner.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the availability of trusted and proven marketplaces and a community to facilitate the liquidity of the tokens is essential for the success of a tokenised asset.</p>



 3. Legal &amp; Compliance  



<p>The third aspect to consider in the tokenisation process is the regulatory and legal side of things which is relevant at all stages of the process, especially for assets that are deemed to be securities or require other regulatory oversight.</p>



<p>The first part of this is regulatory compliance. Tokenising physical assets usually involves regulatory requirements depending on the jurisdiction in which the asset is located. For example, in the United States, securities laws may apply if the tokens represent ownership in the asset and are sold to investors. Compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations are usually also required either when selling the tokens or when registering on a token marketplace.</p>



<p>The process of issuing tokens should also be carried out in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This includes ensuring that the tokens are not being sold as unregistered securities. And lastly, there may be tax implications when tokenising a real world asset.</p>



 4. Custody &amp; Settlements  



<p>The fourth aspect to consider in the tokenisation process are any custody and settlement requirements. The tokenisation process basically just creates a digital twin of the asset, but for the asset to actually be tokenised various things ought to be considered. For example, it should be ensured that the ownership of the real world asset is actually in the hands of the token holders. And that the party that tokenises the real world asset holds the deeds and titles to prove the ownership of the asset at the time of tokenisation.</p>



<p>But this is of course not the only relevant point related to this aspect of the tokenisation process. Other things like the management of the physical asset needs to be carefully outlined. This refers to things like loans that need to be repaid before an asset can be released, measurements to prevent (and insure against) things like theft, loss, or damage also need to be agreed upon and be put in place, or arrangements regarding the movement, renovation, etc. of an asset.</p>



<p>These aforementioned considerations mostly refer to the management of the physical asset. But for the tokens, there are also various considerations depending on the jurisdiction. There may be restrictions on the transfer of tokens representing ownership of physical assets. For example, in some cases, the transfer of ownership may require the involvement of a licensed broker or agent.</p>



 5. Dispute resolution 



<p>The fifth and final aspect of the tokenisation process is dispute resolution. Even with all arrangements and precautions in place there will always be times where there are misunderstandings and disputes. So how does this work with tokenised real world assets?</p>



<p>When it comes to dispute resolution in the context of tokenised physical assets, the process can vary. This depends on the specific platform or protocol being used to facilitate the tokenisation. In most cases, the smart contract of the tokenised asset outlines the exact rules and agreements related to the token (and real world asset), as well as the process for dispute resolution.</p>



<p>However, another approach is to rely on established legal systems and frameworks to resolve disputes. For example, if a dispute arises between parties involved in a tokenised real estate transaction, traditional real estate laws, and courts could be used to resolve the dispute.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that tokenisation of physical assets is a relatively new technology. There may be some legal grey areas and uncertainties when it comes to dispute resolution. As a result, it’s important for parties involved in tokenised physical asset transactions to seek legal advice and carefully consider the terms and conditions of any smart contracts or agreements before entering into a transaction.</p>



 Benefits of tokenisation of real world assets  



<p>But what exactly are the benefits of tokenising real world assets? Some of these advantages can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Fractionalisation  



 Greater liquidity  



 Increased transparency  



 Lower transaction costs  
 



 1. Fractionalisation 



<p>Tokenisation allows assets to be divided into smaller portions which means that investors can buy and sell fractions of an asset, rather than having to buy the whole asset. For example, instead of buying an entire real estate property, investors can purchase a percentage of ownership in the property. This opens up investment opportunities to a wider range of investors, including those who may not have enough capital to buy an entire asset.</p>



<p>Another benefit of the fractionalisation is that it allows for more flexible ownership structures which can be better tailored to the investors, in turn increasing the appeal of the investment.</p>



<p>Lastly, the fractionalisation of assets can also be beneficial for community building, in the case of valuable art for example. Instead of having a single owner, it becomes a community-owned asset which can increase both the appeal and value of a physical asset. Who wouldn’t want to own part of the Mona Lisa?</p>



 2. Greater liquidity  



<p>Tokenisation makes assets more accessible and tradable on a blockchain, which can increase liquidity. In traditional markets, it can be difficult to find buyers and sellers for certain assets. However, by tokenising an asset and trading it on a blockchain, investors can quickly and easily buy and sell the tokens without needing to go through intermediaries. This can increase the speed and efficiency of transactions, making it easier for investors to enter and exit the market. And unlike traditional asset purchases transactions are instantaneous and seamless.</p>



<p>Furthermore, given that the asset is split up into smaller portions (represented by tokens) the asset becomes an investment opportunity to a wider range of investors, increasing liquidity even further.</p>



<p>It is important to note though that this is not the case for every type of asset depending on the jurisdiction in which the physical asset resides. Token transactions may still be subject to rules and regulations which can make the buying or transfer process equally inefficient as the regular process, and possibly even more cumbersome in some cases.</p>



 3. Increased transparency  



<p>Tokenisation can make it easier to track ownership and movement of assets, as all transactions are recorded on a blockchain. This increases transparency and reduces the risk of fraudulent activity, as ownership of the asset is easily verifiable. Additionally, since all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, it is easier to audit the history of the asset (and tokens). Thus, this can be important for compliance and regulatory purposes.</p>



<p>This can also be beneficial for tracking the provenance of certain assets, as the digital twin can contain the full history of the physical asset.</p>



 4. Lower transaction costs  



<p>Generally speaking, tokenisation can reduce the costs associated with buying, selling, and managing assets. By removing the need for intermediaries like brokers and custodians, tokenisation can significantly reduce transaction fees. Additionally, tokenisation has the potential to make it easier to manage assets. All ownership and transaction data is stored on the blockchain, reducing administrative and legal costs associated with traditional asset management.</p>



<p>It is important to mention however that the tokenisation process can also increase costs if the stakeholders want greater trust and transparency before, during, and after the tokenisation process.</p>



 Disadvantages of tokenisation of real world assets 



<p>As with any novel technology, there are never only advantages. Some of the disadvantages and possible risks of tokenising real world assets can be summed up as follows:</p>



 
 Fragmentation  



 Regulatory uncertainty  



 Technical complexity  



 Counterparty risk  
 



 1. Fragmentation 



<p>While fractionalisation can be seen as a benefit, it can also lead to the fragmentation of ownership. The more diversified the ownership of an asset becomes, the more difficult it will be to reach consensus on decisions related to the asset which can possibly lead to conflicts between token holders, which consecutively could impact the value of the asset.</p>



 2. Regulatory uncertainty  



<p>As the use of tokenisation is relatively nascent, there is still regulatory uncertainty surrounding it. This can create challenges for both investors and issuers alike, as they may be unsure about how to comply with regulations, and which regulations apply to tokenisation exactly.</p>



<p>Furthermore, new regulations surrounding tokenisation could also pose new threats and hurdles to the overall tokenisation process.</p>



 3. Technical complexity  



<p>Tokenisation requires technical knowledge to implement. It can prove to be a barrier for everyday asset owners looking to tokenise their assets. But a steep learning curve is not the only possible barrier. A lack of understanding of all the aspects of the technological side can lead to poorly designed and written smart contracts. In turn, this opens the door to hackers and cyberattacks.</p>



<p>Furthermore, given the technical complexity of using this kind of technology token holders of lower technical proficiency may be more susceptible to falling for new forms of scams and hacks.</p>



 4. Counterparty risk 



<p>While tokenisation can reduce the need for intermediaries, it can also create new forms of counterparty risk. As is the case with any type of marketplace or exchange, if the tokens are held on that marketplace or exchange, you do not control the funds yourself. If one of these exchanges goes bankrupt or gets hacked, it can become difficult to recover the investments on that marketplace or exchange.</p>



<p>While this can of course be mitigated by taking the tokens out of the platform, history has shown that many people still prefer the convenience of keeping their tokens on an exchange, despite the possible risks. Furthermore, if organisations want to manage their tokenised assets themselves they might require specific roles and functions to manage the relevant wallets which hold the tokens.</p>



 Fractional ownership: the future?  



<p>The tokenisation of real world assets has clear benefits and opens up many new opportunities. However, on the flip side, there are also many challenges ahead. As with any nascent technology, it remains to be seen whether tokenisation will become the norm for ownership of various types of real world assets or just a small technological sidestep with little impact.</p>



<p>For tokenisation to become the norm, pioneers will need to pave the way for others. There will need to be major developments in terms of technology, marketplaces, regulations, and more before tokenisation can become mainstream. Nonetheless, with the clear benefits in mind and the constantly growing interest in web3 technologies , the future seems bright for tokenisation.</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, data storage is a crucial component for all applications, regardless of their scope or complexity. While traditional Web2 offers a wealth of storage options tailored to various use cases, such as SQL, NoSQL, Filestorage, S3, and FTP, the transition to Web3 demands a similar expansion of storage infrastructure to accommodate its unique requirements.</p><p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> has emerged as the de-facto standard for storing data in Web3, with its decentralized file storage protocol being ideal for images, videos, and static content. However, IPFS was never designed to handle personal data, and thus, a more suitable solution is necessary.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/data-storage">Verida DbStore</a>, the first “self-sovereign” database infrastructure for Web3, which promises to revolutionize how data is managed by offering users guaranteed ownership, the speed and performance of traditional databases, and the ability to permanently delete their data. As a new decentralized infrastructure and architecture, Verida DbStore is specifically designed for rapid access to highly changing, structured personal data with encryption as a fundamental aspect of the protocol.</p><p>Let’s delve into the intricacies of IPFS and Verida DbStore, comparing their architecture, security, performance, storage types, and suitability for handling personally identifiable information (PII).</p>At a glance: IPFS vs Verida&nbsp;DbStore Architecture <p>IPFS consists of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of block storage nodes, where each node is responsible for data identified by its unique hash. Users can retrieve data from any node, which collaborates with other nodes to locate and return the requested information.</p>IPFS consists of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of block storage&nbsp;nodes<p>On the other hand, Verida is a P2P network of database storage nodes, each responsible for a user-specific queryable database. Data on the network is identified by the owner and database name. To retrieve data, users look up the database storage nodes associated with a user and request the data from one or more nodes. Data is replicated across multiple nodes based on geographical and user preferences.</p>With Verida, a user can use their private key to sign, encrypt and access their&nbsp;data Type of&nbsp;storage <p>IPFS stores unstructured blobs of data such as images, videos or&nbsp;PDFs.</p><p>Verida stores structured data in a document database that can be queried, indexed and replicated.</p> Security <p>IPFS lacks native authentication or encryption, making all stored data publicly accessible without permissions or security restrictions, akin to a globally distributed hard drive with universal read&nbsp;access.</p><p>In contrast, Verida incorporates end-to-end encryption as a fundamental aspect of its protocol. All data requires authorization for access and a decryption key, ensuring security on par with traditional database infrastructure. Verida also offers flexible permission configuration for each user database, allowing control over read, write, update, and delete permissions.</p> Performance <p>IPFS, inspired by torrenting technology, uses distributed hash tables to find content across nodes. While this allows for fast read responses when data is cached locally, it leads to significant latency in discovering new data, resulting in unpredictable and slow response times. This latency issue makes IPFS unsuitable for dynamically changing data without additional protocols.</p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ipfs-measurements/">Real world data from Cloudflare showing an average response time of 44.4 seconds for newly created content on&nbsp;IPFS.</a><p>In contrast, Verida is designed for sub-second reads and writes. Although there’s some initial overhead in discovering a user’s database, once connected, data transfer occurs via a P2P socket connection. This makes Verida ideal for applications requiring “web2-like” performance, where interactions are primarily “app-to-user” or “user-to-user.”</p> Suitable for&nbsp;PII <p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes sensitive data like health records, names, addresses, and financial records that are legally protected in most countries. Regulations dictate the storage, transfer, and user rights concerning PII.</p><p>IPFS, a globally decentralized network, is unsuitable for storing PII because it offers no control over data storage or replication, nor guarantees data deletion, which is necessary for compliance with the “right to be forgotten” in many jurisdictions.</p><p>Verida DbStore, also a globally decentralized network, allows users to control where their data is stored. By default, the <a href="https://www.verida.io/">Verida Wallet </a>selects <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/infrastructure/storage-node">storage nodes</a> in the user’s country or region, ensuring regulatory compliance. Users can change these nodes or host their own for greater self-sovereignty. They can also delete their data from storage nodes, delete their identity and data entirely, and exercise their “right to be forgotten.” Verida combines the advantages of decentralization with regulatory compliance.</p>The <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk">Verida Client SDK</a> is designed to empower user’s to control where their data is&nbsp;stored. IPFS as a base&nbsp;layer <p>Numerous projects are developing decentralized database infrastructure for Web3 using IPFS, including Textile, Ceramic, and Web5. At first glance, this approach may appear logical, as IPFS serves as the filesystem for Web3 and could potentially be transformed into a queryable database. However, this strategy proves to be impractical.</p><p>This approach is similar to constructing a permissioned, encrypted MySQL on a public S3 bucket. This would be slow and vulnerable to security threats, making it an undesirable option. While some projects incorporate an encryption layer over IPFS, the eventual breaking of current encryption would leave the data exposed, as it is both public and permanently accessible. In contrast, Verida safeguards encrypted data through authentication and authorization layers, adhering to industry best practices for protecting sensitive information.</p><p>To address these issues, some projects introduce additional server-side infrastructure on top of IPFS, forming new “storage networks.” However, if extra infrastructure is necessary, it would be more efficient to build on a foundation designed as a database from the outset, rather than relying on an ill-suited base technology like&nbsp;IPFS.</p><p>It is essential to note that IPFS is suitable for various use cases, such as storing immutable public records, NFT images or videos, or whitepaper PDFs. However, it is not an ideal choice for personal data storage, which necessitates a more fitting alternative.</p> Verida’s approach <p>At Verida, we’ve adopted a groundbreaking approach by creating nodes that are not based on IPFS, but rather on well-established database technology that supports authorization, permissions, and decentralized identity standards. This innovative strategy combines the best of both worlds: the reliability of battle-tested, industry-leading database technology and seamless integration with emerging decentralized identity standards through our provided <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk">SDKs</a> and server components.</p><p>In a world where users can own their personal data, it’s critical to provide a mechanism to share encrypted data with third parties. The Verida protocol leverages encrypted data replication which is facilitated by peer-to-peer database synchronization at the protocol&nbsp;level.</p><p>This standards based architecture allows for the addition of various storage engines, making Verida DbStore the first of many decentralized storage solutions expected to emerge over the next decade. This forward-thinking infrastructure ensures that we stay ahead in the evolution of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>We invite you to explore Verida DbStore through the <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/databases">interactive tutorial</a> in our <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">developer documentation</a> and join us on our mission to empower users with self-sovereign identity and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Together, we can shape the future of Web3 and unlock its full potential.</p> Want to learn&nbsp;more?

<p></p><p>Communities play an important role in any blockchain and crypto projects. Community members became project ambassadors and were the first to spread the word about these new revolutionary technologies. In this article, see how Horizen leverages its community thanks to its ambassador program.</p>



 Blockchain and crypto projects rely on their communities.&nbsp; 



<p>It is due to the precursory character of these technologies. They are too avant-garde for the mainstream media and too complicated for the general public. It took communities to be able to take an interest in emerging projects and to promote them more widely.</p>



<p>Take bitcoin, for example. One of its strengths is drawn from its original community, the cypherpunks. These are the best cryptographers in the world who helped the bitcoin technology emerge and have given it credit, as well as shedding light on revolutionary technology.</p>



 What is a (crypto) community? 



<p>Suppose we have a look at the definition of community. In that case, we find:</p>



 
 a unified body of individuals: such as the people with common interests living in a particular area 



 &nbsp;a group of people with a common characteristic or interest living together within a larger society 



 a body of persons of common and especially professional interests scattered through a larger society 
 



<p>(source: <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community</a>)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto communities were born with people with shared crypto and freedom interests, living on the internet. They are linked by a shared policy (e.g., decentralization, banking freedom, currency sovereignty) but are still part of a larger society. Everybody can join the ownership by owning cryptos! And that’s the beautiful thing about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we know that the emergence of crypto and blockchain technologies is due to their communities, how do we use this strength by being a blockchain project?</p>



<p>The answer is with Horizen and its Zenvangelists!</p>



 The Horizen Ambassador Program 



<p>The Zenvangelists are active members form the Horizen community who are dedicated to contributing to and growing with Horizen. </p>



<p>&nbsp;Zenvangelists are web3 believers from all walks of life who are passionate about Horizen. Anybody can become a Zenvangelist, as long as they are:</p>



 
 A part of the Horizen community. 



 Interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general 



 Always willing to help other members of the community 



 Eager to contribute to the growth of the Horizen community  



 Want to be committed to continuous learning and education 



 Be a self-starter (autonomous, self-taught, in short: passionate) 
 



<p>How do we empower our Zenvangelists?</p>



 
 We are always available for guidance and support 
 



 
 We hold monthly meetings where they can discuss community matters and share ideas with the Horizen team and leadership 



 Zenvangelists have exclusive early access to new Horizen product and service releases before the public 



 We help Zenvangelists grow their personal network and reach, improve their skill sets, and provide event opportunities to represent Horizen.   



 We reward Zenvangelists for their effort in many ways, including swagkit, ZEN rewards, free event participations etc.

															Why Horizen?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;In short, I chose Horizen because of its strong community, its innovative vision, and its potential to make a real difference in the world.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;Mainly because of the privacy focus, constant development, and great potential. The innovating sidechains were giving new tools to developers, with $ZEN powering the future of DeFi, Play2Earn games, DApps, Web3, and NFT projects</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;What first garnered my interest in crypto, as many like to joke about being “in it for the tech” was truly my growing interest in GPU mining. I’d tried to mine Ethereum at the time and had been failing with graphics drivers and related issues, so I found that ZEC was comparably profitable at the time and was easy to set up and get going.</p>
<p>When I found that Horizen would have the same algorithm and supply of coins, I saw opportunity at being an early supporter. The passion of the team at an early stage and to this day has always been something that stands out to me.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;Horizen looked like a big project and has since grown even bigger. There are 3 companies, a doxxed team, a news website, a blog, the academy, an open GitHub, the Horizen Early Adopter’s Program, and the HDE (Horizen Developer Environment). There are tools for the community: Discord, Twitter accounts, and Telegram channels … It even has a meme coin^^</p>
<p>There was a lot of work to build the Zendoo protocol, and since it was released, a new era has started, with Tokenmint and EON. I hope many sidechains will be added to the ecosystem in the coming months/years.</p>
<p>Paragism:&nbsp;The strong ethos of privacy attracted me initially. I also found Horizen very dedicated to bringing new innovations with its research-driven culture and strives to push technological boundaries. This blockchain project keeps delivering back-to-back developments with continuous R&amp;D regarding various vital parameters to achieve high scalability and extendibility.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;The project has a clear vision, excellent leadership, a capable team, unique technology, and major industry partners. Horizen ticks all the boxes, and with Horizen EON launching, we will soon see Horizen carve out its market fit.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;At the end of 2017, while preparing for my own business, I wanted to learn more about the blockchain area. At that time, I found the ZenCash homepage and sent a direct email to send a proposal saying that I would like to work while learning.</p>
<p>We also asked for consent by presenting an article on zencash’s forum, which is now unused.</p>
<p>At the same time, I conducted various communication, such as sharing many conversations and Korean market research.</p>
<p>Based on that, I joined the current Horizen, and I strongly agree with the direction we are heading now, the role as a platform, and the cultivation of an ecosystem that focuses on practically necessary privacy such as Data-Privacy.</p>
<p>I first announced the launch of Horizen Korea at ZenCon0, and since then I have made preliminary contact with many partners for Horizen Korea in Korea.</p>
<p>Now that we are almost ready to announce the business outline and official launch, we will soon be able to meet Horizen Korea, which is taking on various challenges as much as the Korean community members expect of Horizen.</p>
<p>Guan:&nbsp;Because the project has a sustainable funding model and cool graphic designs. Horizen is an inclusive ecosystem where everyone is rewarded for their contributions.</p>

															For how long have you been in the Horizen community? Share your journey in crypto communities?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;I’ve been actively involved in the crypto ecosystem since 2019, and I’ve been passionate about the potential of blockchain technology to transform the way we live and work. Since then, I’ve been exploring different projects and communities in the space, and I was excited to join the Horizen team in late 2021.</p>
<p>As someone who has always been interested in the intersection of technology and finance, I was drawn to Horizen’s vision of a decentralized, privacy-focused ecosystem that empowers individuals to control their assets and data. I’ve been impressed by the team’s commitment to innovation and dedication to building a community-driven platform that can make a difference in people’s lives.</p>
<p>As a tracker of daily task submissions, I’ve had the opportunity to engage with Horizen users daily and see firsthand their enthusiasm and passion for the project. I’m honored to be part of such a vibrant and dynamic community, and I’m excited to see what the future holds for Horizen and the wider crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;I joined the Zenvangelists in May 2021. I was expanding my reach into the Cryptoverse and was happy I could join the community. I was enhancing my blockchain knowledge, and Horizen was one of the chains that impressed me.</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;I’ve been involved with Horizen since early 2017 very near the launch of the project when I first heard about it being supported on the first ever exchange for Horizen, Bittrex, which happened to be the first alt-coin exchange I had used in my crypto journey.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;I don’t remember when I first heard about Bitcoin, but at the time, I thought it was cooler to search for Alien life running SETI or help research with Folding@home than to mine cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>I saw all this crash in 2018 and thought the ecosystem had turned to silly speculation.</p>
<p>But, after a while, during the bear market, I started looking into the ecosystem again and saw great people building interesting projects. I bought some cryptos and read a lot of whitepapers.</p>
<p>I started a website. The first tutorials I wrote were about Bitgreen and Zelcash (now Flux) configuration.</p>
<p>In 2020, I started looking into masternodes and Horizen was one of my first ones. A Secure Node was cheap, and the APY was very good before the halving.</p>
<p>I started to dig deeper into Horizen with the public release of Zendoo on the testnet, tested it on a VPS, completed some HDE tasks, and therefore wrote some articles.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;Horizen was one of the first coins I bought when I started my crypto journey in 2017. I wasn’t active in the community then, but I used to lurk on Telegram. I was always impressed by how accessible the team was, and Rob was always in the chat, answering questions and engaging with the community.&nbsp; His passion was infectious. During the 2018/19 bear market, I became more involved in the community. I tried to help where I could, such as live streaming the weekly team meetings, amplifying Horizen news through HorizenClips, and doing some end-of-year and zendoo launch community Livestream events.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;I learned about Bitcoin from the end of 2015 and started mining with my computer at home. I didn’t get as much volume as the current Bitcoin whales, but I started to pay more attention to the technology called blockchain rather than profit.</p>
<p>Technically, it came out earlier, but the technology that was almost dead came back to the world through an example of Bitcoin, and since then, as new technologies such as Ethereum’s smart contracts have been introduced, the blockchain industry has begun to draw attention.</p>
<p>These days, diversity that can be utilized within the blockchain industry, such as NFT, is possible, but in the past, there were many people who took a business approach with a conceptual nature as a simple payment method. In it, I was obsessed with the thought of whether it would be right for someone to look into my wallet address, even though it is a wallet address made up of addresses that are very long and difficult for people to memorize.</p>
<p>From this point of view, even in terms of a simple payment method, we can see the importance of privacy.</p>

															Do you have something to say to those who want to join the Zenvangelist program or any crypto community?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;For those interested in joining the Zenvangelist program or any other crypto community, I would say: go for it! Being part of a community is a great way to learn, grow, and contribute to a larger cause. It’s an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals, share your knowledge and experience, and make a difference.</p>
<p>My advice would be to start by getting involved in the community in whatever way feels most comfortable to you. This could mean joining a Discord group, participating in social media discussions, attending meetups or events, or contributing to open-source projects. Whatever you choose, be sure to stay engaged, be respectful, and be open-minded. Everyone in the community is there to learn and grow; working together can achieve great things.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t be afraid to take on leadership roles and responsibilities within the community. Whether becoming a Zenvangelist, organizing an event, or contributing to a project, stepping up and taking action is the best way to make a real impact and show dedication to the cause. So, if you’re passionate about crypto and blockchain, I encourage you to get involved and join a community today.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;The Zenvangelist Program, like the majority of crypto communities, empowers the users. You bring your skills, work with others, and learn. Being part of a strong, vibrant, and fun community will bring more knowledge than many courses.</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;For any community members whether new or old my greatest advice to give would be to never underestimate the impact you may have on the communities and projects you are involved in, and in many cases opportunities will arise and those passionate community members certainly stand out of the crowd (and if not make sure you let yourself be heard in a constructive manner) a little effort goes a long way when we all work together to build something greater than one team or project can build alone.</p>
<p>Paragism:&nbsp;Horizen community is rich in resources. It will enable you to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual growth of the ecosystem. The sense of togetherness is profound and enjoyable here.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;Joining a crypto community is still the best way to learn about the ecosystem and a project.</p>
<p>The more you speak with people, meet others, and share what you know, the more your knowledge and comprehension grow. That’s a win-win. You become better and help others understand our ecosystem.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;I say jump in! The Zenvangelist program is great because you can tailor it to suit your own unique talents! It is also a great way for you to get to know the team and community better, and it can help open lots of doors if you are pursuing a career in crypto.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;Sure! In the Korean community, there are many valuable members who play many roles. For example, AstarZen is directly producing PFP NFTs for node operators in our Korean community. Needless to say, Ken is also the spiritual pillar of our Korean community.</p>
<p>Guan:&nbsp;We are an honest and lovely community with many interesting and smart people! Come on and join us, You won’t regret it!</p>

															How does it feel to be named Legend Zenvangelist?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor: Being recognized as a Legend Zenvangelist within the Horizen community is amazing. Being acknowledged for my contributions and dedication is an honor.</p>
<p>I believe it helps promote the project, impart my wisdom and experience, and assist in adopting and engaging new users.</p>
<p>However, having the title of Legend Zenvangelist carries more obligations than just a title. It entails continuing to be involved and active in the community, sharing my knowledge and suggestions, and assisting in determining the project’s direction. It entails setting an example for others and motivating them to get involved and change the world.</p>
<p>Overall, being recognized as a Legend Zenvangelist is humbling, and it inspires me to keep putting in the effort and helping the Horizen community. I’m happy to be a part of this thriving ecosystem and eager to see what we can accomplish together.</p>
<p>PVM: I feel proud to be named a Legend Zenvangelist but still humble. It’s a title that makes me feel appreciated and the reason to keep working as hard as I did until now. Now I have to lead by example and maintain high standards</p>
<p>DeFi: It’s an honor to be recognized as Legend Zenvagelist, and my pleasure to see where the Horizen Ecosystem has come from, to where it is now, and being a part of where it is going. I truly believe the greater market is largely unaware of the constant building going on throughout the years and could be near the precipice of true recognition as a DeFi, Smart Contract platform – being secured by the largest node network and hybrid Proof of Work network structure under the hood.</p>
<p>Paragism: It is a matter of pride. Horizen community has empowered me to bring positive changes. I am grateful that my involvement and work have been recognised.</p>
<p>Xavier: That’s a funny bonus, but honestly, being called a legend wasn’t part of the plan when I joined the Zenvangeslists^^</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp; I feel a little undeserving because I have been pretty quiet in the community lately as I have been busy launching a new business in Seoul. But Horizen is definitely my favourite project!</p>
<p>Jonghun: I am delighted to hear that I have been selected among the valued Zenvangelists for more diverse endeavors. I am happy that I will work harder in the future with Horizen Korea as my new starting point, but I accept it with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Guan: I feel so honored to be a Legend Zenvangelist, spreading Horizen is a significant thing in such a very early stage!&nbsp; I also meet a lot of super cool ZEN-frens from all over the world. It’s a fantastic journey in my life!</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Mahnoor, thank you so much for being here every day for the community. You were even here during your maternity leave to help the fellowship. Where do you find this constant energy to be present in the community?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I believe that the crypto and blockchain space has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about money, data, and identity, and I’m committed to doing my part to help bring about that change. Whether it’s through tracking daily task submissions, answering questions in Discord groups, or participating in social media discussions, I always try to be available and responsive to community members.</p>
<p>Of course, there are times when it can be challenging to balance community involvement with other responsibilities, such as family or work. But ultimately, I believe that being present for the community is an important part of my role, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute in any way I can.</p>
<p>Overall, my energy and enthusiasm for the Horizen community comes from my belief in its potential and my passion for the work that we’re doing. I’m honored to be a part of this dynamic and innovative ecosystem, and I look forward to continuing to contribute in any way I can.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: PVM, you are our event Zenvangelist and an excellent writer. So tell us, what is the best: hosting or participating in the party?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: Hosting parties and events is fun, and taking part is even better. My friends tell me to make “PVM Entertainment and Leisure” a real thing, as the events I create are always top of the crop!</p>
<p>This is what I love to do … to create events that suit every crypto user, from NFT lovers to Crypt edges. I constantly think about new party activities and themes and ways to reward the participants with memories and good vibes”</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: DeFi, you are the new Horizen community voice. You have great skills in hosting and green screen management. What came first, the desire to play with editing software or to talk about the Horizen project entertainingly?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: AI would say my desire in content, editing, and feeling though I have an above average understanding of many concepts that others may benefit from all to tie in together, but to answer which came first, it was the tinkering around while bringing some creativity to the mix – I’d been doing so since the Windows XP era on Windows Movie Maker… Although the quality and effort was poor at best, I always try to make incremental improvements over time (even if it means two steps forwards, one step back at times).</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Paragism, what is different in the Horizen community?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: The Horizen community gives a sense of belonging. All ideas are welcomed and we get to see plenty of expressions. The community members also get to learn new things and hone their skills.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Xavier, you are the always-willing-to-try-tech-things-guy among the Zenvangelists. You make great tutorials and create love, hug, and cakes in our tokenization platform and EVM. Where does this genuine willingness to share come from?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I love tech. I love to learn new technologies. I started coding at 7 and never stopped learning different flavors of basic (Turbo) pascal, c, c++, java, SQL, HTML, javascript, php, tcl, … and systems administration.</p>
<p>I’ve been sharing my knowledge since 98, I think. It was one of my end of studies projects to write a website generator in java (v1.0.2) and use it to generate a website. The website was called Alaide (that means“help needed” in French). It was a collection of tutorials about HTML 3.2, CGI programming, and java.</p>
<p>I then wrote articles for the French Linux magazine for several years, mainly about Linux development.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time browsing the apache forums and community websites like “léa Linux” or “le site du zéro.”</p>
<p>Nowadays, I work as a freelance sysadmin and developer and help my customers understand and face their tech problems. I’m still writing tutorials, helping people on Twitter and Discord, testing things, and helping people in their crypto journey.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Jonghun, you’re more than the Korean community backbone; you made it to the Horizen team! What made you stay at Horizen through the years?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I have had various experiences within the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>I helped launch a global exchange in Korea and played the role of COO, and I am advising on various projects.</p>
<p>Unlike many projects, Horizen always develops by clarifying the vision set in the beginning, responding to the market, and knowing how to adapt.</p>
<p>From a currency with a simple privacy function, now as a platform, we are expanding the ecosystem for various projects. Of course, we are preparing to support the use of the Privacy function where it is actually needed, rather than abandoning it.</p>
<p>In the Korean community, not only me but Ken and so many people are moving together.</p>
<p>Maybe not just community members, but each of them speaks a lot about Horizen’s development direction in a really logical and passionate way.</p>
<p>There was also strong support from the community about removing the shield pool from the main chain this time. When voting on this, members of the Korean community debated day and night.</p>
<p>In addition to my vision for Horizen, Horizen, with such a passionate community, will keep everyone in the future.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Guan, You are an OG who did much for the Horizen community. What made you stay through the years?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: The team always knows how to push things forward. the project’s core cross-chain protocol Zendoo solves scalability that can massively help many web2 businesses into web3.</p>

<p>Horizen inspired artwork from Zenvangelist <a href="https://twitter.com/S1DARTA0">Sidarta0</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>“I love the sleeping astronaut. A lot. But also <a href="https://sidarta.in/product/topsy-turvy-drawing/">Topsy Turvy</a>, one of the first artworks that got people from Horizen further interested in letting me have art on their products. I still have the original; it blows my mind that no one has ever bought it. I love the colors and the weird randomness. It was created in the flow. One of my favorites. Because I still remember the process. It was a fun piece to do. And also very hard to do again.”</p>

<p>Last but not least, special thanks to Psyrax, JC, our Legend Zenvangelist SupportMan, who is always available to assist the community with any node/mining-related questions. You’re the backbone of our Discord server, essential to the community. So, thank you!</p>

 Why release a transparency report? 



<p>Electric Coin Co. is committed to openness and transparency — as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital currency, and in support of our mission to empower people with economic freedom. This transparency report details company income, expenses, and use of funds during Q3 2022.</p>



<p>Key takeaways</p>



 
 Bootstrap received coins at a value below the ECC operating-expense level for Q3 2022. During this time, Bootstrap received coins at an average of $461,000 a month (at the Q3 average ZEC price, $60, for each of the three months’ distribution dates), and Bootstrap and ECC incurred average monthly expenses of approximately $766,000.&nbsp; 



 At the end of Q3 2022, Bootstrap and ECC collectively held approximately $3.0M in USD and approximately 116.9K ZEC.&nbsp; 



 As of March 16, 2023, the company held approximately $1.3M in USD and approximately 110K ZEC.&nbsp;

							<p>We could start this post by saying that our motivation to create a Zebra package for Arch Linux was that Arch enjoys the highest average rating of any Linux distribution on <a href="https://distrowatch.com/index.php?dataspan=score">DistroWatch</a>. However, the truth is that one of our engineers uses Arch (btw.), and he thought it would be handy to have Zebra packaged.</p><p>Packages in the official Arch repositories contain compiled binaries signed by their maintainers. The Arch developers maintain essential packages, and so-called trusted users maintain the rest. In addition to the official repositories, the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">Arch User Repository</a> (AUR) lets anyone from the Arch community share their own package. The difference is that AUR packages do not contain binaries but a script that pulls, builds, and installs the software for the user. Arch users are encouraged to inspect the script’s content before executing it.</p><p>Zebra is currently packaged in the AUR. The <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zebrad">package</a> prepares dependencies, pulls Zebra’s source code from GitHub, and builds and installs the same binary as the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/zfnd/zebra">Docker image</a>.</p><p>AUR users can vote for a package to increase its popularity, and trusted users can adopt popular packages and promote them to the official repositories. As the ArchWiki says, “a good number of new packages that enter the official repositories start in the AUR”. The original zcashd node already has an official package, and Zebra will hopefully follow. So if you are, by the way, using Arch, feel free to install the zebrad package and let us know how it went on our Discord, or on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/technology/zebra/46">Zcash Community Forums</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following is a correspondence from a teacher and father in the Czech Republic. I very much appreciated his observations, and he generously permitted me to share them with you all here in the hopes that it might help others.</p>
<p>March 23, 2023</p>
<p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>I have been following your research for a certain time now. I work as an elementary public school teacher, and there are some quite dramatic changes in the approach to students being implemented in our public school system. Nothing is official though. NGOs are starting to infiltrate the schools, such as the one I teach in. So far, this has taken the form of seminars for all teachers staff, where they stress student sovereignty, which is reasonable in essence. I have studied Montessori and Waldorf school methods and raise my own kids in such a way.</p>
<p>A method being pushed for about two years is called formative assessment. After taking the time to take a course on it and study it more thoroughly, I’ve found aspects of reductive scientific techno vision. Kids are given aims to fulfill along with some criteria they must meet at the end. When they finish working, they assess themselves according to the criteria and draw their conclusions about their own study. However, kids are unable to take their own studies into their own hands and be “responsible for it,” which is the underlying idea of formative assessment. It seems to me that it copies the fundamentals of machine learning, which they are trying to implement in our schools. I have tried it in many classes, and it is unrealistic, unnatural, time consuming, and unwanted by the kids.</p>
<p>Have you come across formative assessment in your country? Is it something they promote there also? Is this a method used to teach kids constantly sitting in front of panels and Ipads? I tried to find some studies supporting its success in teaching but found nothing. It is being promoted by the EU and our government all through our school system. As a teacher and a father I am concerned.</p>
<p>I also want to thank you for your research and the energy you are putting into informing people about these huge changes in our lives. Here, in my country, there is absolutely no information about the metaverse, blockchain, or AI whatsoever. Not even in blogs or social media.</p>
<p>I will be happy to hear from your opinion on this, should you find a minute. Keep up the good work!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greetings from the Czech Republic!</p>
<p>My reply:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Teacher Friend,</p>
<p>First, I think you are correct that it has everything to do with machine learning. The themes of “student-centered” education and “student voice and choice” have been central here for the past decade. While to the uninformed these ideas sound empowering, especially after so many years of drill and kill exercises for standardized testing that were intended to sap student and teacher creativity and curiosity. They know this. The program of “formative assessment” is in alignment with training a machine. It is goal oriented behavior. You can see numerous references to “formative assessment” in this <a href="https://www.oecd.org/czech/49479976.pdf">2012 OECD document for the Czech Republic</a> promoting competency based education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to better understand the evolution of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/?s=%22competency+based%22+">competency-based education</a> in the United States, here is a search of the term from my blog. I was introduced to these ideas by my friend Emily, a second grade teacher in Maine. She discontinued her blog a number of years ago, but some of the posts are available on the Wayback Machine – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214808/https://emilytalmage.com/2015/04/26/save-maine-schools/">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117100719/https://emilytalmage.com/2016/01/15/what-really-happened-in-alaska/">here</a>. We didn’t know anything about machine learning at the time, just the human capital finance part.</p>
<p>Competency Based Education, which is sometimes called Mastery or Proficiency-Based, is a set up for digital skills badges and “lifelong learning” on the blockchain ledger. Essentially, the “self-directed” model of education suits the need to treat humans as learning agents in complex simulations that will be used to forecast future global labor markets. It is important to understand that teachers are intended to be the vanguard in the adoption of these new technologies. Managing educators as “improve-able” digital human capital is also a planned global investment market. In the United States, they conditioned teachers first to accept behaviorist badges and digital micro-credentials as part of their “professional development,” so they would embrace the idea and promote the new paradigm to their students. I see that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq5BE-hoEKA">Erasmus</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/academy-for-sustainable-future-educators-edusta/">EduSTA</a> are <a href="https://projects.tuni.fi/edusta/">doing the same</a> in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>There is a reason Jeff Bezos, grandson of DARPA and Department of Energy big-wig <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35782841/lawrence-preston-gise-sr-death/">Lawrence Gise</a>, is investing in Montessori pre-k. I didn’t know about embodied AI and sensor networks when I wrote <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/09/15/montessori-inc-pre-k-predictive-profiling-for-power-and-profit/">this post</a>. Look up <a href="https://www.3blmedia.com/news/history-rsf-social-finance">RSF Social Finance</a>, the Rudolf Steiner Foundation, now based in Silicon Valley. It’s a social enterprise channeling considerable amounts of tech money. No surprise then that, at least in the US, Waldorf schools forced masking of children. We have to be mindful that even “alternative” types of learning styles like Montessori and Waldorf are being set up to <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-11-20-kid-tracking-sensors-may-not-be-the-wildest-thing-about-this-montessori-model">harvest data on children</a>. This will happen through artificial vision cameras, beacons, sensors, and wearable tech installed in learning environments. Such environments can be in non-traditional classrooms and even the outdoors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is most needed now is data to train artificial intelligence in social relations and human creativity and introspection. Formative assessments, when fed into a machine, allow the thinking process of the child to be made available for computation and analysis. This isn’t about one child or a classroom of children, but learning at scale – all of the children in the EU. It’s about the mental states of individuals and communities for the purposes of documentation and pattern recognition over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A challenging task is to embody artificial intelligence. When the AI comes into the material world it has to be able to navigate with a material “body” around complex obstacles and changing environments. Much of this research has been conducted as part of the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Embodied-AI-Robocup-Domestic-Robots.pdf">RoboCup</a> – robotic soccer team competitions. That project is being led by <a href="https://ai.sony/blog/blog-006/">Peter Stone</a> at UT Austin in Texas. Stone is also <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/">head of SONY AI North America</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this relates to choice and decision theory. Researchers use simulation modeling to train the AI before putting the technology into a robot. Within the digital simulation, the robots experience many failures moving through their test environment. Those failings affect their choices the next time around. Eventually, they “learn” to be more functional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it’s useful to see alternative “student directed” approaches to learning in this light. They will want children to be independent to the verge of social isolation to create the stress to force their decision making process – then log the self-reflection inquiry. This is “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2022.846693/full">goal oriented behavior</a>.” It is easier for the system to “learn” from disaggregated agents than a complex mass of humans collaborating, at least at this point. Some day, perhaps soon, the machines will be able to look at group dynamics with the same ease. It seems the Czech government has been very involved in the development of <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/customer-cases/czech-id">digital identity and e-government</a>. Social Finance has also been working with the European Social Catalyst Fund to <a href="https://socialfinance.org/insight/spotlight-social-finance-global-network/">investigate pay for success opportunities</a> in your country. Education and health are the two primary targets.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for reaching out. I hope you, and others, find this information helpful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Alison McDowell</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Electric Coin Co. (ECC) has been working since June to resolve Zcash wallet performance issues that are affecting users of third-party apps Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable.* All three of these mobile wallets utilize the ECC SDK.</p>



<p>Our engineers have made progress, however, work remains —&nbsp;including further updates to zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet — to fully restore good user experience in the impacted apps.</p>



<p>Solving these issues is our No. 1 priority, even taking precedence over our long term roadmap. Internally, we are calling this “Emergency Mode.”&nbsp;</p>



 The syncing problem 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented some wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. (The current wallet sync process requires scanning the entire blockchain before funds are available to be spent.) If a wallet won’t sync, a user can’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>



 What we’ve done so far 



<p>Within weeks of identifying the problem, ECC released two updates to zcashd that resolved full node issues, and work was underway on the SDKs. In October, we released zcashd 5.3.0 to fix out-of-memory issues, but further public releases specifically relevant to these syncing issues were delayed, as ECC engineers were pulled off task to build zcashd 5.3.3 and 5.4.2 — critical updates that remediated vulnerabilities inherited from Bitcoin Core.</p>



<p>Here’s a summary of what we’ve done, so far, to address wallet performance issues:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Released zcashd 5.1.0 and 5.2.0 in July to address performance in full nodes 



 Released zcashd 5.3.0 to fix a number of intermittent out-of-memory issues 



 Completed most of the code updates and testing for zcashd 5.5.0, which implements fee changes. Note: users should have the ability to spend funds without a full wallet sync upon the release of zcashd 5.6.0. 



 Completed a portion of the back-end work required to support the next release of the iOS and Android SDKs, which will include the first phase of an improved sync capability. 
 



 Exiting Emergency Mode 



<p>Our top priority is ensuring users can access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, so we’re building updates that will allow users to receive and spend new incoming funds faster,** and we’re implementing features that provide visibility on syncing progress.</p>



<p>Only after these capabilities are delivered —&nbsp;and when we’re confident that wallets are not being impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior —&nbsp;will we consider exiting Emergency Mode and widening our focus to include other initiatives.</p>



<p>The table below represents an estimated release schedule to address the wallet syncing issues. Each release is slated for delivery within a half-month window to allow for dozens of inherent dependencies. Interim releases may occur based on specific requirements or dependencies throughout this process. Version numbers listed may also change based on emergency or other unplanned impacts.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that after these releases are made available, third-party developers may need a number of days or weeks to implement and test.</p>



DateReleaseDetailsFirst half of April 2023zcashd 5.5.0A transaction-fee structure change based on overall size (inputs/outputs) and frequency of transactions (ZIP-317) will make attempts to spam or flood the network with txs much more expensive and unlikely. Mobile wallet users sending regular single recipient transactions will not be affected by this change.<br><br>Fund availability improvement will provide the ability to spend funds before a wallet is fully synchronized.&nbsp;<br><br>While this release will have no immediate positive effect on the wallet user experience, this is a necessary step toward exiting emergency mode.Second half of April 2023lightwalletd 0.5Partners currently running lightwalletd servers will need to apply this update to allow the future SDK capabilities to properly function and deliver an improved user experience via the mobile wallets.<br><br>Supports future zcash 5.6.0 update.Second half of AprilECC prototype walletThis initial version of the app is being developed with a minimum feature set as a test platform to validate current Zcash functionality and serve as a prototype for future feature development.<br><br>Initial distribution will be limited with a broader product launch later in 2023.Second half of May 2023zcashd 5.6.0DAGSync capability, which will enable fast sync and scanning of the blockchain<br><br>Users will not see the changes to the UX until the SDK update 0.6 (outlined below) goes out.Second half of May 2023Mobile SDK updates 0.6 (iOS &amp; Android)This update will include support for third-party app access to fund availability and improved sync capabilities.<br><br>Once this update is live, it will be up to the individual wallet developers to integrate the new features into their application, which will enable users to access their funds without issues and improve the overall Zcash user experience. This will end the emergency mode.



<p></p>



 



 



<p>* Based on community feedback, Ywallet has been working well and appears to be unaffected by high transaction load on the network.</p>



<p>** The speed benchmark we’ve set for downgrading from emergency mode is that a typical Zcash user can receive and spend funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in one hour. This is not a perfect measurement (use cases can vary wildly), nor is it our end goal (we know a great user experience demands more), but we believe it’s important to set a reference goal for internal and community alignment. Future speed improvements will be planned once the critical issues are resolved.</p>

   Alfredo Garcia describes a new Zebra feature to store Zcash block data in an elasticsearch database, which allows us to use Kibana to explore and visualize the data.  
 The post Visualize Zcash Blockchain Data with Zebra + Elasticsearch + Kibana appeared first on Zcash Foundation.

							<p>The Zcash blockchain history is big and rich—any block explorer application can just call RPC methods from a zcashd node and present the data in the desired way. Data analysis is hard in this context, on the one hand, you can just do what a specific application will allow you to do, or on the other hand if you need different visualization you have to create your own app.</p><p>As an alternative, we can export and index all block (header and transaction) data fields into an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">elasticsearch</a> database and use <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana/">Kibana</a> as a front end to do some analysis.</p><p>The possibilities of data visualization are huge with Kibana and all we need to do to create them is to feed an elasticsearch database with valid JSON block data.</p><p>When the elasticsearch feature is enabled, each block is sent from Zebra into elasticsearch; this is in addition to saving the block in the internal rocksdb database. We can then guarantee Zebra’s correct ongoing functionality and storage in the desired external database at the cost of more hard drive storage and a longer synchronization time.</p><p>Once the data has been inserted into the database, the Kibana part is easy. It may be able to provide many answers to existential questions our community deserves to know, for example:</p>  How many Orchard transactions have we had since its introduction? (Adoption)  How many shielded coinbase transactions have we had since its introduction? (Adoption)  How many Sprout transactions did we have in the last X period? (Deprecation)  How many transactions per block have we had on average since the start of the blockchain? (Information)  Which hours of the day are more transactions executed? (User distribution)  What is the average size of a block or transaction? (Parameters)  What is the distribution between Orchard, Sapling, Sprout and transparent transactions? (Information)  And many, many others.  						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
																														 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							The Zebra elasticsearch feature has only been tested on Testnet so far. Here is a guide on how to set it up; it is pretty easy.

What I think is needed next:
 
 	 Deploy the Mainnet in the cloud 
 	 Setup Kibana for listening to an external IP address. Optionally attach a domain name to it. 
 	 Create and share Kibana usernames and passwords between people interested in creating visualizations 
 	 Create dashboards with Zcash data 
 	 Share links to visualization in forums, twitter, news, etc. (external users do not need Kibana access to see shared visualizations) 
 
<br>
If you want to collaborate on any of these, please let us know by posting to the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/technology/zebra/46">Zcash Community Forum</a>!

<p>Scientific research &amp; publishing are gruelling tasks that extend outside the scope of science itself. Centralised publications abound in archaic practices that span from submitting a paper to getting it peer-reviewed and finally published, process which may take even up to years. In addition, research requires funding from very early stages of pursuing an idea, all the way to its finality (i.e. clinical trial or real-life applications). In TradSci (traditional science), funding is usually obtained once progress has already been achieved or when a startup has been formed.<br>DeSci (decentralised science) sets out to change this paradigm by funding early stage research via DAOs. When it comes to scientific publications, peer reviewing is also decentralised and incentivised, considerably speeding up the process. Moreover, contributions can be clearly retraced, avoiding false claims over IP, and the research itself becomes much more easily accessible and disseminated.</p><p>We were joined by Vincent Weisser &amp; Laurence Ion, stewards of Vita DAO, to discuss the advantages of DeSci in general, and the progress of longevity research in particular.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Vincent’s background and his interest in longevity  Laurence’s background and his interest in biotech  The purpose of DeSci  Which science branch is better suited for DeSci  How DeSci fixes contribution acknowledgement &amp; incentive misalignment  From research idea to startup via DeSci funding  $VITA token utility  Accelerating scientific publishing via DeSci  How IP is attributed in a DeSci setting  Project review and governance in Vita DAO  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentweisser">Vincent Weisser</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/longevion">Laurence Ion</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/vita_dao">Vita DAO</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/molecule_dao">Molecule DAO</a>  <a href="https://www.vitadao.com/projects">Vita DAO projects</a>  <a href="https://www.molecule.to/">Molecule</a>  <a href="https://www.bio.xyz/">Bio DAO launchpad</a>  <a href="https://www.longevityprize.com/">The Longevity Prize</a>  <a href="https://longevity.review/">The Longevity Decentralized Review</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst &amp; Meher Roy.

<p>This happened to me today (three-a-half-minute clip below):</p>
<p></p>
<p>So much for meaningful community participation and relationship building. This demonstrates that the P3 / NGO complex is a theater of busywork to misdirect well-meaning people as Web3 sensor networks and extended reality are installed around us. It’s happening right before our eyes, but we cannot see it for what it is. Even if we could, we’re far too distracted. We’re in a struggle for consciousness and agency, navigating a digital landscape whose treachery we cannot yet fully comprehend. Tell me, what does “community” mean if the majority opts to construct a world where turning children and the most vulnerable into securitized debt is normal? Where everything we love is quantified and rated in real time by emerging technologies? </p>
<p>The professionals fiddle as Rome burns. They, or at least the host, couldn’t handle a mother with a conscience.</p>
<p>This is the introduction of a webinar hosted by <a href="https://www.sp2.upenn.edu/person/nicholas-torres/">Nicholas Torres</a> of Social Innovations Journal based in the Philadelphia suburbs.</p>
<p></p>
<a href="https://archive.ph/yfSga"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://archive.ph/yfSga">https://archive.ph/yfSga</a>
<p>The webinar served as a launch event for <a href="https://socialinnovationsjournal.com/index.php/sij?mc_cid=546eb7ef1b&amp;mc_eid=c36bf829c8">a new volume of their journal</a> on place-based approaches to social innovation. A majority of the co-authors were affiliated with the Canadian anti-poverty think tank, the Tamarack Institute that operates out of the University of Waterloo. There were also several participants with ties to the Salt Lake City United Way, the lead organization for the first pre-k social impact bond as well as staff from StriveTogether, the US NGO using the collective impact framework to turn children into an asset class for global investors. </p>
<p>I mapped out the co-authors and commenters from the chat below.</p>
<p> Interactive version available <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/6b7b7e7fa90e4e7b7eeac8731cfb5ce0#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1pcEFsRHRTZA%3D%3D">here</a>.</p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tamarack-map.png?ssl=1"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/6b7b7e7fa90e4e7b7eeac8731cfb5ce0#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1pcEFsRHRTZA%3D%3D">https://embed.kumu.io/6b7b7e7fa90e4e7b7eeac8731cfb5ce0#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1pcEFsRHRTZA%3D%3D</a>
 Opening Remarks: 
<p>Sonja Miokovic: “So it all starts with this premise that we believe that communities drive transformational change, and this is something that Tamarack’s been doing for over twenty years now. When we were founded, we had two big goals. So, the first was to establish a learning center that would provide research and document real stories, best practices, and effective applications for community change. The second was to apply what we were learning in the field, in communities and learning to end poverty. So, these last two decades have shown us that community change really happens when individuals and networks come together with this intention to collectively tackle these problems and focus on impact. </p>
<p>So, I feel like the curation of this issue was a really great for us to zoom out and see how things are interconnected. This edition really focuses on our evolving understanding and our experience with social innovation, and it was a really unique opportunity for us to these examples of ingenuity across communities, across Canada but also the US and some other experience we have baked in here. So, the theme is really grounded in community innovation or place-based social innovation, and we believe this is an essential piece for tackling complex issues. Throughout our session today you’re going to hear the perspectives, we have eighteen contributing authors. So, that’s quite a lot, and it was really interesting to look at the overarching theme and see all the threads that are going through. I really invite the audience, I know it’s just gone live, but we’re going to hear from all the authors to hear their thinking, and how they’ve moved these themes forward. So, questions are always welcome.</p>
<p>*Remember that last part when we get to the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 My comments posted to the chat: 
<p>Alison McDowell: “I’m curious how you imagine extended reality and emerging tech / sensor networks fitting into your social innovation program? I know that population level data analytics is an area of significant interest, especially in the impact finance space.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alison McDowell in response to a suggestion by one of the authors that universities play a lead role in social innovation: “At this point, though, I think we need to consider that many research universities function as R&amp;D extensions of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/10/09/has-the-chamber-of-commerce-hijacked-your-education-system-engineering-students-for-a-low-wage-gig-economy/">corporate</a> and <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2017/01/16/how-did-the-department-of-defense-end-up-in-my-childs-classroom/">military interests</a>.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell regarding government involvement in innovation: “How is <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-nations.html">Canada’s role as a leading digital nation</a> / e-government solutions participant being factored into how this program is being implemented?”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell: “It seems that the impacts of AI and disruption of traditional work options will create opportunities in human capital investment in re-skilling labor markets to build out extended reality. Do you see this as a public-private partnership opportunity? What is the government’s role in providing access to citizens as raw human capital via digital identity and labor engineering? What are the ethics of creating global investment markets in re-skilled labor? Is there a difference in <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/12/06/poverty-wont-be-solved-by-committee-education-for-liberation-less-data-more-freire/">using this approach with children</a> as opposed to with adults?</p>
<p>Andrea Nemtin: “Hi Alison, I think there are some very interesting conversations to be held around data and social innovation, who owns what information, and how do we use it for social benefit?”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell in response to above comment: “I would be interested in knowing who defines social benefit, and how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arfNOiXB8CU">“wellbeing” metrics</a> might be <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/07/14/wellness-metrics-teaching-machines-to-live-with-us-synthetic-pretenders-part-15d/">built into AI and sensor networks</a>. I imagine sometime in the near future government might be replaced by a “public goods” DAO (<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/02/07/gods-eye-view-part-2-intuition-governance-tokens-and-training-kids-to-bet-big/">futarchy</a>). Not sure if people would be onboard for that.”</p>
<p>Andrea Nemtin’s response to my comment that many universities are now functioning as extensions of the corporate and military sectors: “Yes, and how do we ensure how similar resources can be directed to our most pressing social challenges?”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply to Nemtin: “Well, if we’re using military technology to address challenges, I wonder how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx7Dt8hql5M">vulnerable populations</a> would feel about that, right?”</p>
<p>Andrea Nemtin’s reply: “Oh no, that isn’t what I meant – yes, that would be problematic.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply to above: “Most people have no idea that <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/09/27/ieee-blockchain-chair-urges-speedy-collaborative-open-metaverse-deployment-before-mass-dissent-erupts/">Niantic</a>, who pioneered augmented reality, got their seed funding from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hanke">In-Q-Tel</a>, the CIA’s venture capital arm. We’re not informed about the origins of these technologies.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell commenting on a reference to “field catalysts” and “systems level change:” “Do the concepts of <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YhH5y1I2L8lwEnLzs6jWNrH0u64_04PbksgIdcthPuo/edit?usp=sharing">systems theory</a> and emergence inform your process?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alison McDowell commenting on discussion of building capacity by linking community leaders (field catalysts) and adopting models of collective knowledge sharing: “How is data from these interactions gathered? <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/02/10/gods-eye-view-part-3-civic-tech-the-wisdom-of-crowds-and-off-shore-sandboxes/">Is machine learning involved</a>? If not now do you imagine it will be in the future?”</p>
<p>Sandra Lapointe: “Are universities community innovators?”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply: “Do you mean the role of universities in establishing the research frameworks that underpin social impact finance? My experience is that many academics are tasked with building the cost-offset equations that will drive global markets to develop human and natural capital interventions. They’re also innovating the technologies that will capture the impact data for the deals. The problems is that most grassroots activists have no idea these markets even exist.”</p>
<p>Sandra Lapointe’s reply: “There are researchers conducting research on social financing, but I don’t have the impression that this is the bulk of the work. Social innovation happens when we create new ways of doing and thinking and build the capacity to reflect on social change at a very fundamental level. That includes research on all aspects of what we are discussing today, and especially things like inclusive innovation and sustainability.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply: “I suggest looking into <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/10/heckman-and-pritzker-pitch-apps-as-poverty-solutions-yielding-a-13-return-on-investment/">James Heckman’s equation</a> that will underpin global markets in children’s futures via securitization of pre-k debt. It involves putting children on blockchain with digital ID and using surveillance play tables (<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/21/childhood-captured-pay-for-success-and-surveillance-pre-k-play-tables/">Hatch Education We Play Smart</a>) to gather social-emotional audio and video data to score toddlers’ behaviors. This data will run global finance markets once all the children have a digital ID, and it can be brought to scale. See the <a href="https://readynation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/db_files/Kauffman-ReadyNation%20PKSE%20Report%2012041922.pdf">2012 ReadyNation / Kaufmann Foundation PKSE study</a>.”</p>
<p>This clip is of a conference hosted by Heckman at the University of Chicago on social-emotional learning. When a researcher says it’s been too difficult to get low-income parents to use the (surveillance) apps, Heckman jokingly replies they <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/30/incentivizing-pre-k-online-gaming-with-digital-sticker-books-and-pornography-for-the-adults-says-heckman-half-joking/">better incentives</a> – like online pornography for the adults. Really, he says this.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Alison McDowell continued: “The same thing is being done for natural capital via NFTs or other forms of tokenization. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPEGnJJ_4so">the Bank of International Settlement was presenting</a> on their <a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/green_finance/genesis_2.htm">Genesis Project</a> – green bonds with smart contracts for carbon offsets. All of this requires real time data collection. That impact data can then be repurposed via <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> and <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">Singularitynet.io</a> to train AI. &nbsp;We are building the Singularity with the impact data.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell in response to presentation on equity in climate space, including just transitions for indigenous groups in Canada: “I would be really interested in <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2020/02/17/statement-of-solidarity-in-support-of-wetsuweten-first-nation-all-the-darkness-shall-be-exposed-to-the-light/">indigenous perspectives</a> on the use of sensor networks and surveillance technologies like drone and satellite monitoring tied to smart impact bonds in carbon markets. This approach is being done in the name of climate justice, but in fact these data-gathering systems put vulnerable communities under increased digital surveillance.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell: “To what extent are indigenous worldviews shaping the collective impact space?”</p>
<p>Sandra Lapointe: “Participation of communities in the granting process is crucial. Academic granting councils are keen to support partnered research, but substantially more impact (and incentives to transform research practices) would come if community members were involved in the evaluation of partnered research grant applications.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply: “I’m curious if you all are looking at initiatives like <a href="https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-quadratic-funding-for-the-world">Gitcoin grants</a> that are feeding the grant making process into DLT (distributed ledger technologies). I see a big push for broad participation, but the Quadratic Funding model still involves deep reserves of matching funds that are often from tech interests who will benefit from the digitization of philanthropy. In that case it looks like philanthropy, but really, it’s catalytic capital, patient capital awaiting the scaling of extended reality.”</p>

<p>Alison McDowell commenting on presentation about the importance of “social capital:” “Do you all think most people are aware of the massive changes that are underway with disruption of labor markets, the impact of public surveillance tech, globotics, quantum computing. I love the idea of community voice, but the reality of it is the ability to shape the future is currently in the hands of the people at the top who hold considerable wealth and power. It’s hard to come up with good solutions if people don’t even understand the landscape that they’re operating in.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jaime Stief: “This resonates with me a lot Alison. I’ve been watching how the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in the US has influenced federal financial priorities there, and I wonder whether something similar could ever happen in the Canadian landscape?”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply: “The BIS (Bank of International Settlement) over the past two days was all about programmable money and cross-border payments. They are restructuring banking – the central bankers don’t want the commercial banks to go away, though. Look up digital nations – plans for tokenization go beyond financial assets the next plan is to “tokenize” democracy and frame it as “radical participation. Money and votes must be understood as signals to train machine learning in social interactions. This is at the core of complexity theory and emergence. Look up Teilhard de Chardin and the Omega Point. Also, Oliver Reiser’s 1946 book “World Sensorium.” This has been in the works for quite some time.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell continued: “For example Sanctuary.ai based in the Vancouver area – look up globotics, Globalization 4.0 discussed by economist Richard Baldwin. They are creating a future of work where people compete for global gig jobs to put their minds in a tele-operated robot. These are major changes. We can’t come to consensus if <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/12/11/email-to-yu-yuan-president-of-ieee-standards-association-sent-december-8-2022/">people don’t understand what is planned.</a> No one is being honest about this planned future.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sandra Lapointe: “Agreed! As Andrea mentioned, the role of government, and specifically municipal government in supporting and engaging in the social innovation ecosystem. As Bill is mentioning this requires governments to change and rethink partnerships.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s response: “Is it the role of government to <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/05/16/speaking-out-against-pay-for-success-predatory-public-private-partnerships-and-dr-hites-ties-to-ridge-lane-lp/">create the policy and technological infrastructure required to turn citizens and/or natural resources into investment opportunities for private capital</a>? Will people and nature as assets be available to ALL global investors. How does that work once debt is securitized and attached to high-frequency trading portfolios? Could we unknowingly be setting up toddlers to have their futures shorted? Are poor people and damaged environments (tokenized) the next “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/01/26/will-see-a-pre-k-tarp-toxic-assets-relief-program-in-20-years/">Big Short</a>?” Not only pre-k finance, but also securitization of income sharing agreements on blockchain (<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2021/03/03/thingification-ii-talking-with-tom-cowan-about-the-game/">Edly</a>) and Social Finance’s <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/01/23/fin-tech-digital-identity-and-e-government-in-brazil/">Career Impact Bonds</a>.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell: “Yesterday, the BIS floated the idea of technology companies joining commercial banks in the lending space.”</p>
<p>Liz Weaver: “I’m excited to be talking about collaborative governance. I do think it is, almost like what we heard today, it’s a circle.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell comment in response: “Circle – cybernetic feedback loops – Macy Conferences – now we have the tech, including token engineering, for granular social programming.”</p>

<p>Sonia Miokovic: “Any questions from the audience?”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply: “I have shared a lot of questions above.”</p>

 Testimony Against Turning Children Into Investment Assets: 
<p>Alison McDowell: “So, I’m a mother and an independent researcher in this field. I’m a conscience for what is happening. I got into this when they closed a bunch of schools in my city. We’re a city with significant poverty, with significant environmental racism, with significant harm being experienced in many areas, and the solutions that are being proposed are about data. They have to be about data at scale. So, that becomes inherently dehumanized.</p>
<p>What I have found researching the education spaces is that the money ALWAYS went back to hedge funds. Not just venture capital, but specifically to hedge funds. Then what I realized is that these equations in human capital finance, and also natural capital, are being used to turn human relationships of the most disenfranchised people who don’t have the capacity to write all the papers that you’ve been writing – to create the equations, <a href="https://wymancenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Belfield-et-al-2015.pdf">Clive Belfield’s social-emotional learning</a>, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/10/heckman-and-pritzker-pitch-apps-as-poverty-solutions-yielding-a-13-return-on-investment/">the Jim Heckman equation</a> that’s going to be used to scale pre-k finance. These equations will put children around the world on blockchain, put returning citizens from prison on blockchain, push people in addiction onto blockchain…at scale with digital identity all the data will be collected through sensor networks. There’s a paper – ReadyNation and the Kaufmann Foundation from 2012 saying specifically that pre-k debt will be turned into global asset-backed securities and traded on global markets.</p>
<p>They were setting up ten years ago children, children to be traded as global debt products. There are these technologies like the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/21/childhood-captured-pay-for-success-and-surveillance-pre-k-play-tables/">Hatch Education surveillance play tables</a> (we play smart) that are being used, because as Jim Heckman says they cannot actually change IQ. It’s not useful to the market, but they can change character. They can change character through digital media. These are all facts. They are very well documented.</p>
<p>You’ve presented all of this lovely information about community innovation, but what about the mother who runs, a Black woman businessperson who’s running a pre-k out of her house, doesn’t know this. So, there will be academics and community organizers who will come in and spin these great tales, but they won’t say, you know what? We’re training your child so that they can agree to put their mind in a robot developed at Sanctuary.ai in Vancouver, for the world of Quantum AI – D-Wave – in Burnaby. They’re not telling you that, and that’s why…Ronald Cohen’s film “I<a href="https://theinvisibleheart.ca/take-action/">nvisible Heart</a>” screened all over Canada to set you guys up for this.</p>
<p>Now I don’t know if you know it, and you think it’s ok to securitize children? This is the new slavery, and you’re doing it in the name of social justice and saving the world. I don’t know if you don’t know what you’re doing. Do you not know what you’re doing? Did no one give you the papers that said the plan is to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/edly-income-share-student-loans">securitize income sharing agreements</a>, and then feed the AI all the impact data? This collective impact data that you’re all collecting. Maybe you don’t know that you’re collecting it yet, but soon the sensor networks will be everywhere. This (waving at the laptop camera), this is all collecting the data. And they’re going to get social data, because the thing the AI most wants now is how to be human. It wants to know the system, how we interact with each other…how we’re creative…”</p>
<p>Sonja Miokovic: “Alison…”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell: “Yes, I mean I’m just…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE HOST HAS REMOVED YOU FROM THE MEETING</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe Nicholas Torres of Social Innovation Journal was the host. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An hour-long screen recording, which lasted until I was removed from the webinar, can be watched here. Sorry, you can hear the keystrokes as I type into the chat. Af far as I know the event wasn’t livestreamed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>PS: I spent the morning contacting as many people as possible from the webinar. I got some bounce-backs, but I suspect many of my emails landed in the right inbox. I’m grateful for Cliff’s guidance in these matters. He’s taught me that we get back the kind of energy we put in. Let us all try and exercise compassion, because some day it will be us who needs gentle redirection. Below is the email I sent out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear (personalized name),</p>
<p>I didn’t have the opportunity to conclude my remarks yesterday, so I wanted to reach out and share a post from my blog that includes my comments from the chat and links related to the issues I raised.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/03/24/mother-of-conscience-gets-bumped-by-social-innovators-for-explaining-how-children-will-be-securitized-on-blockchain/">https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/03/24/mother-of-conscience-gets-bumped-by-social-innovators-for-explaining-how-children-will-be-securitized-on-blockchain/</a></p>
<p>I believe if we understood the role that social innovation is meant to play in tokenizing natural life on earth – yes, including children – to create profit for powerful investors and to generate the data required to advance the Singularity, we would not want to be a part of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trent.st/">Trent McConaghy</a> of<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/"> Ocean Protocol</a>, a key player in the impact data / AI tokenization space, is Canadian now based in Berlin. There are numerous initiatives involved in planned systems of tokenized economics, e-government, and social physics that operate out of the University of Waterloo, just a few minutes walk from where the Tamarack Institute is based.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “place-based” strategies people are being tasked with facilitating are about gamification, complexity, and emergence in a world of ubiquitous computing – de Chardin’s Omega Point. The goal is to mine our social relations in “smart” IoT environments to train machine systems – to “humanize” them. If you appreciate a good rabbit hole, check out this relationship<a href="https://embed.kumu.io/7e4ca13d5586842710868082b4eaa6fa#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1XY2tvTTRjYw%3D%3D"> map</a> I made.</p>
<p>I encourage you to step back from the part of the elephant you’ve been focused on and consider that there may be a lot more going on in the background than you know. We live our lives generally only aware of the slivers of reality we’re offered, until something happens that leads us towards uncharted waters. For me that was 2013 when Boston Consulting Group<a href="https://archive.ph/LBXKp"> closed</a> 23 public schools in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintaining siloed information is a useful tactic for those who seek to hide treachery in plain view. Curiosity is the antidote. I know that the human heart and soul are far more powerful than any emerging technology. That is why we must say no to a future of<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/05/28/soulbound-tokens-trust-networks-and-californias-big-test/"> Soulbound Tokens</a>. I trust you will make good choices going forward. Inform yourself. You cannot un-know what I shared yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never underestimate informed mothers with a conscience. : )</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Alison</p>
<p>PS: If you have questions about my work, which centers on Web3, speculative finance, cybernetics, and legacies of domination, feel free to reach out. We don’t know what we don’t know. Maybe you have some pieces of the puzzle, too!</p>

 zk-nyms are here — a major milestone towards a market-ready mixnet <p>We recently <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-unveils-zero-knowledge-anonymous-credentials-zk-nyms-at-sxsw-6d56bd31802a">announced zk-nyms</a> to the world. zk-nyms are a cryptographic system that allows people to pay and use for services without leaking unnecessary personal information. This is an important milestone for the Nym mixnet and the following VPN example illustrates perfectly why…</p><p>VPNs are one of the more known and used privacy tools around, and if you are using one, you will probably be using a credit card to pay for it. That means the VPN provider has your card details, name and address. Furthermore, VPNs act as a trusted proxy, so even if they shield your IP and browsing history, they themselves know all the websites you are accessing!</p><p>To put it bluntly, your VPN provider now has your identity and full browsing history. And to make matters worse, some “free” VPNs even embed third-party trackers to gather your data and sell it on others (<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/vpns-tor-i2p-how-does-nym-compare-8576824617b8">read&nbsp;more</a>).</p><p>So let’s get into what zk-nyms can do to solve&nbsp;this!</p> Introducing zk-nyms <p>The very first use-case of zk-nyms is now out in the world: bandwidth credentials for the mixnet! By using zk-nyms, people can prove they have the right to use the mixnet for privacy, without revealing their wallet address, payment amount, balance or any other information.</p><p>We don’t want your payment details, your name, transaction number or any other information about you. All we need to know is whether you (or the app you are running) have the right credentials to use the mixnet. In fact, that should be the norm for any digital service that you&nbsp;use!</p><p>We have just launched a sandbox where people can test spending bandwidth credentials with a gateway (<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/bandwidth-credentials.html">using CLI</a>). We invite devs and gateway operators to come and <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/bandwidth-credentials.html">try it&nbsp;out</a>!</p> Pay, but not with your&nbsp;privacy! <p>The Nym mixnet protects you online — not just the IP address and content, but even the metadata and patterns of communication. The mixnet is decentralised and trustless, meaning there is no part of the infrastructure that holds any data about you or your traffic. And that has to be the case for payments&nbsp;too.</p><p>The mixnet is currently free of charge, but there will eventually be a small fee to ensure <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-token-d55ffd3d397a?source=collection_archive---------0-----------------------">operators are compensated fairly</a>. Today’s digital services are incentivised towards surveillance. From Facebook and social media more generally to free email and VPN services, they provide a service at a low cost to attract users and then make up the rest by selling people’s&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Nym mixnet includes token economics to ensure that the infrastructure operators are incentivised to provide privacy, not surveillance. And now with zk-nyms, we are one step closer to a paid mixnet service that is fully secure and does not leak any additional information.</p> What next for&nbsp;zk-nyms? <p>Bandwidth credentials is just the first practical use-case for what we see as blazing a new innovation pathway for our online lives. In the physical world, most of us are not under constant observation. Most of us are not subject to continuous micro analysis by unknown organisations, determining who you are, where you belong and what you are likely to do next. In the physical world, you get to choose what you share about yourself, when and with whom. Unfortunately that is not currently the case&nbsp;online.</p><p>zk-nyms intends to make this possible in the digital world too. You will be able to selectively reveal your information to build trusted and secure relationships without leaking unnecessary personal information to third parties. Specific use-cases include privacy preserving KYC, private payments, access control, age verification as well as a generic privacy preserving single-sign on!</p><p>You are not a number in a database. Your identity should not be imposed by companies and agencies using a tightening net of proliferating profiling algorithms. Digital systems should primarily serve people, not the other way around and the ability to selectively determine what you reveal and to&nbsp;who.</p> Features of&nbsp;zk-nyms <p>You may be seeing the words ‘zero knowledge’ and ‘private credentials’ bouncing around a lot these days and be wondering: what makes zk-nyms different from other credentials and zk-magic? The main advantage of zk-nyms is that we are decentralised, and have threshold-issuance, meaning that we avoid a centralised point of trust to issue us the credentials! To wrap up here is a quick overview of the features of&nbsp;zk-nyms…</p> Cryptographic <p>As the name hints at, zk-nyms make use of several cryptographic primitives, including zero-knowledge proofs, blind signatures and commitment schemes, and are an extension of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07344">Coconut credential scheme</a>. Zero knowledge has become quite the hype lately, so there are plenty of guides out there for those who want to deep-dive, but suffice to say that this bit of cryptographic magic allows people to cryptographically prove something without having to reveal the evidence. (A more in depth post comparing zk-nyms with zk-snarks, starks and other zero knowledge hype, coming&nbsp;soon!)</p> Decentralised <p>A unique feature of zk-nym is that it is decentralised. This means that there is no single authority that holds your credentials. Instead they are issued by a decentralised validator set. For some of you readers, this might raise alarm bells regarding potentially malicious validators, but we have good news for&nbsp;you…</p> Threshold issuance <p>…because zk-nym makes use of threshold issuance, meaning validators only hold a share of the key that signs the credential! Having a threshold issuance has a similar byzantine-fault tolerance as other validator bases schemes, i.e., we not only distribute trust but also avoid crush of the system in case some validators go offline or are malicious.</p> Unlinkable <p>Unlinkability means that the issuance of your credential and your subsequent showing of it is unlikable. This means that even if validators collude with the service to which you show your credential, they cannot learn any additional information. Furthermore, a property of blind issuance means that even if all the validators colluded, they would not be able to piece together the private attribute of your credential.</p> Selective disclosure <p>The power is now firmly back in your hands to selectively disclose information about yourself as and when you need&nbsp;to.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@M.Quin/zk-nyms-burada-piyasaya-haz%C4%B1r-bir-mixnet-yolunda-%C3%B6nemli-bir-kilometre-ta%C5%9F%C4%B1-2b6388695653">Turkish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/zk-nyms-ya-est%C3%A1-aqu%C3%AD-un-hito-importante-hacia-una-mixnet-preparada-para-el-mercado-fd182329addf">Spanish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymportugues/zk-nyms-est%C3%A3o-aqui-um-marco-importante-em-dire%C3%A7%C3%A3o-a-uma-rede-de-mixagem-pronta-para-o-mercado-33297c488080">Portuguse</a></p> Learn more <p>Try: zk-nyms for <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/bandwidth-credentials.html">bandwidth credentials CLI&nbsp;sandbox</a></p><p>Blogpost: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/vpns-tor-i2p-how-does-nym-compare-8576824617b8">VPNs, Tor, I2P — how does Nym&nbsp;compare?</a></p><p>Paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07344.pdf">Coconut credentials scheme</a></p><p>Paper: <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/011">Security Analysis of&nbsp;Coconut</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">zk-nyms are here — a major milestone towards a market-ready mixnet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      Partnering with Hex: Data Collaboration Made Easy        Barry, Caitlin, Glen and their team are building a collaborative workspace for the modern data stack—where delivering insights is seamless.   <p>By Matt Miller and Michelle Bailhe Fradin</p><p>Published March 23, 2023</p>      



 
<p>Data is the competitive advantage of the 21st century. Without access to the right information, businesses are unable to make the quick decisions they need to survive—and any dream of AI is off the table. The good news is that the wave of the cloud has brought with it a whole set of new companies and technologies to collect and break down more information than we ever could have imagined, including cloud data warehouses, real-time data and integration, efficient data loading, transactional cloud databases, transformation and metrics. These products and others like them are giving us better information than ever before and the companies behind them have created more than $100B of market cap in the process.</p>



<p>The irony, though, is that atop this modern data stack, teams are still forced to use kludgy, decades-old analytics tools to actually make all of that data useful and deliver insights to users. But these are the types of opportunities we love at Sequoia: when a shift in the competitive landscape creates a clear opening for an enduring company to emerge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we are thrilled to embrace just such an opportunity and announce our partnership with <a href="https://hex.tech/">Hex</a>. We believe the platform that co-founders Barry McCardel, Caitlin Colgrove and Glen Takahashi and their team are creating has the potential to transform how businesses work together—in modern languages, with modern infrastructure. Hex starts its journey with data scientists, offering them the best way to collaborate on notebooks and work together to deliver insights. It ends with an analytics platform that empowers both business users and data analysts to quickly find the answers they need to do their jobs.</p>



<p>We learned about Hex through our partnerships with Snowflake and dbt, where customers were raving about their experiences with the product. People tell us they love the collaborative experience it offers and the ease it gives them in accessing the information they need. For some customers, Hex is already being used not only by data scientists, but the whole company.</p>



<p>When we first met Barry, Caitlin and Glen, they weren’t raising money. We are thankful to them for nonetheless being patient with our interest—and for seeing value in the opportunity to partner with us. We are excited to put Team Sequoia behind Hex, and we look forward to seeing them accomplish their dream of making data an easy and collaborative experience for everyone. By doing so, they will rightfully claim their spot as the crown jewel atop the modern data stack that is changing our world.</p>

      Developer Tools 2.0         <p>By Charlie Curnin, Josephine Chen and Stephanie Zhan</p><p>Published March 22, 2023</p>        Generative AI stands to change how work happens in one industry after another. But software engineering’s transformation isn’t done yet.        



 
<p>Copilot has caught lightning in a bottle. GitHub’s AI-powered companion for developers, suggesting the code you might want to write next, is a hit in more ways than one. It’s beloved by engineers, attracting more than <a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/">a million</a> within about a year and delivering a substantial boost in productivity. (Even if you’re a <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1608895189078380544">top engineer</a>, it might write half your code or more.) It also stands to become a commercial blockbuster. Charging $10-19 per seat per month, Copilot could grow to generate $1 billion or more in annual revenue among GitHub’s <a href="https://github.blog/2023-01-25-100-million-developers-and-counting/">100 million users</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Copilot’s success has set off a gold rush. Founders have raced to bring the power of large language models to all kinds of other industries, building tools to help professionals write, code, design and create media. There’s “Copilot for lawyers,” “Copilot for doctors” and “Copilot for designers,” and many more “Copilot for X”’s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are all exciting directions. We think <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">generative AI</a> stands to transform <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyatweetybird/status/1628446962742874112">one industry after another</a>, making all kinds of professionals <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-for-work-perspective/">more effective at work</a> and delighting waves of consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there’s a lot more to do for developers. Copilot, which leverages OpenAI’s model Codex, may be just the opening salvo in AI’s transformation of how software engineers work. Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">predicted</a> in 2017 that neural networks would create a new generation of software, “Software 2.0,” and we may see the same reinvention of the tooling that helps people make software—a “Developer Tools 2.0.”</p>



<p>There are many opportunities here. Some founders are iterating on the in-editor, get-help-while-you’re-coding experience Copilot popularized, trying different interaction patterns or different models. Think of Replit’s <a href="https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter">Ghostwriter</a>, Soucegraph’s <a href="https://twitter.com/sourcegraph/status/1618719148087070721">Cody</a>, <a href="https://www.tabnine.com/">TabNine</a> and others.</p>



<p>Many other opportunities lie further afield. You might target work engineers do beyond writing code, like debugging and documentation—or other work engineering orgs do, like incident response. You might think of value props other than “write code faster,” like “write code that’s more performant or more secure.” You might throw out the plugin form factor and rebuild an entire application. You might focus on personas other than the software engineer, like the data scientist who needs a boost writing in notebooks (see: <a href="https://hex.tech/magic/">Hex</a>), or the data analyst toiling away writing SQL queries. There’s a wide waterfront of opportunities to explore and many places to hook into developers’ workflows.&nbsp;</p>
 



<p></p>







 
<p>Building legendary companies to enable this won’t be easy. Copilot faces <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446821/microsoft-openai-github-copilot-class-action-lawsuit-ai-copyright-violation-training-data">legal scrutiny</a> over concerns related to <a href="https://githubcopilotlitigation.com/pdf/06823/1-0-github_complaint.pdf">software piracy</a>. Microsoft, the incumbent with control over both GitHub and VS Code, enjoys significant distribution advantages. Many founders have started building with LLMs, making many opportunities competitive. GitHub itself just announced plans to offer broader AI functionality through a brand-new version of Copilot, powered by GPT-4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in our view, there’s a massive opportunity for AI to transform software engineering, and it’s a matter of who, not if. We think important ingredients in who prevails will be focusing on developer experience, providing net-new capabilities, and making strategic choices around how to land and expand in developers’ workflows. Success here can mean rewriting how engineering happens—and having a chance at building a generational company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the first installment in a series. These notes help summarize Wolfgang Smith’s book, “<a href="https://angelicopress.org/theistic-evolution-smith">Theistic Evolution: The Teilhardian Heresy”</a> and were prepared by Lorraine Davison. She has generously agreed to share them with us here given the significance of the geologist/theologian’s work on the Omega Point to our current post-human trajectory.</p>
<p>March 19, 2023</p>
<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>I would like to share with you my notes from a book that I am reading about the thought of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.</p>
<p>As you know, Teilhard is part of the Catholic story as is the author of this book, Wolfgang Smith. But Smith is also a product of the same academic and corporate structures that you have painstakingly traced in your mapping of the development of the ideas that are now shaping our world in ever more terrifying ways. He graduated from Cornell at eighteen with majors in physics, mathematics and philosophy and took an M.S. from Purdue. He then spent 3 years at Bell Aircraft Corporation as an aerodynamicist. He gained recognition for his pioneering papers on the effect of diffusion fields, providing a theoretical solution to the re-entry problem for space flight. He then got a Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia University and became a professional mathematician.</p>
<p>So, Smith straddles both science and faith. I guess that it was the ever more obvious attempts to morph science itself into a faith that made him embark upon a critique of scientism and upon attempts to revive metaphysics as an authentic theological discipline.</p>
<p>In this light, he has Teilhard firmly in his sights.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you have often pointed to the Jesuit’s work as a central element in the potential endpoint that is driving many of the current developments in society, I thought it might be useful to precis the central points of this work. In the first chapters, the author is establishing how Teilhard’s theories depend upon the destruction of the thought of his own Catholic and all other major religious traditions. He also calls into question the scientific basis for his theories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think his insights will deepen our understanding of Teilhard’s work and why it so influential and dangerous for the entire human race. I hope that it is not too dry!</p>
<p>The book is called <a href="https://angelicopress.org/theistic-evolution-smith">Theistic Evolution: The Teilhardian Heresy (</a>Angelico Press 2012).</p>
<p>Below, I provide a summary of the introduction and chapters one through three.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Smith locates Teilhard within the field of theistic evolution which argues that God creates through evolution that is driving us to a predestined endpoint. Teilhard devoted much of his work to promoting and describing this endpoint. His work combines science and theology.</p>
<p>The author provides a brief sketch of Darwin’s theory of evolution. He then highlights how subsequent discoveries, especially in biology, have cast increasing doubt on the theory.</p>
 
 Microevolution. Although yielding observable effects, has never been shown to effect the transformation of one species to another 
 Macroevolution. The famous gaps in the fossil records and all those missing links! 
 Irreducible complexity. The practical and mathematical improbability that a complex system could evolve by chance mutations and be selectively assumed into a genetic line. 
 
<p>He highlights how fanatical adherence to Darwin’s theories can only come from a need to contain all explanations for life in a materialist framework.</p>
<p>Teilhard’s “theistic evolution” has infected nearly all the Christian world. Even worse, it is being used to shore up a tottering “scientific” theory by filling in its gaps with divine intervention.</p>
<p>Modernism has demythologised biblical interpretation and stripped it of ontological meaning (ontological as relating to all questions of what it means to “be”). This means that we interpret Eden as belonging to the same material world as that which we now inhabit. However, it is really a transcendent realm from which humanity “fell”. This fall has come to be seen almost entirely in moralistic terms and not as a movement from one realm to another.</p>
<p>The point is that the Christian creation story and theistic evolution cannot both be true. If mankind originated (body and soul) in a transcendent realm outside of our world, then it did not originate in our known world many millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Smith argues that in Christianity man is at the absolute centre of creation and the created world is tied to our fate because we have a unique relationship to God. Teilhard wanted to reinvent Christianity and create a new religion. But this does not just concern remote Catholic theologians as (after some kind of mystical vision) he felt that he was the only person to have seen the truth. He then set out to engulf all of humanity in this vision.</p>
<p>His work has replaced the idea of following Christ with the intention to create Christ by way of evolution. Christ is no longer Alpha and Omega but only Omega. All that remains of spiritual life is communal action – the kind that promotes “socialization” (apparently one of Teilhard’s own terms). What counts is not the individual but the species.</p>
<p>He created many scientific-sounding fictions and has convinced many people of the truth of his vision. Smith aims to look at the “scientific evidence” for theistic evolution which has allowed his doctrine to “attain dominion” in the educated Christian world and beyond.</p>
<p>Finally, he offers this book as a kind of homeopathic remedy for the infection of theistic evolution. He will go on to cover such topics as the nature of time and eternity, the twofold distinction between spirit, mind and matter and the meaning of history in light of revelation. Of course, his is obviously a Christian perspective.</p>
<p>Chapter One – Evolution: A Closer Look</p>
<p>Whilst there is some evidence for microevolution this is not the case for macroevolution. Smith means the latter in this discussion. For instance, there is no evidence of a continuous evolutionary chain and there are many temporal gaps in the fossil record. Also, no evidence has been found for the intermediate creatures that had been proposed in order to complete that chain (such as Ernst Haekel’s protovertebrates). In addition, DNA shows that idea of the genealogical tree is mistaken as the biosphere does not show a sequential progression but rather is divided into well-defined and widely separated classes. This separation is clear and mathematically verifiable at the molecular level. There is no evidence that this was any different in the past.</p>
<p>Even more convincing is the complexity of living organisms even at their most basic level. Mathematical calculations based on the makeup of the simplest of life forms show the improbability of Darwin’s scenario. The author gives the example of flagellum.</p>
<p>Smith then puts Darwin’s increasingly shaky theory of evolution up against what he calls “authentic theology.”</p>
<p>St Augustine said “beyond a doubt the world was not made in time but with time.”&nbsp; Evolution takes place in time so this is not how God created. Scripture rules out the objection that the world might have been made with time but creatures in time.</p>
<p>“He that liveth in eternity created all things at once”. – Ecclesiasticus 18:1</p>
<p>This is known as the omnia simul doctrine.</p>
<p>“God creates the world and all things in the present now” explains Meister Eckhart.</p>
<p>This “now” coincides with eternity.</p>
<p>So Teilhard’s assertion that “God creates through evolution” is untenable metaphysically, or at least it should be for Christians!</p>
<p>God creates the creature before he creates time: being has precedence over time.</p>
<p>In fact, time derives from the creature. This seems strange to us. But the Church Fathers taught that created beings are birthed in time and then each manifest being has its own spatio-temporal locus. It fits into a “universal network of secondary causes” but its roots extend beyond the visible cosmos and into the timeless instant of the creative act.</p>
<p>This means that your being does not coincide with the visible “you”. Smith says that even the tiniest plant is “vaster than the entire cosmos in its visible form” because its roots extend into eternity.</p>
<p>This doctrine is difficult for us to understand – it is from God’s perspective.</p>
<p>Creation from the point of view of Anthropos (Adamic or primordial man) is contained in the hexaemeron or six days of creation. This is the first effects of the creative act as they are expressed within (and not without) the visible cosmos.</p>
<p>Smith argues that our world has effectively shrunk because we no longer understand the old teachings about the extra dimension where the primary act of creation takes place–that which is above. This is the invisible realm that is beyond the detection of science and has therefore been dismissed as fantasy. So, we have now become “denizens of the flatland”: the land that has lost its verticality. Consequently, we can now dismiss the ancient doctrines altogether (atheism) or reinterpret them to fit into the horizontal plane (heresy).</p>
<p>Thus, according to Smith, the Darwinist is seeking the origin of the species where it cannot be found as being preceded time. But the theistic evolutionist both commits this error and adds another. He locates these origins within time and then asserts that God creates through evolution. Omnia simul has disappeared and every supposed movement of evolution is attributed to God. We have been deracinated and cast onto the shifting sands of time. In short, we have been robbed of our essential being.</p>
<p>But there is a true evolution of creatures. A first birth takes place in the “above” and then a second as the creature moves “downwards” (as it were) into the visible cosmos. This is the manifestation or “unfolding” in space and time of a created being.</p>
<p>Evolution is central to the work of Teilhard as he says all other theories and systems must bow before it.&nbsp; However, he does not explain how this came to be established. In other words, he is claiming an evidential base for Darwin’s theory that does not exist.</p>
<p>Smith shows that Teilhard abandons the argument that Darwin’s theory can be proven by empirical evidence in favour of the argument that it can be established on a priori grounds – that is through the exercise of reason. No one has ever been able to observe a genuine action of evolution or transformation of species from one state to another. So, Teilhard enthrones evolution as the king of theories on the grounds that reason can see no other way that the development and transformation of species could occur.</p>
<p>Even though Teilhard, the Christian, has to include God in his theories, the operations of chance predominate in his work.&nbsp; Moreover, everything, even Christianity, must now be reinterpreted in the light of a universe fuelled by random chance. The biblical creation story and the whole idea of God has to be recast as He may only now create through the mechanism of evolution.</p>
<p>Smith concludes that Teilhard became fascinated by the theory of evolution because he wanted to be able to contain all explanations for the causality and transformation of life within the visible cosmos. He wanted to rule out “the intervention of an extra cosmic intelligence” and to see a self-sufficient nature “as a seamless garment of organic interrelationships in which every living form can be regarded as the resultant of preceding forms.” This is the biological counterpart of Newtonian physics applied to the biosphere.</p>
<p>Teilhard identifies that there must be a “physical agent” that connects and explains the transformative movements of nature. His dream seems to have been to define, name and presumably use this agent. It is the philosopher’s stone of the transformist’s cause. Smith points out that if they have not, after so much time, identified this agent of transformation and thus of evolution how can they say that evolution itself is established fact?</p>
<p>He concludes this chapter by wondering at the fanatical faith of the transformists in the self-sufficient “one organic physical interaction of living beings.” They seem to be obsessed by establishing evolution as a way of precluding the “intrusion” of an extra cosmic intelligence”. This is the great paradox. It seems that Teilhard’s express aim was to reintroduce the Christian God into the scientific world view. But Smith argues that the God of Teilhard is not the Christian God. He wishes to enthrone a new deity who is more suited to the needs of the evolving “ultra human”. This is a new religion and Teilhard is its self-appointed prophet.</p>
<p>Chapter Two – Forgotten Truths</p>
<p>For Teilhard “spirit” is an evolutionary process in consciousness and thought. It is the unconscious unfolding into the conscious and onto the self-consciousness unique to humanity and which includes our capacity for language.</p>
<p>“Once symbols have taken the place of things, one is able to manipulate these symbols, move them about at will; and by virtue of this inner freedom, one finds oneself, as it were, in a new space: the space of concepts, the inner world of thought.”</p>
<p>Spirit has become a “thing” that can be “observed” within ourselves and related to other things (such as the brain). It is “a variable connected to other variables.”</p>
<p>If this process of spiritualization is channelled through “socialisation,” it will lead, according to Teilhard, to hyperconsciousness. This is the collectivisation of thought of Teilhard’s super-organism in which each of our brains is but a neuron in the over brain.</p>
<p>Following Descartes, Teilhard reduces spirit to a “thinking entity”. This departs from the ancients who distinguished the thought processes of the mind from the intellect which was associated with the spirit.</p>
<p>Particularly after Descartes, the higher concept of “intellect” was subsumed into “mind” and forgotten. For Descartes, “mind” was a spiritual substance whose activity was thought. Teilhard goes beyond this and declares that mind/thought is spirit. This amounts to a radical transformation in our view of what it is to be human.</p>
<p>Traditionally, thought was seen as an activity arising from the interaction of spirit (or soul) and body – like a pianist (spirit) playing a piano (the body). For Teilhard there is only the piano (body). He insists that our dynamic humanity arises from one single phenomenon and not the interaction of two. Thus, for instance, personhood arises only from the neuronal activity of the brain. This is not universally accepted even by many neurologists.</p>
<p>Smith maintains that Teilhard has failed to grasp that spirit and matter are situated on different levels of reality – the two poles on a vertical axis that contain existence. he argues that Teilhard’s single cosmic substance does not exist.</p>
<p>Creation began with a duality – heaven and earth which can be understood in a number of different ways, but underlying them all are two elements—spirit and matter.</p>
<p>In the past, thinkers have tried to represent the invisible spiritual reality through metaphors and images, but eventually these attempts (such as Ptolemy’s cosmology) were ridiculed because they contained elements that could not be observed and hence were deemed to be untrue. These attempts to portray a dual reality have been obliterated from the modern mind.</p>
<p>This obliteration becomes especially problematic when we try to grasp the immaterial elements of our own inner worlds. It was widely understood that the spiritual (the heavenly) interpenetrated the human person. Spiritual and material elements worked together in order to produce the created world and the self-conscious “I” but each kept their separate identity. For Teilhard, however, there is only one indistinguishable substance.</p>
<p>In physics there is no empty space or a totally material particle. The cosmos is full of immaterial spiritual content that gives life and renders the universe comprehensible. So, as we comprehend the world we see it with a spiritual eye – it is this that makes us human.</p>
<p>For Teilhard, our world is not the lowest level in a hierarchical, metaphysical cosmology but is the whole cosmos that includes even God. Spirit and matter are two sides of the same coin –</p>
<p>&nbsp;“All that exists is matter becoming spirit”.</p>
<p>This is the core of Teilhard’s thought.</p>
<p>The “arrow of time” is propelling this substance “spirit-matter” on a one-way evolutionary journey.</p>
<p>The implications of Teilhard’s theories for Christian anthropology are immense. Traditionally man is seen as reflecting the duality of heaven and earth as he consists of body and soul. &nbsp;However, we depend on three elements for our existence. Soul (psyche) is not strictly speaking the spirit(pneuma) which exists in a level above our individual forms. It is the spiritual element from which our individual soul is derived – the soul of our soul. So, the individual soul occupies an intermediary position between the spiritual realm from which we derive life and the material body. In this way we are technically made up of body and soul but linked through the soul to a higher reality. The psychic knowledge of the soul is not self-contained. It derives its “knowing” from a higher spiritual plane. The intellect is thus ultimately spiritual.</p>
<p>But Teilhard does not distinguish between spirit and psyche. In fact, He replaces both these “old” concepts with another evolutionary process – that of psychogenesis.</p>
<p>In the old system, the product of the intellect was cognition and that of the psyche/mind, thought, “thought is the quest of which cognition is the end.” In other words, the intellect guides us through mental movements (often not without some considerable pain!) in order to arrive at an understanding (the stasis of an authentic vision, or cognition). The two are not the same. Indeed, the mind never stops moving and, more often than not, this random thought movement is not guided by intellect or concluded by cognition.</p>
<p>The author explains that cognition does not involve movement because it takes place outside of time. It is only outside of time that we achieve the unity necessary for true cognition as time implies dispersion and multiplicity. An unperceived timeless stillness enables us to perceive a landscape as an undispersed whole. Here, our senses are saved from being overwhelmed by the millions of individual elements that make up the scene.</p>
<p>However, Teilhard is welded to movement as he sees everything as process. He confuses cognition and thought because his system requires it. He cannot afford to perceive the immutability and stillness of timeless spirit.</p>
<p>Smith is keen to emphasise that he is not talking about the Spirit of God but spirit with a small ‘s’. This is the highest tier of the created world. &nbsp;It is not subject to time but neither is it eternal. It occupies a middle ground between time and eternity. This is essential to Christian metaphysics which has to include this realm of intellect. This is the created heaven that belongs with earth as the centre belongs to the circumference of a circle. It is this mysterious union of opposites that constitutes creation.</p>
<p>Creation then consists of the material world and several levels of the psychic world which is crowned by the spiritual. Logic dictates that the nature of time changes as the levels progress. A thousand years on earth can be as a day in heaven. Indeed, at the summit ‘before’ and ‘after’ merge into a timeless now. For Teilhard, man is trapped in the temporal zone as he denies the intellectual soul that pulls us to the timeless heaven and which defines our humanity.</p>
<p>Chapter Three – Complexity/Consciousness: Law or Myth?</p>
<p>In Teilhard’s directed evolution matter is becoming spirit. It is being spiritualised into life, consciousness and intelligence. This is happening through a process of complexification in which particles become molecules which become cells and eventually Intelligent multi-cellular organisms. Higher levels of complexity produce entities with an interior or psychic life that we call consciousness. So, consciousness is the product of increasing complexity.</p>
<p>In an attempt to establish laws in the biosphere that mirror those of Newtonian physics, this idea is called the Law of Complexity/Consciousness. Teilhard claims that it is empirically verifiable and it forms the foundation of his thought.</p>
<p>However, we are only able to observe the behaviour and not the consciousness of beings outside of ourselves.&nbsp; Neither is it simple to measure, in any meaningful way, living organisms in terms of their degrees of complexity. Therefore, it is not clear how one would asses to what extent consciousness is proportional to complexity. And even if this Law held good does it establish Teilhard’s thesis?</p>
<p>Smith argues that it does not necessarily establish what Teilhard wishes to establish – that the spiritual factor is derived from matter. But this is fundamental to his work. He must deny dualism at all costs in order to establish that the cosmos is comprised of one substance— spirit-matter.</p>
<p>We have at least one mental power, however, that does not seem to be a product of our organised complexity. &nbsp;This is the ability to take the extremely fragmentary elements of our sense experiences and unify them into single or ordered comprehensible perceptions. In some way, we turn these many elements into one. For instance, one photograph may be made up of over a million dots. Yet there are no structures in the brain dedicated to the unifying function that makes these dots into one comprehensible image or the multiple elements of a street scene into a streamlined and coordinated sensory experience. Thus, some other element is at work that is not a spatial entity. It’s position “above” space enables it to combine all the elements of spatial experience so that we can make sense of them.</p>
<p>Consciousness is seen in traditional thought as a power of the soul that is independent of the body. However, some aspects of consciousness (here called empirical consciousness) clearly arise from the interaction of the body and soul as in the processing of sensory perceptions in the waking state. But as we saw above, the processing of the multiple inputs to the senses relies upon the powers of the soul.</p>
<p>The author argues that this power of the soul is created and has not arisen from evolution. However, it does evolve in the sense that it is unfolded progressively through the body. Thus, the body and the soul need each other. &nbsp;This unfolding of the powers of the soul also results in the development of species. But this only takes place within prescribed boundaries—dogs will probably never compose symphonies. So this unfolding does not result in the transformation of one species into another—“nothing can become that which it is not”. This is why mutations of form more often than not result in the death and not the evolution of the organism.</p>
<p>Sometimes Teilhard is self-contradictory in arguing that a primitive kind of psyche must exist in every corpuscle and precedes complexification. This is mystifying as not only does it undermine his own argument but is completely without the scientific verification necessary to establish the credentials of his allegedly science-based theories.</p>
<p>Smith argues that Teilhard will use any argument available to him (no matter how scientifically weak) in his efforts to abolish traditional dualism because it is the one thing that stands in the way of his radical evolutionism.</p>
<p>Teilhard does however retain some Christian teaching such as the doctrine of immortality as the survival of the entire human consciousness. But can this doctrine really survive within his framework?</p>
<p>In place of the soul, Teilhard argues that it is “radial energy” that draws the organism to ever greater levels of complexity and which also survives death. For Teilhard, this scientific soul has evolved out of the primeval stuff of the universe and was not created ex nihilo by God. It develops through complexification until it becomes the self-reflective soul/radial energy of man. At death this energy rises upward carrying its “incommunicable load of consciousness.”</p>
<p>It is clear that Teilhard has now abandoned all pretence of scientific rigour and has entered the realm of the metaphysical. For if consciousness depends on the material complexity of the body, how can it survive the death of the organism that produces it? In traditional teaching the body is made for the soul but the soul is not derived from the body. St Thomas Aquinas explains “The intellect is a faculty of the soul and the soul is the form of the body.” But intellect does not correspond to any bodily organ in the way that sight obviously relates to the eyes.</p>
<p>Thus, whilst the soul may be a weaker entity without the body, there is no reason that the intellectual part of the soul should not survive. This is true in most religious traditions. These traditions may be based on revelation or the pronouncements of mystics but they have an undeniable logic. The soul survives because it is perfectly simple and not because of its complexity!</p>
<p>The idea of immortality does not fit so neatly into Teilhard’s theories.</p>
<p>The author makes the point that outside of his own field (palaeontology) Teilhard’s “scientific” theories have received a mixed reception in the scientific community. He has been most warmly received in so-called theological circles and amongst thinkers such as Julian Huxley who introduced his work to the English-speaking world. He has been charged with self-contradiction and the overuse of metaphor which should obviously be used sparingly in scientific treatises mainly concerned with empirical verification of observable phenomena.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the hint of despair in the voice of the author who notes that:</p>
<p>“To the admiring multitude the Teilhardian pronouncements have become oracles of Science; and the more flagrantly far-fetched, the more earth-shaking do these pronouncements appear.”</p>

			 by Alex Bornstein 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>On November 6, 2019, the Electric Coin Company (ECC) signed an <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Trademark-Agreement-ZF_ECC_notarized-pages-and-signed.pdf">agreement</a> with the Zcash Foundation (“ZF” or “Foundation”) to donate the worldwide trademark rights for registered Zcash logos and word marks. This donation is subject to a number of ongoing enforcement and performance obligations that ZF must undertake and maintain in order to remain in compliance with the agreement. The obligations include:</p><p>“Foundation will have the right, at its own expense, to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the trademark applications and registrations included in the Trademark Rights and the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of any new or additional U.S. and non-U.S. trademark applications and registrations for the Trademark Rights […] and agrees to take such actions as are necessary to […] maintain in good standing all trademark registrations”</p><p>In addition to the registration and enforcement requirements in the ECC/ZF agreement, ZF must also comply with trademark laws and regulations in fifteen countries/jurisdictions (including the European Union as one entity), with more likely to follow in the future. This is a significant undertaking by ZF as trademark related activities require both external and internal resources in order to ensure proper enforcement and maintenance of the registered marks.&nbsp;</p><p>Why is trademark enforcement important? In addition to ZF’s required actions under the ECC donation agreement and required actions under all registration jurisdictions, enforcement is important in order to:</p>  Identify official sources of information, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent or incorrect information.  Identify official apps and services, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent activities.  Protect the reputation of Zcash, its associated entities, and the Zcash community.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>How does ZF monitor trademark usage and how is enforcement initiated? ZF utilizes a multi-faceted approach:</p>  We work with multiple trademark lawyers to inform and lead our worldwide registration and enforcement efforts. These efforts include monitoring trademark registrars worldwide to ensure we are disputing potential infringements as early in the registration or renewal processes as possible.  We subscribe to multiple “watch services” that monitor apps, social media usernames, domain name registrations, and other online services. When a trademark violation is identified, we take immediate action to notify the offending party and resolve the violation.   <p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of our enforcement partners identifies Zcash trademark violations with a focus on social media and apps. Through only this one partner, since November 2021, we have flagged 793 incidents and we have successfully enforced 602 infringements, with 78 enforcements currently pending. In addition, we have 8 “major” incidents underway (which may include URLs, apps, social media, and/or trademark registrations) in cooperation with law firms in six countries.</p><p>Enforcement actions can be lengthy (and costly) processes with opportunities for both ZF and the alleged offender to respond and counter-respond multiple times prior to a final resolution.</p><p>ZF will include trademark action tracking statistics, beginning with the Q1 2023 report, to further increase transparency related to our trademark enforcement actions and progress.&nbsp;</p><p>What can you do to help keep current and future Zcash community members safe from scams and misinformation?</p>  Become familiar with ZF’s <a href="https://zfnd.org/trademark-policy/">trademark policy</a>.&nbsp;  If you create, or have created, a project that requires trademark usage approval and you haven’t requested approval yet, please do so <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BTlMl98PCJ8ZwPWDcNd4xprRHtjSbdCj5navaOuPjWY/viewform?edit_requested=true">via this form</a>.&nbsp;  If you create, or have created, a project that does not require trademark usage approval (because it is informational or otherwise isn’t required by the policy), please ensure your project is clearly marked as an unofficial source to avoid confusion.&nbsp;  Report suspected trademark violations <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uXLdYuSxCMuzk4HZULg-J78rrnOE0qey9P8rQHX_LVg/viewform?edit_requested=true">via this form</a>.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>ZF appreciates your assistance and cooperation as we strive to keep the Zcash community informed, safe from scams and misinformation, and presenting a unified and clear message across all online platforms.&nbsp;</p>

 Building games of imperfect information with Aztec’s Noir&nbsp;language <p>Noir was conceived of as an open-source, universal zero knowledge language. It was always meant to make the experience of developing in zero-knowledge much more accessible, by:</p>  having simple to read syntax that’s easy to reason&nbsp;about  abstracting away cryptographic concepts and security considerations  incorporating cryptographic libraries for commonly used crypto primitives  <p>So when we heard about the <a href="https://mach34.space/">Mach34</a> team and their work on BattleZips — a Battleship clone relying on zero-knowledge — we knew we had to work together.</p><p>We met the Mach34 team after they placed at the ETHDenver 2022 hackathon with a Circom-written version of the classic Hasbro game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a>.</p><p>Shortly after we released <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge-ff43f38d86d9">Noir</a>, they expressed interest in rewriting Battlezips, providing us feedback, and creating a tutorial series on writing zk circuits and programs in&nbsp;Noir.</p><blockquote>📺 Watch the BattleZips-Noir YouTube series&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25_FzjlG7ZU&amp;list=PLabpoAlaCBY3SM6xHmZCOhPHlmLB4EY6H&amp;ab_channel=AztecNetwork">here</a>.</blockquote><p>We provided them an Aztec Grant in late 2022, and they were off to the races, culminating in showcasing the Noir-powered Battlezips running in the browser at our sponsored game night at ETHDenver 2023.</p><blockquote>🚢 Play Battlezips <a href="https://battlezips.com/">in your&nbsp;browser</a>.</blockquote><p>Here’s an unabridged conversation with Mach34 on their experience building on Noir and what developers can expect building on the universal zk language.</p> A Noir-ish conversation with&nbsp;Mach34  Q: Tell us about BattleZips. How does the game use zero-knowledge cryptography? <blockquote>A: BattleZips is a zero-knowledge implementation of the popular board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a> that uses proofs to shield ship positions. While this is by no means an original idea for a zero-knowledge application, Battleships was chosen as it is a simple but complete example of integrating arbitrary business logic in zero knowledge circuits.</blockquote><blockquote>By settling zero knowledge proofs in smart contracts, we can create novel digital and economic interactions that make the existing role of Information Escrow by third parties obsolete. BattleZips helped us understand how to apply zero knowledge proofs, and we hope the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25_FzjlG7ZU&amp;list=PLabpoAlaCBY3SM6xHmZCOhPHlmLB4EY6H&amp;ab_channel=AztecNetwork">BattleZips-Noir course</a> gives you the same advantages!</blockquote> Q: What inspired you to start Mach 34 and develop BattleZips? Why explore&nbsp;Noir? <blockquote>A: BattleZips marked the beginning of our journey into zero-knowledge cryptography and expanded our horizon on where this technology could be applied in real world use&nbsp;cases.</blockquote><blockquote>This is one of the factors that lead us to creating Mach 34. Mach 34 is a Web3 and ZK Software Consultancy. We chose to focus on mastering the web3 tech stack for the sake of expertise rather than a specific application. This enables us to explore any industry ripe for decentralization, growing our overall experience with the enterprise of&nbsp;web3.</blockquote><blockquote>Corporations and governments alike habitually abuse the authoritative topology of web2 networks; as Web3/ ZK Consultants, we have the means and the desire to help innovators usurp centralized processes and give sovereignty in cyberspace back to the&nbsp;users.</blockquote><blockquote>It is crucial that we stay up to date with the latest trends in this fast developing space to ensure we provide superior expertise to clients. Our prior experience writing proofs demonstrated to us that there is a significant variation between the different tools that exist, how rapidly they can be applied to an engineering problem, and what they accomplish. This led us to explore Noir upon its official release and see how it differentiated itself from pre-existing alternatives.</blockquote> Q: How did you find the ease of usability of Noir compared to other zero-knowledge domain specific languages you’ve worked&nbsp;with? <blockquote>A: Prior to Noir we used the Circom language and the Halo 2 proving system written in Rust. Proceeding from a first look at the Noir documentation to writing circuits was a fairly quick and straightforward process.</blockquote><blockquote>We thought that Noir lived up to most of what it promised in its introductory <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge-ff43f38d86d9">medium post</a>. If one were to begin learning Noir without wanting to get bogged down in learning the inner workings of ZK and how circuits translate to proofs then they could certainly do so. It does a good job of abstracting away from the more complex aspects of the&nbsp;topic.</blockquote><blockquote>One thing that could improve the developer experience is ensuring that the nargo command-line tool and the Aztec NPM packages compile the same Noir version. This is an issue we ran into mid way through the development process that resulted in a refactor to ensure we could test our circuits with the Aztec NPM packages.</blockquote> Q: As a full-stack development shop, how has the process of incorporating zk-cryptography changed the way you approach software development projects? <blockquote>A: Our interest in zero-knowledge cryptography was one of the driving factors for starting Mach 34. Historically and to this day, one of the most sought after skills in the web3 space is the ability to write smart contracts.</blockquote><blockquote>Similarly as the past few years have shown, we believe enabling privacy and scalability in web3 applications is only going to become more and sought after and ultimately a necessity. In anticipation of this we have positioned ourselves at Mach 34 to have the skills and expertise necessary to help companies engineer ZK solutions.</blockquote> Q: What kind of impact do you think Noir and other zero-knowledge domain specific languages will have on the broader software development community? Where do you see the industry&nbsp;going? <blockquote>A: Noir and other ZK DSLs play a pivotal role in the proliferation of zero-knowledge cryptography by abstracting away from the underlying cryptographic principles.</blockquote><blockquote>As history shows, abstraction is absolutely necessary for any technology to become widely adopted. If engineers were never able to design high level programming languages from low-level opcodes then we would have far fewer and less effective software developers than we do&nbsp;today.</blockquote><blockquote>Once the complexity and thought is removed from the underlying components that make zero-knowledge cryptography possible in the first place, engineers have more time to think about applications that would benefit from ZK. It looks like we are about to enter an exciting phase where we will start to see more examples of the technology applied to real world use&nbsp;cases.</blockquote> Q: What advice would you give to developers who are interested in learning more about zero-knowledge cryptography and how to use it in their projects? <blockquote>A: This is definitely an exciting space to get involved in given it is still very much in its infancy. It is poised to solve issues related to privacy and scalability in public blockchains, as well as contexts out of web3 where there is currently a lack of much needed&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>This being said, resources for learning are still sparse and those that exist often have a technical complexity that can make them hard to digest. It can take quite a bit of patience and perseverance to become acclimated to this space but it is well worth the effort given that you are one of the individuals pioneering the ecosystem.</blockquote><blockquote>If you are a developer that has an interest in getting started in ZK then I think reading some high-level introductory materials would be a good starting&nbsp;point.</blockquote><blockquote>After a basic understanding is gained on the topic then exploring a DSL like Circom or Noir to write a simple circuit would be a beneficial next&nbsp;step.</blockquote><blockquote>Once it becomes clearer to you what can be accomplished and what tools are at your disposal then really the limit is what you can ideate. The cool thing is that there is still so much room for novel innovation that it could very well be the case no one has thought of your idea yet. Don’t sit idle and wait for things to develop further! Now is a great time to jump&nbsp;in!</blockquote> Q: Are there any upcoming projects at Mach 34 that you can share with us that utilize zero-knowledge cryptography or other cutting-edge technologies? <blockquote>A: Mach 34 has been researching and working towards constructing a “Zero-Knowledge State Channel”. While rollups offer fantastic scalability, we were put off by the need for a sequencer. Furthermore, aside from Aztec Connect and a few others, ZK Rollups do not have any private state. Thus, we began to explore how state channels might be repurposed with zero knowledge.</blockquote><blockquote>To open a ZK State Channel, parties will agree on the terms of the execution (like a smart contract). The channel initialization dictates what steps can be taken next, and by whom. Rather than posting every transaction on-chain, a state object is recursively built off-chain.</blockquote><blockquote>While previous state channel constructions had optimistic trust assumptions, we can leverage ZK to perform verifiable computations that have instant, trustless finality. Once a state channel has reached an end condition, the entire state execution is notarized by posting the state channel proof on-chain for all nodes to verify in zero knowledge.</blockquote><blockquote>This final proof further employs zero knowledge to hide most of the intermediate state; only pre-determined derived metrics or public outputs are made publicly available on-chain.</blockquote><blockquote>This has many interesting use-cases; we plan to demonstrate how this construction is useful for credit scoring by adding ELO scores to the State Channel version of BattleZips. This provides a verifiable metric that scores the performance of an individual without revealing any of their in-game&nbsp;moves.</blockquote><blockquote>We envision countless use-cases for ZK State Channels across all segments of web3. Undoubtedly, there are use-cases that we haven’t thought of. For this reason, all of our work on ZK State Channels is free and open source. While we intend to utilize the infrastructure for profit, we want to make sure that all possibilities are explored in service of the best possible future for web3 developers and&nbsp;users.</blockquote> Q: What are some use cases you’re excited&nbsp;for? <blockquote>A: One area of exciting potential outside of blockchain is how zero-knowledge can transform personal identification.</blockquote><blockquote>When providing personal ID, the majority of the time more information is conveyed than necessary. Proving one is of a legal drinking age need only confirm the person is above 21 years of age, yet sharing the ID divulges information such as street address and&nbsp;name.</blockquote><blockquote>Using zero knowledge proofs conceivably one could prove they are at least 21 without having to provide additional information. Another example is having to provide a social security number in a KYC process. Leaking a SSN number can have catastrophic consequences so one would prefer this is done as infrequently as possible. With ZK proofs instead one could prove they bear a SSN number without needing to reveal exactly what theirs&nbsp;is.</blockquote> Explore the BattleZips project <p>We’re thrilled that the <a href="https://mach34.space">Mach34</a> team have done such a deep and candid dive into Noir’s capabilities, and their feedback has been invaluable.</p><p>For developers interested in building on Noir, check out their well-documented BattleZips repo.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/BattleZips/BattleZips">🚢 Explore the BattleZips Github repo and codebase</a>.</blockquote> Build on&nbsp;Noir <p>Interested in building zero-knowledge applications on Noir — or contributing to the open-source project?</p>  Get started in our docs&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">here</a>.

 The Ironic Bearishness of using VEIL as Cash 

<p></p>

<p>I and many others are long-time proponents of using both Veil and Bitcoin as cash. A discussion has arisen in the Veil community of people sponsoring developers working on specific development projects, although this is applicable to any Veil Project role.</p>

<p>One commented that as we are “Veiliens” we would surely prefer all remuneration to be done using Veil. This should communicate our preference for and support of Veil as a currency, and certainly it is superior as a privacy coin, but there are some factors that unexpectedly, or ironically, as some would put it, work the opposite!</p>

<p>Let’s suppose that we are paying a developer who has no other source of income, not even welfare. So we know that he has to pay for food or he will starve, and for computer resources too. While some might suppose that any Veil that gets sold for food must have been bought. Buying and selling pressure should cancel each other out, but this is not going to be the case.</p>

<p>Let’s consider that this Veil is not being bought at the exact same time as the same amounts are being sold, in fact, as a Veilien you already have a bag of it, but we also believe that Veil needs to recover 100 to 1000 times its current value, so we will consider the demand and supply and market sentiment dynamics as they are after a 99.9% drop in the value.</p>

<p>Certainly, if Veil had continued its rise in 2019 from its regular trading in the five to seven thousand satoshi range, with a little-known all time high of ten or twenty thousand sats, Veil would certainly be trading comfortably in the multi-dollar range. 20,000 satoshis today, at the time of writing is $5.63. Well, if you are prepared to pay someone 100,000 Veil for some work, valued at $338.20 today, with a Veil price of 12 sats (since increased before posting this article), knowing that those one hundred thousand Veil should be worth TWENTY BITCOIN, or USD$564,236.20, and with a $100,000 Bitcoin, TWO MILLION DOLLARS, you would not want to part with that Veil knowing that they will be DUMPED on the market and probably not even get the $300 dollars worth of work you are expecting!</p>

<p>We see therefore that the Veilien above, by allowing those 100,000 Veil to be dumped on a weak market is not only communicating that they don’t think Veil should regain its all time high, but his or her action will only further depress the market.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that no Veil team member is receiving 100,000 Veil in a month for their work. So, let’s consider the opposite approach. Paying with a currency that has established value and a highly liquid market. That might be Bitcoin itself, or if the sponsor and the sponsored developer live in the same country, it might be their shared national fiat currency.</p>

<p>Before that, let’s consider a managed approach to using Veil as an incentive. The sponsor has the Veil already, as should be expected for a Veilien believer, so he pays the developer, and at the same time places buy orders for the full amount that the developer will need to sell for his or her essential needs. However low the sponsor places his buy orders is the maximum extractable value that the developer can likely instantly gain from the market, BUT there might be other sellers, and the developer might not manage to sell all of the sponsorship before the sponsor’s BIDs are all taken. So, the sponsor needs to bid for a greater amount of Veil or the value transfer from the sponsor to the developer may fail. This has inefficiencies, as the sponsor has to budget more than the value the developer will gain from the transaction, and both will have to play the market, distracting both from developing Veil.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the fiat sponsorship approach, much as we instinctively abhor and avoid fiat currencies. Assuming the sponsor and the sponsored both are able to use the given fiat currency, not at all certain these days, so long as there are no transaction fees, and no interference from banking or government agencies, the full value of the sponsorship will be enjoyed by the beneficiary of that sponsorship, and they will be able to put their full efforts into the necessary developments they have been hired to do. At the same time, the sponsor, a faithful Veilien, can hold on to their (more) valuable (to them) Veil, to be used when the product of the development work has been able to make Veil more popular. Furthermore, the developer seeing how they are improving the ecosystem, may be motivated to budget some percentage of their earnings, from the sponsorship or from other income, into buying some Veil for themselves! This will be Veil that does not get dumped on the market.</p>

<p>Now, I’m still in favour of using Veil, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and so on, as cash, it is necessary, when you expect a long term price recovery, to replace any amount that has been used for spending, knowing that when you spend what was, and should once again be, ten thousand dollars, but only receive five hundred dollars of value for it, if you really believe that, you will replace it the same day, as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p>Please join our Veil community. We hope you become a “Veilien” and see the merit in sponsoring a developer for the RingCT staking project, or for other projects within the Veil ecosystem, or sponsor or become a marketer. Don’t be too shy to attach your business name to the sponsorship, for example: “Bill’s Bicycle Boutique, sponsor of Sato’s She, Veil RingCT staking developer!”</p>

<p>[ Please note that this approach assumes that the current coin price is as a result of a deep bear market. It is highly likely that the opposite approach would be most popular in the heights of a bull market, where anyone wants to get their hands on the currency as a high priority. ]</p>

      Partnering with Turnkey: Crypto Private Key Infrastructure        Sam, Bryce and Jack are giving builders the protections they deserve—with an accessible, self-serve API.  <p>By Alfred Lin</p><p>Published March 21, 2023</p>      



 
<p>Throughout the ups and downs of crypto financial markets, one thing has remained the same: builders are still building. The number of <a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report">active developers</a> contributing to open-source projects continues to climb, and is now more than 300% of what it was in 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the crypto developer stack takes shape, custody is, of course, a core pillar—but many custody products were originally designed to support buy-and-hold financial use cases, not the development of new products. While existing enterprise custody solutions are helping larger organizations scale, developers have their own unique set of circumstances, and in their search for self-serve solutions, too often encounter long sales cycles, large annual minimums, and delays in support for new chains and tokens. Many developers simply give up on the API dream and settle for integrating existing solutions that don’t fully meet their needs.</p>



<p>Sam McInvgale, Bryce Ferguson and Jack Kearney met while building Coinbase’s innovative Custody product, and have seen these challenges firsthand. They were determined to give developers the custody infrastructure necessary to make building in crypto easier. The result is <a href="https://www.turnkey.io/">Turnkey</a>, a private key management platform offering the same advanced security protections major financial institutions demand, but designed just for developers. Sam, Bryce, Jack and their team have built an accessible, easy to use, API-first product that helps users self-custody their crypto via secure enclaves, a deterministic operating system and a custom language for managing permissions. Developers can go from sign-up to signing a transaction in minutes, not months—and generate thousands of wallets programmatically across chains.</p>



<p>We first met the Turnkey team through Bryce, a Sequoia Scout whose passion for all things crypto we knew well. When he introduced us to Sam and Jack, we quickly realized this was a company with three co-founders who would each be backable on their own.&nbsp; They now are leading an expert team with years of experience securing billions of dollars of crypto across Coinbase, BitGo and Polychain. We are grateful for the opportunity to partner with them and lead Turnkey’s seed round.<br><br>Now, they are <a href="mailto:hello@turnkey.io">expanding that team</a> and launching a <a href="http://www.turnkey.io">closed beta</a> of their platform, and we encourage anyone building in crypto to give it a try. Today’s launch is an exciting step toward the future of the crypto developer stack, and we can’t wait to see how Turnkey empowers the next generation of builders.</p>

<p>March 21st, 2023 — We’re excited to announce that Brave’s new <a href="https://store.brave.com">Merch Store</a> is finally here! Our fully customized storefront is now the ultimate destination for official Brave and Basic Attention Token-branded merchandise.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>With a product range that prioritizes style, comfort, and easy-to-wear designs, the Brave Merch Store features a brand-new cozy zip-up fleece hoodie, luxuriously soft 100% cotton tees, and other never-before-seen items. We’re also bringing back well-loved fan favorites, including our knit beanies, embroidered Champion jackets, baseball hats, and stickers. Plus, we’ll introduce seasonal products on rotation, as well as limited edition designs from our Design Team, Brave Creator community, and BAT NFT Program collaborators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building our Merch Store from the ground up allows us to minimize the personal data we store on our servers and on your device, and create a solution that aligns with Brave’s core values of privacy, security, and user control. At present, the store integrates with <a href="https://www.printful.com/">Printful</a> for worldwide drop-shipping and <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for secure credit card payments. Key additions, including Web3 payment transaction support for BAT and other digital assets, Brave Wallet connectivity, digital collectibles, and order notifications are on the Merch Store roadmap. The Merch Store’s <a href="https://github.com/brave/store-brave-com">source code</a> is also open-source and fully auditable on GitHub and in scope for our <a href="https://hackerone.com/brave?type=team&amp;view_policy=true">security bug bounty program</a>.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of our new Merch Store, we’re offering an exclusive discount: From today until Monday, Mar 27, 2023 at 11:59 PM PDT, use the code LAUNCH20 at checkout to get 20% off your order. Take advantage of this opportunity to be among the first to score all-new Brave &amp; BAT merch!</p>

<p>Last night we streamed part four in our series “Flow Life,” focused on the rental housing venture launched last summer by Adam Neumann (WeWork) and Web3 venture capitalist Marc Andreessen (a16z). Part of the discussion featured a chapter from the 1973 book, “Emergent Man,” written by former NASA researcher Robert Smith, III. Smith described his proposal for an interplanetary space kibbutz, a project to be led by the United Nations. Adam Neumann has said that he imagined WeWork as a capitalist kibbutz.

      Partnering with Tavus: AI-Personalized Videos        In a video-first world, how do you create customized outreach that scales? Hassaan and Quinn are using AI to crack the code.  <p>By Stephanie Zhan</p><p>Published March 20, 2023</p>      



Tavus co-founders Hassaan Raza and Quinn Favret



 
<p>We live in a world where sales emails often seem too impersonal, where many marketing materials are filled with stock content, and where the efficacy of traditional performance marketing has declined severely. Audience engagement has become a scarce and valuable resource—and capturing attention has become an increasingly acute challenge. Customers want only the content most relevant to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tavus co-founders Hassaan Raza and Quinn Favret knew this pain all too well. By experimenting at their previous company, they discovered that personalized videos that touched on the specific needs and desires of each customer received far higher click-through and response rates compared to content meant for the masses. And so they labored away, creating hundreds of clips for their customers during overnight recording marathons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But they knew there had to be a better way. How could you build a workflow tool that would empower business professionals to create personalized videos, but without needing to manually record each and every one?</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">Tavus</a>: a platform that can build a personalized AI version of any sales or marketing professional. A rep starts by completing a 15-minute&nbsp; recording to train their personalized AI, then records a single template for each set of videos they want to create. Using a simple yet powerful text editor, designing individual videos for every customer is as easy as typing up a script, with unlimited variables for personalization to address their specific needs—and voilà! Tavus automatically creates clips with pixel-perfect videos of you that replicate your facial expressions and voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I first tried the product in late 2021, the night after meeting Hassaan and Quinn. It was in alpha at the time, but even then, it felt like magic. We were delighted to partner with them at the beginning of their journey, and to lead their seed round. They are a special pair, with vision, grit, customer obsession, and a creative lens through which to redefine the way sales and marketing should be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, just 18 months later, Tavus creates video on par in quality with anything you would create manually—and makes it a whole lot easier and faster! Even better, Tavus integrates into a company’s programmatic workflows: if a lead submits a form from your website, for example, they can automatically receive a customized Tavus video follow-up instead of a standard email. Already, these customers are seeing results—including 10x higher engagement and 300% increases in response rates, all while reps report saving 10+ hours per week.&nbsp;<br><br>AI is reshaping every industry, and sales and marketing tools are no exception. We’re excited to be working with the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tavus-io/jobs/">growing Tavus team</a> to supercharge the work of the next generation of sales and marketing professionals. Come check it out here: <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">tavus.io</a>.</p>

   Hester Peirce is one of five SEC Commissioners. She's been a Commissioner since 2018, with her term ending in 2025. Peirce, a previous podcast guest of Bankless, consistently makes first principles statements and is known to often dissent for her colleagues on crypto-related actions…we talk about that in today’s episode. These are a couple of many reasons why we enjoy her and her guidance so much.

<p>A letter from the labyrinth – Bristol, UK. Note the <a href="https://discoveringbristol.org.uk/browse/slavery/historic-site-quakers-burial-ground/">Quaker involvement</a> in the early slave trade as ship owners and financiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>March 18, 2023</p>
<p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>It’s Sea, from Bristol, UK. I thought I’d write and send a few links concerning developments around 4IR and smart cities from my corner of the labyrinth. Bristol is home base for the Merchant Venturers Society, the historic colonialist and technocratic chattel slave masters that operated the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The Merchant Venturers were major players in capitalism’s early technological development and&nbsp; the expansion of the British Empire.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They were also the appointed rulers of the city through the Royal Charter of King Edward in 1552. The charter is still in force to this day, though in the modern times they fob us off with one of their ‘democratic’ tentacles, the Bristol City council. The Merchants made headlines following the toppling of Edward Colston’s Statue a number of years ago. Local people pulled it down following demonstrations here in 2020.</p>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests</a>
<a href="https://www.merchantventurers.com/news/statement-from-the-society-of-merchant-venturers/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.merchantventurers.com/news/statement-from-the-society-of-merchant-venturers/">https://www.merchantventurers.com/news/statement-from-the-society-of-merchant-venturers/</a>
<p>Bristol was selected as a smart city testing ground back in 2014/15. I thought I’d send the links below, as you may be interested. It shows the big push from organisations inside and outside the city that are attempting to develop a framework and infrastructure for the future here. One recent development on the streets, a pilot to draw us in, is cashless payment e-tech skooters and e-bikes for rent. They are leaving this e-tech around all areas and neighbourhoods of the city. This is a test project/partnership between our local council and VOI, a company that’s involved in Bristol’s smart tech roll out.</p>
<a href="https://www.intelligenttransport.com/transport-news/141804/voi-technology-expands-e-scooter-operating-area-to-south-of-bristol/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.intelligenttransport.com/transport-news/141804/voi-technology-expands-e-scooter-operating-area-to-south-of-bristol/">https://www.intelligenttransport.com/transport-news/141804/voi-technology-expands-e-scooter-operating-area-to-south-of-bristol/</a>
<p><br>
Also homeless vendors I know for&nbsp; The Big Issue Charity (a homelessness charity and newspaper), were issued cashless payment devices during the COVID crisis. This paper prints articles in support of e-tech and has entered into charitable promotions with VOI, allegedly donating credits that people spend while using the companies e-bikes to the charity.&nbsp; The general narrative pushed around the tech by local authorities, political parties, and business concerns is that these projects are sustainable, ecological alternatives to conventional transport, with the adage to convince us, they are supporting charity.&nbsp;</p>
<a href="https://www.bigissue.com/life/money/more-big-issue-vendors-are-now-taking-contactless-payments/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/life/money/more-big-issue-vendors-are-now-taking-contactless-payments/">https://www.bigissue.com/life/money/more-big-issue-vendors-are-now-taking-contactless-payments/</a>
<p>It’s a bit weird seeing a once quite rebellious rural, working class city turning into a gentrified technological smart hub, in what is obviously a propaganda exercise for spreading future developments around this island and elsewhere. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a lot more going on in Bristol that can be found online, this city is one of the main testing grounds for 4IR and the promotion of smart cities. I hope this information is helpful. </p>
<p>Much respect,<br>
Sea</p>

Here are a few links related to the Merchants Venturers’ current and past roles within the city, as well as links related to smart city developments in Bristol:<br>

      Vijaye Raji Wants You to Think Impact        <p>By Paul Boutin</p><p>Photography: MERON MENGHISTAB</p><p>Published March 16, 2023</p>        After 20 years working with the powerful tools used inside Microsoft and Facebook, Statsig’s CEO is building versions that can help every company deliver measurable real-world results.      



 
<p>“It takes a special courage to say look, I understand where the data is going, but we’re going the other way,” Vijaye Raji tells me with contagious cheer. The statement might seem against Raji’s interests given that his startup, Statsig, founded in 2021, builds testing and validation tools designed to give organizations the rich real-world data they need to make product decisions.</p>



<p>The more you learn about Raji’s life, however, the more it makes sense that his product isn’t going to tell you what decisions to make. In a 20-year career, he’s learned to defy conventional wisdom and make his own decisions—most recently leaving a post leading thousands of engineers to found an 8-person startup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Sequoia partner Mike Vernal’s words, “Vijaye is the most impactful engineer that I’ve ever worked with. He’s incredibly pragmatic and punctual and just a get-shit-done kind of person. If I could have just one engineer on anything, that would be Vijaye.”</p>



<p>Raji is clearly confident but not overly eager to talk about himself. He’d rather explain at length that organizations often make decisions without the data they really need. Or they look at limited-scope data, which leads to short-term focus while missing the big picture. Or (there are so many ways to fail!) they’ll go overboard the other way and let the numbers decide everything against their better sense.</p>



<p>“Data is always optimizing locally,” he says. “Follow it and you’re climbing to the highest local ground. To get to much higher ground, you may need to go through a dip first.” Collecting data from a wider area, with more local details, is like getting the best possible map of uncharted waters ahead. “You need to have product sense and apply it to the data,” he cautions. But first, you need the data.</p>



<p>With Statsig, Raji wants to give other organizations the breadth and depth of data enjoyed by tech giants.&nbsp; He thinks this will let them make better decisions and choose new directions, informed by real-world data about their customers’ behavior.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Vijaye is the most impactful engineer that I’ve ever worked with.… If I could have just one engineer on anything, that would be Vijaye.”</p>
mike vernal</blockquote>



<p>As a boy in Puducherry, India, young Vijaye took an interest in programming at age 12. A computer was beyond his family’s budget, so he did his coding on a machine at the local library. Once, he convinced the librarian to lock him in overnight so he could pull an all-nighter.</p>



<p>Despite his enthusiasm for tech, Raji was cautious about leaving his family behind. When it came time for college, he attended nearby Pondicherry University rather than one of the top IT schools from which many Indian-born engineers in Silicon Valley have graduated. “I got into a bunch of colleges that were outside my town,” he says, “but I didn’t want to go far from family. My dad was working abroad, so my mom definitely loved for me to stay close. But it was a big decision—there are better colleges that I had to give up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time he graduated, Raji’s father had returned home. Vijaye felt OK to take a job 500 miles away in Hyderabad. Before long, Indian outsourcing giant Wipro tapped him to relocate to Finland for Nokia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having never traveled far, Vijaye says he had to learn a lot that others took for granted: “I had never flown on a plane before. I had to learn how to fasten my seat belt.” In Finland, he quickly learned that spicy food and a meat-free diet were still an anomaly at the time. Then there was Finland’s weather: “I moved there in spring, and when November came I didn’t know what hit me.” Puducherry, on the Bay of Bengal, rarely dips below 70 degrees in winter. Yet, he says, he enjoyed discovering new ways of living and came to appreciate them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After two winters in Finland, Raji got an offer from Microsoft in Seattle. Wipro was paying him $2,600 per year—good for India at the time—but Microsoft’s offer letter promised a $72,000 annual salary. The still unworldly Raji believed that, of course, the number was a ridiculous typo.</p>



<p>Once his friends had convinced him it wasn’t, he was all in to relocate halfway around the world for a company he admired. “I had learned to program on QBasic, and then Visual Basic and Visual C++, all thanks to Microsoft,” he says. “It was like a dream when I got that offer.”</p>



<p>He didn’t know it, but he would work for Microsoft for nearly a decade. He stayed longer than he’d have preferred, to avoid the risk of losing his visa should he leave. “I was stuck in green-card hell for 9.5 years,” he quips. “There was a running joke that the fastest way to get a green card was to get married, have a kid in the U.S., and when that kid is 18 years old, they can sponsor you for your green card.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not that he hated his job. Raji worked on critical projects including the Windows Application Framework, SQL Server Modeling Language, Microsoft TV and Visual Studio, which grew into the VS Code application that millions of programmers worldwide are using today. As a side project, he created the Small Basic programming language designed to appeal to beginners.</p>



<p>Four years in, he met local high-school teacher Ashley Lauren. When they eventually married in 2009, Ashley sponsored him for his green card, which he obtained a snappy three months later. He says now, “Microsoft wasn’t bad, but I was ready to go.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It was time for something new. For that, there’s nothing better or bigger than starting your own company and making it successful.” </p>
vijaye raji</blockquote>



<p>Sequoia partner Mike Vernal had worked at Microsoft in those same years and then moved to Facebook. When Raji, whom he hadn’t met, arrived at Facebook later, Vernal says other ex-Microsoft coworkers told him to pounce to get Vijaye on his team. What they didn’t tell Mike was to make sure he was early. At that point, Raji had no patience for people who don’t show up on time. He passed on joining Vernal’s group, but the two became friends over time.</p>



<p>Raji hadn’t planned to stay at Facebook a full decade either, but they kept promoting him. He joined Facebook’s Seattle campus when it was an office with a dozen people, and ended up leading the operation as it grew to 6,500 people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, he says, a startup seemed the one big thing he hadn’t done: “I’ve done engineering. I’ve done large orgs, I’ve made decisions on where to invest in real estate to house 20,000 planned Facebook employees in Seattle. I’ve done commerce, I’ve done ads, I’ve done gaming, I’ve done entertainment.</p>



<p>“It was time for something new. For that, there’s nothing better or bigger than starting your own company and making it successful. And what I’m doing now is data infrastructure, something completely different from everything I’ve worked on before.”</p>



<p>To be clear, both Raji and Vernal—who had left Facebook to become a partner at Sequoia—toyed with several startup ideas in the late 2010s. When they eventually converged in early 2019 on the idea for Statsig, Raji made plans to wrap up his role at Facebook, when he was still head of Facebook Seattle and also of Facebook Gaming.</p>



<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself—by then only two levels up on the org chart—pinged Raji on Messenger (they had chatted often) with a counter-offer: the head of the company’s Entertainment group was taking the place of another departing executive. To Zuckerberg, Vijaye seemed the obvious choice to step up from managing not only gaming but video, music, movies, sports and who knows what next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entertainment was a major part of Facebook’s future. Even Raji agreed it could be a tough year for Facebook if anyone else took the job. “Organizations are very resilient,” he says, “nothing ever breaks because somebody leaves… but, I felt a sense of obligation. I committed to another 18 months.”</p>



<p>Finally, nearly two years later in February 2021, Raji handed in his Facebook badge to start Statsig.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Raji says that what he experienced at Facebook was a builder-centric culture that most companies just don’t have from the top down. “Decisions were all data-driven,” he says. “No more debates in conference rooms. Products are built quickly, validated with testing, and the successful ones survive while the unsuccessful are discarded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook engineers can do this because the entire company uses the same set of infrastructure tools. It doesn’t just make work more efficient, it enables a cultural shift. Facebook engineers don’t measure themselves by ship goals—“I shipped two features this year”—but by performance results: “I shipped a feature that boosted engagement by 2.5 percent.”</p>



<p>Statsig is the latest of several companies like Honeycomb and <a href="https://www.scuba.io/">Scuba.io</a> that were founded by Facebook alumni looking to bring these tools and the culture they enable to as many other companies as possible—a chance to have an impact on the way software is built at any company, maybe even as an industry.</p>



<p>“So far, we’ve built our own versions of a half dozen of Facebook’s tools,” he says. “We’re adding more every few weeks.” For example, Statsig’s <a href="https://blog.statsig.com/introducing-pulse-b38f25790d09">Pulse</a> is a powerful tool for internal A/B testing based on Facebook’s Deltoid. It’s the kind of super tool that big companies like Uber and Spotify can afford to build for themselves, but most startups can’t. Raji is certain that Statsig will empower a foundational cultural shift among customers—from ship goals to metric goals. For non-engineers: It’s not what you build, but what’s your impact?</p>



<p>“What amazed me off the bat with Statsig was the strength and breadth of user-love that the team has garnered,” shares Dannie Herzberg, a Sequoia partner.&nbsp; “Join their Slack community and you’ll see prospects and customers from early-stage startups all the way to enterprise companies sharing their enthusiasm for the product and celebrating new features as they’re launched.”</p>



<p>For Raji and several Facebook colleagues who jumped ship to join him, starting Statsig meant suddenly downshifting to work with eight people instead of eighty thousand, having to learn the partner ecosystem, having to learn to manage a startup business P&amp;L, and so much else they’d been able to leave to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like most startup teams, they found this exhausting and also exhilarating. But as Statsig sailed off on its own, Raji looked back to Facebook’s shores and realized he’d missed the chance to take something valuable with him: “As the head of Entertainment I had access to the world-class sales team and world-class marketing team, and never once bothered to learn that. Now I kick myself: If only I could go back and spend quality time with the sales leaders, the marketing leaders, the business leaders. I had the opportunity.”</p>



 Delivering impact 



<p>Regrets aside, Raji has a track record of identifying projects and companies where he can have an impact on the outside world. What does he look for?</p>



 
 A unique perspective. A credible vision that isn’t shared by the majority. “If an idea and its value proposition is super-obvious to you, but not so obvious to others, that’s an idea worth exploring.” 



 A short time from plan to product. “The implementation of a minimum viable product should take weeks or months, not years. You don’t want to be developing in a vacuum for too long. Take it to potential customers as soon as possible.” Many startups have gone heads-down for nearly a year, only to emerge with a product that isn’t what the market wants at all. 



 VCs getting excited. “Venture capital investors have a broad line of sight into the market. They can quickly spot if something solves a real pain point.” Few ideas are 100% novel. They’ve seen similar ventures crash, so they perk up when they see one with an approach that could avoid known roadblocks. 
 



<p>Raji is indeed known for being reliably punctual, and impatient with those who aren’t. Contrary to popular tech-industry myth, you don’t win by simply working all waking hours, but by developing good time management. Vijaye keeps a well-honed startup parent schedule: A tightly managed workday, followed by never missing playtime with his children after office hours. Then, after they’re tucked in, you can count on him to respond to critical messages later in the evening.</p>



<p>More important, he says, is not letting your first win or two convince you that you’re always right. He’s seen successful people presume that they have superior insight and use their past success—coupled with either undeniable charisma or a bulldozer persona—to get their way contrary to evidence and objections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Statsig is meant to be a set of tools to keep that from happening, by letting more organizations develop a nimble culture of real-world testing and measurement to drive decisions. “A lot of companies debate the merits of ideas in a conference room,” he says. “Every idea has its merits. The way you understand which one’s working and which one’s not working is actually putting it out to the people that use the product. You don’t have heated debates. If the customers like it, the numbers go up. If they don’t, the numbers go down.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m never attached to a decision that I make,” he concludes. “If there’s new data or evidence that proves that I’m wrong … well, I’m wrong.”</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a revolutionary concept that is gaining traction in the world of digital identity management. In simple terms, SSI is a way for individuals to take control of their own digital identity and personal information, and use it to interact with the world around them. This has the potential to revolutionise many industries, including the travel industry.</p>



 The Benefits of Using SSI in the Travel Industry 



<p>In short, the benefits using SSI in the travel industry can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Travellers control their own personal information 



 Travel companies do not have to worry about storing sensitive personal data 



 The travel process is more streamlined 



 Identity can be verified more efficiently and securely 
 



<p>Let’s explore these benefits more in-depth below!</p>



 Streamlining the Travel Process 



<p>One of the biggest challenges facing the travel industry today is the need for passengers to provide a vast amount of personal information to various parties throughout the travel process. This information is often collected, stored, and shared in an unsecured and decentralised manner. This leads to vulnerability to security breaches and identity theft. And as shown by various research, <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/marriott-british-airways-and-easyjet-fail-on-data-security-with-hundreds-of-security-risks-exposed-by-which-a6a2q2L2YtdZ">many travel companies’ websites suffer from serious data security risks.</a></p>



<p>With SSI, individuals can create a digital identity that includes all of their personal information and documentation, such as passport and visa details. This digital identity can then be used to quickly and easily verify one’s identity with various organisations and services throughout the travel process, such as airlines, airports, and hotels.</p>



<p>This has several benefits for travellers. Firstly, it eliminates the need for passengers to carry physical copies of their documents, which can be lost, damaged, or stolen. Instead, passengers can access their documents digitally. This is done by using their self-sovereign identity, which provides a more secure and convenient way to verify one’s identity.</p>



<p>In addition, it reduces the time and effort required to provide personal information and documentation. It makes the overall experience smoother and more efficient. Finally, it allows travellers to have greater control over their personal data. They can choose which information to share with which organisations. Furthermore, they can revoke access to their digital identity at any time.</p>



 How SSI Helps Companies in the Travel industry 



<p>Another benefit of self-sovereign identity for companies in the travel industry is that it reduces their risks related to storing customer data. With traditional forms of identity verification, companies are often responsible for collecting, storing, and protecting large amounts of personal information about their customers. This can be a costly and time-consuming process. It also exposes companies to potential liabilities in the event of a security breach or data leak.</p>



<p>With self-sovereign identity, customers can securely and easily share only the necessary information with companies. Consequently, this reduces the amount of data that companies need to store and manage. This can help to reduce the risks and costs associated with managing customer data. It can also help to protect companies from potential liabilities.</p>



<p>Additionally, using self-sovereign identity can allow companies to build trust with their customers. It shows that they are committed to protecting personal information and providing a secure and convenient experience. As a result, self-sovereign identity can be a win-win for both companies and customers in the travel industry.</p>



 The Potential Downsides of Using SSI in the Travel Industry 



<p>Using self-sovereign identity in the travel industry has a lot of potential for both companies and travellers. One must know that there are also potential downsides and risks. Namely the following few:</p>



 
 Lack of adoption: Self-sovereign identity is a relatively new concept. It may take some time for it to be widely adopted by individuals and organisations in the travel industry. 



 Compatibility issues: Not all organisations and services in the travel industry may be able to accept self-sovereign identity as a form of verification. This could limit its usefulness for some travellers. 



 Potential for misuse: As with any technology, self-sovereign identity has the potential to be misused by individuals with malicious intent. For example, individuals could create false or fraudulent digital identities in order to access services or commit crimes. 



 Security concerns: While self-sovereign identity can provide a more secure way to verify one’s identity, it also introduces new security concerns, such as the need to protect digital identities from hacking and other forms of cyber attack. 



 User error: Self-sovereign identity relies on individuals to manage their own digital identities. Mistakes or errors made by users could potentially compromise the security of their personal information. 
 



<p>While these potential downsides and risks should be taken seriously and should be addressed adequately, traditional forms of identity (verification) suffer similar downsides and risks. And if implemented correctly while taking various precautions, self-sovereign identities will be able to provide a more efficient and secure way of handling your identity and personal information.</p>



 Introducing: A Self-Sovereign Identity Tool for Travellers 



<p>Zaisan offers tooling that is helping to make SSI a reality for travelers. A <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/identity/">self-sovereign identity platform</a> that allows individuals to create, manage, and share their digital identity in a secure and convenient manner. With this tooling, travellers can easily access and share their travel documents, such as passports and visas, with the relevant parties, making the travel process smoother and more efficient.</p>



 Conclusion: Self-Sovereign Identity is Poised to Transform the Travel Industry 



<p>In conclusion, self-sovereign identity has the potential to revolutionise the travel industry. It allows individuals to take control of their own digital identity and personal information. Despite the potential risks and downsides, SSI is looking to be a solid way to handle personal data. Web3 identity tools are helping to make this vision a reality, making it possible for travellers to securely and easily access and share their travel documents. As SSI becomes more widely adopted, the travel industry is sure to see significant benefits in terms of security, convenience, and efficiency.</p>

<p>Network Disruption Resolution</p><p>On March 11, 2023 the DERO network suffered a chain split due to issues with developer controlled seed nodes. These nodes act as an anchor for network participants to uniformly sync with the rest of the blockchain network. Since services have yet to be restored, the blockchain remains split, which includes a chain that is stuck (seed nodes) and a heavier chain that has more mining activity. Since DERO utilizes proof-of-work consensus and the absence of our seed nodes, all network participants are left to choose which chain to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Together with various esteemed members of our community, we have collectively decided to move forward with the heaviest chain as we continue to restore service to our seed nodes. Below, you will find instructions on how to get your node up and running by using community and foundation hosted public&nbsp;nodes.</p> UPDATE (3/19/2023): The DERO network is no longer reliant on seed nodes. <a href="https://github.com/deroproject/derohe/releases/tag/Release117">The latest release provides these updates</a>. The following solution is no longer required.  Remote Node (Wallets) <p>The default remote nodes are also down, so you will need to specify a node address when launching your CLI wallet. Instead of using the ‘- -remote’ argument, run your wallet with the following arguments:</p> ./dero-wallet-cli-linux-amd64 --daemon-address=node.derofoundation.org:11012 <blockquote>Or specify node.derofoundation.org:11012 in your connection settings when using&nbsp;Engram.</blockquote> Daemon (Node) <p>Run your daemon with the following arguments:</p><p>CLI</p> ./derod-linux-amd64 --add-priority-node=78.159.118.236:11011 --add-priority-node=209.58.186.186:11011 --add-priority-node=23.81.165.146:11011 --add-priority-node=85.17.52.28:11011  <a href="https://github.com/DEROFDN/netrunner">Netrunner</a>  ./netrunner --add-priority-node=78.159.118.236:11011 --add-priority-node=209.58.186.186:11011 --add-priority-node=23.81.165.146:11011 --add-priority-node=85.17.52.28:11011 <p>Alternatively, you can download the following files and place them in your mainnet&nbsp;folder:</p>  <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings/raw/branch/master/peers.json">peers.json</a>  <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings/raw/branch/master/ban_list.json">ban_list.json</a>  <p>You can right-click and “Save As” each file above, or visit the repo: <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings">https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings</a></p><blockquote>Please note: You may need to replace these files before each launch of your&nbsp;daemon.</blockquote><p>Below is a list of public nodes that are available:</p>  ams.derofoundation.org:11011  213.171.208.37:18089 (MySrvCloud)  5.161.123.196:11011 (MySrvCloud VA)  51.222.86.51:11011 (RabidMining Pool)  74.208.54.173:50404 (deronfts)  85.214.253.170:53387 (mmarcel-vps)  163.172.26.245:10505 (DeroStats)  44.198.24.170:20000 (pieswap)   Explorers   <a href="http://explorer.derofoundation.org">explorer.derofoundation.org</a>  <a href="https://explorer.deronfts.com">explorer.deronfts.com</a>  <a href="https://derostats.io">derostats.io</a>   Moving Forward <p>During this time, the decision has been made to keep exchange wallets in maintenance mode for the time being. We will send out further communication once we have an ETA of when they will become available.</p><p>We also aim to eventually remove the use of seed nodes in the future, but our young network and on-going development may require their usage for a bit longer. There are also plans to prevent such issues in the future, which will be provided at a later date. We were delighted to see solidarity win in the end and could not have done it without the help of our community.</p><p>We would like to take this time to thank the DERO community again for their efforts and patience during this&nbsp;time.</p> Privacy together. <p>—</p><p>Join the DERO community!</p><p><a href="https://forum.dero.io/">Forum</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/29GNSJ4">Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/DeroProjectGroup">Telegram</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DERO_Foundation">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeroProject/">Reddit</a></p><p><a href="https://dero.io/">Website</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/deroproject/dero-network-update-2def3c133f38">DERO Network Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/deroproject">DERO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As of close of U.S. banking operations Wednesday, March 15, we have cleared substantially all of the backlog of minting and redemption requests for USDC.<br><br>Since Monday morning, Circle has redeemed $3.8 billion USDC and minted $0.8 billion USDC.<br><br>The events of the past week have impacted the liquidity operations for USDC. Circle has worked tirelessly to re-initiate services with alternative banking partners, particularly payment and USDC redemption services. We would like to thank our customers for their patience during these unprecedented times.&nbsp;<br><br>On Tuesday, March 14, we went live with a new transaction banking partner for domestic U.S. wires in and out. Today, we went live with that same partner for international wires to and from 19 countries. We also went live today with an existing transaction banking partner for international wires. We expect to bring more capabilities back on line tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>We would like to extend our thanks to all the teams that have worked tirelessly around the clock with incredible professionalism to stand up these new services at unprecedented speed. We will continue efforts to add additional transaction banking partners.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/halborn-discovers-zero-day-impacting-dogecoin-and-280-networks">Halborn disclosed vulnerabilities in some code forks of Bitcoin Core</a>, which could be exploited to crash nodes. An attacker could potentially take advantage of these vulnerabilities to crash mining nodes, and thus reduce (by approximately 50%)&nbsp; the amount of hashpower required to mount a 51% attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash was one of the currencies affected by this disclosure, as zcashd is a code fork of Bitcoin Core. <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">ECC has released new versions of zcashd that remediate the vulnerabilities</a>. Anyone who runs a zcashd node should update immediately.</p>



<p>There is no evidence to suggest that these vulnerabilities have been exploited on the Zcash network, and there is no reason to suspect that the Zcash network is susceptible to a 51% attack (even if the required hashpower were reduced by 50%).&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra">Zebra</a> is an independent Zcash node implementation, and is not based on Bitcoin Core. Halborn has confirmed that Zebra is not vulnerable to these issues. However, we have taken the precaution of hardening certain sections of our codebase to make Zebra more resilient to similar memory exhaustion attacks.</p>



<p>We would like to express our gratitude to ECC for coordinating the Zcash ecosystem’s response to this security disclosure.&nbsp;We would also like to thank Halborn for responsibly disclosing these vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>Development of new privacy-enhanced zero-knowledge tech can revolutionise the identity industry by ensuring anonymity.</p><p>Austin, Texas, USA — Sunday, 12 March 2023: Today at South by Southwest 2023, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym</a>, the leader in network layer privacy, announced a new privacy-preserving zero-knowledge technology called zk-nyms at a <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2023/events/PP1143244">featured session</a> with CEO Harry Halpin and Chelsea Manning (famous whistle-blower and now-Security Consultant for&nbsp;Nym).</p><p>Combining the key attributes of zero-knowledge technology and anonymous credentials, zk-nyms allows users to selectively only reveal certain information about themselves, such as their nationality or age, to generate credentials. This prevents compromising additional unnecessary and sensitive personal data. Using the strength of cryptography, zk-nyms puts the power of this selective disclosure into the hands of users rather than large companies via decentralisation.</p><p>Harry Halpin, CEO of Nym Technologies, said, “Identity technologies run the risk of reducing us to a number in a database. Our new zk-nym technology puts the power to reveal your identity back in your own&nbsp;hands.”</p><p>The zk-nym technology works like a new kind of drivers license, except that when showing the license, only the parts needed for immediate purpose (for example, name, duration of validity and photo) are revealed while information that is not required is hidden (such as addresses or precise birthdate).</p><p>Unlike previous zk and identity schemes, zk-nym is decentralised and trustless. The zk-nym technology is based on prior work on what is called the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07344.pdf">Coconut signature scheme</a> and has now been extended by Nym researchers Ania Piotrowska and Alfredo Rial Duran. Coconut enables distributed issuance of anonymous credentials, meaning zk-nyms avoid a trusted centralised issuance authority.</p><p>“We analysed the security of zk-nyms and have proven that this technology offers strong user privacy protection. Moreover, we have extended zk-nyms to provide anonymous payment mechanisms that enable both on-line and off-line payments. Off-line payments allow service providers to verify and accept a payment without contacting any issuing authorities.” said Alfredo Rial Duran, Cryptographer, Nym R&amp;D&nbsp;team.</p><p>The first use case for zk-nyms is access credentials to the <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/">Nym mixnet</a>, ensuring a person can prove they have paid for and therefore have the right to use the digital service, without revealing name, wallet address or other sensitive information. Other use cases that are being developed include privacy preserving KYC process, e-cash and a general purpose single-sign on. In general, zk-nyms can be used to ensure privacy, while proving a person’s right to use a digital&nbsp;service.</p><p>The Nym team is releasing a sandbox for zk-nyms. The zk-nym technology represents a breakthrough in making privacy as easy as building a JSON object for programmers, where certain values can be easily hidden (or ‘shielded’) to prevent information leakage. As opposed to more complex zero-knowledge systems, it is meant to be easy for ordinary programmers to use and for people to understand as a list of attributes about themselves.</p><p>The core technology behind zk-nyms was previously demonstrated with various kinds of data including being used for proving COVID-19 vaccination status in a privacy-enhanced and decentralized manner with the support of the <a href="https://ledgerproject.eu/">European Commission via the LEDGER project</a>. Although the European Commission did not use the technology during COVID, zk-nyms represent a privacy-enhanced alternative to current plans in Europe to build centralised identity databases that could be used to track and surveil ordinary&nbsp;people.</p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Candice Teo, <a href="mailto:candice@nymtech.net">candice@nymtech.net</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-unveils-zero-knowledge-anonymous-credentials-zk-nyms-at-sxsw-6d56bd31802a">Press Release: Nym unveils zero-knowledge anonymous credentials, zk-nyms, at SXSW</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Releases 5.3.3 and 5.4.2 harden zcashd code and remediate vulnerabilities inherited from Bitcoin Core that may have affected more than 280 chains,<a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/halborn-discovers-zero-day-impacting-dogecoin-and-280-networks"> according to blockchain security firm Halborn</a>.</p>



<p>We have no evidence that an exploit has occurred on the Zcash network, and these bugs do not compromise user privacy or impact Zcash supply. As always, if you notice any unusual activity in your node, please report it to security@z.cash.</p>



<p>All Zcash node operators on 5.3.1 or 5.3.2 should update to <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.3.3">5.3.3</a> immediately, and all Zcash node operators on 5.4.0 or 5.4.1 should update to <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.4.2">5.4.2</a> immediately. <a href="https://z.cash/download/">Prebuilt binaries and Debian packages</a> will be available in the next few hours.</p>



<p>The vulnerabilities, discovered by Halborn in a 2022 audit of Dogecoin, were first disclosed to ECC and contributors to other affected networks on Feb. 14, and more details were relayed in a Feb. 17 call. ECC initiated our security process immediately and began coordinating with ZecSec.com, the independent Zcash-community-funded security team, and with Zcash Foundation, who analyzed the impact on zebrad, its own implementation of a Zcash node. We also reached out to Horizen, Komodo, and other teams with whom we have disclosure agreements.</p>



<p>Within days, we had zcashd patches ready for third-party testing, but the public releases have been delayed to allow other projects time to complete their own remediations and to allow for coordinated comms, given the sensitive nature.</p>



<p>Halborn found that the bugs could allow an attacker to utilize peer-to-peer network messages to fill the memory of a node and crash it. By crashing other people’s mining nodes, an attacker could potentially reduce, by around one half, the amount of hashpower they would need to mount a 51% attack on the Zcash network. A successful 51% attack could potentially be used to execute a double-spend attack, which could result in users who received transactions from the attackers losing their funds. We have no reason to believe that the Zcash network is currently vulnerable to a 51% attack — with or without the “one half discount” on the attack cost — but out of an abundance of caution, we’ve hardened the zcashd nodes so that they cannot be crashed using this bug.</p>



<p>ECC has a record of fast, coordinated responses to incidents like this and is well-known for delivering safe and secure technology for Zcash users and other privacy-minded projects. For our latest news and product updates, please follow @electriccoinco on Twitter.</p>

 A giant leap toward a fully programmable encrypted zkRollup <p>Today we’re announcing the sunset of Aztec Connect, our privacy infrastructure that served as the encryption layer for Ethereum.</p><p>One week from today, deposits into the Aztec Connect contract both from <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> and other front-ends like <a href="https://zkpay.finance/">zkpay.finance</a> will be disabled.</p><p>Users will continue being able to withdraw with no fees for one&nbsp;year.</p><p>Our sequencer will slowly reduce the frequency of rollup blocks for withdrawal, with a final sunset date approximately one year from now: March 21st, 2024. Here are the critical&nbsp;dates:</p>  13th — 21st March: Aztec Connect normal functionality  21st March 2023 at 2PM UTC: Deposits&nbsp;disabled  One-year withdrawal window (March 13th, 2023 — March 21st,&nbsp;2024)  March 21st, 2024: Last Aztec rollup sent from Aztec sequencer  March 21st, 2024 onwards: users will have to run withdrawal software or rely on community-run sequencers  <blockquote>▶️ Head to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> today to begin withdrawing funds.<br>▶ View withdrawal instructions <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> What’s Next <p>As of March 21st, 2024–approximately one year from now–Aztec will no longer run a sequencer. That means the current system will no longer publish rollup blocks processing Aztec Connect transactions, contract permissions will be renounced, and all rollup functionality will be&nbsp;ceased.</p><p>At that point, withdrawals will be highly technical. While we remain optimistic that a community-operated sequencer will be functional, everyday users will have to rely on that infrastructure or run their own sequencers to withdraw.</p><p>Thus, while withdrawals will always be possible, they will become significantly more burdensome after March 21st, 2024. We therefore recommend users withdraw funds as soon as possible.</p><blockquote>▶️ Head to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> today to begin withdrawing funds.<br>▶ View withdrawal instructions <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> Open sourcing Aztec&nbsp;Connect <p>As of today, Aztec has fully open sourced the entire Aztec Connect protocol complete with scaling upgrades and a new secure&nbsp;SDK.</p><blockquote>▶️ See the open source Aztec Connect repo&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect">here</a>.</blockquote><p>We encourage the Aztec community to fork, deploy, and operate a new version of the system. We’d love to see an independently-operated Aztec Connect and are ready to fund it. Head to our open-source repo and docs to learn more about running an Aztec Connect&nbsp;fork.</p><p>The second wave of our grants program is coming up in April, and we look forward to funding community-run infrastructure then. In the meantime, keep in touch on our <a href="http://twitter.com/aztecnetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://discord.gg/aztec">Discord&nbsp;server</a>.</p> Aztec’s Vision <p>At Aztec, our goal has always been to develop a truly decentralized general-purpose encrypted zkRollup with the security of Ethereum.</p><p>While Ethereum has created a world computer that can read and write to public state, Aztec aims to fulfill the vision by adding the ability to read and write to private&nbsp;state.</p><p>In our mission to achieve that vision, we’ve taken a step-wise, incremental approach to the development of encrypted transactions on Ethereum.</p><p>The first attempt at on-chain privacy using a zkRollup was Aztec 1. Aztec 1 was slow, inefficient, costly, and limited in its functionality to basic private transfers.</p><p>Our latest effort was a set of privacy infrastructure and tools for Ethereum called Aztec Connect. It not only extended privacy functionality on Ethereum beyond simple payments and toward arbitrary smart contract interactions, it hinted at the cost savings that encrypted rollups are ultimately able to achieve through transaction batching.</p><p>Aztec Connect was a critical step in our mission to build a fully programmable encrypted zkRollup. Not only did it provide critical feedback, it proved to us the battle-worthiness of our sequencer and rollup contracts.</p><p>The immense research invested into Aztec Connect will be usable and indeed critical to the development of our next-gen product. Having an encrypted rollup live and in production gives us confidence in our shift to focusing on a fully programmable version.</p> The Future is&nbsp;Noir <p>As we move forward, our mid- and long-term focus will be solely directed towards the development of two major products, which are mutually compatible and interlinked:</p>  Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge  Our next-generation encrypted zkRollup  <p>Noir continues to gain new features by the day, with the Noir tooling team publishing regular releases. We are convinced Noir is the simplest, most powerful way to write programs in zero-knowledge.</p><blockquote>▶️ <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">Install Noir today</a> and go from 0 to programming in zkSNARKs in less than an&nbsp;hour.</blockquote><p>With additional resources at their disposal, the Noir team will only grow its functionality. Not only is Noir useful today as a generalized programming language for zk development — capable of using multiple proving backends and verifying to any EVM chain — a modified version of Noir will be the smart contract language for Aztec’s next-gen zkRollup.</p><p>Expect more Noir features and a full set of specifications for our newest zkRollup in the first half of 2023. To learn more about our next-gen system, check out our&nbsp;docs.</p><blockquote>Learn more about the next generation Aztec protocol&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec3">here</a>.</blockquote> Onward <p>The Aztec community has been a vital part of the development and success of Aztec Connect, and we are incredibly grateful for the 100,000+ users who have used Aztec Connect for private DeFi. It has long been obvious that privacy in a blockchain context is an absolute necessity, and Aztec Connect further validated that&nbsp;thesis.</p><p>It’s undeniable that Aztec Connect was an important stepping stone towards realizing our ultimate goal. It’s now time for us to focus fully on that goal: a decentralized general-use encrypted zkRollup.</p><p>To all our partners: thank you for betting on Aztec. We’re excited to bring you a fully-featured Noir and local devnet for our next-gen network by the end of 2023.&nbsp;Onward!</p> Frequently Asked Questions <p>Q: How do I withdraw&nbsp;funds?</p><blockquote>A: Navigate to <a href="https://zk.money">zk.money</a> or your preferred front-end. View withdrawal instructions for <a href="https://zk.money">zk.money</a> here: <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset</a></blockquote><p>Q: Is Aztec done building privacy products?</p><blockquote>A: Not even close. We’re laser-focused on building more Noir features and bringing you a programmably private L2 to be announced in the first half of&nbsp;2023.</blockquote><p>Q: Is Aztec shutting&nbsp;down?</p><blockquote>A: Nope. Our team has raised <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-raises-100-million-to-build-encrypted-ethereum-dd5062ba949c">over $125 million</a> from investors like a16z and Paradigm to bring encryption to blockchain. Our team is over 40 strong and we’re still hiring aggressively for open roles. <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec?gh_src=935e32f2teu">Join&nbsp;us</a>!</blockquote><p>Q: Is Aztec building an&nbsp;L1?</p><blockquote>A: No — we are utilizing the same rollup technology used in Aztec Connect in a new encrypted L2 powered by Noir, our universal zk language.</blockquote><p>Q: Why are you sunsetting Aztec&nbsp;Connect?</p><blockquote>A: We simply are not able to commit sufficient resources to simultaneously support Aztec Connect and the development of an encrypted zkRollup. Not only are we in the midst of inventing a groundbreaking new proving system, we are building a network with significantly higher complexity than Aztec&nbsp;Connect.</blockquote><p>Q: Are you sunsetting Aztec Connect due to regulatory pressures?</p><blockquote>A: No. We were under no regulatory pressure nor have we fielded any inquiries from law enforcement. Aztec Connect is and was compliant with UK law, given Aztec is a UK&nbsp;company.</blockquote><blockquote>We believe the practical enforcement measures we implemented <a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork/status/1560710567249096704">last August</a> have deterred illicit activity on the rollup without materially restricting users.</blockquote><blockquote>Rest assured our next-gen product will have higher programmability, more functionality, and the same or stronger privacy guarantees than Aztec&nbsp;Connect.</blockquote> Join the Aztec Community <p>We’re always on the lookout for talented engineers and applied cryptographers.

<p>Brave Firewall + VPN, powered by Guardian, is now available on desktop with the recent 1.49 version of the browser, completing Brave’s already available Android and iOS VPN offerings so users can benefit from full cross-platform protection.</p>
<p>The desktop VPN will be rolled out in various regions over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today. The desktop VPN also includes cross-device support, which enables users to connect five devices to one VPN subscription, regardless of platform.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 Affordable cross-device subscription 
<p>Today, almost everyone uses the Internet on more than one device (like your laptop at home, and your phone on the go). Brave’s new cross-device VPN subscription model lets you connect and protect five devices—across Android and iOS, macOS and Windows—to one subscription. Brave’s Firewall + VPN service is available for $9.99/month, or $99.99/year (annual plans for desktop purchases are coming soon). With five supported devices per account, you can protect each device for less than $2 a month.</p>
<p>The Brave browser blocks ads and trackers on every webpage, keeping you much safer while you browse; the Brave Firewall + VPN blocks trackers in every app on your phone, even outside the Brave browser.</p>

 Already using Brave Firewall + VPN on your mobile device? 
<p>If you already have a Brave Firewall + VPN subscription on your Android or iOS devices, visit the VPN section of the Brave browser settings. This will take you to <a href="https://account.brave.com/">account.brave.com</a>, where you can manage your subscription and automatically link more mobile or desktop devices.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 How to get started with Brave VPN on mobile or desktop 
<p>We’ve made the setup process for Brave Firewall + VPN as simple as possible. Don’t worry about downloading any extra apps; simply open the settings menu in the Brave browser on desktop or mobile, and toggle on VPN. You’ll then be taken to account.brave.com, where you can easily complete the setup.</p>
<p>Brave Firewall + VPN is the easiest way to protect all your devices—and all your apps—directly from the browser.</p>

 Brave-level protection, even outside the Brave browser 
<p>Brave browser puts your privacy first by blocking ads, trackers, cookies, scripts, and more while you browse the Web. Brave Firewall + VPN is a premium service that goes even further by enabling you to:</p>
 
 Mask your IP address 
 Change your location online 
 Prevent your ISP from snooping on your activity 
 Access your favorite content no matter where you are 
 Protect your Internet traffic on apps outside the Brave browser 
 
<p>Brave Firewall + VPN, powered by Guardian, extends all the protection you expect from Brave outside of the browser on Android, iOS, and macOS (and Windows, <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/11973307463181">with an added workaround</a>). That means giving you network-level protection against unwanted surveillance on the apps you use, across all your devices. Guardian is a leading Firewall + VPN technology platform that was recently acquired by DNSFilter.</p>
<p>Note that iOS and Android users can use our integrated <a>Privacy Hub</a> (a feature coming soon to desktop as well) to check exactly which trackers are blocked, including outside of Brave. The Privacy Hub highlights risky pages and trackers, and ties those trackers to the tech companies and publishers behind them, showing users how often sites try to invade their privacy.</p>

 Your privacy and anonymity guaranteed 
<p>When choosing a VPN, you’re trusting the provider with your data. Brave’s VPN service is powered by Guardian, stores no log files, and uses no cookies. We can’t store any of your connection or browsing data, because we don’t collect any of it in the first place.</p>
<p>We’ve also implemented an onboarding process that enables you to sign up for Brave Firewall + VPN using only an email address and payment information.</p>
<p>Once you sign up, you’re issued unlinkable daily tokens that validate your subscription when using the VPN. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of the VPN, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>

 Protect yourself from ISPs 
<p>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are the backbone of Internet connectivity; virtually all Internet traffic passes through them. This puts many of them (depending on their jurisdiction) in a position where they could easily collect and sell user data; in fact, various ISPs sell this data to advertising brokers to build a more comprehensive ad profile of the user. Because they have privileged access to user Internet traffic, they can even monitor your activity and slow down your Internet connection speeds as they see fit. But with Brave Firewall + VPN, you can easily mask your IP address and cloak your Internet activity, even from the prying eyes of ISPs.</p>

 More online freedom 
<p>While traveling abroad, you might find that your favorite sites or news outlets no longer work. That’s due to geo-restrictions that prevent certain sites and apps from being accessible from certain locations. With Brave Firewall + VPN, you can connect to the Web from local servers around the world, making it appear like that’s where your traffic is originating. This enables you to bypass geo-restrictions in the browser and access your favorite content no matter where you are.</p>

 Added firewall protection 
<p>A VPN is great for encrypting your internet traffic, but it can’t block harmful trackers and other online nuisances. That’s where a firewall comes in. Most standard, free, and even other premium VPNs don’t include a firewall—which serves as a secure barrier between your device and the Internet. It blocks unwanted trackers, harmful traffic, and other malicious things from ever reaching your phone, tablet, or computer.</p>
<p>How does it work? Brave’s built-in firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing flows of data based on a set of rules. So if an app is secretly broadcasting tracking data, Brave Firewall + VPN will detect and block the offending activity while still ensuring the app functions normally.</p>

 Try Brave Firewall + VPN today 
<p>Ready to protect your Internet traffic across all your devices? You can try Brave Firewall + VPN  with a free 7-day trial. To do so on your desktop device, open the Brave browser and click the new VPN icon in the browser address bar. Or, when using the Brave browser on your phone, go to the Settings menu, and toggle Brave Firewall + VPN to on. (If you don’t see this option, update to the latest version of Brave on your device.) It’s the safest, easiest way to protect yourself online, on every app, on every device.</p>

<p>With the upcoming launch of Polygon's zkEVM mainnet, L2s are undoubtedly a huge narrative that is unfolding in 2023. It is time to take a step back and recognise the incredible amount of effort that has gone into researching and building L2 scaling solutions in general and zk rollups in particular. Tech-wise, we barely scratched the surface of general purpose processors that can handle zk circuits, so there is still tremendous room to grow. As layer 2s become more efficient, so will the applications that are dependent on blockchain throughput.</p><p>We were joined by Jordi Baylina (tech lead) &amp; David Schwartz (CTO) from Polygon's zkEVM, to discuss the different milestones &amp; challenges they had to overcome in designing a zk rollup, from circuits to mainnet.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jordi’s &amp; David’s backgrounds  The idea behind Hermez Network  zkEVM scaling &amp; validity proofs  How different ZK rollup models function  What challenges zkEVM encountered during development  Evolutionary pathways in the realm of ZKPs  Auditing zkEVM  Trusted setup requirement for zkEVM  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jbaylina">Jordi Baylina on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsrz">David Schwartz on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonZK">Polygon zkEVM on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

<p>Starting today, Brave Wallet users in select countries will see a new option to sell crypto into fiat currencies, including US dollars, euros, and pound sterling.</p>
<p>In May 2022, Brave <a>announced</a> a partnership with <a href="https://ramp.network/">Ramp</a> that enabled Brave Wallet users to buy crypto with fiat currency—or “on-ramp”—in Brave Wallet, the Web3 wallet natively-integrated into the Brave browser.</p>
<p>This week, with v1.49 of the desktop browser, we’re delighted to announce the expansion of that partnership: Brave Wallet users can now sell crypto for fiat—or “off-ramp”—with Ramp as well. Users now have the option to both move in and out of crypto entirely through their self-custody wallet, rather than through centralized exchanges that hold custody of users’ assets. With Ramp’s on- and off-ramping services integrated into Brave Wallet, users no longer need to relinquish ownership of their crypto to transact.</p>
<p>After recent events where centralized exchanges mishandled customer funds, it’s more important than ever to offer secure and easy-to-manage self-custody. Before the creation of Bitcoin and the ensuing emergence of Web3 technologies, self-custody wasn’t a common word in most people’s vocabulary. While self-custody has grown in popularity over the past decade, the most common way to hold digital currency and tokens remains with centralized exchanges. We expect to see that shift with innovations in user-experience, like the one we are releasing today.</p>
<p>Off-ramp is available for over <a href="https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/432-what-cryptoassets-does-ramp-support#h_04e4875f6a">38 currencies</a> including Solana, Ethereum, USDC and BAT. For a running list of supported payout methods, see <a href="https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/8992-what-payout-methods-does-ramp-support-for-selling-crypto">their support page.</a></p>

 Using Ramp to sell crypto in Brave Wallet 


    
    

    


    


    
    

 
 
<p>Open the expanded Brave Wallet screen in Brave. This can be done either by clicking the wallet icon in the top right of your browser, or by visiting brave://wallet in the URL bar.</p>
 
 
<p>From the main portfolio page, click the asset you want to sell.</p>
 
 
<p>If the asset is available to off-ramp, you’ll see a Sell button among the list of accounts that hold that asset.</p>
 
 
<p>Click Sell and enter the amount you wish to off-ramp.</p>
 
 
<p>Click Sell with Ramp once you’re ready, and proceed to Ramp’s site to complete the process.</p>

 The humble beginning <p>At Privy, we are building the simplest way to onboard all your users to web3, whether they are new to the space or tried-and-true experts. This means building a library that enables developers to <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3s-coming-of-age-c588af57c94d">meet users where they are</a>, and cater to diverse audiences whose product experiences grow with their engagement.</p><p>Privy’s <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3-for-users-not-experts-52c692c25bb1">embedded wallets</a> allow applications to create fully-functional Ethereum wallets on-demand without requiring users to leave the app. With this feature in place, we believe we are about to unlock a significant UX boost for the Web3 ecosystem!</p><p>The space itself is abuzz with changes that will profoundly shape UX, as threshold-based multi party computation matures, and smart contract wallet architectures (often called “account abstraction”) are standardized. While we are extremely excited about these evolutions and are working with partners to bring them into our own product, our core focus is enabling developers to build meaningful end-to-end solutions from day 1. To that end, we wanted this post to share some technical details on how embedded wallets got their&nbsp;start.</p> In the beginning, there was&nbsp;entropy <p>A wallet is born when 128 bits of entropy are chosen randomly by a CSPRNG. These bits are converted to a mnemonic via <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">BIP-39</a> which is used to derive the user’s wallet key&nbsp;pair.</p><p>While wallet software is many things, the entirety of the wallet can be reduced to these 128&nbsp;bits.</p><p>The choices are 128, 160, 192, 224, or 256 bits. These map to 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 word mnemonics. 128 was chosen for its simplicity. This will be configurable by integrating applications.</p> Sharing is&nbsp;caring <p>It’s critical the entropy (henceforth referred to as the mnemonic) is secured and only accessible by the end-user it belongs&nbsp;to.</p><p>Privy’s embedded wallets achieve this by deploying a Shamir Secret Sharing scheme where the mnemonic is split into N shares and can be recovered using M of N shares. In our implementation, three total shares are allocated, with two belonging to the end-user and one secured by Privy. This has two core advantages: Privy alone cannot reconstruct the mnemonic and access user keys, and the user can always access their keys without needing to go through&nbsp;Privy.</p> We value our&nbsp;clients <p>To protect users and remain non-custodial, mnemonics and other plaintext key material are never transmitted over networks or exposed to servers. Everything happens on the end-user’s device. Wallets are created on the end-user’s device. Shares are reconstructed on the end-user’s device. Requests are serviced on — you get&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thus, clients are responsible for protecting the user’s wallet. While the UI remains under control of integrating applications, we leverage headless iframes to create a sandboxed environment where keys can safely be used to service requests sent to the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Compatibility is&nbsp;key <p>We value interoperability and choice. Users must be able to take their wallet keys with them in the event they no longer wish to use&nbsp;Privy.</p><p>Like all modern wallets, embedded wallets are <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets</a> and adhere to the multi-account hierarchy specified in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">BIP-44</a>. This ensures compatibility across existing wallet software and thus enables users to switch clients at any time with the click of a&nbsp;button.</p> User experience is paramount <p>Private keys and mnemonics are not particularly human-friendly, especially for non-technical users. Therefore, it is imperative that Privy shield users from the technical underpinnings. To the extent possible, Privy creates a Web2-like experience with features your every day user would expect. Examples include social logins, cross-device support, and simple account recovery.</p><p>One feature to highlight here is enabling developers to craft human-readable messages for their users.

    <p>Horizen EON is our first public proof-of-stake sidechain and a fully EVM-compatible smart contracting platform that allows developers to efficiently build and deploy dapps on Horizen, while fully benefiting from the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p>In this step by step guide below, we will walk you through the process of creating an ERC-20 Token on Yuma Testnet – a temporary public testing environment for EON.&nbsp;</p>
 Tools used in this tutorial 
 
 <a href="https://matamask.io">MetaMask</a> 
 <a href="https://yuma-testnet-faucet.horizen.io/">Yuma test token faucet</a> 
 <a href="https://chainlist.org/?search=yuma&amp;testnets=true">Chainlist</a> 
 <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard">Open Zeppelin</a> 
 <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Remix</a> 
 <a href="https://yuma-explorer.horizen.io/">Yuma block explorer</a> 
 
<p>We assume you already have MetaMask installed on your browser for this tutorial. If you do not, you can <a href="https://metamask.io/download/">download MetaMask here.&nbsp;</a></p>
 STEP 1: Connect Yuma Testnet to MetaMask&nbsp; 
<p>You can easily<a href="https://chainlist.org/?search=yuma&amp;testnets=true"> connect Yuma Testnet to MetaMask through Chainlist.</a> Follow the instructions on the screen,&nbsp;Yuma Testnet should appear on your MetaMask:</p>
<p></p>
 STEP 2: Claim test token – TZEN 
<p>You’ll need TZEN as transaction fees to send your newly created tokens. You can get TZEN from the <a href="https://yuma-testnet-faucet.horizen.io/">Yuma test token faucet</a>. Copy and paste your Metamask address in the “Wallet Address” field on the faucet.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 STEP 3: Create your code on Open Zeppelin and create a new contract on Remix 
<p>Now we are ready to create your ERC-20 token! To do so, a simple way is via the <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard">Open Zeppelin wizard</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we are going to create a Javier Token in honor of our team member Manon’s #ZenCat Javier. Here is him supervising Manon.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Select the “ERC-20” tab&nbsp; 
 Complete the following fields:
 
 Name: think of a cool name for your token 
 Symbol: your token symbol 
 Premint: The amount of token you want to create 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 When you are done, click on “Open in Remix” and it will lead you to the Remix webpage 
 Rename your file according to the name of your token/ smart-contract 
 
<p></p>
 STEP 4: Deploy your smart contract on Yuma Testnet 
<p>To deploy on the Yuma testnet, first, make sure Yuma testnet is selected and connected on MetaMask</p>
 
 On Remix, go to “Deploy and run transactions” by clicking the Ethereum icon on the left&nbsp; 
 Select “Injected Provider – MetaMask”&nbsp; 
 Be sure that the address here matches your MetaMask address in the “ACCOUNT” field 
 
<p></p>
<p>Go on the Compiler and make sure that the “Enable Optimization” is checked</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-5.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Go back to “Deploy &amp; run transactions” and click “Compile” (The green play icon)<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-6.jpg"></a> 
 Click on “Deploy”  
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-7.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Click on “Confirm” on MetaMask 
 
<p></p>
 STEP 6: Verify your smart contract on the Yuma block explorer 
 
 On Remix, your contract should appear on the left. Click on “Copy” 
 
<p></p>
 
 Import your token on MetaMask
 
 Click on “import a token” 
 Paste the contract address 
 Click on “Add a custom token” 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 Go on the Yuma Explorer <a href="https://yuma-explorer.horizen.io/">https://yuma-explorer.horizen.io/</a> 
 Paste on the search bar and press “Enter” 
 Your contract should appear&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-11.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-12.jpg"></a></p>
 STEP 7: Flatten and publish 
 
 On Remix, go back in “File Explorer” 
 Use the right-click and select “flatten” 
 Click on the flattened contract 
 Copy the data on the right, you can select all with “Crtl+A” 
 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.05-AM-1.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Go back on the Yuma Explorer at your contract address and click on “Code” then on “Verify and Publish” 
 Select “Via flattened source code”, then click on “Next” 
 Make sure to have the same data on the Solidity Compiler, and the data that appears on the Yuma block explorer and paste the code on “Enter the Solidity Contract Code” 
 Make sure to enter the “Contract Name”. Here “Javier Token” 
 Click on Verify and Publish. Your code is now verified!&nbsp; 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.05-AM-2.jpg"></a></p>
<p></p>
 STEP 8: Send tokens 
 
 Go on MetaMask, to your newly created token, and click on “send” 
 Enter the address where you want to send your tokens to&nbsp; 
 Enter the amount and click on “Next” 
 Click on “Confirm” 
 The tokens are sent, and you can view them on the Yuma explorer! 
 
<p>The recipient may have to import your token in MetaMask. To do so, he must click on “import a token” and then paste the token contract address available on the Yuma explorer. (You can also send him the token contract address, the one you used to import the token on your MetaMask at the beginning of the tutorial)</p>

  Arc Founders on the Problems that Drive Them  <p>Four founders in the Spring ‘23 cohort of Arc, Sequoia’s pre-seed and seed-stage catalyst, share the ideas that brought us together.
</p>  <p>By Team Sequoia</p><p>Published March 9, 2023</p>  



 
<p>This week, we welcome a new cohort of 10 companies to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>—including one second-time applicant. These companies, the majority of which are in stealth, span a variety of industries including health tech, fintech, crypto, AI and more. We asked a few of the founders to share their thoughts on the problems they’re solving, and what drives them and their teams.</p>



 



<p>What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important?</p>



<p>Devin Bhushan, <a href="https://www.squint.ai/">Squint</a>: In industries like manufacturing, a lot of training is done one-on-one or with outdated manuals—people have to navigate multiple sources of information just to get the job done. It’s a slow and frustrating process, and it can undermine productivity and safety. Squint is a mobile app that uses computer vision techniques and augmented reality to help workers quickly map machines and complex processes, to create seamless guides that show the right thing at the right time.</p>



<p>Colin Dunn, <a href="http://visualelectric.ai">Visual Electric</a>: We created Visual Electric because we wanted to make design more accessible by giving people better-designed tools. Artists and designers still get a familiar, moodboard-like environment—but it’s powered by AI, so they can combine inspiration images with text prompts for tasks like “landing page” or “brand.” From there, they can remix and refine to create new concepts.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessechor/">Jesse Chor</a>, Tanda: People who are early in their financial security journey may not have access to—or trust in—traditional banking. They need tools to help them save money, build credit and grow their community. Tanda is a social savings app based on the concept of ROSCA, or Rotating Savings and Credit Association, which is popular around the world. Group members deposit money every few weeks, then each person takes a turn to withdraw—and the ones who go last are rewarded with interest.</p>



<p>Mayank Kishore, <a href="https://www.mirageml.com/">Mirage</a>: Right now, creating in 3D is time-consuming and takes years of experience and specialized training. It’s a very steep learning curve. Mirage uses generative AI to democratize 3D. It allows you to enter prompts to search assets, generate models, add VFX—so you can build an environment in minutes, with no complex software. It’s a resource for game designers, but also concept artists, product marketers, interior designers, VFX artists. We want to make 3D accessible to everyone.</p>



<p>Why now? What has changed—or is changing—about the world that makes this the right time to take this on?</p>



<p>Mayank, Mirage: We’ve seen with diffusion models how AI can aid in the creative process. But it’s still a challenge for designers and other creators to retain sufficient control when they’re using these tools. By redesigning the 3D canvas from the ground up, Mirage gives individuals the control they need over their AI-assisted creations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jesse, Tanda: Access to savings and credit is an ongoing problem, but the recent financial slowdown put a spotlight on it and exponentially increased the need and opportunity for a product like Tanda. In the U.S. alone, close to 20% of adults are either unbanked or underbanked.</p>



<p>Colin, Visual Electric: Generative AI is a paradigm shift in the way we create, and we believe that presents an opportunity to build a new class of design tool—where you are the art director instead of the designer. Visual Electric has the potential to accelerate the work of existing designers, but also to expand the market and empower others to create work of their own.</p>



<p>Devin, Squint: Over the last several years, mobile devices and AI have improved to a point that allows for a product like Squint. In manufacturing, experienced operators are retiring and complex new machines are constantly being introduced, so the need for more intuitive digital tools has never been greater. But we also believe Squint can have applications beyond the factory floor. AR is going to fundamentally change how we interact with information, and it can help all of us spend less time hunting down the knowledge we need.</p>



<p>Why you? What compels you to work on this problem?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jesse, Tanda: I’ve built Tanda before, at Yahoo, and it worked amazingly well. It was killed as part of an acquisition, but in the five years since I’ve been thinking about it non-stop. I always said that if I ever did another startup I would bring it back, better than before.</p>



<p>Colin, Visual Electric: We are our own customers. Visual Electric is built for designers, by designers—along with engineers and ML experts who are passionate about creative tools. We’ve all been thinking about this problem for a long time—working in design at Dropbox, Facebook, and Apple, among other companies, and for my co-founders Adam and Zach, in their previous experience as founders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Devin, Squint: I’ve been working in AR since the early days of ARKit on the iPhone, and I believe it is the future of how we’ll consume content. I have also seen firsthand how clunky user experiences and high barriers to entry can hold back products from breaking through in this space. That’s why it’s so important to me to make Squint simple and seamless.</p>



<p>Mayank, Mirage: My co-founders, Aman and Sree, and I have worked together on 3D software for years—including at NVIDIA, where we developed infrastructure and AI algorithms for autonomous vehicles. We saw how progress could bottleneck because it was so difficult to create environments quickly enough. So we started Mirage to enable anyone to unleash their creativity by replacing complex design software with AI-augmented tools.</p>

<p>With every new technology, some jobs are lost while others are gained. People often focus on the former, but in this episode we chose to highlight the latter – a highly creative role that emerges alongside AI: the prompt engineer.</p><p>Until AI can close the loop of its own, each tool still requires a set of prompts. Just like a composer feeds an instrument the notes to play, a prompt engineer feeds an AI a map of what to produce. And if we know anything from music it’s that composing great music takes great skill!</p><p>In this episode we explore the emerging importance of prompting with Guy Parsons, the early learnings of how to do it effectively, and where this field might be going.</p><p>Will the prompt engineer be more like the highly sought after DevOps engineer, or a proficiency like Excel that you find on every resume?

<p>Today, all of us at Web3auth moved a step closer to realising our mission of passing the identity ownership back to the individuals and users. We partnered with FOX -owned Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) to provide a seamless Web3 user onboarding experience for The Masked Singer Experience.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1626028978220990464">https://twitter.com/i/status/1626028978220990464</a></p><p>A typical web3 wallet’s user onboarding experience involves setting up a seed phrase for authentication, which is a complex and tedious task. It takes the user anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes. This timeframe has churn written all over it, and it is quite significant in web3 user adoption standards.</p><p>But this has been the standard practice over the years. After we launched Web3Auth and had numerous customers using our wallet infrastructure, several consumer-focused applications have seen a 3x increase in conversion rates, from 24% to about 63%, as opposed to conventional seed phrase wallet solutions.</p><p>In a significant paradigm shift that we have been able to enable today, we joined forces with FOX Entertainment-owned Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) to offer the most seamless onboarding experience possible for the fans of The Masked Singer Experience. This digital fan community is an evolution of the singing competition The Masked Singer — television #1 unscripted series.</p><p>With this partnership, Web3Auth will allow the fan community to connect to The Masked Singer Experience seamlessly, by logging in to the experience and setting up a web3 wallet directly via email, social and Google accounts instead of having to use the conventional seed phrase-enabled wallets. After this collaboration with us, users will need only less than a minute to set up their wallet accounts.</p><p>We decided to give this renewed onboarding journey a special&nbsp;name.</p><p>Two-Factor Wallets&nbsp;(2FW)</p><p>Users can set up a 2FW via 2FA flows — including social logins, phone, laptops, or even biometrics which would take less than a minute. The 2FW also significantly enhances wallet security — if one factor is damaged, users can still recover the wallet using the other&nbsp;factors.</p><p>Our Co-founder and CEO Zhen Yu Yong recommends three key factors for web2 businesses to consider for a successful web3 project&nbsp;launch:</p>  intuitive user experience  familiar user&nbsp;journey  security  <p>He believes that intuitive user experience and accessibility are paramount to allow the show’s fans and crypto enthusiasts to enjoy the reimagined Masker Singer NFT experience.</p><p>But the partnership only makes more sense for Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL). It empowers creators to build their communities through web3-centered fandom experiences that allow people to interact with content in new ways, ultimately reshaping the entertainment industry as we know it by infusing it with a new sense of freedom, access and control. BCL believes the future of the entertainment industry lies within Web3, which will help democratize access to Hollywood, strengthen the bond between creators and their communities and pave new avenues for creativity, innovation and&nbsp;success.</p><p>Today, we have been able to scale Web3Auth to a place where we have already onboarded over 500 web2 and web3 applications and wallets. Today, we are able to clock over 12 million user keys a month, which is an exponential growth from that of last year. But this is only scratching the surface. Having said that, our larger goal is to provide users with Two-Factor Wallets that are secure and seamless.</p><p>“We are all set to partner with larger enterprises within entertainment, gaming and blockchain industries. We want to close the gap between Web2 and&nbsp;Web3.”</p><p>~ Zhen Yu Yong, Co-founder and CEO, Web3Auth.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/how-web3auths-two-factor-wallet-infra-empowered-the-masked-singer-experience-onboarding-experience-83c3498675">How Web3Auth’s Two-Factor Wallet infra empowered The Masked Singer Experience onboarding experience</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Web3Auth Self-host SDK is now Core&nbsp;Kit <p>Simplification in access — a core principle our entire team at Web3Auth consistently strives for. It has been a significant part of our engineering culture. Today, we move a step closer towards our mission to simplify Web3 wallet infrastructure for everyone.</p> Our Self-host SDK is now Core&nbsp;Kit <p>We decided to do a little rebranding to our Self-host SDK, and call it Core Kit. Because it is the core infrastructure that resides underneath all of our products. Simple and&nbsp;easy.</p><p>Of course, there are reasons why we chose to change the&nbsp;name.</p>  The very term self-host could possibly imply that our customers had to do a lot of heavy-lifting.  It could have been very easily interpreted with our Plug &amp; Play&nbsp;SDK.  <p>Here is a little context pertaining to the underlying technological architecture in our two flagship SDKs — Core Kit (previously Self-host) and Plug &amp;&nbsp;Play.</p><p>These SDKs are built on top of an underlying SDK called tKey, which stands for Threshold Key. The <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/tkey/">tKey SDK</a> manages private keys by generating shares using Shamir Secret Sharing, a threshold cryptographic algorithm technique. The image below shows how the tKey SDK architecture plays out in a virtual environment.</p>Web3Auth’s tKey SDK architecture<p>Now when it came to Self-host as a term, ‘hosting by the self’ was a possible misinterpretation we did not want our customers to take away from&nbsp;it.</p>  Self-host offered a bundled package of core components or UI-less SDKs to help a customer customize their desired user interface (UI) to further generate and manage their shares. This implies only one thing — it empowers you to retain your own brand’s user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)&nbsp;flow.  On the other hand, the core purpose of our Plug &amp; Play SDK was to offer a standardized and default user interface (UI) and a user experience (UX) flow from Web3Auth — so that our customers could seamlessly generate and manage their desired number of&nbsp;shares.  <p>By definition, this particular SDK is supposed to be a set of tools that would help you build an authentication engine for your platform — essentially, a non-custodial wallet. But the problem is that our Plug &amp; Play SDK also has a similar purpose, but the only differentiation is that — it allows no room to customize any&nbsp;shares.</p><p>The change of name to Core Kit also refers to exactly what our SDKs offer — a bundled package of UI-less SDKs (or core components) to help you gain better access and control over the user experience (UX) flows, while retaining your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Here is what the Core Kit&nbsp;entails:</p>  tKey JS SDK, which works on web and react&nbsp;native.  A web-based Single Factor Auth&nbsp;SDK.  A NodeJS Server SDK hosted on the backend nodejs&nbsp;server.  <blockquote>“Owing to this potential misinterpretation, we wanted to take this space and opportunity to explain why we decided to do this rebranding.”</blockquote><p>As we move forward, we are soon going to launch the tKey Android iOS SDKs over the coming few months. Besides, we are also going to launch an aggregator SDK for all of the Core Kit in Web, to allow for better ease of integration.</p><p>If you are an enterprise looking to add a powerful web3 component to your existing systems, look no further — Core Kit is&nbsp;here!</p><p>Furthermore, below is a summary of all the other product updates we&nbsp;have:</p> A revamped Plug &amp; Play&nbsp;SDK <p>Our Plug &amp; Play suite now has all UI SDKs, giving you quick and easy access to our platform.</p><p>Here is what the suit includes:</p>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/modal/">Web Modal&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/no-modal/">Web No Modal&nbsp;SDK</a>  an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/android/">Android SDK</a>, an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/ios/">iOS&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/react-native/">React Native&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/flutter/">Flutter&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/unity/">Unity&nbsp;SDK</a>  a Unreal SDK is out, documentation will be launched&nbsp;soon   Updated documentation <p>All of our documentation has been revamped with a new <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/quick-start">quick start</a>, and general flows to highlight our products and integration better.</p><p>Check them out&nbsp;<a href="https://web3auth.io/docs">here</a>.</p> We’re on Discourse, our newest community portal! <p>We have now fully migrated from GitHub Discussions to a brand new community forum on Discourse to enable a superior community support experience, better search capabilities, more accurate suggestions, and quicker responses.</p><p>Join our community forum&nbsp;<a href="https://community.web3auth.io/">here</a>.</p><p>Over the last 4 years, our team at Web3Auth has been able to onboard over 500 applications and wallets across Web2 and Web3. Today, we manage more than 12 million user keys a month, a growth that is significant and exponential from that of our previous&nbsp;years.</p><p>Traditional wallet authentication methods such as seed-phrases, are difficult to remember and are vulnerable to phishing attacks. We have been working hard the last 4 years on various key management technologies and we believe we have been instrumental in pioneering this paradigm shift in the industry, especially after having launched our <a href="https://web3auth.io/mpc.html">Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</a> technology.</p><p>But this is only the beginning. As we continue this journey to achieve our audacious mission, which is to make digital ownership human-centric and accessible to everyone, we want to thank you for being a part of our thriving community and for your support in helping us build this wallet infrastructure for&nbsp;all.</p><p>We’d love for you to try out Core Kit, the Plug &amp; Play SDKs, and join us in the product conversations on <a href="https://community.web3auth.io/">Discourse</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/important-product-updates-web3auth-self-host-and-plug-and-play-590bdf414ef6">Important Product Updates — Web3Auth Self Host and Plug and Play</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is to clarify our response to a detailed internal investigation into a claimed vulnerability attack on Web3 Magic&nbsp;Links.</p><p>Today, we want to take this opportunity to address a claimed vulnerability on Magic Links in Web3 highlighted by DFNS.co. Read more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/24/crypto-wallet-firm-dfns-says-magic-links-have-critical-vulnerability/">here</a>.</p><p>The disclosure describes a phishing attack on passwordless Magic Links, that affects Web2 applications but was aimed specifically toward Web3 applications.</p><p>A short summary of the incident with the timelines:</p>  This phishing method was disclosed to us privately on Thursday, 23rd February 2023, over a voice&nbsp;call.  Between 23rd and 25th February, upon discovery of the phishing attack, the Web3Auth team launched a detailed investigation into potentially affected users and their accounts.  In conclusion, the investigation found no cases of existing users being affected by this&nbsp;attack.  A verification challenge and stricter IP policies were implemented to prevent future phishing attempts on Monday, 27th February, 2023.  <p>A brief overview of the phishing&nbsp;attack:</p><p>When a user wants to sign up and log in to any user account on the internet, the conventional flow is that he or she would get a verification email with a link to confirm and verify the email address. Upon verification, the user would now be able to access the dashboard or the user&nbsp;account.</p><p>But in this case, which happens to be a phishing attack, a malicious third party comes into play. It triggers a login request, because of which it sends out a passwordless web3 Magic Link to the user’s email. The link could possibly have a call-to-action button that prompts the user to log in. When the user clicks on it, the malicious third party would now be able to log in on behalf of the user, but the user is kept in the dark about the consequences until the account is accessed or&nbsp;altered.</p><p>This was how the claimed vulnerability attack unfolded, which turned out to be a well-known phishing&nbsp;attack.</p><p>Upon intimation of the issue on 23rd Feb 2023, Web3Auth conducted a detailed investigation into potential scenarios under which the issue might have occurred.</p><p>The investigation found that there were no such cases of this vulnerability found with respect to our existing user accounts. Our current policies that are already in place, display the origination of login requests as well as open channels for support, for identified malicious requests. These shall effectively prepare us for similar malicious incidents where the user did not activate the request in the first place. Rest assured, we continue to conduct our business and everyday operations while our users have absolutely nothing to worry&nbsp;about.</p><p>Our future commitment</p><p>However, this gave us an opportunity to further tighten our existing security measures. As part of some immediate remedial actions, we have proactively added additional security policies to identify potential and existing phishing attacks. This included matching and verification of a numeric login code to identify false requests, along with more stringent IP blocking, if the attack originated from different locations.</p><p>To ensure that we handle similar issues in a timely and effective manner, we have developed a Security SOP. Further, if you happen to discover any issues with our product, please email us at security@web3auth.io. Our team shall quickly review your submission and respond within 72 hours. While submitting these issues, kindly provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, the potential impact, and any additional information that may be&nbsp;helpful.</p><p>Feel free to refer to our <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/contribute/bug-bounty">bug bounty program</a> as&nbsp;well.</p><p>As part of our commitment to platform security, we will acknowledge your submission and keep you informed of our progress in addressing the vulnerabilities. We would also publicly recognize your contribution, with your permission, in our security hall of&nbsp;fame.</p><p>We take the security of our platform very seriously.

<p>Account Abstraction has been all the rage in recent months. But with all the different specifications, implementations, jargon and use cases it entails, it is very easy to be buried in the weeds. For those looking for an easily pluggable AA SDK, look no&nbsp;further.</p><p>Today, Safe Global (previously Gnosis.safe) <a href="https://safe.global/core">announced</a> the Safe{Core} SDK, in partnership with Web3Auth in making Account Abstraction an end-to-end and production-ready experience.</p><p>Here is a snapshot of what the core SDK entails for developers:</p><p>The company (Safe) reports that its custody infrastructure has been closely audited and tested over the last 5 years, and that it is now able to secure $39 billion in assets&nbsp;today.</p><p>With Web3Auth, this SDK enables mainstream users to enjoy the benefits of an experience they’re already familiar with. Social logins to Two-Factor wallets that leverage the security of their devices as well. Here is where we echo a similar philosophy and align with Safe on the&nbsp;same.</p><p>”Today, there is a binary choice for users. They can either completely give up ownership of their assets to a custodian and play in a walled garden, or bear the full responsibility of protecting their assets and scrutinizing every transaction. Small everyday burdens of gas fees, seed phrases, jumping wallets, and switching networks to do simple transactions have made web3 unusable by the&nbsp;masses.</p><p>We need to do&nbsp;better.”</p><p>As for developers, if you want to understand more and build on top of the Account Abstraction experience, join us in a month-long global AA Hackathon. The march for this hackathon starts today, with bounties worth $50,000. Join us today&nbsp;<a href="https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/safe/">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/unlock-digital-ownership-for-the-mainstream-user-safe-core-sdk-built-with-web3auth-9caf864d723">Unlock digital ownership for the mainstream user: Safe{Core} SDK built with Web3Auth</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Web3Auth vs Magic — How to choose your Key Management Solution  Authentication is one of the most important components of any application and as the Web3 movement grows, wallet &amp; private key management becomes its most critical aspect. The right to own your own key and the right to own your own identity.  For any dApps, the fundamental question is — how are you managing your users’ wallet? Keeping in mind this critical question, we are comparing two of the leaders in the wallet management space, Web3Auth and&nbsp;Magic. <p>Before we deep dive into the technical details and comparison, let’s understand what these solutions are trying to achieve. Both Web3Auth and Magic replace seed phrases with intuitive one-click logins making onboarding into web3 seamless while giving control to the application to manage their&nbsp;flows.</p><p>Further to that, the infrastructure and usage of both the platforms is very different and needs a deeper understanding. For this, we will be comparing the two platforms on the following aspects:</p>  Wallet Management: How the users’ private keys are managed and held&nbsp;safe?  Authentications Options: How many types of authentication and 2FA methods are supported?  Multichain Support: How many blockchains are supported and utilised?  White Labelling and Customisation: How much control the developer has on the UX&nbsp;flows?  Scalability: How the platforms perform for applications at&nbsp;scale.  Ease of integration: How easy it is to implement a basic instance of the platform.  Open Source &amp; Native platforms support: How much code is publicly available and audited? How many platforms are supported?  Web3Auth vs&nbsp;Magic Differences in Wallet Management Infrastructure <p>According to the Magic’s <a href="https://magic-whitepaper-key-based-authentication-system.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Magic+Whitepaper.pdf">Whitepaper</a>,</p><blockquote>“Magic’s Delegated Key Management leverages Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) provided by Amazon Web Services’ Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Dedicated user master keys generated using AES-256 with 384-bits of entropy are stored on the HSMs. The master keys never leave the hardware as they are meant to be locked inside and unable to be exported. All encryption and decryption operations happen inside the hardware modules themselves. HSMs are a lot like popular 7 FIDO devices like YubiKeys or hardware-based wallets for cryptocurrency storage such as Trezor or Ledger, but instead of traditional harddrive storage, they sit in the cloud, secured by AWS’s data&nbsp;centers.</blockquote><blockquote>Users’ private keys are encrypted by these hardware-based user master keys, which means that attackers need to gain access to the hardware to be able to retrieve the keys, and are forced to stay within Magic’s adversarial infrastructure — which is capable to detect, impede, and monitor attacker’s progress to prevent and mitigate any damages.”</blockquote><p>Hence, we can see that Magic depends on Amazon Web Service’s (AWS) Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for their key encryption. The users’ private keys are encrypted by these hardware-based user master keys and stored separately in a multi-region MySQL database.. This approach is good in terms of speed and availability, however has a major flaw, wherein the entire private key sits encrypted on the cloud secured by AWS KMS which can be a single point of failure. Hence, we can regard their solution as a semi-custodial system.</p><p>Web3Auth is a<a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-is-here-9387d570990b"> fully non custodial MPC (Multi Party Computation) solution</a> where the user keys are distributed across a network of nodes owned by the top firms in the crypto industry and the user’s own devices. This is enabled by an on chain node network distributed key generation followed by an off chain multi-sig. The key is never fully owned by anyone and only the user has the access to it via their own authentication methods. While making a blockchain transaction, the key is never reconstructed or stored anywhere, rather a series of partial signatures are done across the network and user devices and the final signature is generated for the transaction.</p><p>This infrastructure can be used across the world with node availability throughout the world with industry leading speeds and a surety that user keys are never owned by a single entity&nbsp;anytime.</p><p>You can read more about Web3Auth’s <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/overview/key-management/">Wallet Management Infrastructure</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-is-here-9387d570990b">New MPC Solution</a>.</p> Authentications Options <p>One of key features of Web3Auth and Magic is the support of any social, federated identity ( Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, etc.) and custom JWT auth providers. This allows developers to integrate any kind of login method, provided they are using JWT ID Token for user registration.</p><p>In addition to this, Two Factor Authentication is a key aspect of keeping your accounts secure. Magic supports 2FA with mobile operators like Authy and Google Authenticator and/or SMS authentication giving you the traditional experience of&nbsp;2FA.</p><p>Web3Auth introduces a new layer of security here with the introduction of Two Factor Wallets. Web3Auth actually uses its off chain multi sig to distribute keys into multiple devices and or SMS/ other authentication methods. This enables you to get a true decentralised 2FA setup where your keys are secured even if one of the authentication methods is compromised.</p> Multichain Support <p>Web3Auth’s SDKs are chain agnostic, ie. they can be used on any blockchain. Today there are thousands of dApps built on numerous blockchains that have integrated Web3Auth. On the other hand, Magic supports 20+ popular blockchains.</p> White Labelling and Customisation <p>Web3Auth allows applications and wallets to fully customise and whitelabel the solution. Using the various options of integration available, you can even make Web3Auth totally invisible in the user flow focusing totally on your application end to end. Magic does provide a range of customisation options, but it is limited as compared to Web3Auth.</p> Scalability <p>Both the solutions do very well in terms of scalability of users and availability across multiple regions. Being hosted on AWS HSMs, Magic is available worldwide within their servers. These servers are owned by&nbsp;Amazon.</p><p>Web3Auth’s network of nodes are hosted worldwide and by trusted industry leaders like Polygon, Binance, Tendermint, ENS, Etherscan etc. Additionally, with the new Sapphire network of Web3Auth, applications can choose to run their own nodes in addition to the nodes available publicly giving them flexibility and control over their user scalability.</p> Ease of Integration <p>A basic integration of both the platforms is quite easy and straightforward. With Web3Auth a basic of the Plug and Play SDKs requires just <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/quick-start">4 basic steps</a> and with excellent documentation and examples guiding you throughout the journey of building your own customised solution. A basic integration takes less than 15 mins of work and no extra customisation is required for being production ready. You also have the flexibility to migrate to a more advanced integration with our range of SDKs available for different use cases and platforms. We also have an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/integration-builder">integration builder</a> which, according to your requirements, shapes up a ready to use code that can be directly implemented in your application.</p><p>A basic Magic integration takes a similar approach with one additional step. You need to use custom authentication for using any social login provider apart from email passwordless. Their documentation and guides are great to follow along and one can figure out how to implement them&nbsp;easily.</p> Open Source &amp; Native Platform&nbsp;Support <p>Open source is at the heart of decentralisation. Both Web3Auth and Magic have strong multi platform support and an active open source community around their products. Web3Auth supports Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, Unity and Unreal Engine. Magic supports all of them except Unreal Engine. They additionally support PHP and WordPress logins.</p><p>At Web3Auth, all these SDKs are open sourced alongside our core infrastructural SDKs and smart contracts controlling the nodes as well. These are fully audited by some of the top smart contract auditing firms in the world. For Magic, the SDKs are open source, while the encryption and DKMS remain closed&nbsp;source.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Although Magic is a great product in terms of getting your users onboarded into the Web3 world, it is evident that Web3Auth has a clear advantage on the core infrastructure level over them. Being a more advanced product with a greater emphasis on security, non-custodiality, and customisation, Web3Auth becomes a clear choice in almost every situation where user wallet management and recoverability is an involved&nbsp;factor.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-vs-magic-how-to-choose-your-key-management-solution-10bbbe78e58e">Web3Auth vs Magic — How to choose your Key Management Solution</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
