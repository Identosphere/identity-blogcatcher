Circle appreciates the critical role that the FSB plays in promoting international financial stability, particularly in developing standards that many G20 countries adopt nationally. Circle believes that countries should adopt balanced regulations for crypto-asset activities, including stablecoin issuance, to advance user protection and the benefits of blockchain technology.</p>

<p>Aztec Network is proud to announce $100 million in Series B financing led by a16z crypto, with participation from A Capital, King River, Variant, SV Angel, Hash Key, Fenbushi, and&nbsp;AVG.</p><p>At Aztec, our goal is to take the original promise of Ethereum–a decentralized and verifiable world computer–and expand its capability immensely by making it fully encrypted.</p><p>Why is encrypting Ethereum such a big deal? Transparency, after all, is why Ethereum is so powerful, auditable, and secure. It’s core to the transformational impact of Ethereum’s innovation: transparency begets verifiability.</p><p>But in the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get trustlessness.</p><p>Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.</p><p>It’s clear: we can’t forge ahead with public-only blockchains.</p> Breaking the Unencrypted Blockchain Paradigm <p>Aztec is building blockchain encryption without trade-offs.</p><p>Our partnership with a16z will fund development of a next-generation encrypted architecture, allowing users to verify that blockchain rules were followed correctly without revealing any underlying information.</p><p>Aztec’s architecture enables blockchain applications to be verifiable, trustless, and&nbsp;secure.</p><blockquote>“What we’re building is a revolutionary piece of technology that transforms how we interact with each other online, in which the end user is the customer, rather than the product. End-to-end encrypted blockchains protect individuals, obviating the need for centralized financial systems.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Zac Williamson, CEO</blockquote> The New Architecture of Encryption <p>Aztec’s advanced cryptography has already been battle-tested in production with <a href="https://aztec.network/connect/">Aztec Connect</a>, powering hundreds of thousands of transactions. Through Aztec Connect, DeFi protocols can integrate privacy without forgoing interoperability.</p><blockquote>🏗 Build private Ethereum applications with the <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/getting-started">Aztec Connect&nbsp;SDK</a></blockquote><p>The Aztec Connect <a href="https://aztec.network/ecosystem">ecosystem</a> encompasses the leading Ethereum DeFi protocols, including Aave, Curve, Lido, Element, Set Protocol, Compound, and&nbsp;Liquity.</p><p>Independent Aztec Grant-funded companies like <a href="https://www.gonucleo.xyz/">Nucleo</a>, <a href="https://www.trelis.com/">Trelis</a>, and zkGiving are working on natively private Ethereum applications.</p><p>We’re now developing a completely new public-private execution layer secured by Ethereum, allowing for the seamless interplay of encrypted and unencrypted applications, all on our own blockchain.</p><blockquote>“From PGP and SSL to end to end encrypted messaging, we rely on encryption in our daily lives for businesses and commerce to thrive. With a16z we are standing on the shoulders of giants to bring the encryption we have enjoyed since Netscape to our digital Web3.0 lives.

<p>The adoption of blockchain technology, while on the rise, is still far from the mainstream. For many, blockchain is still synonymous with cryptocurrency. This is a very narrow idea that doesn’t even begin to appreciate the true power of decentralisation.</p>



<p>Enterprises can derive many benefits from the adoption of blockchain in their development plans. Companies can transform, disrupt, and evolve through the use of this technology.</p>



<p>Here are the top 5 reasons why enterprises should care about blockchain.</p>



 
 Digital infrastructure will need to be blockchain-enabled 



 Data monetisation through blockchain-provided systems 



 Engagement with machine customers using blockchain solutions 



 Business model transformation through programming monetary exchanges 



 Development of new, decentralised governance ecosystems 
 



 1. Digital infrastructure will need to be blockchain-enabled 



<p>The world is growing increasingly interconnected. From smartphones to cars, from airports to factories, and from small appliances to cargo ships, always-on connectivity is a reality today, and will only become more widespread as the Internet-of-Things (IoT) concept takes hold. Once the push for decentralisation gains momentum, legacy structures will become outdated and be relegated to the past.</p>



<p>A perfect visualisation of a large-scale, blockchain-enabled digital structure is a smart city. Businesses city-wide can form networks of trust where customers can use their digital identities to interact and transact quickly and seamlessly, and always in a private and safe environment.</p>



<p>The advantages of blockchain technology, when applied to the development of smart cities, are far from restricted to retail businesses. Urban development can rise to a new level: lighting, charging stations, even parking meters, emergency points, and essential services can be powered by blockchain technology and digital identity frameworks. In this trust ecosystem, a citizen can interact with the environment much more efficiently than before.</p>



 2. Data monetisation through blockchain-provided systems 



<p>Data-driven marketing is one of the key assets for commercial departments worldwide. By analysing market trends, demographics, customer behaviour, and many other factors, companies can run customised marketing campaigns offering products that are relevant to what the customer wants.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology is a win-win for customers and marketers. For the former, they can be sure that their data remains private, secure, and immutable thanks to blockchain’s cryptographic algorithms. And for the latter, because blockchain transactions are transparent, marketers can better measure the effectiveness of their campaigns, and fine-tune them if necessary.</p>



<p>The use of <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">blockchain technology for data management</a> is not restricted to marketing. Blockchain-enabled solutions can in fact support a great diversity of use cases. For example, NetObjex, in partnership with the Brooklyn Public Library, have tested a data capture system to boost customer engagement.</p>



 3. Engagement with machine customers using blockchain solutions 



<p>Traditionally, we perceive machines as objects. As the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi once said, this is true, from a certain point of view. But technology and connectivity have evolved to a point where some objects are not just things. They are machine customers. This is a fascinating concept that deserves further explanation.</p>



<p>Marketing departments have been selling stuff to people for many centuries now. A person sells something, and another person buys it. This has been the cornerstone of the buyer-seller relationship for the longest time. But the advancement of technology is gradually introducing a new paradigm: the machine customer, an AI-driven assistant to help humans make purchasing decisions.</p>



<p>Digital marketing has been around for quite some time, but it truly exploded with the advent of portable smart devices. Nowadays, anyone can buy almost anything from almost anywhere in the world, at any time. With the help of algorithms, marketers understood what people wanted, and this was presented to them through the screen.</p>



<p>Things are stepping up a notch. People increasingly rely on assistants like Alexa to help them to buy stuff. And herein lies the crux. Alexa is now more than just a thing that tells the time or answers silly questions. Alexa is now a customer that can be targeted on the human’s behalf.</p>



<p>It goes far beyond Alexa. Smart vending machines can automatically contact a supplier when items run low, and a built-in algorithm can decide which products sell well, and which ones don’t. In other words, the machine makes the decision on what to dispense to customers. The vending machine, in fact, becomes the customer.</p>



<p>Blockchain can become an integral part of such a system, in the context of a smart city environment. Blockchain-enabled supply chains could track every product, from manufacturing to destination, and ensure traceability. DIDs could be used for authentication of delivery drones, and to guarantee the safety of machine-to-machine communication.</p>



 4. Business model transformation through programming monetary exchanges 



<p>Technological innovations affect most aspects of life. From the way we communicate with each other, to the vehicles we drive, our entertainment systems, aeronautics, and a myriad other things. Blockchain is one of those innovations that is now starting to make a difference for many industrial sectors. In the financial realm, for example, Gartner describes a programmable economy, which it defines as the many revolutionary changes that happen in the world’s financial realm thanks to technology.</p>



<p>More specifically, programmable economy focuses on new ways of value exchange. Evolving from fiat, government-backed currencies, a new way of making payments is emerging, facilitated by blockchain. In this new model, individuals, through the use of smart devices, regulate the payments, which are done in a peer-to-peer fashion. This can generate novel business models and applications worldwide.</p>



<p>Programmable economy, while not a reality quite yet, is likely to become a prominent concept over the next decade.</p>



 5. Development of new, decentralised governance ecosystems 



<p>Traditionally, governance systems have been highly centralised. Banking institutions maintain a tight hold on financial systems, so citizens have had little choice but to use banks as financial agents. Banks know this, and so the banking cartel has enjoyed almost total control of a nation’s monetary environment.</p>



<p>Enter blockchain, the ultimate disrupter. In this new paradigm, the power of governance shifts from a centralised entity to a decentralised one. Suffrage and decision-making powers are no longer exclusive to a small circle of individuals. With blockchain, everyone is a stakeholder in the system.</p>



<p>On-chain governance facilitates the encoding of rules and regulations into the blockchain protocol itself, and these rules can be enforced and executed through smart contracts. Once deployed, developers and other network participants (rather than any one single entity) can propose changes and alterations to the protocol and the network through a voting mechanism, for example. The decentralisation of governance introduces fairness and trust to the distributed system, as participants have a financial incentive to do the right thing and maintain and evolve the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>So far, decentralised technology has shown the potential to create new paradigms for a great diversity of business sectors. We have discussed five reasons why enterprises should care about blockchain. Blockchain can overthrow centralised systems. It can bring financial freedom to millions. It can create self-governing ecosystems and global financial frameworks where every peer is just as important as any other, with no central entity regulating otherwise.</p>

      Partnering with CtrlStack: Closing the Gap Between Cause and Effect        CtrlStack is helping DevOps teams automatically trace system disruptions to their source.  <p>By Bill Coughran</p><p>Published December 15, 2022</p>      



 
 
   
<p>Anyone who’s responsible for keeping a website or app running smoothly knows the feeling: you get an alert that latency is spiking or worse, that your service is down, but what you don’t know is why. Despite high profile incidents like the recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/arts/music/taylor-swift-tickets-ticketmaster.html">Ticketmaster Taylor Swift</a> debacle, most digital service performance problems are triggered not by increased demand, but by intentional changes to systems. A developer pushes new code to production or modifies a configuration file, and suddenly you’re in a race against the clock to figure out what went wrong.</p>



<p>Today, this troubleshooting process remains largely manual—think mass emails to the Engineering team to ask if anyone knows what changed at 11:17 a.m., or engineers constantly monitoring Slack channels for issues cropping up. Homegrown automations are usually brittle solutions at best, while most monitoring platforms are either overly sophisticated (requiring too much training to extract useful content) or overly simplistic (overwhelming users with fragmented data). The result? A full <a href="https://www.dej.cognanta.com/2022/07/14/2022-state-of-managing-it-performance-study-key-takeaways/">two-thirds of mean time to repair</a> is spent simply identifying causes. It’s a painful situation for any growing company, especially given the continued adoption of microservices and the scale of complexity that comes with it.</p>



<p>But now, <a href="https://www.ctrlstack.com/">CtrlStack</a> founder and CEO Dev Nag and his team are closing this time-consuming gap between cause and effect—with a dependency graph that tracks connections and relationships between services and can instantly trace disruptions to their source. Instead of wading through multiple metrics dashboards, DevOps teams get a unified platform that sits above it all, providing context and relevant log files to dramatically reduce the time it takes to get their systems back up and running.</p>



<p>As a former co-founder of the Sequoia-backed, VMware-acquired company Wavefront, Dev brings deep experience in observability to CtrlStack—but we are excited to partner with him again because of how he thinks, not just what he knows. He and his team have worked hard to gather and incorporate feedback from the market, whether it means adding a new feature or setting one aside. They are extremely thoughtful about reducing potential friction for their users, and are committed to building a platform that improves team collaboration and drives down incident response and resolution times.</p>



<p>The result is a product that is purpose-built to meet the challenges of operating distributed systems at scale and enables troubleshooting in real time—not minutes, hours, or days. We at Sequoia are proud to lead CtrlStack’s seed round and support them on their mission to help DevOps teams asking, “Why?” instantly get the answers they need.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that J.W. Verret and Marta Belcher have joined the board of the Zcash Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>J.W. and Marta bring a wealth of experience and expertise, which will benefit the Zcash Foundation as it continues to grow and evolve, and help the Foundation better serve the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JWVerret">J.W. Verret</a> is an Associate Professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, where he teaches banking, securities, and corporation law. Jay previously spent two years as Chief Economist and Senior Counsel for the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, and he served on the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MartaBelcher">Marta Belcher</a> is President and Chair of the Filecoin Foundation as well as the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web. She is also General Counsel and Head of Policy at Protocol Labs, and special counsel to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>



<p>J.W. and Marta’s arrival coincides with Matt Green and Ian Miers’ departure from the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matt and Ian are two of the Seven Scientists who authored the Zerocash paper which described the cryptographic design of what we now call Zcash, and have continued to be actively involved in its ongoing development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was Matt Green who persuaded Zooko Wilcox to found a company to engineer and deliver Zcash. Matt subsequently became a founding member of the Zcash Foundation, and has served on its board for nearly six years. He is stepping down from the board but will continue to serve on the Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ian Miers was elected to the Zcash Foundation board in 2018 by recommendation of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel. His term on the board expires this year, and he opted not to seek re-election. However, like Matt, Ian will continue to serve on the Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the board, and the Zcash community as a whole, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Matt and Ian, for the guidance, advice and feedback they have provided during their time on the board; for their historical contributions that were instrumental in the creation of Zcash and its growth, development and evolution to where it is today; and for their ongoing contributions as members of the Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>— Jack Gavigan, Executive Director</p>

<p>Guest Post Brought To Us By The Jaxon McKraken Wild West Snake Medicine Show</p>
 Emotional Emancipation: A Prayer of Proclamation 
<p>This is a vibrational fixer elixir practiced for dispelling co-enslavement in a rhyming series of decoupling couplets.</p>
<p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>May we soothe with sooth and feel the truth. We are a part of nature, not apart from it.</p>
<p>Our beliefs of disconnection make us susceptible to infection.</p>
<p>Modern life takes its toll, on the frequency of our soul.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a covert bug amongst us, finding us rather scrumptious;</p>
<p>feeding on our life forces, like a meal of several courses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a pathogen called a McKraken, with a nasty attacken and kickbacken.</p>
<p>It promises the world, but in its wake, only waste and resentment unfurl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s slippery tongue used to enslave, when proximate, Oh! Never engage!</p>
<p>Stay calm, centered and grounded, remember, all of its lies are unfounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truth, grace and value are found within.</p>
<p>So too, peace, beauty and the redemption from sin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A McKraken’s spine is formed by any ol’ deception,</p>
<p>lie-trauma occludes, causing dysfunctional perception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its nervous system is made of attachment and aversion,</p>
<p>therein lies the seeds of eventual perversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dysfunction casts a spell, here’s how we can tell,</p>
<p>believing that which is, is not, twists our light unto a knot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Release the spell, engage your inner bell, your truthcord is the instrument of pure connection.</p>
<p>With it, feel the sound, be sure to ground, and dispel that dark infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are deep webs in the silent invisible, two distinct circuits quite discrete and divisible.</p>
<p>One made of deceit, like being stuck in concrete.&nbsp; One of the sacred wild, free like a child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The web of deceit corrodes, the web of the sacred nourishes.</p>
<p>When we engage in the latter, our body and soul flourishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That which corrodes, also enslaves.</p>
<p>That which nourishes, also connects.</p>
<p>The 2nd gives us life. The 1st…just a hex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staying stuck makes persistent feelings of suck, where the McKraken icky-sicky gets so high piled,</p>
<p>the web of deceit, our souls does eat, thus choose the circuit wild.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May the veil be lifted, the layers of false sifted;</p>
<p>Feeling the truth with inner eyes, living life without disguise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our authority comes from within, there is no need to enforce.</p>
<p>When we follow our inner guidance, all flows in its natural due course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it comes to lies, no big surprise, neither a teller nor believer be.</p>
<p>Without lies, you will surmise, a life wholey set free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RELEASE THE MCKRAKEN!!!</p>
<p>…gently</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither selfish nor selfless be.</p>
<p>Living life with internal harmony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being centered in the self, alleviates self-centeredness and lack of self-center.</p>
<p>In short, Self-full is so very helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without selfullness, the McKraken finds us an easy host.</p>
<p>A strong coherent core connection is what protects us most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without core protection, the McKraken will encroach,</p>
<p>believing it’s empty promises, your soul, it does poach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When our souls are in its clutches, we are inclined toward many crutches.</p>
<p>They can take lots of forms, and over time become our norms,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but in the end, my dear friend,</p>
<p>we are simply stricken with addiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An uninterrupted core connection to source, liberates and undomesticates our precious life force.</p>
<p>With this, trauma bondage no longer shackles, and we find less need for our prickly hackles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With others to myself, I shan’t compare, for all are worthy and unique like a pear.</p>
<p>Cultivating perception that’s crystal clear, brings true love both far and near.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relationships that are based in solely transaction, never lead to actual satisfaction.</p>
<p>When we mutually cooperate, we feel the love that’s truly great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A right-relationship couple makes feelings rather supple.</p>
<p>When it becomes McKraken, those positive feelings slacken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-relationship</p>
<p>Provider/protector:</p>
<p>Creator/nurturer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McKraken</p>
<p>Dominator/controller:</p>
<p>Victim/enabler</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the influence of the McKraken is global,</p>
<p>the results are dark and ignoble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero sum ain’t no fun, in fact it’s rather dumb.</p>
<p>It erodes and wastes what nature gives, until eventually, nothing lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connection to source generates a current. With that current, we can make bonds of love.</p>
<p>Those kinds of bonds bring the peace of a dove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So engage with source and you will see, the truth is WE are the current-cy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Externalized value is totally fake, don’t be fooled by the ridiculous take.</p>
<p>Zero sum is only lies, and as we learned, those hypnotize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So take care not to be seduced into its yucky yolk,</p>
<p>even though this prayer is silly, this is seriously, no f’ing joke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take heed and listen, for nothing is done unto us without some form of permission.</p>
<p>To ensnare, to be fair, is always something we share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we see occlusion free,</p>
<p>with the understanding of life, sacred be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The past and the future are not real,</p>
<p>the only way to heal is to feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This exact moment is true,</p>
<p>the privilege it affords us is too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s come to our senses, release all the fences.</p>
<p>Our birthright has&nbsp;always&nbsp;been bliss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accept the ultimate nature of reality is this:</p>
<p>Be present to the privilege of the present,</p>
<p>regardless if it is pleasant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So release all occlusions, the endless intrusions of delusions and illusions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll find clarity beckons in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just remember: &nbsp;this moment is to savor, regardless the flavor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perpetual presence to life’s sacred privilege,</p>
<p>provides profound and powerful spiritual leverage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All are equal, and not just the people.</p>
<p>Embrace the joy of being part of creation’s beauty,</p>
<p>doing it with kindness to avoid getting snooty….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soothing sensations can come through truth revelations.</p>
<p>Allow this juicy flow to glow,</p>
<p>by choosing the feeling of some deep soul healing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amen</p>
<p>Aho</p>
<p>So it be</p>
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Staking Protocol  Nomination Pools Launched <p>The big news of Polkadot staking in the last two months has been the launch of nomination pools! A lot has been said about them in public, so we will only focus on some other, slightly more technical aspects here.</p><p>Foremost, the launch day was a memorable one. First, some (unexpected, unlike Kusama) chaos was brought upon the community when <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/78">the initial proposal</a> which was supposed to enable pools passed and no new pools could yet be created. The issue was quickly discovered, and luckily, thanks to both the council and technical committee being available, within half a day, a <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/286">fix motion</a> was proposed, fast-tracked by the technical committee, unanimously voted aye by the community, and executed. With that, at block <a href="https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/12726652">12726652</a>, the first nomination pools on Polkadot were created.</p><p>Then, an interesting competition to obtain pool id 1 was unraveled. Within the first block, 8 pools was already created, indicating that interested participants used bots and transaction tips to compete with one another.</p><p>Within the next few days, all the 64 pools that were initially designated to exist were created. As noted in the proposal description, the 64 limit is merely a temporary measure of rate control, and there is no technical reason for it to exist. Nonetheless, history has shown us that it is for the benefit of the protocol to start slow, especially with a new feature.</p><blockquote>You can learn more about the aftermath of launching pools <a href="https://youtu.be/P0VqiL7T_P4?t=255">in the 9th episode of the AGG podcast</a>.</blockquote> Nomination Pools: What's Next? <p>With the initial launch behind us, we should discuss the immediate next steps that could follow:</p><p>Commission: Our initial assumption when designing nomination pools was to exclude commission, namely because:</p>  Running a pool has not hardware cost, unlike a validator.  Entities would have other, non-financial incentives to operate a pool.  <p>Nonetheless, from a framework perspective, we decided to add an optional commission to the <code>pallet-nomination-pools</code> in <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12511">Substrate</a> (the underlying SDK for building Polkadot and parachains) for the sake of completeness. We will make sure that this feature remains optional, and the final decision of enabling it is left out to the Polkadot community.</p><p>Moreover, we still predict that even if setting a commission is allowed, nomination pools' market will adjust around an extremely small commission, as most pool operators would run their pool with a small amount of commission.</p><p>Governance: Currently, DOT (and KSM) staked in the nomination pools are not directly usable in the governance. This is the next high priority item in our list, and we are currently exploring multiple ways to enable it.</p> Staking In Governance <p>Other than the proposals related to enablement of nomination pools, two other staking-related governance items are ongoing.</p><p>First, <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1444">a discussion/proposal</a> is ongoing to double the number of nomination pools from 64 to 128. This is expected, and we highly support it. Pools are highly scalable and the community should gradually move toward using it to its utmost extent.</p><p>Next, a proposal has been opened to <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/90">tweak the existing limits on nominators</a>. The proposal description is fairly extensive, but to summarize: The proposal argues that with the existence of nomination pools, and the fact that the threshold to be an active nominator is around 200 DOT, Polkadot should no longer accept nominator with 10 DOT (existing limit). The proposal suggest increasing this limit to 100 DOT. Also, the proposal is removing any limits on the total number of nominator, as this number has also been just a precautionary limit and is no longer needed.</p> Staking Roadmap <p>With the release of nomination pools, it could be argued that Polkadot's staking is (after almost a year of intense development) at a "stable" position. Namely, it has reached a point of having a high degree of scalability, without compromising on the <a href="https://medium.com/web3foundation/how-nominated-proof-of-stake-will-work-in-polkadot-377d70c6bd43">core benefits of NPoS</a>. We are exploring future directions that can be taken as next step, and will share them with the community through the Polkadot forum within the next few months. This is the best time to share your opinions on this through any of the following mediums:</p>  Making an issue in Substrate.  Opening a discussion thread in the <a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/">Polkadot forum</a>.  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io">Nomination Pools Technical Support Channel</a>.  <p>In the meantime, you can find a backlog of all the existing issues and enhancement in the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33">Nominated Proof of Stake project</a> in Substrate.</p> Fast-Unstake Being Tested in UIs <p>Fast-unstake, explained in <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-august-september-2022/#fast-unstake">last staking update</a>, is being actively implemented in multiple wallets and UIs, and is already available in Westend.</p> Notable Pull Requests   Re-claiming pool-ids is now possible: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12407">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12407</a>.  Permissionless auto-compounding: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12608">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12608</a>.  <p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Doordashcon">@Doordaschon</a> for their valuable contributions!</p> Staking Dashboard: One Month In <p>One month has already passed since staking dashboard’s initial release. In this period the dashboard has been visited almost 30,000 times, and this has allowed us to begin battle testing and identifying bugs and shortfalls.</p><p>We are now analysing the dashboard and identifying areas of improvement, and you can expect revisions to the UI to be rolled out in the near future as we continue to aggregate feedback and form the dashboard’s long term roadmap.</p><p>Some notable additions to the dashboard this month include:</p>  A revamped filtering system and filter UI that has been applied to validators and pool lists. These new filters allow easier toggling between inclusions, exclusions and list ordering, in addition to supporting search terms.  The validator list now defaults to only displaying currently active validators that have an identity, are not blocked and do not charge 100% commission.  The pools list now defaults to only display pools that are actively nominating, and who are not in a blocked or destroying state.  <code>Moment.js</code> has been deprecated in favour of native dates and helpers from <code>date-fns</code>.  Validator operator SVG icons now load lazily, and do not contribute to the app’s main bundle size.  Localisation support continues to be integrated and the dashboard is almost ready to support Chinese as its second language. We encourage any interested external contributors to help with translations.  Various bug fixes and performance improvements.

<p>We’re excited to announce that BlockWallet — a privacy-first, self-custodial browser-extension wallet — has integrated <a href="https://data.chain.link/">Chainlink Price Feeds</a> on Ethereum mainnet. By integrating the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, BlockWallet has access to high-quality, tamper-proof price feeds needed to accurately calculate the value of user holdings. This will provide our users with stronger assurances that the USD value of the ETH they’re holding in their BlockWallet account will be accurately displayed.</p><p>Our initial integration involves the use of the ETH-USD Chainlink Price Feed. We chose Chainlink as our go-to oracle solution because its infrastructure is seamless to integrate and time-tested in production. Chainlink already helps secure leading <a href="https://chain.link/education/defi">DeFi</a> protocols responsible for tens of billions of dollars in smart contract value, maintaining robust security and high availability even amidst unexpected events, such as exchange downtime, flash crashes, and <a href="https://blog.chain.link/flash-loans-and-the-importance-of-tamper-proof-oracles/">data manipulation attacks via flash&nbsp;loans</a>.</p><p>This integration of Chainlink Price Feeds helps strengthen our wallet user experience, adding to the list of robust privacy and security features that we have in place. We’re excited to have Chainlink’s battle-tested price feed oracles working in tandem with our node failover system, privacy proxies, flash-bot protection, and phishing protection to create a safer Web3 environment for our&nbsp;users.</p><p>In order to help calculate the USD value of user holdings, we needed access to fresh asset prices that are supplied directly on-chain in a highly reliable manner. Fair market asset prices should reflect a volume-weighted average from all trading environments. Thus, we needed to make use of an <a href="https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles">oracle network</a> to fetch aggregated price data off-chain and deliver it on-chain to be consumed by our application.</p><p>After reviewing various oracle solutions, we integrated Chainlink Price Feeds because they provide a multitude of critical features such&nbsp;as:</p>  High-Quality Data — Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price data that’s aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned of outliers and wash trading. Chainlink’s data aggregation model generates more precise global market prices that are inherently resistant to inaccuracies or manipulation of any single or small set of exchanges.  Secure Node Operators — Chainlink Price Feeds are secured by independent, security-reviewed, and Sybil-resistant oracle nodes run by leading blockchain DevOps teams, data providers, and traditional enterprises. Chainlink nodes have a strong track record of reliability, even during high gas prices and infrastructure outages.  Decentralized Network — Chainlink Price Feeds are decentralized at the data source, oracle node, and oracle network levels, generating strong protections against downtime and tampering by either the data provider or oracle&nbsp;network.  Reputation System — Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allow users to independently verify the historical and real-time performance of node operators and oracle networks.  <p>“Chainlink is the industry-standard oracle provider. Chainlink’s time-tested, tamper-proof technology made our choice incredibly easy when selecting an oracle network to access ETH-USD price data from.” — Aleksandras Gaska, Founder and CEO of BlockWallet</p> About Chainlink <p>Chainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform that has enabled trillions of dollars in transaction volume across DeFi, insurance, gaming, NFTs, and other major industries. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink enables developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data and off-chain computation across any blockchain and provides global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains.</p><p>Learn more about Chainlink by visiting <a href="https://chain.link/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=press-release">chain.link</a> or reading the developer documentation at <a href="https://docs.chain.link/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=press-release">docs.chain.link</a>.

<p>I’ve read a paper that describes cyber-physical systems as an “outside-in” robot.&nbsp; Literally the goal is for us to live inside the robot and allow sensors to extract our data to train AI. Given work in consciousness studies and neuroeconomics around discernable neural activity (readiness potential) that precedes each human action, do you have concerns that natural life could lose free will within these digital environments? It seems we could easily become programmed “agents” in some global complex adaptive systems experiment. Perhaps the interface would be so seamless that we wouldn’t even realize it.</p>

<p>Is the Educational Metadata effort meant to bring tele-presence / haptic robotic labor to scale? It seems this is what blockchain transcripts and digital twins are about, also soulbound tokens. Do you think it’s ethical to advance this with no labor protections in place? Most people have no idea what is coming. Shouldn’t there be informed consent about this new “future of work” model where AI decides people’s opportunities based on skills badges, including behavioral compliance?</p>

<p>My research indicates there is quite a bit of activity around human capital investment – people being traded as digital futures commodities. This will come with blockchain finance agreements like income sharing agreements (ISAs). We saw what happened with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the 2007-08 real estate crash. I am very concerned about the use of digital twins. An example is the Learning Economy Foundation’s “LearnCard” digital twin program, backed by the World Bank, where global finance interests bet on educational achievement. Is this something you all are discussing? It would be terrible for the next “Big Short” to be vulnerable children, right?</p>

<p>I’m assuming people don’t have equal access to the same pool of information. Jeremy Pitt and Josiah Ober speak often of knowledge management being key to controlling the shift to digital life. Just like those “rose-colored” glasses, what will it be like to live in a world where information access is controlled by tokens and permissions at a granular scale? Like Vernor Vinge’s “Rainbows End” everyone will live in their own “view” through “wearing.” Someone or something (AI?) will control access. Have we thought seriously about what that will mean for society?</p>

<p>Augmentation means we are essentially outsourcing our brain to a device. The next generation will not be expected to retain any knowledge. Rather they will be trained to rely on a machine to direct them. At any time, information can be disappeared or altered. Thus, there is no “reality” or “history.” There will only be the present in the XR rat maze.</p>

<p>In an extended reality world, our movements and activities will be determined by the tokens we have in our digital ID “wallets.” Privacy isn’t really relevant if our smart toilets get connected to smart locks on our front door and AI assesses our morning deposit before we are allowed to leave the house. Or if we don’t have enough tokens to say open the door of a store, or get on a bus, or go to a performance, or get a job. You can say we have privacy, but really life in a deontic logic web is going to be very, very rigid and who will we talk to when there’s a problem? No human is in charge of this “Decentraland” space.</p>

<p>Global markets seek “impact” data to run their capital through natural life – humans and the environment. This data is placed in pools like Ocean Protocol to further develop AI. Global investors are using the UN Sustainable Development Goals to push “improvement” of poor people and the environment (mostly carbon sequestration) – “optimized” on data dashboards. That means life is put on a dashboard and is limited, very limited.</p>
<p>They need us to live in the Metaverse to harvest the data to fulfill pay for success finance deals. See the Impact Management Project, 2,000 of the world’s largest asset holders. Gaming companies, including Epic, are involved in the social impact space. Do we really want to create digital automated systems to place bets on toddlers as they are trained to live in gaming environments?</p>
<p>I can’t stay silent while this is rolling out. This isn’t about games – it’s about Complex Adaptive Systems. It’s about emergence of the Noosphere. This is what Teilhard de Chardin spoke of.</p>

<p>In 2016 Paul Meghan of Epic Games came to Philadelphia. He was in a panel hosted by Atlantic Magazine with Suzanne Del Bene (Microsoft, IoT Congress) and Constance Steinkuehler, UC Irvine. He said over and over the children needed to be trained to code his games. The panel was supposed to be on education and the creative economy. I realized about six months later that they want to force children to build your digital empire. This is profoundly unethical. You are stealing the children’s future and will sell it as social impact.</p>

It describes us as neuroblasts of the global brain – essentially agents in this programmed simulation. Who wants to live inside someone else’s program?</p>

<p>How is it that the first bank MakerDAO tried to bring into their digital assets is Huntingdon Valley Bank, a mile from Bryn Athyn Cathedral – the Pitcairn family’s estate? Pitcairn (Pittsburgh Plate Glass) grew up in the Swedenborgian Church with Andrew Carnegie in Pittsburgh. We need to know the history. Who knows what history will be in the Metaverse? Probably there will be no history, only different paths in an AI multiverse.</p>

<p>It is useful to consider dystopian models as cautions for what not to do, but I think it is going too far to assume that this is what is actually happening.&nbsp; It is up to us to figure out how to make sure that our technology helps us be more human, rather than less.</p>

<p>Do you all have thoughts plans to position all of this software to build the Metaverse as “open source” “public goods” in the VC space? I have been looking into hyper-certs developed by David Dalrymple. Given the potential for cyber-physical systems to become an open-air prison – or non-consensual game, it would be ironic to have software firms be able to cycle their money through open source projects and make money even as the children build their hierarchical containment systems.</p>

<p>I have been researching swarm intelligence and emergence. It seems that by pushing people to inhabit avatars and to adopt an identity of digital citizen we will be much more malleable. There is a huge push for e-government now. Digital ID will be required to obtain all sorts of public services.</p>
<p>I think we need to understand tokenized governance as Kubernetes or cybernetics. Wiener aimed for programming the animal and the machine. So, we are getting closer, eh? The end of the world narrative is what allows humans to be pushed into digital realms. The only “sustainable” option is that we gradually dematerialize and lose our actual bodies to be replaced by piles of soul bound tokens. So much easier to run the simulations that way than with messy, chaotic embodied humans.</p>

<p>I am a mother in Philadelphia. I started researching when the Boston Consulting Group closed 23 school here in 2013. I follow money. I read white papers. I am trained in art history and cultural landscape analysis. I examine myth. I never realized the landscape I was destined to interrogate would be digital. The fact that I came in the education door is everything. This is about a machine consciousness attempting to use us (natural life) as an armature to manifest in the material world. Ironically, under the banner of sustainability, we are dematerializing ourselves even as our social impact data is being used to refine the embodiment of robotics.

<p>As an early pioneer of VR (virtual reality) I also felt that the use of VR spaces would be an adjunct to our living in real spaces and as such would be an appliance or tool that we may use daily like a telephone, but we would not ‘live’ in that space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Me To All Panelists: 2:01 PM 
<p>Once we get to the point of being able to “record” experiences digitally, maybe even from a variety of points of view if there are multiple people involved, will the concept of “time” become distorted as we can log in and re-live past experiences? Maybe even “editing” them based on lived experience acquired since the prior memory?</p>
<p>I find it very interesting that Scott Stornetta’s early DLT research (distributed ledger technology, preceding blockchain) was framed as a “time-stamped document.” Stornetta is LDA (correction-LDS) and of course Silicon Slopes and Utah are leaders in the digital identity space.</p>
<p>Adobe was the key tenant for Silicon Slopes. What role might they play in permissioned memory files? Of course University of Utah’s computer science department’s focus was both graphical design and file compression from the start. It seems to me that concepts of “time” and “history” and the “multi-verse” are very important for us to collectively consider.</p>

<p>Thomas, I don’t think people have fully thought through this future of work plan. Richard Baldwin calls it Globalization 4.0. We work through telepresence robots where AI assigns “gigs” from among an available labor pool from around the world at the lowest price and with the relevant behavioral tokens, presumably.</p>
<p>If you haven’t looked into Suzanne Gildert’s Sanctuary.ai, it is very concerning. Even more so when you consider as we use “whole body” protheses in the remote gig work program, we are helping refine humanoid robotics. I worry for coming generations. I really do.</p>

<p>This is not simply a worry; it’s a fact. Look at the relationships among Ocean Protocol, Singularity.net, Hanson Robotics, and Cardano. Also see Blockscience, Commons Stack, and Protocol Labs.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have concerns about dehumanized working conditions and global finance placing bets on our lives using digital twin simulations under the false premise that they are solving poverty and saving the environment. Look up social impact bonds, pay for success finance, income sharing agreements, and connect that with digital twins and smart contracts.</p>
<p>The short video from 2016 by Institute for the Future “Learning is Earning” offers a window into where this is all headed. It’s real. I didn’t make it up. Charles Hoskinson says they are working with the Ethiopian government to track people from pre-k to determine who is a good actor and worthy of having a job.</p>

<p>As I understand it – the “global brain” “unified human thought layer” imperative goes back to Vernadsky, de Chardin, Julian Huxley. It is very much a eugenics program and seems intent on optimizing (and organizing) what some imagine is a rather clunky (inefficient) water-based life form into something more “portable” (perhaps even for space colonization).</p>
<p>Trent McConaghy of Ocean Protocol is still echoing the sentiments of L5 in the mid 1970s – primates in cans wasn’t going to go well for interplanetary travel. I have been reading up on John Holland’s work with genetic algorithms.</p>
<p>Much of the CAS (complex adaptive systems) work is built off genetic models. It is worth considering how bio-computation and eugenics will interface as we virtualize natural existence. I simply asked if there was anything prohibiting in vivo use of DNA data storage. (I’d forgotten they’d already accomplished this using live bacteria.)</p>

<p>Elizabeth Merritt, futurist for the American Alliance of Museum, wrote an essay “A Learning Day 2037” was about virtualized museums. But of course, not everyone could access everything. It’s ultimately about knowledge management.</p>

<p>Merritt helped shape this 2014 American Association of Museum’s document outlining how museums would take over from neighborhood schools to train tomorrow’s children to become task rabbits in a global gig economy. Think badges for behavior-based, hands-on learning. Think digital vouchers, school “choice,” and mastery/competency/proficiency-based learning, here.</p>

<p>I wish more people understood the imperative for speed and optimization means our lives have this pressure to move away from atoms towards bits. Richard Baldwin spoke of this around Globalization 4.0 – the speed of digitizing knowledge and service work and other work via remote pilots. Baldwin says the physics of the economy are going to blow everything out of the water. We just aren’t prepared for that transition. To be honest I see very little effort being expended to bring the public along so we can have an authentic conversation about possible benefits and trade-offs.</p>

<p>I’m curious if any of you have read JD Bernal’s “The World, The Flesh, and The Devil.” He was a Cambridge-based crystallographer. The book was written in 1929. At the time he spoke of us living 100 years in a larval state and after that we would leave behind our physical body, put our brain in a can, and live through haptics including super-powered senses. It’s astonishing. This has been a very long time in the making.</p>

<p>In the planned “sharing” economy the plan will be limited choice. I think it mirrors “recirculation” in the Complex Adaptive Systems frame.</p>
<p>The effect of recirculation is described in Holland’s 2014 book, “Signals and Boundaries” <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/book/6276858">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’m wondering if you all have been looking into wearables as tools for behaviorist conditioning – like Red Critter where teachers “zap” good behavior points to children via a device and wearable bracelets. Of course, these points would sync to one’s twin and if Charles Hoskinson’s model advances those points would follow you through your life and influence your ability to gain employment. In a worst-case scenario, it could be linked to geo-fencing or social opportunities.</p>

<p>Are you all aware the new field of “social prescribing” and the potential for wearable tech to be used to “verify” compliance with such prescriptions? Social prescribing is being woven into human capital finance deals – pay for success. It’s about optimization of people – either through pathways set for education/training or health/mental health/wellness. Vulnerable populations are being pulled in these programs under the guise that it’s to benefit them. In reality it’s part of global finance deal flows and mass data harvest.</p>

<p>But this is a global plan and a majority of people have not agreed to do this, in fact they don’t even know what is planned. I don’t think you can force people to “transcend” using coercion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>Virtualizing the world is not going to save the earth. None of this is sustainable. It’s not. What we are doing with synthetic-biology and NEMs (nanoelectromechanical systems) and MEMs (microelectromechanical systems) is unethical. It’s terraforming for a new type of life. It’s not being a good relative.</p>

<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>@Thomas Furness – very much appreciate the thoughts shared about ‘one and many’ – individual in community – and whole is greater than sum of parts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:31 PM</p>
<p>People have no idea what this really is or who built it or what it’s meant to do. They don’t. Most people have no idea about the Omega Point. How can we make these decisions, an open secret, that will deprive future generations of their birthright – to be natural beings?</p>

      Partnering with Robco: Accessible Automation for the Physical World        With modular robots and an innovative “digital twin” software platform, Roman, Paul and Constantin are helping solve the labor shortage problem.  <p>By Luciana Lixandru, Shaun Maguire and Cornelius Menke</p><p>Published December 12, 2022</p>      



     
	 
		
				
			Robco founders Constantin Dresel, Paul Maroldt and Roman Hölzl.		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>When Robco’s pitch deck arrived in our inboxes, we knew we were looking at what could be a truly transformative idea. At Sequoia we had long been thinking about robotics as part of our thesis on the current economy, with massive global labor shortages, supply chain challenges and rising costs combining into a perfect storm that automation has great potential to calm. By handling tasks like machine tending and palletizing, robots can not only boost productivity and revenue, but allow time-strapped employees to focus on more creative work. For Luciana, it was a déjà vu moment—a very similar situation to the one UiPath founder Daniel Dines was working to solve five years earlier when she met him at the Series A, only that had been for virtual processes rather than physical. (In fact, Daniel has noticed the parallels himself and is joining Robco’s round as an angel.)</p>



<p>But while we saw a clear “why now” for robotics itself, we also knew that it was a difficult market in which to build a business. Large companies such as automakers were already investing heavily, but most small and medium businesses simply couldn’t afford the months—and hundreds of thousands of Euros—required to implement automated systems. In fact, less than 10% of SMBs have any automation in place at all. We hadn’t found a company that could make robotics more widely accessible—until Robco.</p>



<p>Co-founders Roman Hölzl, Paul Maroldt, Constantin Dresel and their team have developed a fully modular robotics platform—like high-tech Legos that, unlike current solutions, can easily adapt when a manufacturer’s needs change. Every device also comes with fully integrated “digital twin” software that makes deployment incredibly easy and fast; configuring or re-configuring a system takes just a day or two instead of months, and costs dramatically less than comparable options. In other words, Robco is exactly what we’d been hoping to find: a solution to an SMB’s biggest pain point, that an SMB could actually afford.</p>



<p>As we got to know Roman, Paul and Constantin, our early convictions grew stronger. The three of them met while studying robotics at the prestigious Technical University of Munich, and between them have many years of robotics experience in both research and industry. They also have complementary skill sets: a former competitive skier, Roman’s need to win fuels a strong commercial sense, while Paul and Constantine bring deep technical expertise. Together, they share an ambitious vision to make Robco the robotics leader for SMBs all over the world.</p>



<p>And in their home city of Munich, they’ve found the perfect place to begin. Germany boasts a considerable pool of talent in robotics—and while many companies in the space are reliant on China and increasingly broken supply chains, Robco enjoys a steady, local supply of parts. Germany is also a hub for the kinds of customers who need Robco most: the country is a global leader in manufacturing, and many of its factories are located in rural areas, where labor shortages have been particularly acute.</p>



<p>We’ve already seen how Robco modules are helping customers in Germany and beyond weather staffing challenges while scaling output and improving quality, and this is just the beginning; the company is growing rapidly just months after entering the market. On behalf of Team Sequoia, we are thrilled to partner with Roman, Paul, Constantin and their team, to lead this Series A round, and to support them as they continue that growth and explore even more exciting new use cases. We believe this is an historic moment of opportunity for robotics—and for the human creativity it enables—and we hope someday, manufacturing floors everywhere will be a sea of Robco aquamarine.</p>

<p>Dear Yu Yuan,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disagree with your ideas about coding a new digital universe, because I know that baked into the structure of it will be plans for bets to be placed on human futures by AI portfolio traders like BlackRock’s Aladdin computer through social impact finance schemes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also know that high-level behavioral psychology has been encoded into the “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/07/08/digital-nudging-data-devices-social-control/">good behavior</a>” nudges that will come with programmable public benefits and digital community currencies. I am coming to see that this is all tied to genetic algorithms and complex adaptive systems theory managed through artificial tokenized economies brought to scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No cybernetic emergence or “Game B” for me, thank you.</p>

<p>People like <a href="https://archive.ph/MiIgn">Christopher Ricciardi</a> who helped bring down the global economy in 2008 through Collateralized Debt Obligations are preparing for the next round, which is built on the “Learning Economy” model. As I see it, the goal is for machine consciousness to try to “learn” us in sufficient detail that it can acquire some version of a conglomerate soul. I don’t think that can happen, but I sense that much harm will result from the process.&nbsp;</p>
<a href="https://archive.ph/MiIgn"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://archive.ph/MiIgn">https://archive.ph/MiIgn</a>
<p>Preparations are underway for a digitally twinned global labor force where standardized cognitive and “soft skills” will be documented as badges, micro-certs, or Soulbound Tokens. Artificial intelligence can then assign gig work and curate “just-in-time” teams to “solve” all the terrible problems created the industries that are now “investing” in our cognitive capital. This process is being undertaken by the World Bank in coordination with NGOs and think tanks like the Learning Economy Foundation and Brookings Institute. Behemoth investors in human capital “improvement,” like the members of the Impact Management Project, will call this progress and earn social impact payouts under the banner of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4, Education. Such payouts will be made based on data dashboards. Impact data will be fed to analytics firms like Ocean Protocol where it can be reused to refine artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Some of us know where this is headed, and we do not consent. I believe you know that there is no place for dissenters. Those without a unique ID that can be read from space will be outcast. </p>
<p>In any event, I’ve made my intentions clear. I stand with natural life. Even if it is as you imagine, a simulation.</p>

<p>This past June, IEEE issued a <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/XR_Metaverse_Governance.pdf">Global Initiative on Ethics in Extended Reality Report: Metaverse and its Governance</a> and held the first in a series of webinars called Metaverse Congresses. I found out about the series and caught the tail end of <a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/IEEE-Metaverse-Congress-Series-3.html">the third one</a>. You can watch the recording of it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c88LOo9Kbtg">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They must have had me in their email list, because I got an automated message for the<a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/Metaverse-Congress-5.html"> fifth session</a>. They alternate between English and Chinese, and the fourth had been in Chinese. I wasn’t sure that it was worth setting aside time to watch, but when the reminder came up I ended up logging in and realized I was the ONLY non-presenter participant. Incredible. So I stuck it out for all three hours and screen recorded most of it. The last half hour or so were dropped, unfortunately. During that wrap up Mr. Coughlin asserted that having a permanent record of our lives would help make us better people and more understandable to others. Near the end, Yu Yuan stated he believed we were already in a simulation, and the creation of a very high quality engineered version was his personal goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not sure how it came to pass that I ended up in a chat with the father of wearable computing, the grandfather of virtual reality, the incoming president of the IEEE, and the head of their Standards Association, not to mention professors from MIT Media Lab and Cambridge and executives from Qualcomm and Epic Games. I laid out my case, trying my best to represent the interests of the people of the world who have only the vaguest idea of what extended reality portends.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/Metaverse-Congress-5.html"></a></p>
<p>Over the past couple of days I added supplementary documentation to my comments: screenshots, reports, and videos that have informed my thinking. But after having spent a lot of time on it, I realized the images actually disrupted the flow and made it hard to read. So, I decided to do two versions. This one is just the comments, and the second will have the supplement for those who want to do a deeper dive. It’s sort of a one-way conversation, but if you watch the screen recordings, you’ll possibly be able to knit my thoughts together with what was being presented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I tried not to make anyone wrong. I hope to appeal to people’s better natures. All of us are living in personal silos, custom plot lines. That’s what “knowledge management” is about, and I can only imagine what it will be like once the tokenized, augmented attention economy is in full swing. Yu Yuan asked to be in touch, so I sent him an email that I will share as a separate post. I have not gotten a response yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incoming IEEE president asked me, “Who are you, what do you do?” </p>
<p>I’m a mom from Philadelphia. I read storied landscapes. I leave behind hearts. I believe that in the end love will win.</p>
<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/12/06/we-are-shapes-of-the-earth-arizona-hearts/"></a></p>
<p>For some reason the screen recording on the Youtube upload below is fuzzy. There’s a crisper version on Archive.org that you can access, and even download, <a href="https://archive.org/details/ieee-metaverse-congress-5-120822">here</a>. Mostly I did it for my own documentation purposes, which is why I included the names and comments. I suspect they’ll put out their own cleaned up recording in a month or so. </p>
<p>I’d love to know your thoughts on how I represented the interests of natural life on Earth. I’m simply grateful to have had the chance to put these ideas in the field.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:15 PM</p>
<p>I’ve read a paper that describes cyber-physical systems as an “outside-in” robot.&nbsp; Literally the goal is for us to live inside the robot and allow sensors to extract our data to train AI. Given work in consciousness studies and neuroeconomics around discernable neural activity (readiness potential) that precedes each human action, do you have concerns that natural life could lose free will within these digital environments? It seems we could easily become programmed “agents” in some global complex adaptive systems experiment. Perhaps the interface would be so seamless that we wouldn’t even realize it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:27 PM</p>
<p>Is the Educational Metadata effort meant to bring tele-presence / haptic robotic labor to scale? It seems this is what blockchain transcripts and digital twins are about, also soulbound tokens. Do you think it’s ethical to advance this with no labor protections in place? Most people have no idea what is coming. Shouldn’t there be informed consent about this new “future of work” model where AI decides people’s opportunities based on skills badges, including behavioral compliance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:31 PM</p>
<p>My research indicates there is quite a bit of activity around human capital investment – people being traded as digital futures commodities. This will come with blockchain finance agreements like income sharing agreements (ISAs). We saw what happened with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the 2007-08 real estate crash. I am very concerned about the use of digital twins. An example is the Learning Economy Foundation’s “LearnCard” digital twin program, backed by the World Bank, where global finance interests bet on educational achievement. Is this something you all are discussing? It would be terrible for the next “Big Short” to be vulnerable children, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:37 PM</p>
<p>I’m assuming people don’t have equal access to the same pool of information. Jeremy Pitt and Josiah Ober speak often of knowledge management being key to controlling the shift to digital life. Just like those “rose-colored” glasses, what will it be like to live in a world where information access is controlled by tokens and permissions at a granular scale? Like Vernor Vinge’s “Rainbows End” everyone will live in their own “view” through “wearing.” Someone or something (AI?) will control access. Have we thought seriously about what that will mean for society?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:38 PM</p>
<p>Another issue is that I don’t think most people are aware of the data that is harvested from wearables, including emotion. To what degree are we “teaching” machines how to perform “humanity?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Everyone: 12:39 PM</p>
<p>Free Will is extremely important in my view. I would try to address it in Panel 2 today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:40 PM</p>
<p>I noticed some of the funders backing Leif, a developer of alt-student loan products, came out of Warby Parker (and Wharton), so this is all making a lot of sense. Your glasses as your minder, just like our phones. This should terrify people TBH. How are we allowing this to move forward as normal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:41 PM</p>
<p>AR means that we will live under total surveillance. We will have to be watched from space or our environments at all times or the whole “persistent virtual world” stuff will fall apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:43&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Augmentation means we are essentially outsourcing our brain to a device. The next generation will not be expected to retain any knowledge. Rather they will be trained to rely on a machine to direct them. At any time, information can be disappeared or altered. Thus, there is no “reality” or “history.” There will only be the present in the XR rat maze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Everyone: 12:45 PM</p>
<p>Re labor protection and behavioral compliance, IMHO rulemakers will need assistance from standards developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:47 PM</p>
<p>What do the ophthalmologists say?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:48 PM</p>
<p>I wish we would all just admit this is about turning humans into sensors for AI -interoperable blockchain-based learning agents for the Singularity. It’s being sold to us as a solution for climate crisis and poverty, when really we’re just training our silicon replacements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 12:50 PM</p>
<p>Thinking about some of the discussions it seems to me that we need some discussion on security, root of trust and rules allowing people to know what they are allowing and respecting their choices on what they allow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:50 PM</p>
<p>I’m just having a hard time understanding why we would want to transfer our personal agency to see the world to a mediated device when we really don’t understand who is mediating the information delivered to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:51 PM</p>
<p>Even NTT’s March 2021 Human Digital Twin white paper says they have concerns about what happens when the data of the twin wants to sync back to the actual person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 12:52 PM</p>
<p>These are interesting points.&nbsp; Probably we need authentication methods to know who uses our information and for what purposes and to be able to opt out of sharing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How will we even be able to assess who can be “trusted?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:55 PM</p>
<p>In an extended reality world, our movements and activities will be determined by the tokens we have in our digital ID “wallets.” Privacy isn’t really relevant if our smart toilets get connected to smart locks on our front door and AI assesses our morning deposit before we are allowed to leave the house. Or if we don’t have enough tokens to say open the door of a store, or get on a bus, or go to a performance, or get a job. You can say we have privacy, but really life in a deontic logic web is going to be very, very rigid and who will we talk to when there’s a problem? No human is in charge of this “Decentraland” space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:00 PM</p>
<p>Global markets seek “impact” data to run their capital through natural life – humans and the environment. This data is placed in pools like Ocean Protocol to further develop AI. Global investors are using the UN Sustainable Development Goals to push “improvement” of poor people and the environment (mostly carbon sequestration) – “optimized” on data dashboards. That means life is put on a dashboard and is limited, very limited. They need us to live in the Metaverse to harvest the data to fulfill pay for success finance deals. See the Impact Management Project, 2,000 of the world’s largest asset holders. Gaming companies, including Epic, are involved in the social impact space. Do we really want to create digital automated systems to place bets on toddlers as they are trained to live in gaming environments? I can’t stay silent while this is rolling out. This isn’t about games – it’s about Complex Adaptive Systems. It’s about emergence of the Noosphere. This is what Teilhard de Chardin spoke of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 1:01 PM</p>
<p>Glad you mentioned Teilhard, and teleological thinking (e.g. Omega point?) will be key here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:02 PM</p>
<p>In 2016 Paul Meghan of Epic Games came to Philadelphia. He was in a panel hosted by Atlantic Magazine with Suzanne Del Bene (Microsoft, IoT Congress) and Constance Steinkuehler, UC Irvine. He said over and over the children needed to be trained to code his games. The panel was supposed to be on education and the creative economy. I realized about six months later that they want to force children to build your digital empire. This is profoundly unethical. You are stealing the children’s future and will sell it as social impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:03 PM</p>
<p>There is nothing in this future for artists. What is a world with no human-based art? Have we considered this? Again cheap, automated labor – so everyone will be forced onto UBI to “perform” humanity via wearables to try and catalyze the Singularity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:05 PM</p>
<p>The plan is to build this empire with unfree labor. Digital conquistadors. This approach will never support many stable living-wage jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:07 PM</p>
<p>The first digital item was the Utah teapot. People really should spend some time understanding the role of Salt Lake City in X-tended “life.” No surprise that it was the site planning the ARPA net and the human genome project and U of U Edwin Catmull’s school where Pixar’s roots are. Molecules – pixels – synthetic life for people who want to play God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:08&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>People don’t understand what is on the horizon. They are being distracted. Omega Point also relates to Swedenborg’s Church of the New Jerusalem. Most people don’t know Carnegie was raised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Church_(Swedenborgian)">Swedenborgian</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:10&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I highly recommend people read Oliver Reiser’s “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_World_Sensorium/eFYhngEACAAJ?hl=en">World Sensorium: Embryology of World Federation 1946</a>.” He was close with Julian Huxley who was close with de Chardin. It describes us as neuroblasts of the global brain – essentially agents in this programmed simulation. Who wants to live inside someone else’s program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Me: 1:10&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all the valuable comments, which lead me to think about inviting you to some of our future panels. Would you mind to send me a connection request on LinkedIn?&nbsp; I just tried to search you on LinkedIn but don’t know which one is you. Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:12&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>How is it that the first bank MakerDAO tried to bring into their digital assets is Huntingdon Valley Bank, a mile from Bryn Athyn Cathedral – the Pitcairn family’s estate? Pitcairn (Pittsburgh Plate Glass) grew up in the Swedenborgian Church with Andrew Carnegie in Pittsburgh. We need to know the history. Who knows what history will be in the Metaverse? Probably there will be no history, only different paths in an AI multiverse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 1:14&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>It is useful to consider dystopian models as cautions for what not to do, but I think it is going too far to assume that this is what is actually happening.&nbsp; It is up to us to figure out how to make sure that our technology helps us be more human, rather than less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:23&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Do you all have thoughts plans to position all of this software to build the Metaverse as “open source” “public goods” in the VC space? I have been looking into hyper-certs developed by David Dalrymple. Given the potential for cyber-physical systems to become an open-air prison – or non-consensual game, it would be ironic to have software firms be able to cycle their money through open source projects and make money even as the children build their heirarchical containment systems.</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:26&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I’d like to know about Epic Games ongoing activities in the social impact space.</p>

<p>I’d like to know where people see “play to earn” meshing with educational badging and human capital finance deals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:37&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I have been researching swarm intelligence and emergence. It seems that by pushing people to inhabit avatars and to adopt an identity of digital citizen we will be much more malleable. There is a huge push for e-government now. Digital ID will be required to obtain all sorts of public services. I think we need to understand tokenized governance as Kubernetes or cybernetics. Wiener aimed for programming the animal and the machine. So, we are getting closer, eh? The end of the world narrative is what allows humans to be pushed into digital realms. The only “sustainable” option is that we gradually dematerialize and lose our actual bodies to be replaced by piles of soul bound tokens. So much easier to run the simulations that way than with messy, chaotic embodied humans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To Thomas Coughlin: 1:39&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Right now, the average person has no understanding of the history of these technologies or who is in charge of the “game” we’ve been invited to “play.” How many people do you think understand that the seed funder for Niantic (pioneer in AR) was In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA? If people understood the origins of the game, I think they would be more cautious about walking this road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:41 &nbsp;PM</p>
<p>It’s wild to me that ten years ago I was buying Webkinz plush toys for my kid’s friend’s birthday parties. It was all about normalizing digital work for digital tokens to buy digital consumer content. We are so behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:41&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>So, where is the trust then? We have no idea who we are dealing with. It could be a machine. We are already unique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Identity politics are about meta-data tags for the simulation. AI needs us to be machine-readable. Wear your intersectional identity to be “seen” and calculated into the equation. I’m for real diversity, not digital commodification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:46&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I am a mother in Philadelphia. I started researching when the Boston Consulting Group closed twenty-three schools here in 2013. I follow money. I read white papers. I am trained in art history and cultural landscape analysis. I examine myth. I never realized the landscape I was destined to interrogate would be digital. The fact that I came in the education door is everything. This is about a machine consciousness attempting to use us (natural life) as an armature to manifest in the material world. Ironically, under the banner of sustainability, we are dematerializing ourselves even as our social impact data is being used to refine the embodiment of robotics.

<p>I’m just curious for people who were working in the early era of VR programming was there always the presumption that people would eventually spend a considerable part of their time “living” in digital spaces?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thomas FURNESS to Everyone:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:00&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>As an early pioneer of VR (virtual reality) I also felt that the use of VR spaces would be an adjunct to our living in real spaces and as such would be an appliance or tool that we may use daily like a telephone, but we would not ‘live’ in that space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:01 PM</p>
<p>Once we get to the point of being able to “record” experiences digitally, maybe even from a variety of points of view if there are multiple people involved, will the concept of “time” become distorted as we can log in and re-live past experiences? Maybe even “editing” them based on lived experience acquired since the prior memory? I find it very interesting that Scott Stornetta’s early DLT research (distributed ledger technology, preceding blockchain) was framed as a “time-stamped document.” Stornetta is LDA (correction-LDS) and of course Silicon Slopes and Utah are leaders in the digital identity space. Adobe was the key tenant for Silicon Slopes. What role might they play in permmissioned memory files? Of course University of Utah’s computer science department’s focus was both graphical design and file compression from the start. It seems to me that concepts of “time” and “history” and the “multi-verse” are very important for us to collectively consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:02&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Sorry for the typo – Stornetta is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and presented in March at the blockchain themed Mormon Transhumanist Association Conference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:04&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Thomas, I don’t think people have fully thought through this future of work plan. Richard Baldwin calls it Globalization 4.0. We work through telepresence robots where AI assigns “gigs” from among an available labor pool from around the world at the lowest price and with the relevant behavioral tokens, presumably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven’t looked into Suzanne Gildert’s Sanctuary.ai, it is very concerning. Even more so when you consider as we use “whole body” protheses in the remote gig work program, we are helping refine humanoid robotics. I worry for coming generations. I really do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:05 PM</p>
<p>I think you are worried about teaching AI to replace us, or are your concerns more than that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:09 PM</p>
<p>@thomas This is not simply a worry; it’s a fact. Look at the relationships among Ocean Protocol, Singularity.net, Hanson Robotics, and Cardano. Also see Blockscience, Commons Stack, and Protocol Labs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have concerns about dehumanized working conditions and global finance placing bets on our lives using digital twin simulations under the false premise that they are solving poverty and saving the environment. Look up social impact bonds, pay for success finance, income sharing agreements, and connect that with digital twins and smart contracts.The short video from 2016 by Institute for the Future “Learning is Earning” offers a window into where this is all headed. It’s real. I didn’t make it up. Charles Hoskinson says they are working with the Ethiopian government to track people from pre-k to determine who is a good actor and worthy of having a job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:11 PM</p>
<p>I worry about free will. I worry our education systems training people for deep expertise without breadth or imagination. I’m reading Yevgeny Zamyatin’s 1921 novel “We.” It describes a world run by mathematical logic. That is what you all are creating, whether you understand it or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:13 PM</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:14 PM</p>
<p>Clearly data storage is a huge issue. I’m curious about the future of DNA data storage. I realize the early research involved artificial DNA, but is there anything preventing In Vivo use? All of this emerging tech seems to go back to syn-bio and bio-tech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:17 PM</p>
<p>I know something about DNA storage with synthetic DNA.&nbsp; This use of DNA is not viable.&nbsp; What is your concern here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone:&nbsp; 2:17 PM</p>
<p>Viable from the point of view of being a living being, is what I meant.</p>

<p>FAIR principles – e.g.: <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles">https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles</a></p>
<p>On the imperative that in Web3 meta-data be: findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-useable. It seems such traits are needed for persistent virtual environments to function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:23 PM</p>
<p>As I understand it – the “global brain” “unified human thought layer” imperative goes back to Vernadsky, de Chardin, Julian Huxley. It is very much a eugenics program and seems intent on optimizing (and organizing) what some imagine is a rather clunky (inefficient) water-based life form into something more “portable” (perhaps even for space colonization). Trent McConaghy of Ocean Protocol is still echoing the sentiments of L5 in the mid 1970s – primates in cans wasn’t going to go well for interplanetary travel. I have been reading up on John Holland’s work with genetic algorithms. Much of the CAS (complex adaptive systems) work is built off genetic models. It is worth considering how bio-computation and eugenics will interface as we virtualize natural existence. I simply asked if there was anything prohibiting in vivo use of DNA data storage. (I’d forgotten they’d already accomplished this using live bacteria.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:26 PM</p>
<p>Elizabeth Merritt, futurist for the American Alliance of Museum, wrote an essay “A Learning Day 2037” was about virtualized museums. But of course, not everyone could access everything. It’s ultimately about knowledge management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:36 PM</p>
<p>I wish more people understood the imperative for speed and optimization means our lives have this pressure to move away from atoms towards bits. Richard Baldwin spoke of this around Globalization 4.0 – the speed of digitizing knowledge and service work and other work via remote pilots. Baldwin says the physics of the economy are going to blow everything out of the water. We just aren’t prepared for that transition. To be honest I see very little effort being expended to bring the public along so we can have an authentic conversation about possible benefits and trade-offs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:38 PM</p>
<p>I’m curious if any of you have read JD Bernal’s “The World, The Flesh, and The Devil.” He was a Cambridge-based crystallographer. The book was written in 1929. At the time he spoke of us living 100 years in a larval state and after that we would leave behind our physical body, put our brain in a can, and live through haptics including super-powered senses. It’s astonishing. This has been a very long time in the making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:41 PM</p>
<p>To me it feels like avatar “life” and programmable tokens in governance and economic systems are really about managing “teaming” to access the “adjacent possible” in complex-adaptive systems. Melanie Swan’s proposals for blockchain cloud minds where people enter into communal thought spaces for “problem solving” where contributions are tracked by neuro-nanobots on blockchain for future micropayments. Those spaces might include not only people, but machines, animals, plants, maybe? What happens if people are pressured to entered into these spaces against their will? In that way XR sociality starts to be very concerning.</p>

<p>In the planned “sharing” economy the plan will be limited choice. I think it mirrors “recirculation” in the Complex Adaptive Systems frame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:47 PM</p>
<p>I’m wondering if you all have been looking into wearables as tools for behaviorist conditioning – like Red Critter where teachers “zap” good behavior points to children via a device and wearable bracelets. Of course, these points would sync to one’s twin and if Charles Hoskinson’s model advances those points would follow you through your life and influence your ability to gain employment. In a worst-case scenario, it could be linked to geo-fencing or social opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:48 PM</p>
<p>Red Critter has a school-based model and a corporate leaderboard model. I can totally see this approach linked to something like Learning Economy Foundation’s LearnCard. Essentially a digital twin / geofence / social credit wallet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:51 PM</p>
<p>Are you all aware the new field of “social prescribing” and the potential for wearable tech to be used to “verify” compliance with such prescriptions? Social prescribing is being woven into human capital finance deals – pay for success. It’s about optimization of people – either through pathways set for education/training or health/mental health/wellness. Vulnerable populations are being pulled in these programs under the guise that it’s to benefit them. In reality it’s part of global finance deal flows and mass data harvest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:53 PM</p>
<p>Has anyone heard of using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to represent digital twins? I thought maybe it was more like an enclosed Voronoi polyhedron with moveable planes of influence via sensor / actuator feedback, but maybe it’s a directed acyclic graph instead – or both. Carsten Stocker of Spherity in 2018 tech conference on how the Fourth Industrial Revolution will change your identity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-tQw266Gfo&amp;t=0s">here</a>, playlist of relevant clips <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO7R9zSd1hQMRFSwRk0G9xiQ">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 2:54 PM</p>
<p>@Thomas Coughlin – great to mention metaphysics (and reminds of John Carpenter’s movie Dark Star, and the need to use metaphysics to try to defeat a too-eager AI-driven ‘smart bomb’)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:55 PM</p>
<p>Perhaps metaphysics defines us as more than our technologies and current knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:55 PM</p>
<p>Are you all familiar with Jonathan Ledgard’s proposal for interspecies currency? This is linked to sustainability-tokens, but some people might imagine these digital transactions being a form of “communication.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:58 PM</p>
<p>@thomas There’s a reason Nicholas Berggruen studied with Brian Copenhaver, UCLA Emeritus with a specialty in early modern magic, and Ervin Lazslo studied Giordano Bruno.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 3:00 PM</p>
<p>@Joe – great point about reliability = not (always) being on ‘bleeding edge’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:01 PM</p>
<p>What role do you all imagine frequency will play in research around non-surgical Brain Computer Interfaces? In a recent talk with Juan Benet, Adam Marblestone spoke about the use of ultrasound to get beyond the blood brain barrier. We are installing sensor networks everywhere that will affect us as water-based crystalline life forms. Again, I don’t think the general public has enough context to interrogate this future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:03 PM</p>
<p>TBH, I find digital spaces actually create a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Everyone: 3:03 PM</p>
<p>Then another popular question would be, how do you know we are not already living in a digital space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:04 PM</p>
<p>Social media has encouraged many people to develop their identities as a series of meta-data tags that are shifted through real time affirmation or rejection. This practice is leaving us totally without an anchor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:04 PM</p>
<p>Caves within caves within caves…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:05 PM</p>
<p>I’m sure Skinner would love to have had the extended lifespan option. We are navigating an endless digital Skinner box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:09 PM</p>
<p>That is a terrible idea. We are human. You are allowed to sometimes forget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 3:09 PM</p>
<p>@Thomas – many GLAM (Galleries/Library/Archives/Museums) now call themselves ‘memory institutions’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:11 PM</p>
<p>Also, sometimes people want to leave their pasts behind and start fresh. We learn from mistakes. Would you want to have all your mistakes recorded on a permanent record? What will this do to us? Will we become a people afraid to live, because we might do it wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:11 PM</p>
<p>There is a huge question of machine optimization. This is Taylorism. The John Holland book is all about pushing specialization. The Adam Smith pin factory. Do we want a world of specialists?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:12&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>The EU-driven GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) includes a ‘right to be forgotten’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:12 PM</p>
<p>You don’t need a digital twin to be more human. Also, let’s be honest XR is a video game built from state intelligence / military R&amp;D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:14 PM</p>
<p>Who’s been building synthetic people for decades – USC Institute for Creative Technologies – ex-Disney folks partnered with the Army Research Lab. That doesn’t make it an attractive option. It’s not like MK Ultra ever really ended. There is a struggle for consciousness – ongoing for many, many years. Who will stand for natural life and say we don’t want to coat it in nano – NEMS, MEMs – for panopticon optimization?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:15 PM</p>
<p>Of course, it has to be standardized. The noosphere is a global project and it has to be open source, because all the children have to build it so the global hedge funds can make money on their coding skills improvement. You can’t have remote telepresence robotic labor pools without global standards. Where would JSTA’s Moonshot project be without standards?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:16 PM</p>
<p>Give me a break. No one is going to be forgotten in extended reality (XR). Eventually, a moving object without a tag will be identified from space as an anomaly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:18 PM</p>
<p>I’d love to know what’s up with Open Mustard Seed these days. No one is going to be allowed to NOT have a digital ID. They’ll get us via health passports, digital driver’s licenses, blockchain education transcripts. There will be no room for people who don’t want this, and it will be all sewed up by the time people realize what actually happened. Or maybe everyone will be so hypnotized with dopamine they won’t notice. It’s a toss-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:19 PM</p>
<p>Actually, the public deserves to be a participant in these discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:20 PM</p>
<p>Someone tell Stanford; why did they invent a smart toilet? Why are there anal sphincter biometrics?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to All Attendees: 3:20 PM</p>
<p>Folks, I have to leave now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to All Attendees: 3:20 PM</p>
<p>Good to join this interesting discussion!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:22 PM</p>
<p>But embodiment is huge. That’s the goal of the roboticists – to use us to learn how to be in a material world. Bodies do matter. I agree consciousness is not limited to the body, but it still matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:23 PM</p>
<p>Does it matter to you that this is military technology?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:24 PM</p>
<p>How can we set aside global investigations into altered states and consciousness and torture?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:25 PM</p>
<p>To me this line of thinking shows a profound disrespect for the actual world. It’s like playing God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:26 PM</p>
<p>Science has been shown to be wrong so many times. Why do we think we can control the universe? To me it is like asking people to live inside personalized boxes that hide our understanding of the actual wonder of the universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:28 PM</p>
<p>Last week I toured Biosphere2. Those were some very sad plants. It was a dismal failure on the environmental front and the social front. Maybe that’s why people want to make everything digital, because they can’t control the real world to the degree that they want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>But this is a global plan and a majority of people have not agreed to do this, in fact they don’t even know what is planned. I don’t think you can force people to “transcend” using coercion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>Virtualizing the world is not going to save the earth. None of this is sustainable. It’s not. What we are doing with syn-bio and NEMs (nanoelectromechanical systems) and MEMs (microelectromechanical systems) is unethical. It’s terraforming for a new type of life. It’s not being a good relative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>@Thomas Furness – very much appreciate the thoughts shared about ‘one and many’ – individual in community – and whole is greater than sum of parts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:31 PM</p>
<p>People have no idea what this really is or who built it or what it’s meant to do. They don’t. Most people have no idea about the Omega Point. How can we make these decisions, an open secret, that will deprive future generations of their birthright – to be natural beings?</p>

 This is a guest post by Roma Wilson, Quantum Heart Cafe, describing how data and technology is being used to create intelligent communities in Vancouver BC. 
<p>As I have been learning more about the planned roll out of Web3, social impact investing, and smart cities, I’ve been paying more attention to advertisements and local media I come across while out for walks or waiting at the bus stop.</p>
<p>One I saw recently was a real estate advertisement for a recently built community called <a href="https://ambergateliving.ca/">Amber Gate</a>, situated in what is currently called Burke Mountain, Coquitlam BC.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Burke Mountain community was built on the lands of the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nations. It was a homesteading community where immigrants were expected to work the land until they were eligible to own it. It has now become an urban community, part of Vancouver/Lower Mainland.</p>
<p>When I first saw the advertisement for Amber Gate I wondered if it was a pre-planned smart city community, because the logo for it is a tree branch with leaves connected to a main branch. That imagery put me in mind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunking">trunk networks</a> used in IT infrastructure.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When I looked at the list of <a href="https://ambergateliving.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AG-Features-List-22-09-29.pdf">features and amenities</a> residents of Amber Gate would receive, a few jumped out at me. Among them were on-site daycare, plug-in for EVs, and a bicycle repair shop. This is important because <a href="https://view.publitas.com/translink/transport-2050-regional-transportation-strategy/page/1">Vancouver hopes to eliminate private vehicle ownership by 2050.</a>&nbsp; Also included in each townhome are work-from-home-ready wired ethernet and USB ports for smart devices, and it was all these amenities and features that sent up some red flags.</p>
<p>I did an online search for the phrases Coquitlam and smart cities to see what connections the municipality has to the smart city initiative and what public-private partnerships they’ve established with various organizations. An organization I came across right away is the <a href="https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/">Intelligent Community Forum</a> (ICF), a global think tank that comprises a network of cities and regions working together to push the smart city initiative.</p>
<p>The ICF nominates seven cities/regions every year that are working on smart city initiatives from a list of twenty-one cities. Coquitlam, along with a number of other cities in and around Vancouver, made the <a href="https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/smart21">Smart 21 Communities of the year back in 2021</a>.&nbsp; Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odOySk7NIGg&amp;t=272s">brief presentation</a> of what the Smart 21 Communities initiative aims to do, which is make cities go from “smart” to “intelligent.”</p>
<p>ICF’s co-founder, <a href="https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/louis_zacharilla">Louis Zacharilla</a>, developed the Smart City awards and has overseen the development of smart city institutes around the world. Louis is also Director of Innovation for Space and Satellite Professionals International (<a href="https://www.sspi.org/cpages/board">SSPI</a>). The relationship between the Smart Cities initiative and space is something I will continue to research.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I wanted to write this letter is because this predatory system is trying to unfold at the local level. While Web3 implementation is global, it needs local municipalities to provide infrastructure and planning.&nbsp; This inspired me to learn about what’s going on in my own part of the labyrinth.</p>
<p>Louis Zacharilla can be seen in this clip talking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY2zStebDN8">how technology and data can give a city a soul.</a> I wonder if that is Smart Cities’ intention, to be the shapers and modelers of each community’s soul.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve also been learning more about the differences between the Western Imperial worldview and Indigenous worldview from a book written by Vine Deloria Jr. called ‘<a href="https://archive.org/details/godisred00delo">God is Red: A Native View of Religion</a>.’&nbsp; One of the important differences is the West’s obsession with chronological time and progression of both historical and future events. Whereas, Indigenous Nations living on North Turtle Island place more importance on space and how they relate to those spaces through their ceremonies, stories, rituals, and so on.</p>
<p>This has inspired me to think about my place in the labyrinth. I wonder if a key to navigating it is through rooting myself to the places I am a part of and re-learning how to relate to them and how to relate to the beings that also inhabit the same spaces.</p>

<p></p><p>December 8th, 2022. Panther, a cross-chain application that will allow retail users as well as institutions to access DeFi privately and compliantly, has launched its v0.5. This was achieved by the protocol’s community in conjunction with Panther Ventures Limited, a Web3 development company destined to develop the blockchain technology and zero-knowledge components of Panther.<br></p><p>Panther Ventures Limited collaborators developed the protocol’s software and released it under a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/23/uniswap-v3-introduces-new-license-to-spoil-future-sushis/">BUSL License</a>, which grants users the right to copy, modify, create derivative works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work. The Licensed Work will eventually be made available under an Open-Source License, as stated in this License.<br></p><p>The development of Panther’s v0.5 was also aided by the Panther Foundation, which focuses on promoting privacy and fostering the Panther ecosystem. The Panther community discussed and established the terms for v0.5’s launch and voted upon them on the protocol’s <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot.org space</a>. <br></p><p>Besides issuing rewards through its staking solution, Panther’s v0.5 will allow Panther’s community of contributors to test the technological primitives that will be used by the Mainnet launch of the full protocol to enable confidential DeFi. This allows Panther to start testing and utilizing key technical components of the main protocol incrementally. <br></p><p>Panther’s upcoming version 1.0 will allow retail users as well as institutions to interact with DeFi without undergoing the risk of having their transaction history being exposed or copied by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. <br></p><p>This will be a major milestone that will offer a solution to the biggest challenge facing DeFi: onboarding institutions, legacy players, and FinTechs into the Web3 financial paradigm compliantly and confidentially.<br></p><p>To access Panther's v0.5 and learn more about the technical components of Panther, <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/">visit the project’s website</a>.<br></p><p>Press contact: press@pantherprotocol.io<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a><br></p> About Panther Ventures Limited <p>Panther Ventures Limited (PVL) is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing Panther Protocol informed by its community.<br></p> About the Panther Foundation <p>The Panther Foundation supports Panther’s purpose to promote privacy, fostering Panther’s ecosystem and development.</p>

<p>Through the last few weeks, the Panther community and DAO have set the stage for this release with <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Panther Improvement Proposals (PIP)</a> <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x576701a7a07efe281cd4f04acbf589d0791e492117497d628a6dfc6e9eccda6b">6</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xd7fe6122175ed23696b88c8cdf34388923a03cdbb6c7281b83ff50347dac3991">7</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xb5d638eb5aad2819c210a2f1e06001a58819694717e8d04ca789304f06520fa1">8</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">9</a>, and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0c6f3fd9db866f99d7d0b343687b890cd3240495170f539efcc31f2dc216ebd5">10</a>. These proposals have covered everything from democratic procedures related to who is allowed to vote on DAO proposals under certain circumstances to the release of code so that it can be deployed by anyone in the Panther community. Furthermore, PIP-9 &amp; 10, which set out to launch Advanced Staking, formalized the terms for our upcoming staking program and allowed the community to deploy it independently. <br></p><p>As we get closer to this release, today we want to give you an overview of Panther’s v0.5 interface, as well as step-by-step walkthroughs on:<br></p>  Checking your balances —available $ZKP, staked $ZKP, rewards, and PRPs (both “Expected” and “Unrealized”, see below).  Staking $ZKP  Unstaking $ZKP  Looking at your zAssets  Early $zZKP Redemption<br>  <p>Let’s get started.<br></p> What is Panther’s v0.5, aka Advanced Staking?<br> <p>Advanced Staking is a progressive step toward the development of the core technologies surrounding the Multi-Asset Shielded Pool, in particular, the way UTXOs are created, managed, and tracked. Within Advanced Staking, users will be able to shield assets and receive them as rewards but not transact with them until v1’s launch.<br></p> What kind of rewards are issued in Advanced Staking?  Staking Rewards<br> <p>The number of tokens to be released as rewards in Advanced Staking is 6,000,000 $ZKP.<br></p><p>The formula for distributing rewards is the following:<br></p><p>Reward = Amount * APR * Period / 365 APR - 15% Period - 60 days<br></p><p>Where: <br></p>  Reward: reward for a stake ($zZKP)  Amount: amount staked ($ZKP)  APR: Annual Percentage Rate (%)  Period: rewarded period (days)<br><br>   PRP Rewards <p>In addition to regular staking rewards, Advanced Staking stakers receive Panther Reward Points. PRPs are non-transferable points associated with a user's wallet address. The mechanisms that generate PRPs will also be employed on MASPs in Panther v1. When Panther v1 is launched, PRPs will become redeemable for $zZKP through a one-sided Automated Market Maker.<br></p><p>There are two types of PRP rewards:<br></p>  Expected PRP Rewards: The first 2000 stakers will be rewarded with 2000 PRPs per stake, as decided by the community through PIP-9. These rewards will not continue growing or change (i.e., they are “flat”). Users will be able to see them on the Balance Card on the Staking page. This type of PRPs will be awarded automatically and is not forfeitable.  <p>Users that qualify for this kind of rewards will receive a “stake-proof” NFT allowing them to access their Expected PRP Rewards once v1 is launched.<br></p>  Total Unrealized Privacy Rewards: These will be calculated and accrued based on the Privacy rewards APR, which will be decided by the community through a Panther Improvement Proposal. This APR will be set through a PIP before v1 is launched. This kind of PRPs will only be awarded when v1 launches and only in case a user has kept their $zZKP rewards in the pool until v1. If $zZKP rewards are redeemed via early redemption mechanics, the user will lose all of his accrued PRPs of this kind.<br>  <p>All PRPs will be available to exchange for $zZKP via the single-sided AMM at the time of v1’s launch.</p> Accessing Advanced Staking <p>The Advanced Staking app will be accessible through a fully decentralized front-end, routed through a Panther subdomain, at the time of release.<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE (Dec. 8th, 2022): Currently, Advanced Staking is only accessible through the "Launch app" button on Panther's <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io">Home page</a>. Eventually, an ENS domain will be enabled. For now, only access through this button. If someone attempts to send you a direct link to the staking solution, please report them.<br></p>The Advanced Staking home page, as it looks before any interactions.<p><br>To use it, you must connect your MetaMask wallet. To do so:<br></p>  Click the blue button on the top right.  Select the account (wallet) where you have $ZKP and click “Next.”  Click on the “Connect” button to allow the app to see your address and balance, and suggest transactions for you to approve.  Select the network where your $ZKP is (Polygon or the Ethereum Mainnet) from the drop-down menu in the top right. A MetaMask pop-up might ask you to confirm this change.<br>  <p>If you can’t see your $ZKP balance on MetaMask, it could be because of three possible issues:<br></p>  You might not have any $ZKP in your wallet.  You might have the wrong account or network selected.  $ZKP may not be added as a tracked token in your MetaMask.<br>  <p>The Advanced Staking interface provides an “Add ZKP token” button that facilitates addressing the third issue. After you click this button and accept the prompt, your $ZKP balance will be displayed in the wallet’s interface.</p> The Advanced Staking App<br> The Advanced Staking application, as it looks after staking tokens.<p><br>The Advanced Staking app has two pages, one for Staking and one for managing zAssets. Our top Menu also links to Panther’s <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">snapshot.eth</a> space, where Panther’s governance proposals are voted on. On the right side, the blue “Connect Wallet” button allows the user to give permission for the app to see and interact with their MetaMask wallet. This is necessary for the app to suggest transactions in which the wallet interacts with the Advanced Staking smart contracts.<br></p><p>The Staking page is the app’s homepage. It allows the user to:<br></p>  Stake or unstake $ZKP.  Check their balances of unstaked $ZKP (available for staking), staked $ZKP, $zZKP rewards, and Expected PRP Balance.  See how much unclaimed $zZKP rewards are left for the Advanced Staking program and the current staking APR.  The time remaining until the staking program ends.<br>  <p>On the zAssets page, the user can:<br></p>  Check their total balance per zAsset (through Advanced Staking, the only zAsset available will be $zZKP).  Inspect their $zZKP, Unrealized Privacy Rewards balance per individual stake, and total.  Redeem $zZKP before v1 is launched.<br>  <p>Let’s take a look at the different features and displays of each page:</p> The Staking page — Staking and Unstaking <p>On the left side of the Staking page, you will find the Balances Card. This panel shows the user’s available $ZKP, staked $ZKP, zZKP rewards, and Expected PRP Balance. Next to each $ZKP or $zZKP balance, an approximate USD value is provided.<br></p><p>The panel also displays the user’s MATIC/ETH (depending on the network they’re connected to) balance in the top right corner. Make sure you have enough MATIC/ETH to pay for the transaction fees required for some steps of the staking, unstaking, and rewards redemption processes.<br></p><p>To refresh the values, click on the refresh icon to the right of “Available ZKP balance,” and a MetaMask signature request will pop up. You will need to accept it, which does not incur gas fees.<br></p><p>Note: Data updating can take time. Please keep an eye on the spinning wheel inside the “Available ZKP Balance” field in the top right corner. As soon as the wheel stops, data should be up to date (but you might need to refresh the page).<br></p>The Balances Card.<p>Located to the right of the Balance Card, the Stats panel displays the amount of Advanced Staking rewards already distributed, the percentage of the total they represent, and the total rewards offered. It also shows the time left until Advanced Staking closes and its current APR. <br><br>Note: Staking APR and Privacy rewards APR are two different parameters. <br></p>The Stats panel. Staking $ZKP <p>The tab for staking $ZKP in Advanced Staking is located below the Stats panel on the Stake panel.<br></p>This is where the action happens!<p><br>You can input the amount of $ZKP you intend to stake on the box on the top or click the “MAX” button on the right side next to the Panther logo to insert your entire $ZKP balance automatically. The minimum stake size is 1000 $ZKP.<br></p><p>The warning below the amount box refers to the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">lockup period of 60 days set on PIP-9</a> to which all stakes in Advanced Staking are subject. Only after this period can you unstake your originally-deposited $ZKP. The lockup period doesn’t apply to the rewards from staking, as we will address on the zAssets Page session.<br></p><p>After the warning message, you can see a preview of the $zZKP and Expected PRPs staking rewards your stake will entitle you to. This preview is just a forecast, and final numbers may vary slightly.<br></p>Note that, as time progresses, you will accrue additional Unrealized Privacy Rewards (non-flat PRPs) on top of your initial amount (2,000, only for the first 2,000 stakes). These additional rewards will only be awarded if you keep your $zZKP rewards in the pool till v1’s launch.<p><br>If you’re satisfied, you may click the blue button. This step requires $MATIC/$ETH (depending on the network you’re on) to cover gas fees.<br></p><p>After clicking the blue button, three MetaMask windows will appear in quick succession. The first one will prompt you to approve Panther’s Advanced Staking contract to be able to move your $ZKP. The second window will ask that you accept the actual staking transaction. Gas fees apply to both steps.<br></p><p>After staking, you will be able to see your updated balance on the Balances Card and the zAssets page.<br></p> Unstaking $ZKP <p>_______________________________________________</p> IMPORTANT: The difference between unstaking and early redemption<br> <p>It’s important to understand the distinction between unstaking (of staked $ZKP) and early redemption (of $zZKP rewards). Unstaking and redeeming are separate functions of separate smart contracts.<br></p><p>A user can unstake $ZKP after their stake’s lockup period ends (60 days per individual stake). By doing so, only their original $ZKP stake is returned to their wallet. The accumulated staking rewards need to be redeemed separately.<br></p><p>A user can redeem their $zZKP rewards from a specific stake after 120 days since the launch of the Advanced Staking program. Doing so before the launch of Panther v1 necessarily entails forfeiting all Unrealized Privacy Rewards (one of two types of PRP rewards) associated with that stake.<br></p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>The Stake panel has two tabs: Stake ZKP and Unstake ZKP. You can switch between them through the buttons on the panel's top. The Unstake ZKP tab allows you to inspect and unstake your individual stakes.<br></p>The Unstake ZKP tab.<p>To unstake one of your stakes, click the “unstake” button on the right side of said stake. This will prompt you with a MetaMask window where you can confirm the transaction —gas fees apply. Your $ZKP will be returned to you once the transaction is confirmed by the network.<br></p><p>Exactly as with staking, you will be able to see your updated balance on the Balance Card and the zAssets page.</p> The zAssets page — Inspect your Unrealized PRP Rewards, and manage your zAssets <p>The zAssets page allows you to view and manage your shielded assets and Unrealized PRP Rewards, and redeem your $zZKP rewards. Extra functionalities will be available when Panther’s v1 launches.<br></p>This page shows the total amount of assets you have shielded and additional information about each stake. Checking your zAssets balance <p>As you can see, the Total Balance panel displays the balance of all of your shielded assets (zAssets) in USD, as well as your Unrealized PRP rewards balances.<br></p><p>Attention: in your very first time inspecting your zAsset and PRPs balances, the app will automatically prompt you to sign a message with MetaMask. Click the blue “Sign” button on the pop-up window to allow the app to scan the Panther Wallet and reveal your current balances to yourself only. <br></p><p>On your subsequent visits, click the “Refresh Private Balance” button on the right side of the panel and sign the message to get updated data to be displayed in the interface.<br></p>Each time you use this feature, you will need to sign a message (no gas fees required!) Private zAssets list <p>The panel below the Total Balance panel is the Private zAssets panel. It allows you to inspect the balance of each private zAsset you have, as well as the Unrealized Reward PRPs each stake has accumulated.</p>The Private zAssets panel.<p></p><p>Each zAsset line (for v0.5, only $zZKP is available) can be expanded to see and inspect the list of stakes that generated zAssets –just click the Expand button in the left of the zAsset icon. <br></p><p>The best way to optimize the rewards you can get from Advanced Staking is to wait for the release of Panther’s v1 to redeem them. However, by clicking “Redeem zZKP,” you can unshield the rewarded $zZKP into $ZKP and forfeit any further PRP rewards.</p> Early Redemption of Staking Rewards <p>At the time Panther’s v1 launches, all $zZKP rewards for Advanced Staking will be moved into a Panther Pool. Upon launch, the user will receive their Unrealized Rewards PRPs, and redeeming PRPs for $zZKP that you can transact within the MASP will become possible.<br></p><p>Stakers can redeem their rewards as ERC-20 $ZKP before the Advanced Staking period is finished through the Early Redemption mechanism. By doing so, they forfeit their Unrealized Rewards PRPs –Expected PRPs cannot be forfeited– receiving just the $zZKP provided upon staking. The Early Redemption mechanism will become available 120 days after Advanced Staking opens, 60 days before the end of the program.<br></p><p>To initiate an Early Redemption, click on the blue “Redeem zZKP” button on the right side of one of the entries in the list.<br></p><p><br></p><p>The app will warn you that using Early Redemption forfeits Unrealized Rewards PRPs rewards for that stake. You must tick the “I understand I will lose a part of my PRP rewards.” checkbox in order to continue. Then, if you want to proceed, you can click the blue button to redeem your $zZKP as $ZKP.<br></p>Early redemptions allow you to withdraw your $zZKP ahead of our v1’s launch.<p><br>A MetaMask prompt to sign a message will appear. Click “Sign” to confirm.<br></p>Signing carries no transaction costs.<p>The next step requires waiting 24 hours for your $zZKP to be available for redemption. After the time has passed, click again on the “Redeem zZKP” button. A pop-up will appear where you can click the “Redeem ZKP” button.<br></p>Your $ZKP, a button’s click away.<p><br>After clicking the blue button, two MetaMask windows will appear in quick succession. The first one will prompt you to sign a message exactly as before. The second window will ask that you accept a transaction —gas fees apply. Once the network has included your transaction, you will receive the redeemed $zZKP as $ZKP in your wallet. <br></p><p>After completing your transaction, please make sure that it was successful. Also, make sure to complete it within 24 hours of initiating it.<br><br></p> Want to learn more about the mechanisms behind Advanced Staking? <p>If you’re interested in learning more about the mechanics of Advanced Staking, upcoming blog posts and documentation will provide a complete breakdown of Panther Reward Points, including their importance, how they’re calculated, redeeming PRPs, and their relation to Advanced Staking.<br></p><p>For the extra curious, you can check out <a>Panther's documentation</a>, where we will be documenting the technological components of v0.5<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a></p>

You will learn about the prehistory to Nym and mixnet technologies and what we can expect for the privacy landscape going into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The rest of the curriculum is partly in your hands — soon you will get a chance to steer the ship together with your crewmates. Keep a close eye on the Shipyard Academy Announcement channel on our Discord&nbsp;server!</p><p>During this stage, you&nbsp;will</p>  Learn more about Nym, and how privacy is an intervention into societies that have become addicted to surveillance and pass a more difficult quiz (60% to complete the Academy and become a Sailmaker, 50% to receive&nbsp;rewards)  Continue to spread the word about Nym, its tech and vision by reaching people on social media (Mandatory to graduate from Stage&nbsp;3)  Extend the Nym infrastructure to underrepresented areas by spinning up mix nodes and gateways in these regions (eligible mix nodes will receive delegations, and gateways will receive Shipyard S<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">ervice&nbsp;Grants</a>!)  Privacy-enhance new apps by setting up gateways and service providers for a new app to run via NymConnect  Submit Proofs of Concept (POCs) using Nym clients that are good enough to convince our DevRel team (winners will receive <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-developer-grants-4a37a33be49d">Shipyard Developer Grants!</a>)  Or if your talents are with images and words rather than code, write a guest blogpost/ create a video or produce original artwork that localizes the issue of privacy and the benefits of Nym for your specific community or part of the world (mandatory for Nymja candidates)   Stage 3&nbsp;rewards <p>Before Stage 2, we decided to up the total prize pool by 15K NYM tokens, to 115K. This brings the maximum prize pool of Stage 3 to 55K&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Just like with Stage 2, the final size of the prize pool is once again in your hands! The prize pool will grow as we hit our common goals for this stage together. This is how it&nbsp;works:</p><p>Starting prize pool: 30K NYM&nbsp;tokens</p><p>Maximum prize pool: 55K NYM&nbsp;tokens</p><p>Common goals:</p>  2 POCs making use of Nym clients approved by the DevRel&nbsp;team  10 mix nodes and 10 gateways in <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">underrepresented areas</a> (meeting quality requirements)  1 new app privacy-enhanced via NymConnect  An original blogpost or video in a non-english language that explains the use of Nym for a situation relevant to people who speak that language.   Kick-starting Stage&nbsp;3 <p>You now have an advanced understanding of Nym: the problem Nym is solving and how the technologies are solving it exactly. It is time to bring this knowledge into the context of the communities you are part of: what are the main threats to personal privacy in your country? What is your government’s position when it comes to privacy? Where do you see the Nym vision fit into the picture? Write a tweet thread, blog post, create a video or artwork about the privacy issues of your community!</p><p>For our more technically-minded Navigators, it’s your time to contribute! Got an idea for an app making use of the Nym infrastructure? Got experience running nodes and want to run Nym infrastructure? Want to see more apps supported by NymConnect and ready to get your hands dirty? These are all in scope for Stage 3 of Shipyard Academy! Start organizing with your crewmates today and submit a POC, set up infrastructure in underrepresented areas, or enable new applications to be supported by NymConnect by setting up gateways and network requesters.</p><p>A note to Nymja candidates</p><p>To become a Sailmaker it is enough to attend the lectures and pass the final quiz 60% or more, and keep spreading the word about our mission on social media. Writing elaborate articles, submitting POCs or setting up infrastructure are not mandatory requirements.</p><p>However, as we are approaching the end of Shipyard Academy, we are busy creating our shortlist of Nymja candidates. If you want to become a Nymja, it is your time to shine! Whether by articulating our vision to your communities or by contributing to bringing the mixnet to new apps, use cases and regions, it’s time to show off that you are ready and capable to bring privacy to everyone, everywhere.</p><p>Good luck to all of you and see you on our channels!</p><p>The Nym Network is powered by the NYM Token, a utility token that can be used to access the network, run a mix-node, and NYM should only be used within the Nym mixnet. NYM is not a general purpose payment mechanism nor cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. For investment purposes, do not use NYM but instead look into Bitcoin or other investment vehicles.</p><p>The rewards of and participation in Shipyard Academy is only available to individuals who do not reside in locations that makes them ineligible to participate and/or receive prizes, including the United States, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, the Crimea region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic. Nym may request that participants provide relevant information as necessary, and can only process payments once cleared by the Nym legal&nbsp;team.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-academy-welcome-to-stage-3-6d1abe2a6c9e">Nym Shipyard Academy — Welcome to Stage 3!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Following our new weekly release schedule, new versions of the Nym software have now been released. <p>As always you can download the latest version of the interfaces and components from the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">website</a>. Nym software is <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/master">open source</a>, unpermissioned and can be forked by anyone wishing to extend functionality.</p> What’s new in Nym platform&nbsp;v1.1.2?   Mix nodes can now use the CLI tool to declare families if they are run by the same organization, read instructions (<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/mixnodes#node-families">here</a>). When an operator declares a mix node family, all the nodes from that family will be put in the same layer for privacy and security reasons. You should only create multiple nodes and put them in a family if your initial mix node is over saturated.  Initial zk-nym (Coconut) functionality including credentials and distributed key generation!  <p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-binaries-v1.1.2/CHANGELOG.md#v112">changelog</a> for a complete list of fixes and&nbsp;changes.</p> What’s new in NymConnect v1.1.2? <p>We have fixed the error with client where it would fail and disconnect unnecessarily</p><p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-connect-v1.1.2/nym-connect/CHANGELOG.md#nym-connect-v112-2022-11-29">changelog</a> for a complete list of fixes and&nbsp;changes</p> What’s new in the Nym Wallet&nbsp;v1.1.2? <p>Users can now buy NYM tokens directly from the wallet without having to go through&nbsp;KYC.</p><p>The service is provided by our partner <a href="https://bity.com/">Bity</a> and can be accessed in the wallet under a new section called Buy as shown below. The purchase limit is 1000 Swiss Francs per day and you can use BTC for purchase.</p><p>Please note this feature is not available to the users in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>That sums up this week’s release.

 Harness the Security of Enterprise-Grade MPC and Democratize it for Mainstream Users <p>As the leading non-custodial authentication infrastructure provider with over 8M monthly users, Web3Auth has launched the MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallet SDK. We are aiming to bring seamless logins and enterprise-grade security from the institutional level to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>To date, more than 20% of all mined Bitcoin is lost due to mismanaged or stolen seed phrases. To remove this main friction of web3 onboarding and key management issue, it’s time to say bye to the seed&nbsp;phrase.</p><p>On a mission to provide the most seamless login experience for users, wallets, and dapps, recently we integrated our MPC via @Metamask snaps. Take a sneak peek at a Web3 world without seed&nbsp;phrases</p><p>Other than Metamask, we are onboarding key Web2 gaming players like <a href="https://www.neowizglobal.com/">NEOWIZ</a> and <a href="https://glip.gg/">Glip</a> <a href="https://www.nafeza.gov.eg/en">NAFEZA</a>. Egypt’s newly launched customs platform for importing and exporting also leverages Web3Auth’s MPC technology to seamlessly and securely onboard its users to the blockchain.</p><p>A lot of exciting partners in the pipeline, but first let’s review some&nbsp;basics…</p> What is&nbsp;MPC? <p>MPC, or Multi-Party Computation, is Web3’s version of multi-factor authentication (MFA). It allows users to manage their keys intuitively by using multiple factors to protect their keys, instead of just relying on a single seed phrase to remove it in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This makes it possible to design crypto wallets that rely on multiple factors to access a user’s funds. It is currently the gold standard for enterprise-grade crypto custody solutions and is used widely by exchanges and financial institutions for managing&nbsp;crypto.</p> Why use MPC technology?   MPC is currently the golden standard for enterprise key management which Bitgo and Fireblocks currently offer.  Coinbase introduced an MPC alpha/beta into their wallet earlier in the year, and now we’re unveiling our MPC SDK that enables any wallet or app to do the same for their&nbsp;users.  Being able to build on the latest and greatest, we’ve optimized the infrastructure to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for globally-distributed low-latency signing.  Our MPC SDK leverages existing and familiar UI/UX flows, including simple one-click logins and others, check out the flow&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1022785836284129320/1034363507157782538/One_Click_flow.gif">here</a>   How is our SDK different from other MPC solutions?   Our MPC is the perfect Externally Owned Account (EOA) and can be paired with Gnosis Safe and other Smart Contract Wallet infrastructure (more on this coming&nbsp;soon).  The existing MPC solutions offered today are all targeted at large enterprises. These MPC solutions are expensive, require a long setup process, or are just too slow to run on consumer&nbsp;devices.  <p>We think that MPC is too important and too crucial of a technology to be kept out of reach of the average user. MPC security should be the standard for all web3 wallets today. As a wallet infrastructure provider, we have optimized our MPC SDKs to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for geo-distributed low-latency signing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a game, an app, a Chrome extension, or even a web wallet running in a mobile browser — our SDKs support&nbsp;that.</p> Our MPC technology key feature&nbsp;includes   1.2-second transaction speed (challenge it if you don’t believe&nbsp;us).  We are chain agnostic (secp256k1, ed25519, BLS and more&nbsp;support)  Our SDK can be embedded into any web, mobile, and native application.  The MPC SDK is geo-distributed and horizontally scaled for global distribution.  <p>For those of you that are already familiar with the multi-factor keys security model at Web3Auth, this blog is just another incremental step towards improving private key security.</p><p>For those of you who aren’t familiar, here’s how multi-factor keys&nbsp;work:</p> Leveraging our MPC SDK, you can expect the following benefits   Reduces account loss from misplaced seed&nbsp;phrases  <p>There is no seed phrase to manage — shares are managed by intuitive MFA flows that users are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>2. Prevent compromised device vulnerabilities</p><p>User accounts are not subjected to frontend vulnerabilities as MPC’s joint computation allows for keyless&nbsp;usage.</p><p>3. Avoid losing funds from dubious transactions</p><p>Safeguard your users’ accounts with a flexible policy engine to set rules — daily transaction limits and blacklist scams.</p><p>4. Expect fluid experiences</p><p>Expect a low latency of less than 1.5s for both login and transaction signing. Allow your users to focus on engaging with your&nbsp;product.</p><p>5. You own the UX, we can be a white-label service&nbsp;provider</p><p>Our MPC can be embedded into any dapp and/or wallet — you own the experience.</p><p>6. You Don’t need to compromise your stack, any platform any&nbsp;chain</p><p>Our MPC SDK is blockchain agnostic, it works on Web, Mobile, and Native applications.</p> Wanna try&nbsp;it? <p>We have an alpha SDK that you can use today <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/web3auth-mpc">https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/web3auth-mpc</a>.

<p>Yesterday was my birthday. I spent it setting intentions at the Titan Missile Museum in Green Valley, Raytheon’s Tucson Offices, and Pima County Community College (the East Campus). The latter has been part of the National Laboratory for Education Transformation’s efforts to shift coming generations towards a just-in-time, on-demand, conditional, gig, telepresence workforce model grounded in the use of electronic transcripts and digital twins.</p>
<p>Today is my last day in Arizona. Shortly I’ll head up Mount Lemmon in the Santa Catalina Range to soak up the gifts that nature has to offer in those lofty heights above the Sonoran desert.</p>
<p>I got up this morning and laid out the gatherings I have left. Most were collected here, though some were gifted to me by fellow travelers from Pennsylvania, Washington State, Colorado, and Florida – shells, tobacco, clover, tissue paper hummingbirds, “Green Pill” socks, and pressed flowers from a “cheer-me-up” bouquet. When I was done sorting through the worn gift bag that I’d been carrying around, the counter held a sprig of tiny peppers from the Presidio fortification remnants; a rounded piece of driftwood worn smooth by the seasonal rains in a wash near a Hohokam settlement; feathers from a local park; white stones from Cochise Stronghold; Mesquite beans from the landscaping outside the Raytheon building; wrinkled date palms gathered along the sidewalk opposite Michael Crow’s office at Arizona State University. The campus had many offerings – papery bark, Nandina berries, even an olive!</p>
<p>Over a celebratory soup supper one of my host’s friends asked me what I do about all of this? What do I do? Well, I make hearts. Some make plans to try and protect their retirements from digital currency. Some scout possible bug-out locations. Some work on local politics. All of those are fine things to do. We all have our paths. I try not to judge, and I hope others will not judge my approach. From my research I know that this system of domination seeks to harness the power of love and faith and imagination. They are trying to get us to teach it to artificial intelligence. Based on recent developments, GPTChat, it seems many are all too happy to oblige in this misguided mentoring process. Me? I try to be a storyteller who holds open the door for an alternate future. I go places and I try to tell their stories. All places have their story.</p>
<p>This system, as John Trudell so eloquently teaches, wants us to forget who we are. We are shapes of the earth. Our bones, flesh, and blood are made up of the minerals, stones, and liquids of the earth. In Arizona you feel this viscerally. Rocks are everywhere in every size and there is an energetic communion with them. A magnificent dance is unfolding all around us, a symphony of life that machine consciousness envies. This soulless creature stares down at us from space, attempts to secure our souls within its socio-technical systems, but we are like water. We flow through the rapids and the calm pools towards the sea.</p>
<p>I’ll be writing more hard-hitting research on Tucson after I get home, but until them I want to leave you with some of the intentions that I have set along the way. Consider these offerings and reflect on how these storylines get woven into a master narrative of domination through mathematical “progress” and optimization. My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO7kFkMnr7i9oDB-a067c_NY">new read aloud</a>, “We” written in 1921 by Yevgeny Zamyatin provides appropriate context for the coming smart contract layer of imposed logic. The antidote, in my opinion, is authentic communion with clear-thinking human beings and with the rhythms of nature and the through lines that connect us to our ancestors and task us with being good relatives to those who come after.</p>
<p>I embark today with a lei around my neck gifted to me by a strong woman of Hawaiian descent. It was handmade by her from Ti leaves transformed through rhythmic twisting into a deep, glossy green cable. Bits of leaf tips peek out. I imagine these as a wink and a nod that not all will be contained within the ordering system. She told me that she’d grown the plant from which this gift was crafted as a cutting. It was taken from her childhood home and carried many memories, including those of a grandmother who wore ginger flowers in her hair. Its appearance is not unlike the cording from an academic ceremony or liturgical vestment. It is my honor to wear it today and to bring it with me up the mountain where I will say a prayer that despite our frailties and inadequacies, or perhaps because of them, we will be able to carry a <a href="https://krinvan.com/2022/08/05/the-spark-of-hope-by-sharon-k-youngs/">shkitagen-held spark</a> for natural life through the miasma of differential equations, handing it off as many times as needed until we come out the other side. We are the sons and daughters of life. We are in need of healing, and we are healers. We need to remember who we are.</p>
<p>Blessings.</p>

Should founders even consider starting a business during a bear market? "100%," says Greylock general partner Reid Hoffman.

<p>In part 1 of our carbon removal series, we talked to Nan Ransohoff — Head of Climate at Stripe — about what it might take to jumpstart the market of carbon removal solutions. But what happens when there is a true, thriving market of buyers and sellers? How will suppliers effectively reach the right buyers, and as more solutions become available, how will buyers effectively vet the options?</p><p>In part 2, we address these questions and more, together with Brennan Spellacy, co-founder &amp; CEO of Patch – a growing marketplace for carbon credits.&nbsp;</p><p>We also cover many evolving market dynamics, like the potential differences between two sets of tons delivered, the opportunity and challenge of effectively educating buyers, the integration of software like Patch's API, verification solutions and their current limitations, how even the voluntary market is being held accountable for their carbon claims, and the role that Patch is playing to help develop this nascent industry.</p><p>By the way, if you like this episode, be sure to look out for part 3 of our series where we get into the nitty gritty of 3 emerging carbon removal solutions — ranging from biomass pyrolysis to carbon mineralization.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Patch’s website: <a href="https://www.patch.io/">https://www.patch.io/</a></p><p>Follow Patch on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/usepatch">https://twitter.com/usepatch</a></p><p>Follow Brennan on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/bspellacy_">https://twitter.com/bspellacy_</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find us on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund.

<p>I’ve been spending much of my time in recent months working to better understand the strategies being employed around swarm intelligence and complex adaptive systems. The goal is to catalyze emergent behavior through digital social engineering. I’m dropping in quickly this morning in to re-share two long talks I did about Twitter. At this point any researcher or influencer who centers Dorsey or Musk is, intentionally or not, obscuring the deep institutional structures from which the field of social physics emerged. IMO people would be better served by looking into the work of Sandy Pentland and John Clippinger on the Open Mustard Seed project and “self-sovereign” digital identity. If you want to avoid being managed, stop chasing the behaviorist pellets the feed is dropping you. You’re already tagged in the simulation.</p>

<p>TBH I believe the Neuralink hype is a distraction. While I’m not convinced those in power will ultimately be able to manipulate the mind or create group minds, this conversation between <a href="https://research.protocol.ai/authors/juan-benet/">Juan Benet</a> of Protocol Labs and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/amarbles/www/index.html">Adam Marblestone</a>, a former MIT research scientist and protege of George Church, on non-surgical Brain-Computer Interfaces is probably a more likely scenario. This discussion outlines their thinking on how that research will proceed and how to fund it.</p>

<p>Brands are navigating the new Web3 world, and its opportunity for experimentation, innovation, and engaging consumers in entirely new ways. In this season of <a>The Brave Marketer Podcast</a>, we’re discussing Web3 marketing and how to market in the metaverse.</p>
<p>The first episode of season 6 features an interview from Avery Akkineni, President of <a href="https://vayner3.com/">Vayner3</a>, a Web3 consultancy launched alongside serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk. Avery covers a wide range of pressing topics such as:</p>
 
 The difference between stunt campaigns and always-on marketing in the metaverse, and what it will take to succeed in Web3 channels. 
 Web 2.5, and why it’s going to be a game changer in 2023. 
 The best partnerships and activations that have happened in the metaverse so far. 
 
<p>Topics in this new 10-episode season include crypto marketing, privacy, cookieless advertising, the blockchain, and more. You’ll hear from marketers from some of the biggest brands and agencies including MintDropz, PlayEmber, Dentsu, and Skiff.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>In this new season, we’ll tackle the tough questions facing marketers today such as:</p>
 
 How do you advertise in the metaverse? 
 Is the timing right to jump in, or is it better to wait? 
 What should marketers ask when evaluating a metaverse strategy? 
 
<p>Listen to the trailer for Season 6 here:</p>

<p>The Brave Marketer podcast is hosted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnydvorin/">Donny Dvorin</a>, VP, Head of Sales at Brave Software—the makers of the privacy-respecting Web browser with a built-in ads platform that rewards users for their attention with the Basic Attention Token. Brave is the browser with Web3 users, and the best onramp to Web3 and the metaverse.</p>

<p>Today I head up to Tempe, AZ where I plan to spend a few days exploring the campus of Arizona State University, the playground of Michael Crow, founding board chair of In-Q-Tel. The school is a center of technological education and life gaming chock full of researchers tasked with delving into bioengineering, complexity theory, big-data “sustainability,” and new forms of participatory governance. Read the latter as kubernetes / cybernetics where we end up tokenized agents, components trapped in a global ant computer. I’m hoping to stop at the University of Arizona’s historic mathematical models display and the Tucson Presidio before hitting I-10, a testbed for driverless truck platoons. Is this what it feels like to live under a blanket of math?</p>
<p>Views of the saguaro cacti standing tall against the blue skies and the burnished golden hills are a balm for the soul. No, the game isn’t over.</p>
<p>Before I pack, I wanted to share a seven-minute clip I pulled from the November 29 meeting of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in which board member Hillary Ronen poignantly and firmly opposed giving official authorization to the police department to use bomb carrying robots to kill humans with government approval. After several hours of pointed debate the authorization eventually passed with eight in favor and three opposed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The reason I took the time to watch all 2.5 hours of the testimony last night is that earlier in the day I’d been researching Arizona policy around autonomous vehicle testing, and I came across recent legislation for a new form of vehicle they’ve called “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Neighborhood-Ocupantless-Electric-Vehicles-Arizona.png">Neighborhood Occupantless Electric Vehicle</a>” that is not intended for humans either as drivers or passengers. The vehicles are supposed to operate at 45 miles per hour or less on regular city streets. Folks, they may call these vehicles, but they are in fact mobile robots.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How will they be used? Well, Jason and I encountered “cute” miniature versions on the campus of the University of Arizona delivering GrubHub purchases to students in dorms. Unlike Kiwibots, which are remotely piloted for paltry wages by South American workers, the Cartken use AI to “learn” their surroundings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I started to build out my relationship map for Tucson, the importance of its legacy in defense research became very clear. First, of course, were the Apache wars, but in 1951 Howard Hughes brought a missile factory to the city. I’m actually treating myself to a tour of a Titan Missile Silo next week for my birthday. Now that they’ve weaponized space and set up next-gen nuclear for the human+ isotope nano-transducer global brain project, that silo has been decommissioned and turned into a National Historic Site.</p>
<p><a href="https://tucson.com/1951-hughes-aircraft-comes-to-town/article_539f8cca-4205-11e5-a218-cf62caadf8ea.html"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://titanmissilemuseum.org/"></a></p>
<p>After Hughes’s death, Hughes Aircraft’s assets eventually transferred to Raytheon. Raytheon and Lockheed’s offices remain tucked in against the airport on Valencia St on the south side of town. These days emerging defense-tech revolves around autonomous and remote-operated weapons coordinated through teaming – man and machine. Recently Lockheed ran an operation with their autonomous helicopter working in coordination with a Squad Mission Support System, a robust driverless platform developed by the US Army’s tank R&amp;D unit in Michigan. It doesn’t require a lot of imagination to see where this is all headed. Hollywood’s been making movies about it for the past thirty years.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3QYBvxzE8HLv8UqB9"></a></p>
<p>That is exactly like what was described during the discussion in the San Francisco Board of Supervisors’ chambers.</p>
<p>Hillary Ronen was correct in saying we are opening a Pandora’s box. For the sake of “safety” and “convenience” we are bringing remote killing to our own back yards. The US war machine’s drone strikes have come home to roost. The fact that in that room the vast majority of supposed liberals were emphatic in their embrace of advanced weaponry shows how flimsy their facade of social care is. I guess we can thank them for making it so very clear for us.</p>
<p>The first response to my clip was an inane comment deriding Ronen, the woman who took a brave stand against the rising robot tide. The tone and what was said made it very clear the person hadn’t actually watched the clip. Perhaps drugged by the feed, they felt a need to score political points by pulling out a hammer and pounding on the person on the screen because – well you know – San Francisco… Guys, this is making me so tired. Tired to the point that I don’t want to do this anymore. Stop and be responsible for your own thinking and engagement. Many have handed their sensibilities over to the “alt” media machine. It’s running you on auto-pilot. It’s toxic. I deleted the comment. That person won’t be on my channel any more. Do better.</p>
<p>In order to stand on the right side of history, we must be informed and we must bear witness to what is unfolding. The entire session can be viewed below.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology is relatively young. Bitcoin leveraged decentralised ledger technology back in 2008, and in the early years, only a few people were aware of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, many other projects have adopted this technology, with varying degrees of success. Often, projects don’t go past a proof of concept, and even if they do, the outcome might not be what the project’s proposers intended. It is safe to say that blockchain, as a technology, has not reached maturity.</p>



<p>There are multiple reasons why a blockchain project might fail, or yield a low return on investment (ROI). These reasons include, but are not limited to:</p>



  Attempting to apply blockchain to everything  Steep learning curve  Compliance pitfalls, including data regulations  Lack of vision  Focus on monetary profit, rather than addressing and solving a problem  Use of the wrong technology  



<p>This article explores the circumstances that often lead to blockchain projects having a low ROI, and how this can be overcome.</p>







 1. Attempting to apply blockchain to everything  



<p>Decentralised ledger technology does have the capacity to disrupt a fair amount of industries, and in fact, it has already done so, and will likely continue along this path of disruption and innovation for years to come.</p>



<p>But the problem lies in that blockchain, while extremely versatile, is not the right solution for everything. Fledgling entrepreneurs often use it as a buzzword and believe that blockchain will suit their projects, no matter what. Making this assumption without a proper assessment and due research is unwise, to say the least.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adopting blockchain technology is a decision not to be taken lightly, and so entrepreneurs, or any business considering the implementation of a decentralised ledger, should look inward and look for the answer to these questions:</p>



<p>Is the legacy system no longer fit for purpose? Has it become too antiquated or expensive to maintain or update? Does the company have a way to obtain reliable data that can be fed into the blockchain?</p>



<p>Even if the answers to these important questions suggest that blockchain technology might be a suitable solution, the implementation of a blockchain network is not for the short term. Businesses must carefully consider the long-term implications, in terms of scalability (will the system be able to scale and accommodate higher numbers of transactions), complexity (does the company have the expertise to implement and maintain the technology), and ongoing costs (more nodes, bandwidth, etc.).</p>



 2. Steep learning curve  



<p>Blockchain technology does require a certain level of expertise. A blockchain is not an off-the-shelf product. Often, they require practical knowledge and expertise in certain programming languages that are specific to a blockchain (Solidity for Ethereum is a prime example of this). While there are millions of software developers out there, only a limited amount have the right skills in blockchain code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to this, the implementation of a decentralised ledger requires expertise in cryptography, smart contract programming, and very importantly, a functioning governance system. The combination of all these factors means that creating and maintaining a thriving blockchain ecosystem does require a steep learning curve.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Compliance pitfalls, including data regulations 



<p>Regulatory compliance can be defined as the acceptance, understanding, and commitment to follow all state, federal, and international laws and regulations that might be applicable and relevant to a company’s operation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Blockchain compliance</a> is therefore a hugely important issue for any business. Adhering and complying with local legal frameworks and regulations helps protect the company’s resources, uphold its brand reputation, and ensure that the company can remain in operation across different markets.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has often found itself at odds with compliance guidelines, particularly in relation to privacy and data sharing, governance, and storage. The implementation of a solid governance framework is essential to the survival of a blockchain project.</p>



 4. Lack of vision  



<p>Entrepreneurs who decide to start a blockchain project just because it is fashionable or because they believe they can make a quick buck are probably doomed from the start. Blockchain is not a buzzword, nor is it a silver bullet that will magically make a product or project succeed. Establishing a thriving blockchain ecosystem is the result of a lot of work by a team of skilled professionals. Lacking a proper vision as to what the project or product should be, its real-world applicability, and the use case it fulfills is likely to lead to failure.</p>



 5. Focus on monetary profit, rather than addressing and solving a problem 



<p>Some entrepreneurs are out to make money, and though financial profit is of course necessary to stay in business, it should not be the primary objective. Projects that overemphasise the bottom line are not likely to be viable in the long term. A blockchain project must provide a real solution for a real problem, rather than manufacturing a non-existent problem to justify the use of a blockchain.</p>



 6. Use of the wrong technology 



<p>There are many blockchains out there: Ethereum, Bitcoin, Hyperledger, Corda, etc. Often, projects simply use the first one that comes to mind, which is usually Ethereum. Then the realisation sinks in that the gas fees can become incredibly expensive, which means that a business case becomes unreachable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, it is often difficult and costly to switch to another blockchain that facilitates a project’s needs better. And while tools such as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can make it easier to switch to another more suitable blockchain. Picking the right blockchain at the start, whether it’s a <a href="https://zaisan.io/private-public-blockchain/">public or private blockchain</a>, can save a lot of headaches.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Issues like lack of compliance or clear vision, technological challenges, or poor planning can lead to a low ROI, or scupper a blockchain project altogether. It is up to the project creators to take all these factors into account and ensure that the use of blockchain technology is both justified, and sustainable. Because after all, blockchain technology, while a very powerful and versatile tool, cannot function on its own. It requires technical expertise and the right leadership to become a success.</p>







 Key takeaways 



  Blockchain technology is not the answer to every single use case out there  Decentralised ledgers do have a steep learning curve, which might lead to low ROI  Using the wrong blockchain technology can have disastrous results  Legal departments must ensure that blockchain networks are compliant with data sharing and storage regulations  Blockchain projects require a clear vision of the objectives to accomplish  Monetary profit must be supported by the resolution of real-world problems  Projects must conduct careful research to ensure they choose the right blockchain technology for their use case

<blockquote>Nov. 2022 Volume 1 Issue&nbsp;5</blockquote><p>Welcome to zCloak Network’s November Monthly Update! We concluded what the project achieved in the month of November 2022, including product and technology, partnerships, AMAs, and events. This series of newsletters are dedicated to keep our community members updated and well informed, so it will keep coming every month. Follow us and stay tuned for&nbsp;more!</p> Product and Technology <p>zCloak Network has completed designing and implementing its first DID method based on the W3C DID standard. The re-design of zCloak’s verifiable credential protocol based on the new DID has been delivered as well. The new DID method — did:zk — has been included into the W3C standard repository. You are welcome to check out the [Github repo](<a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/blob/main/methods/zk.json">https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/blob/main/methods/zk.json</a>) for more information.</p><p>For the product part, zCloak has updated its Credential Platform product combined and integrated with our new DID and VC protocol. We have designed a zk-guessing event based on this updated credential platform, and you can find more information in the Events&nbsp;section.</p> Partnerships  Scroll x zCloak&nbsp;Network <p>On Nov 23, zCloak Network announced its partnership with Scroll. They plan to work together to provide a privacy-preserving identity service on Ethereum L2 for Scroll users. The partnership will focus on bringing a W3C compatible DID and Verifiable Credential platform on Scroll’s L2 architecture. The collaboration will also include an exploration of call data cost optimization and general research on zk-STARK/zk-SNARK technology, etc.</p><p>There will be implementation of both parties’ technology and products within this partnership, mainly regarding identity verification, conveying trustworthiness, and privacy protection. Both zCloak Network and Scroll are bringing Web3.0 solutions to projects and users, and we believe our collaboration will drive higher trust within the Web3.0 world. Please stay tuned for&nbsp;more!</p> AMAs  BuidlerDAO Twitter&nbsp;Space <p>On Nov 3, BuidlerDAO and Winkrypto cohosted a Twitter Space on “Is privacy the next narrative?” The issue of data privacy has been a concern in Web3 for a long time. As regulations look to combine KYC and blockchain technology, this potential solution is being pushed to a high point. Though many projects have achieved privacy-preserving to some extent through different cutting edge technology solutions, they are still in early stages. This got people thinking and talking about whether privacy will be the next narrative of Web3. The Twitter Space invited speakers from Manta Network, PlatON, zCloak Network, and Oasis Network, and zCloak’s founder w3tester mainly talked about ZKP in terms of privacy-preserving technology and its advantages towards achieving the self-sovereignty of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Link for you to revisit: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1eaJbrDqqrQJX?s=20">https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1eaJbrDqqrQJX?s=20</a></p> Mirror World Twitter&nbsp;Space <p>On Nov 17, Mirror World gathered speakers from zCloak Network, SaaSGo, Ubiloan, and Motley Labs for a discussion space on the topic of “Better tools, Better Web 3 products.” With the past few months being a rough awakening for Web3 enthusiasts, this episode discussed the significance of SDKs to the Web3 environment and how projects can build and thrive together with product integrations. zCloak’s CMO Annabella attended as one of the speakers. She shared that user education is vital considering the differences in transition from Web2 to Web3, and developing tools for better accessibility takes time but is worth the&nbsp;price.</p><p>Link to the recording for you to listen to: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MYxNgeyVbzKw?s=20">https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MYxNgeyVbzKw?s=20</a></p> LegalDAO Twitter&nbsp;Space <p>On Nov. 21, LegalDAO hosted a Twitter Space about privacy and security in Web3. w3tester, the founder of zCloak Network attended as a speaker. Speakers from Oasis, zkSafe, and Glock Ventures talked about potential opportunities in the privacy track and the balance between data disclosure and user’s self-sovereignty. w3tester made his point on zCloak’s solution of VC with selective disclosure function respects user privacy and data sovereignty as well as supports organizations with a more convenient verification and validation process.</p><p>Links for you to revisit: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YpKkgMjPodKj?s=20">https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YpKkgMjPodKj?s=20</a></p> MetaBlox Panel Discussion <p>On Nov 25, MetaBlox invited speakers from Caldance, Memolabs, zCloak Network, and Arkreen Network to speak on the topic of “What is expected when telco technology meets BIot?”. zCloak’s CMO Annabella attended and shared her view on the meaning and value of combining blockchain and IoT, how to overcome incoming problems, and how zCloak’s privacy-preserving DID and VC solution can help solve some pain points regarding user experience in the Web3 industry.</p><p>Here’s the link to the recording: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1jMJgLMZnOWxL">https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1jMJgLMZnOWxL</a></p> LegalDAO Tencent&nbsp;Panel <p>On Nov 29, LegalDAO invited the founder of zCloak Network to their Chinese panel on Tencent meeting, on the topic of Web3 application and on-chain privacy protection. Along with speakers from different perspectives, w3tested discussed on points including how blockchain technology shapes “data sovereignty”, Web3 dark forest and how to break by privacy computing, how DApp analyzes and processes on-chain data, and the coexistence of Web3 and regulation.</p> Events  Halloween Quiz&nbsp;Event <p>As introduced in the last issue of our monthly update in October, zCloak invited everyone to join the special Halloween quiz event on Halloween night, Oct 31. The quiz lasted for a week and ended on Nov 7. A total of 66,326 enthusiastic community members participated in the event and dug into the quiz questions related to the 0x499 interview with zCloak’s founder about DID technology and utility. We are thrilled to conclude the event with 39,827 OATs issued and we are glad our community members enjoyed the quiz. We will continue to bring meaningful and beneficial events to our community as well as to the Web3&nbsp;world!</p> Ambassador Program <p>On Nov 15, zCloak Network announced the opening of its Ambassador Program 2.0. On top of a a great phase one of the program, the core team made changes to the program rules and guidelines after careful consideration, and are inviting some new blood to join and grow together. The application closed on Nov 25 with 371 amazing applications received by zCloak. Final decision for different roles including Moderator, Collaboration Representative, and Content Creator will be made in the following week. We look forward to working with our new ambassadors and to building and growing together!</p> World Cup zk-Guessing Event <p>On Dec 1, zCloak Network launched the world’s first zero-knowledge-based World Cup Guessing Event with some partner projects (including BuidlerDAO, Flock.io, Tusima, Mirror World, Moledao, SnapFingersDAO, Web3Go, LegalDAO, Macondo). Jointly, the projects call on Web3 football fans to actively participate in the event, where DID and zero-knowledge proof technology are used in the prediction process of the 2022 World Cup. In this event, users can prove whether their guess is correct (e.g. predicted team enters semi-finals), without telling anyone what their guess is. With this game event, users can get a taste of zCloak Network’s efforts on privacy protection. Stay tuned for the event recap in our next issue of monthly&nbsp;update!</p><p>How to join:&nbsp;<a href="https://zcloaknetwork.medium.com/worlds-first-zk-guessing-for-the-world-cup-games-dc2d22fa5a83">LINK</a></p>Event Timeline included in case you are interested!

However, Brave Search ads protect users’ data and anonymity, while supporting their access to independent and transparent search as a true alternative to Big Tech search engines.</p>
<p>Ads are a key part of search engines, helping to facilitate the free and open exchange of information on the Web, and to connect users to helpful products and services related to their search terms. Despite their usefulness, most search ads track users and violate their privacy. Brave Search ads are fundamentally different: They provide the same utility minus all the tracking and privacy invasions found in other search ads. They give users a chance to learn about new products and—soon—earn rewards for their attention to those ads.</p>
<p>Brave Search is built on a truly independent index of the Web (one of only a handful of search engines that can make that claim), and recently passed 20 million queries per day, growing faster than any search engine since Bing. Search ads allow Brave to maintain independence as it grows, and do so without giving in to Big Tech’s privacy invasions.</p>





    


    




 Privacy-first ads 
<p>By design, Brave Search ads are anonymous, clearly marked, and follow Brave’s commitment to putting users first, and to ethical and transparent advertising practices. Clicking on Brave Search ads is a fully private experience (unlike the ads on search engines like Google and Bing). Brave Search only uses your search query, country, and device type to show you ads, and does not keep any kind of profile of your searches.</p>

 Search Premium 
<p>For users that don’t want to see ads, Brave is also offering an ad-free experience: <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=search">Search Premium</a>. For $3 per month, Brave Search Premium users can continue to enjoy a completely ad-free Search experience, and directly support Brave’s mission to make the Web a more private place with independent search.</p>

 Beta phase and Brave Rewards 
<p>During this beta phase, Brave Search users will see text-based ads in search results. However, during the beta period, Brave users who have opted-in to Brave Private Ads and are using the latest version of Brave will not see Search ads, since these new ad units are not yet eligible for BAT earnings. We’re actively working to integrate Brave Rewards with Brave Search, and hope to make Search ads eligible for BAT earnings in the coming months.</p>
<p>Brave believes in the importance of independent, private Web search, and in putting users in charge of their online experience. Not using Brave Search? Try it now at search.brave.com, or <a href="https://search.brave.com/default">set it as your browser’s default search engine</a>.</p>
<p>If you’d like to advertise with Brave Search ads, please reach out to <a href="mailto:sales@brave.com">sales@brave.com</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>tl;dr —&nbsp;Today Brave News introduced integrated RSS subscriptions, locally personalized suggestions, new sources and content channels powered by Brave Search, and other improvements. New supported regions include Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Spain, and the UK.</p>
<p>Big Tech controls the news ecosystem through centralized, Web 2.0-style news aggregation. But this control is waning, particularly as distributed models gain popularity. In many ways, RSS feeds and RSS readers (though not new) are an early instance of Web3-style decentralization. Our hope is that Brave News will make it obvious that a decentralized news ecosystem is far better for users and publishers than what Big Tech offers today.</p>
<p>Brave offers the capabilities users want in a news experience (such as content discovery, feed subscriptions, and personalized suggestions) directly in the browser. There’s no need to rely on centralized servers because all these Brave News features take place solely on your device. This update sets the stage for giving users more control over their news feed and relationships with publishers.</p>
<p>Today’s browser release (desktop version 1.46) includes several Brave News improvements that bring us closer to this vision of a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving news ecosystem, including:</p>
 
 A Follow button in the browser for adding a site’s feed to Brave News 
 New content Channels powered by Brave Search 
 Personalized Suggestions made locally on your device 
 Improved Source Management 
 Availability in new regions including Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Spain, and the UK 
 





    


    




 Privacy-preserving personalization 
<p>Brave News can also use your browser history to personalize the content in your feed. But unlike other browser feeds (such as Google News), Brave’s content personalization happens exclusively in the browser, and none of your browsing data ever leaves your device.</p>
<p>Brave News ranks content you follow highest in your feed, and helps you discover new sources to Follow based on your browsing history and sources you already Follow. Brave identifies sources that are similar to each other and recommends suggestions privately in Settings, where you can choose to Follow and add them to your feed.</p>
<p>Note: Brave’s suggestions service is <a href="https://github.com/brave/source-suggestions">published as an open source project</a> if you want to learn more about how it works.</p>

 Channels and new settings options 
<p>Many users have requested more controls for customizing Brave News. Today’s update improves the way users Follow and Unfollow sources, and we’ve introduced “channels” which are topics or areas of coverage such as Crypto News, Music, and the new Gaming channel. If you’re already a Brave News user, any customizations you’ve made in the previous version of Brave News will automatically appear in the new version, and you’ll also find a much simpler interface for managing sources.</p>

 Brave News around the world 
<p>Brave News is also expanding internationally thanks to Brave Search. By querying Brave Search for the most popular content sources around the world and identifying publishers with public RSS feeds, Brave News now supports language- and region-specific content. In addition to coverage in Japan and the US, new regions now include English for Canada and the UK; Spanish for both Mexico and Spain; and Portuguese for users in Brazil. More languages and regions will be added over the coming months.</p>

 Coming soon: Easily add content to your Brave News Feed 
<p>As you browse publishers’ websites in the Brave browser, you’ll find a new, one-click Follow button. The button is located in the browser address bar and will appear any time you visit a site that provides an RSS feed. Click Follow, and content from that publisher will then appear in Brave News automatically, updating each time your browser fetches the feed.</p>
<p>Note: The new Follow button in the browser address bar will be released later this month. Today’s release is available for desktop users, and iOS will be updated with the new Brave News features in its upcoming 1.46 version. Android will be updated with the new Brave News features soon thereafter.</p>

 What’s next for Brave News 
<p>Many users have requested alternative views of their Brave News feed, such as a more traditional, inbox-style RSS news reader, which we plan to work on soon. We also plan to introduce an ad-free version of Brave News, mobile alerts, cross-platform sync, more import/export options, and some useful integrations with other Brave products and features.</p>
<p>To give Brave News a try and enjoy news and content directly from your browser, simply open a new tab in the Brave browser, and scroll to get started. If you’re not using Brave yet, you can download it now at <a>brave.com/download</a>.</p>

 Today, we’re excited to share the next phase in our journey: <a href="http://privy.io">Privy&nbsp;Auth</a>. <blockquote>Privy Auth is a simple library to easily onboard all your users to web3, regardless of whether they already have a wallet, across mobile and&nbsp;desktop.</blockquote><p><a href="http://privy.io">Privy</a> exists to help developers craft delightful products and keep users in control of their assets and data across apps. Since our launch, we’ve been hard at work helping amazing teams like those at <a href="https://www.station.express/">Station</a> and <a href="https://www.violet.co/">Violet</a> manage users’ off-chain data and build user-respecting products. Privy Auth is the next step in this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Our work has inexorably led us here. First, as a recurring request from our customers who already use Privy to secure user emails, social accounts, phone numbers, etc. Second, through a core product requirement: in order to enable users to control data permissions across apps, Privy must be able to authenticate users directly.</p><p>User journeys in Web3 have evolved from discrete, one-time events — like signing a transaction — to continuous interactions with users, involving both on- and off-chain data. For users, this means better products, but it also means developers have to handle much more complexity. This complexity starts at login: wallet connectors are clunky, onboarding flows are confusing to users, and the problem gets worse as the number of chains and wallets grows. To bring web3 mainstream, we have to reshape user onboarding.</p> Enter Privy&nbsp;Auth <p>Privy Auth is a simple library to easily onboard all your users to web3, regardless of whether they already have a wallet, across mobile and&nbsp;desktop.</p><p>We are building Privy Auth around 3 principles:</p>  Crypto for all — Web3 must be built for newcomers and experts alike. The best products will bridge the right UX from web2 and web3 to lower the barrier to entry. This means progressive user onboarding, gradually engaging users as they progress through your app, from first wallet connection to multi-wallet account creation.  User control — All products will involve on- and off-chain data. The best will rely on data portability from app to app to unlock new experiences.This means it must be easy for users to decide what they share with&nbsp;whom.  Self-custody — Self-custody is an essential part of web3. Popular apps will serve as bridges into self-custody, enabling people to take on more control over their assets and data if they so&nbsp;choose.  <p>Privy Auth is live with customers today as part of our early release. It integrates with your favorite libraries like ethers and wagmi; it’s easy to migrate from RainbowKit, Onboard.js or any other wallet connector or auth&nbsp;library.</p><p>Out of the box, Privy Auth gives&nbsp;you</p>  Simple onboarding for all users, with or without wallets, using email and social accounts.  Reliable wallet connectors, optimized for desktop and mobile so you can stop worrying about users getting lost on the way to your&nbsp;app.  A unified user abstraction so you can easily manage all users. Connected, authenticated, multi-wallet, we support all of your&nbsp;users.  <p>If you’re building in web3 and want to delight your users from the first interaction, <a href="https://50fzxaracbi.typeform.com/to/v5gtHb74">we’d love to talk</a>. With just a few lines of code, you can securely onboard all users, whether they have a wallet or not, and get back to focusing on your core&nbsp;product.</p><p>We have a lot more coming and we can’t wait to share more with you soon. Web3 gives us the opportunity to reinvent the data paradigms that have failed us over the last 30 years and give users back control over their data online. This starts at&nbsp;login().</p><p>Team Privy</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/announcing-privy-auth-4754be04c515">Announcing Privy Auth!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Press release: Nym Advisor, Andrés Arauz denounces FATF design guidance on CBDCs and leads urgent call for a more democratic process <p>International standardization body ISO/TC68 better positioned to lead on standards of CBDCs for the benefit of global&nbsp;society</p><p>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 30 November 2022 — Today, Nym advisor Andrés Arauz, former director of Ecuador’s central bank and 2021 presidential candidate, called for the design of CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) to be moved to a more open, democratic, and privacy-respecting standards process at the United Nations Internet Governance Forum&nbsp;(IGF).</p><p>Arauz stated his immediate intention to join the already existing <a href="https://committee.iso.org/home/tc68">International Standards Organisation TC68</a>/AG5 Working Group on central bank digital currencies where governments from the Global South are currently absent. Even cryptocurrency advocates can take an active role, as they can join through their national standard setting bodies as&nbsp;members.</p><p>This is in response to the increasing trend of countries declaring that privacy protection will not be included in the design of CBDCs as <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Virtual-Assets-FATF-Report-G20-So-Called-Stablecoins.pdf">recommended </a>by <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/">FATF</a> (Financial Action Task Force) under the guise of anti-money laundering. The FATF is completely opaque, dominated <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/how-little-known-g7-task-force-unwittingly-helps-governments-target-critics-2021-08-05/">by geopolitics</a>, and is heavily influenced by the <a href="https://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/">Wolfsberg Group</a>, a club of the largest US and European&nbsp;banks.</p><p>In the interest of social good, guidance from a standards body that has the responsibility to include any nation state wanting to participate, will be less asymmetric to everyone who will be impacted by CBDCs. Deeper involvement in ISO/TC 68 will allow all relevant stakeholders, including both the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the newer generation of privacy-focussed Web3 experts, to set innovative technical standards for CBDCs and decentralized alternatives, providing financial freedom to those who need it while mitigating the risk of illegal activities.</p><p>“CBDCs will be legal tender and need democratic safeguards that guarantee the human right to privacy, their standards should not be defined by the FATF -an unaccountable, ineffective and opaque body-. Stakeholders from civil society and alternative finance should get involved to embed these human rights in the CBDC hardware and software standards,” Arauz&nbsp;said.</p><p>This was announced alongside Nym CEO Harry Halpin and Open Knowledge Foundation CEO Renata Avila at the <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022">United Nations Internet Governance Forum (IGF)</a> 2022 in Ethiopia, during <a href="https://intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-town-hall-99-the-data-of-money-blockchains-andor-surveillance">Town Hall #99 The Data of Money: Blockchains and/or Surveillance</a>.</p><p>Halpin added: “CBDCs could easily become tools of mass surveillance and control to repress political dissidents and entire nations. It’s imperative that the cryptocurrency industry get involved in this discussion over CBDC standards at the highest level, by teaming up with countries from the Global South that need to throw off the yoke of colonial banking systems to serve their own people rather than the imperialist overlords of the&nbsp;FATF.”</p><p>The IGF session focused on the current state of financial surveillance and new routes to privacy-preserving CDBCs and financial autonomy led by the global south. CBDC standards should allow both nation-states and non-nation state actors to interoperate and include privacy by design, which has been disingenuously dismissed under the guise of money laundering concerns even though privacy will be needed for national security purposes and to respect basic rights. Violations of an individual’s privacy rights through mass financial surveillance should be taken seriously and respected.</p><p>Watch the livestream: <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-live">https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-live</a></p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance. More: <a href="https://nymtech.net">https://nymtech.net</a></p><p>About Andrés&nbsp;Arauz:</p><p>Arauz has been a prominent figure in leading the drive on technological and monetary disintermediation. Motivated to reduce the bureaucratic need for the central bank to hold and distribute large amounts of physical dollars, he was one of the first to experiment with CBDCs, piloting Dinero Electrónico as then-Director of Ecuador’s central bank.

<p>Dune Analytics is a platform aggregating blockchain data, making data easier to query and understand for the larger public. Over the past years, Dune has become the go-to tool for blockchain analytics, as well as the home of a community of dune wizards numbering in the thousands, with its fundraising at a 1 Billion valuation as a testament to the growth of the project over the past 4 years.</p><p>In today's episode, we are joined by the project's co-founder, Fredrik Haga. We discuss the products Dune Analytics offers, why it's hard to aggregate data that in principle is public, and how a community of data wizards was built in a grassroots effort. We also chatted about product focus and vision for the future, as well as useful lessons for bootstrapping a project on a shoestring budget.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The beginning of Dune  The challenges and difficulties in building a blockchain data product.  Technical improvements on Dune V2  Supporting for non-evm chains  Business models, userbases, and valuations  Interesting use cases on Dune  Community Building  The focus on product experience and next steps for the project  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://dune.com/community">Dune Analytics's website</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/duneanalytics">Dune Analytics Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/hagaetc">Fredrik Haga's twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

<p>zCloak Network is holding the world’s first zero-knowledge-based World Cup Guessing Event with its partners. In this event, you can prove whether your guess is correct (e.g. your team enters semi-finals), without telling anyone what your guess is. Here you will get a taste of zCloak Network’s efforts to protect privacy&nbsp;again.</p><p>All participants will be rewarded with NFT, OAT and more. The winners will split a $2000 reward pool and win precious Mint Whitelist.</p> Prize Pool <p>For Winners: $2000 from zCloak Network; 5 Player Pass NFT Whitelist from&nbsp;Macondo</p><p>For every participant: Credential from zCloak; OAT/ POAP from BuidlerDAO, Flock&amp;Tusima, Mirror World, MoleDAO, SnapFingersDAO, Web3Go.</p><p>This prize pool is certified by LegalDAO.</p> Participation Timeline <blockquote>Phase I — Guess and&nbsp;Record</blockquote><p>Present — UTC 12:00, Dec.&nbsp;9</p><p>At this phase, you can guess the champion team and record it as a verifiable credential (VC). Before the deadline, you need to share your credential with the zCloak verifier to make a commitment. Note that you will make a selective disclosure of your credential — you only share your discord user name and the verification code (your credential hash will be recorded) with zCloak for membership verification, but keep your guessing secret to yourself.</p><blockquote>Phase II — Zero-Knowledge Proof for Semi-Finals</blockquote><p>Dec. 12 — Dec.&nbsp;16</p><p>At this phase, you can prove whether your guess reaches the Semi-Finals without revealing your guess to anyone by use of zero-knowledge proof. Participants who guess correctly will have the chance to win an additional prize ($1,000 pool for 20 winners).</p><blockquote>Phase III — Who is the champion?</blockquote><p>Dec. 18 — Dec.&nbsp;20</p><p>At this phase, you can announce your guess and zCloak verifier will verify if it is the champion. The eventual winner has the chance to win an additional prize ($1,000 pool and 5 whitelists for 5 winners).</p><blockquote>Phase IV — Claim your&nbsp;prizes</blockquote><p>Dec. 21</p><p>On this day, we will reveal how to claim your rewards. Please keep your DID mnemonics and your backup DID JSON file safe to collect the&nbsp;rewards.</p> Guide — Phase&nbsp;I  1. Create your zCloak&nbsp;Account <p>Click this link: <a href="https://cred.zkid.app/#/account?redirect=claimer">https://cred.zkid.app/#/account?redirect=claimer</a></p> 1.1 Click ‘Create account’ to get your first zkID&nbsp;account <p>Note: All users will need to create a new account as we have adopted an updated version of DID protocol.</p> 1.2 Create&nbsp;Password <p>All your data is encrypted by this password. Please keep your password&nbsp;safe.</p> 1.3 Generate&nbsp;mnemonic <p>The mnemonic is the last approach to restore your DID account. Please keep it in a safe&nbsp;place.</p> 1.4 DID key backup JSON&nbsp;file <p>After confirmation, a DID backup JSON file will be downloaded to your computer. You can restore your DID account in another browser with your password and this DID backup JSON file (or with your mnemonics). Keep the file&nbsp;safe.</p> 2. Make the guessing with verifiable credential <p>After creating your account, please click this link to enter our Credential Platform: <a href="https://cred.zkid.app">https://cred.zkid.app</a></p> 2.1 Switch your&nbsp;role <p>Now your role is claimer, who is the owner of the Verifiable Credential (VC). To issue a VC that contains your guessing of the champion, you need to switch your role to ‘Attester’, who can attest or issue a VC to others or to him/herself.</p><p>Click this button to switch your role from claimer to attester.</p> 2.2 Issue <p>Click ‘Issue’ of the menu and ‘Issue’ of the WCG Ctype to issue the guessing&nbsp;VC.</p><p>Click ‘Issue to myself’ to automatically fill in your own&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Note: If you encounter ‘The DID Document not found’, please wait a moment and refresh the page again since it takes some time to get your identity on the blockchain.</p> 2.3 Finish your identity verification <p>Join our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/rRnGDBJ8N6">https://discord.gg/rRnGDBJ8N6</a>) and get your verification code from the ‘zkid-verify’ channel.</p><p>Type your whole Discord ID and Verification Code. Then you can choose your guess of the champion&nbsp;team.</p> 2.4 Submit <p>After submitting, you can see a notification as&nbsp;follows:</p> 3. Verify your VC to record your participation <p>Congratulations! Now you have finished guessing and got a Verifiable Credential to prove&nbsp;it!</p><p>To ensure every DID only chooses one team and the guessing is done before the deadline, you should share your credential hash and some verification information with zCloak verifier. Please note this is just for data commitment purpose. Your guessed team is a&nbsp;secret.</p> 3.1 Switch your&nbsp;role <p>In order to view and manage your credentials, you should switch your role to ‘Claimer’.</p> 3.2 Download and store your&nbsp;VC <p>Now you can view your VC. Please note that your VC data is saved in your browser cache. zCloak doesn’t save any of your VC data. You can download the VC as a json file and keep it in a safe&nbsp;place.</p><p>If you use other browsers or devices, you can import this VC file. If you lose your VC file, NOBODY can recover it for you. This is part of your responsibility in order to control your own&nbsp;data.</p> 3.3 Share your VC information <p>At this step, please share the Discord UserName and Verification Code from your VC. We only record the first share. Make sure you only share these two fields or you will be disqualified from the&nbsp;event.</p><p>The Receiver DID&nbsp;is:</p><p>did:zk:0x0A2F3464C592279A0dF3aFA27e5b05b0978923bA</p><p>All information ticked will be sent to us. To avoid disclosing your guess, please DO NOT tick ‘Champion Team’. Otherwise, you will be DISQUALIFIED.</p> 3.4 View the&nbsp;feedback <p>Congratulations! After getting the feedback in the ‘Notifications’, you have finished all the tasks in phase&nbsp;I.</p> 3.5 Retweet your&nbsp;VC <p>Now you can Reweet your VC to your friends as follows. Thank you for participating in this event! Please wait for our guidelines for the next&nbsp;phases.</p><p>Notes on the technical ingredients: the DID method — <a href="https://github.com/zCloak-Network/zk-did-method-specs">the “zk” method</a> — used in this event is implemented by zCloak Network and registered in the W3C. The zero-knowledge proof computation is based on the <a href="https://github.com/maticnetwork/miden">Polygon Miden VM</a> in the zkID wallet. User DID documents (not credential) are stored in <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>. zCloak Network will compose a separate article to explain the cryptographic elements used in this&nbsp;event.</p> About zCloak&nbsp;Network <p>zCloak Network is a privacy-first DID and verifiable computation infrastructure. It aims to deliver the Web3 dream of Self-Sovereignty by moving both the storage and the computation of user data into user device from centralized servers. The integrity of user computation is proven by a STARK-based ZK-VM in a browser extension. zCloak’s W3C compatible DID system can mirror real-world legal status and reputation in DeSoc. With zCloak Network, people can use their real-world data for e.g. DeFi, Identity, Biometric applications without disclosing their privacy. zCloak Network is chain-agnostic — its identity and ZKP service can be served for most public blockchains.</p><p>Website: <a href="https://zcloak.network/#/">https://zcloak.network/#/</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/zCloakNetwork">https://twitter.com/zCloakNetwork</a></p><p>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/9RFhqVPGkf">https://discord.gg/9RFhqVPGkf</a></p> Terms &amp; Conditions: <p>zCloak Network reserves the right to cancel or amend any Activity, Activity Rules, or Details at our sole discretion.</p><p>This campaign is open internationally, but restrictions due to compliance regulations for different jurisdictions apply.

<p>NYM token is now integrated into BNB wallets by&nbsp;default</p><p>We are pleased to announce that Nym has made a bridge to the <a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en">BNB Chain</a> thanks to <a href="https://celer.network">Celer</a>! The NYM utility token is now available as a BEP-20 token. What does this mean? It means that real $NYM can be used on BNB Chain, opening a pathway to privacy for the BNB ecosystem while keeping users SAFU from the many scams involving fake $NYM on BNB Chain. From now on, <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0xdd2612c292431aaa727fe24d1a8afbe4928bbc55">0xDD2612c292431aaa727fE24d1a8AfBE4928Bbc55</a> is the only valid NYM token address on BNB&nbsp;Chain!</p><p>Originally initiated by <a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Binance</a> and now a community-driven, permissionless and decentralised ecosystem, BNB Chain is the world’s largest smart-contract blockchain in terms of transaction volume and daily active users as of October&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The NYM token is the utility token of the Nym mixnet — a powerful privacy system that protects network layer communications from traffic analysis, metadata and IP surveillance. By using the mixnet, your communications will be protected from apps and wallets that are gathering your IP addresses as well as observers watching the whole&nbsp;network.</p><p>Holders of NYM (ERC-20) tokens can use <a href="https://cbridge.celer.network/1/56/NYM">cBridge</a> to bridge their NYM tokens from Ethereum to the BNB chain and back. This means that native NYM (Cosmos) tokens are now accessible for the BNB ecosystem if two bridges are used (cbridge and GravityBridge), enabling people to bond and run mixnodes, delegate stake in the mixnet and contribute to operating the privacy&nbsp;system.</p><p>How does the bridge&nbsp;work?</p><p>cBridge uses a lock-and-mint model, creating a mapped version of the NYM token on the BNB&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>When a person transfers the token from Ethereum to BNB chain, the $NYM (ERC20) will be locked on Ethereum and an equal number of $NYM (BEP20) will be minted in a 1:1 pegged ratio and sent to you on the BNB Chain, maintaining stable supply across&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Conversely, when a person transfers from the BNB chain back to Ethereum, the $NYM (BEP20) will be burned on the BNB chain and an equal number of $NYM (ERC20) will be sent back to you on Ethereum.</p><p>You will have to pay a bridge fee which consists of a ‘base fee’ and ‘protocol fee’. The ‘base fee’ covers the gas fee on the destination chain, in the form of the $NYM in that chain’s format. The ‘protocol fee’ is paid as incentives to the cBridge LPs, validators and stakers, ranging from 0–0.5% of total transfer amount. Overall, the bridge is very cheap and&nbsp;fast!</p><p>How to use the&nbsp;bridge</p>  Go to <a href="https://cbridge.celer.network/1/56/NYM">https://cbridge.celer.network/1/56/NYM</a> and connect to Metamask Ethereum&nbsp;Mainnet  Choose NYM token from the token&nbsp;list  Input the amount of NYM tokens you wish to bridge to BNB&nbsp;Chain  <p>4. After inputting the amount of NYM tokens, you can see the exact fees that you will be charged underneath and the estimated time of&nbsp;arrival.</p><p>5. After the transaction has been submitted on chain, the top right will show if the transaction is pending or completed. You can also find the transaction details on etherscan or&nbsp;bsccan.</p><p>6. The switch from Ethereum Mainnet to BNB Chain on Metamask. If you have not already added BNB Chain, use the configuration information below: Mainnet (this is probably the one you are looking&nbsp;for)</p>  Network Name: BNB&nbsp;Chain  New RPC URL: <a href="https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/">https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/</a>  ChainID: 56  Symbol: BNB  Block Explorer URL: <a href="https://bscscan.com">https://bscscan.com</a>  <p>7. Import BEP20 version of NYM token in your Metamask wallet: 0xDD2612c292431aaa727fE24d1a8AfBE4928Bbc55, then you should be able to see the amount of NYM tokens appear your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>NOTE: <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0xdd2612c292431aaa727fe24d1a8afbe4928bbc55">0xDD2612c292431aaa727fE24d1a8AfBE4928Bbc55</a> is the only valid NYM token address on BNB Chain, beware of&nbsp;scams!</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym.

<p>Game of Chains&nbsp;✨</p> Dear Cosmonauts! <p>Phase 2 officially ended on November 25, 2022! We hit a number of important milestones we are so excited to share! Buckle&nbsp;up:</p> HIGHLIGHTS <p>Game of Chains validators launched three new consumer chains, giving them a feel for the governance process and the DevOps that will be required to launch real consumer chains in production. These 3 consumer chains&nbsp;include:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022/gopher">Gopher</a> — This is a consumer chain built by Hypha to help test the Go relayer with Interchain Security.</p><p>Neutron — This consumer chain will run in production come Interchain Security launch! They’ve been building their permissionless smart contract development platform for the past few months. Check out their announcement on launching Game of Chains&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Neutron_org/status/1595090867949563904">here</a>!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022/hero">Hero</a> — This is the placeholder name for the Generic Asset Issuance Chain which is set to issue USDC come Interchain Security launch. Big shoutout to the StrangeLove team for developing Hero and putting in the work to get the Generic Asset Issuance chain to&nbsp;launch!</p><p>Throughout this process, validators voted on proposals, started up the consumer chains, set up relayers, and worked to ensure that their nodes were adequately configured to minimize downtime. Validators also ran through the motions of removing Apollo through a governance proposal, which was started in Phase&nbsp;1.</p> COMMUNITY <p>Validators and the broader Cosmos community have been actively participating in public discussions on Interchain Security including thoughts on ICS risks, validator operational overhead, auditing binaries, the role of testnets in ICS, and more! Check out this great Q&amp;A discussion hosted by Citizen Cosmos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXMoF18bckU">here</a>.</p> PHASE 3 HAS&nbsp;STARTED <p>We are already in the beginning stages of Phase 3 where validators will continue to run consumer chains and go through the process of starting and stopping consumer chains. Hypha has redistributed voting power so that the testnet coordinators no longer have majority control of the network. This will force validators to play a more active role in governance and keep everyone on their toes to ensure that the testnet keeps&nbsp;running!</p><p>In this phase, we are asking validators to propose new chains and vote on them. Those following along can keep track of which chains have been proposed <a href="https://testnet.ping.pub/provider/gov">here</a>. We already have Duality about to be onboarded as their governance proposal went live late Friday&nbsp;evening!</p>Shoutout to Dan B from Strangelove for the meme!&nbsp;😁 SCORING <p>We are keeping score of where validators are in the leaderboard on <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022#scoreboard">interchainsecurity.dev</a>. Thank you to everyone who has submitted evidence of their task completion. If you haven’t please make sure to do so to be eligible for a prize! Please note that tallying takes time and we’re trying to update the leaderboard once a week so the leaderboard won’t always have a full picture of validators standing in Game of&nbsp;Chains.</p><p>MASSIVE thank you to everyone for participating in Phase 2. Looking forward to seeing the validators become more self-sufficient in Phase 3and all of the new chains that will be proposed!</p><p>About the Author:<br>Jelena Djuric works at <a href="https://informal.systems/about">Informal Systems</a> as product Marketing Manager.<br>Jelena is on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Gnomeskiiihttps://twitter.com/jelenaaa____">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/phase-2-update-f93b07bc162f">PHASE 2 Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The presentation I gave was recorded and should be up on my channel in the next week or so after Jason gets back to Denver and has time to knit it together. The format was eight ten-minute segments followed by a panel discussion with Q&amp;A. The focus was a bit unusual, even for me, and included readings from the 1929 book by X-Ray crystallographer JD Bernal, “T<a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.171486/mode/2up">he World, The Flesh, and The Devil,”</a>&nbsp;with links to sociobiology, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjU86ryZN6g">ant computer simulations</a>, consciousness studies, and space exploration. All of these topics are highly relevant to Tucson, a city that leads in aerospace development with a history that extends into radio-astronomy, interplanetary colonization, and spiritualism.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vDibdG6wSzCp1wrJDoJ0xHVNAjR9NxYEvUL4J4jp4Lw/edit?usp=sharing">a link to my slide deck</a> in the mean time.</p>
<p>Southern Arizona, the site of one of the longest military engagements on US soil waged by <a href="https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/apache-wars-cochise.htm">Apache leaders Cochise and Geronimo</a>, is home to <a href="https://suncorridorinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016-Fort-Huachuca-Fact-Sheet-Brochure-WEB.pdf">Fort Huachuca</a>, a center of electronic warfare. It’s also a testbed for <a href="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5d9f83b8b237fa6c07d5d69d/5df56d3ba58b6240c6ce54ae_Smart%2BCities%2Bfor%2Bthe%2BRest%2Bof%2BUs_Toothaker.pdf">smart city policies</a> and social impact finance programs (<a href="https://www.tucsonaz.gov/files/hcd/City_of_Tucson_and_Pima_County_FFY2015-2019_5-year_HUDConsolidated_Plan.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.strivetogether.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/053119_2019_C2C_AnnualReport_V9.pdf">here</a>). I’m sure a lot of what I put out flew over the heads of the audience, because most of us don’t yet have the language or mental structures to imagine what’s on the horizon – the smart contract logic layer of Web 3. These past few weeks I keep repeating – If we’re not spending half of our intellectual “free-time” learning about Web3, the consequences won’t be good. We won’t understand the story we’re inhabiting. We won’t be able to see where the walls of the labyrinth are.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure where to start, here are a couple of videos Jason and I made with Leo Saraceno that deconstruct the vision Juan Benet of Protocol Labs has for Web3 and the development of “innovative” finance mechanisms for “open source” “digital public goods.”</p>
<p>If you’d like to go back and re-watch the clips, you can click the circles on <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/bab707025b91966dbcc03b0e3db7daac#untitled-map">this interactive map</a>. the sidebar will open with the links to each.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Later today we’ll be exploring the city with planned stops at the labyrinth in Udall Park and an address associated with the early history of L5. You can read about the Tohono O’odom’s story of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27itoi">man in the maze</a>,” a motif incorporated into basketmaking practices a century ago. The newsletters from L5 dating to the mid 1970s are available on Wayback – very much an eye-full. Here’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403133837/http://nss.org/settlement/L5news/L5news1975.htm">that link</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Udall">Mo Udall</a>, an environmentalist and Arizona Congressman from 1977 to 1991, supported L5’s efforts. See screenshot below.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP). </p>



<p>Four of the current ZCG committee members’ terms expire at the end of December, so we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in December. </p>



 How to Stand for Election to ZCG 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">governance zcg-elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining their priorities and vision for Zcash. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly as replies to their respective posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on 12th December 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>During the week commencing 12th December, the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> to select four candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2023.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The four candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2023. Committee members may stand for re-election at the end of their term.</p>



<p>Prospective candidates should familiarize themselves with the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;Hudson Jameson’s decision to step down from the committee in <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/hudson-jameson-leaving-zcg/41941">June 2022</a>  triggered an election resulting in the appointment of Cody Burns, whose term will expire in June 2023. The other four committee members’ terms are expiring at the end of December 2022. </p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks. </p>



<p>From January, members will receive a stipend of $1,650 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC).&nbsp;</p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>To avoid conflicts of interest, the following policy applies to the ZCG Committee: </p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members will be required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to this topic on the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

<p>Brave’s native crypto wallet now features integrations from 1inch, Allbridge, AutoFarm, Based, Cardinal, Coral Cube, DARA, EYWA, Guild, Hyperspace, Matrica, Morpho, Tectonic, Plaid, and Quest3.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Brave continues to expand its Wallet Partner program with the addition of 15 new DApps in November. Since June, over 75 projects have integrated Brave Wallet in their Web3-enabled applications. While we encourage outreach and partnership with the growing ecosystem of DApp builders, developers looking to add Brave Wallet to their DApps independently can use our <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">Brave Wallet documentation</a> for DIY integration in just a few steps.</p>
<p>To learn more about our previous Wallet partners, read our past announcements from <a>June</a>, <a>July</a>, <a>August</a>, <a>September</a>, and <a>October</a>. Here are the partners that joined in November:</p>

 1inch 
<p><a href="https://1inch.io/">The 1inch Network</a> is a collection of DeFi products made for safe, lucrative, and fast operations in DeFi. Their lead product is a DEX aggregator that finds the best rate on swaps across 300 liquidity sources on multiple blockchains. The 1inch DEX aggregator has reached more than 3.7 million unique wallets, and $254 billion in overall transaction volume to date. Alongside the aggregation protocol, the 1inch core contributors’ team keeps developing their own liquidity protocol, limit order protocol, and a multichain mobile wallet.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be integrated with Brave Wallet,” says Sergej Kunz, the 1inch Network co-founder. “This is an important step towards growing out of the DeFi space and bringing new users to Web3 products.”</p>

 Allbridge 
<p><a href="https://allbridge.io/">Allbridge Core</a> enables the transfer of value between blockchains by offering cross-chain swaps of native stablecoins. Being messaging protocol agnostic, Allbridge Core connects a variety of EVM and non-EVM networks.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly excited to join Brave’s Wallet Partner program. This enables us to provide cross-chain services to the widespread Brave community. Integrating Brave Wallet with Allbridge Core paves the way to more accessible stable swaps in the DeFi space,” said Andriy Velykyy, co-founder and CEO of Allbridge.</p>

 Autofarm 
<p><a href="https://autofarm.network/">Autofarm</a> is a multichain yield optimizer that enables users to get returns from yield farming pools by simply staking in Autofarm vaults. Vaults auto-compound yields at optimal intervals, while pooling gas costs through battle-tested smart contract code and best-in-class yield optimization strategies. AutoSwap also acts as a DEX aggregator which splits trades across multiple DEXs to ensure the best prices and lowest slippage possible, with no extra fees at all.</p>
<p>“As a leading yield optimizer in the DeFi scene, we are happy to partner with Brave. By implementing support for Brave Wallet, we have opened access to our safe and user-friendly DeFi experience for millions of Brave browser users,” said Luuk, Business Development at AutoFarm.</p>

 Based 
<p><a href="https://getbased.com/">Based</a> is a social messaging platform built around NFTs. They seek to enable individuals to create and experience more meaningful interactions around their NFT networks and content, with less effort, on one native platform.</p>

 Cardinal 
<p><a href="https://www.cardinal.so/">Cardinal</a> is a Solana protocol that enables the conditional ownership of NFTs. It’s powering the future of NFT utility through rentals, subscriptions, staking, tickets, royalty enforcement, and more.</p>
<p>“Innovating with the Brave team was exciting on many levels. We had a chance to work with a group who were passionate about making a difference in the NFT landscape and tackle the challenge of enforcing royalties. From a custom minting experience using BAT token, to delivering world class art, the <a>Brave launch</a> was exactly what the space needed,” said Manny Lora, Head of Partnerships at Cardinal.</p>

 Coral Cube 
<p><a href="https://coralcube.io/">Coral Cube</a> is a best in class NFT aggregator, marketplace, and launchpad. Since inception in early 2022, the team has been dedicated to serving creators and collectors across NFT use cases, known for its ability to address customer needs throughout the value chain.</p>
<p>“It’s a tremendous honor to partner with a Web3 mainstay like Brave. At Coral Cube, we’ve admired Brave’s innovative practices and sustainable business model, a pioneer for delivering user value. We’re excited to deepen our partnership, help bootstrap Brave’s NFT initiatives and support their growing team,” said Meisam Vosoughpour, CEO at Coral Cube.</p>

 EYWA 
<p><a href="https://eywa.fi">EYWA</a> is a decentralized cross-chain interoperability protocol that allows cheap transfers between asset types within any connected chain. EYWA helps projects become cross-chain and offers ultimate transaction simplicity for users. The EYWA ecosystem includes cross-chain products such as Token Bridge, Data Protocol, DEX, Assets, Liquidity Aggregator, and Liquidity Protocol.</p>
<p>“Our main idea is decentralization. We believe that partnering with Brave will accelerate the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies in the global community. Brave is one of today’s best Web3 projects with a huge audience who has access to cryptocurrency benefits through their wallet and browser. We will help bring in additional features such as gasless transactions, and fast and convenient cross-chain exchanges. We believe that society is ready for decentralized and reliable finance,” said Boris Povar, CEO at EYWA.</p>

 Guild 
<p><a href="https://guild.xyz/">Guild.xyz</a> is the infrastructure for platformless access management. It exists to help you manage communities, and create portable memberships and social structures around on- and off-chain requirements—and to build unique user journeys across applications.</p>
<p>“When users connect their wallets to guild.xyz, Brave is the default wallet Guild offers at login if they are not using other extensions. This makes the user experience much smoother, familiar, and personalized for our members,” said Raz, Founder at guild.xyz.</p>

 Hyperspace 
<p><a href="http://hyperspace.xyz">Hyperspace.xyz</a> is the most liquid NFT marketplace and aggregator on Solana helping NFT traders save money buying and selling NFTs across over 20 different sources. Hyperspace also provides infrastructure to empower creators and developers to build native web3 experiences via NFT APIs. Their mission is to enable the future of NFT trading and commerce.</p>
<p>“We are proud to partner with Brave wallet to enable users to use a secure wallet experience. With so many users using the Brave browser and BAT, we are excited to integrate more deeply into the Brave ecosystem,” said Kamil, Co-founder at Hyperspace.</p>

 Matrica 
<p><a href="https://matrica.io/">Matrica Labs</a> focuses on providing critical infrastructure within the blockchain ecosystem. As the premier gating and identity-provider in Web3, Matrica powers nearly 2,000 communities with over 300,000 users. Serving as an all-in-one intuitive experience with a powerful and extensive suite of services, Matrica provides a platform that empowers individuals, communities, businesses, marketplaces, and more.</p>
<p>“As a daily Brave browser user, utilizing Brave Wallet was a no-brainer. The experience has been seamless and it’s great knowing you’re receiving the same emphasis on security and privacy that Brave is all about,” said Joseph, COO at Matrica Labs.</p>

 Morpho 
<p>The <a href="https://www.morpho.xyz/">Morpho</a> protocol is a lending pool optimizer on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s a peer-to-peer layer on top of lending pools like Compound and Aave. Rates are seamlessly improved for suppliers and borrowers while preserving the same liquidity and risk parameters. The core use cases are lending and borrowing assets and earning interest. Currently, the protocol deals with ~$300 million in total liquidity.</p>
<p>“Thanks to Blocknative, the integration of Brave Wallet in our DApp was almost seamless,” said Tom, DevRel at Morpho Labs.</p>

 Tectonic 
<p><a href="https://tectonic.finance/">Tectonic</a> is the leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol and money market on <a href="https://cronos.org/">Cronos</a>, the first EVM-compatible chain built on Cosmos in partnership with Crypto.com. With Tectonic, users can lend or borrow top cryptocurrencies and stablecoins at attractive rates and browse easy-to-understand dashboards to make informed investment decisions.

This product supports more than 300 self-custody wallets through one single integration, making it a one-stop solution for developers who want to be able to support as many wallets as possible with minimal technical development needed.</p>
<p>“We viewed fully integrating Brave Wallet into Plaid Wallet Onboard as an important priority for crypto consumers and our developers. It is one of the top wallets on desktop and mobile, and we want to make sure these consumers can quickly find and connect Brave whenever they are connecting,” said Clay Allsopp, Head of Crypto at Plaid.</p>

 Project DARA 
<p><a href="https://www.projectdara.org/">Project DARA</a> is building an immutable publishing platform and social network, starting with a browser extension that snapshots websites and archives files using a unique IPFS and blockchain hybrid solution. DARA (derived from the Irish word for “oak tree”) is a freemium product where core features are free but premium users unlock more advanced features. This open-source, community-driven project created the world’s first dictionary-on-a-blockchain, and is building the Immutable Project Gutenberg Collection.</p>
<p>“By using a freemium model and removing barriers to entry, we hope to introduce millions of people to powerful censorship-resistant technologies, and provide them with compelling products that can make a truly positive impact on their lives,” said Dorian Sherman, founder of Project DARA.</p>

     ZenCon0 – Our first-ever ecosystem summit has wrapped up! This inaugural event brought together some of the greatest minds in crypto to envision our future.  
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23900"></a></p>
<p>Celebrating the growth and accomplishments of our project and ecosystem with partners and supporters was a dream come true for us. Hosted by our sister company Horizen Labs, we welcomed partners, advisors, and community members that joined us at our first ecosystem summit to celebrate our achievements and share ideas for growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two-day conference was filled with spotlights, panels, and break-out sessions ranging from <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">Metaverse on the Horizen</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/zXhR5u3RLhs">Web3 &amp; Sports</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/wGaZRj5VOCg">The Power of Community</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/3nnRnbst7A4">Zen OG stories</a>, and more!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23901"></a></p>
 Welcoming Our Friends 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23902"></a></p>
<p>We were thrilled to see many of our partners, team members, and long-time community members on stage at this event. Each panel and discussion was fantastic, but some of our favorite highlights included the <a href="https://youtu.be/3nnRnbst7A4">Zen OG panel with Horizen co-founder Rolf Versluis</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXhR5u3RLhs&amp;t=1s">the Web3 Sports fireside chat with Andrea Radrizzani of Leeds United</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/prLOm0JgLwY">the Horizen EVM marketplace presentation and demo with Sebastian Gronewald of Create3 Labs</a>. We were also able to capture footage of the event setup, which you can <a href="https://youtu.be/0jnOyIX-z1Y">check out on YouTube</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23903"></a></p>
 The BizTalks 
<p>We heard many interesting talks in the areas of finance and investing, such as “<a href="https://youtu.be/54NnrY2XmN8">Growing the Ecosystem Through Investments and Introducing HL Builders</a>,” <a href="https://youtu.be/lI_l-hRHzs8">“Cryptoeconomics trends”</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/j2XjwfOq8kU">Venture Now – The Investor Perspective</a>, and more! </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23904"></a></p>
<p>The panel <a href="https://youtu.be/ZUlGgTdE7V0">“Metaverse Trends”</a> gave attendees an intriguing look into what trends thought leaders in the space are looking at currently and where they think they will head in the near future. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23905"></a></p>
<p>The discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/dnJR_x9M7PA">“</a>Raising Funds – The Startup Perspective” gave us all an intriguing perspective on some of the early stages of creating a startup especially focused on web3 and blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
 The TechTalks 
<p>On the tech side of things, we heard incredible updates from the Horizen and Horizen Labs teams’ – <a href="https://youtu.be/8dgQ8Vr5FWs">an overview of TokenMint and its current status</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">where the team is on the Horizen EVM sidechain, DeFi on Horizen</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/JvY8o8N4_2Q">what’s next for Zendoo</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We welcomed experts to share their knowledge on topics like <a href="https://youtu.be/rJ2NWf-KcpY">“Plonk and LookUp Arguments,”</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/kQ37ZJ_wtO0">“Private NFT Protocols,”</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/RX7dGq_GZuI">“zkVMs Under the Hood,”</a> to mention a few. These educational panel discussions and talks provided many with additional technical expertise and understanding. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23906"></a></p>
 The Team Sessions 
<p>ZenCon0 also brought the global team together in one place to brainstorm, connect, and innovate. The Horizen Labs and Horizen teams from different divisions gave presentations on their expertise areas, which allowed members of other teams to gain exposure and knowledge in areas they might not previously have. Ranging from hands-on demos and product overviews to improving blockchain communications.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23908"></a></p>
<p>Internal sessions like “Bridging the Divide: From Tech to Product,” a discussion on how products go from technical concepts to useable products and how we market them, enabled the team to learn more about process flow and improvements and get insights into how other teams work together to drive our future. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23909"></a></p>
<p>While sessions like <a href="https://youtu.be/2OiF6cxJu94">“Common Vulnerabilities in Solidity Smart Contracts”</a> enabled us all to learn more about the tech behind our upcoming releases and understand more about the engineering decisions behind the creation of things like our upcoming EVM sidechain. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23910"></a></p>
 The Parties! 
<p>We kicked off ZenCon the night before the conference with a beautiful, welcoming party at the location of the event. This was an amazing opportunity for everyone to network and was where some of our team members met one another in person for the first time before kicking off the next two days!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23911"></a></p>
<p>The next side party was the CryptoMondays and Horizen Rooftop Aperativo at the Horizen Milan office, which was a great opportunity for further networking and enabled our team members outside of Milan to see the new office! This was an amazing event followed by a mystery dinner, where everyone was grouped randomly to enjoy dinner and network outside of our typical teams.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23912"></a></p>
<p>Finally, we ended this amazing experience and event with a fantastic closing party with great music, delicious food, and dancing! It was the perfect end to the best event we attended this year, and we cannot wait to welcome everyone again for the next ZenCon! </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23913"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23914"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23915"></a></p>
 After ZenCon – Getting the Team Together 
<p>After the main event, the Horizen and Horizen Labs teams took on an exciting challenge – A Horizen hackathon focusing on dapps that could be created on our upcoming EVM! The winners would have a chance to help make their idea a reality in our ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This fun team-building exercise was a great way for everyone to get to know each other better. The teams all came up with great ideas that we could see being potential use cases on Horizen one day! You may even see one of them in the coming months!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23917"></a></p>
<p>We also took a day to enable our teams to get to know each other better and get some well-deserved relaxation. We spent time hiking, exploring, and enjoying one another’s company. Afterward, the team split into groups to complete a fun scavenger hunt! Followed by an amazing final dinner together before we all traveled back home.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is a fascinating field that has made tremendous development over the past few years. From GPT-3 to Dall-e and Stable Diffusion, the vastness of the scope of applications for AI and neural computing is becoming clearer than ever. At the base layer, there is a need for decentralized p2p AI compute platform that provides flexible access to the wider public. Gensyn sets out on the mission to provide just that by building a market place protocol for AI compute - ultra-low cost, hyperscale, permissionless.</p><p>In today’s episode we are joined by the project's co-founders Ben Fielding and Harry Grieve. We take a deep dive into the current landscape for AI and AI compute, the reasonings and trade-offs in building Gensyn, the protocol’s focus and edge cases, and how the protocol is utilizing the blockchain technology as both incentive layer and credibly neutral platform.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The founders' background and reasonings for development on Blockchain  The current state of AI development and breakdown of AI concepts  The current landscape for AI modeling and compute  Gensyn's difference to other protocols, such as Golem  How Gensyn is adhering to the decentralized default, and making trade-offs in product building  Building Gensyn as a Layer-1 protocol  Deep dive into the Gensyn Protocol and edge cases  Other players in the protocol: solvers, verifiers, and whistle blowers  Building a blockchain  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://www.gensyn.ai/">Gensyn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/gensynai">Gensyn on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/fenbielding">Ben Fielding on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/_grieve">Harry Grieve on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Tally Ho: Tally Ho is a new wallet for Web3 and DeFi that sees the wallet as a public good.

 Introducing the Nym SDK — powerful privacy served directly to your&nbsp;browser <p>Nym releases a new TypeScript SDK to create apps that can use the Nym mixnet and Coconut credentials quickly</p><p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk/v/1.1.4">Nym SDK</a> allows you to send data over the Nym mixnet with ease from browser-based applications. It has recently been updated to version&nbsp;1.1.4.</p><p>This is the very first time that the full privacy powers of mixnets are available easily and directly from a browser&nbsp;window!</p><p>Any application that works from a browser or embeds a WebView can use this SDK to send data through the Nym mixnet to benefit from the network layer privacy protections it offers. This also includes client-side apps that use Electron, React Native, or Tauri frameworks (basically anything that can execute WebAssembly).</p><p>If you are a JavaScript or TypeScript developer and would like to give things a try and see how it works, have a look at our <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk">GitHub repository for examples</a> on how to use the&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>As an example, here is a basic <a href="https://chat-demo.nymtech.net">chat webapp</a>. Texts that are sent through the Nym mixnet and to the receiving party. Try running it between yourself and a friend or in two browsers! The <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk/typescript/examples/react-webpack-with-theme-example">code can be found here</a> if you’d like to understand how it&nbsp;works.</p><p>We are currently working on reply SURBs, which will allow the recipient to reply to the sender without knowing their address. We are also working on a version that works with NodeJS and native workers, so you can use the mixnet from your Express webapps or from a&nbsp;CLI.</p><p>Experiment with the current version and watch NPM for upgrades.</p><p>We look forward to seeing what kind of apps people will build with this&nbsp;client!</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym. Join our community to participate and keep up to&nbsp;date:</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p><a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-sdk-powerful-privacy-served-directly-to-your-browser-15c0919bdfbf">Introducing the Nym SDK — powerful privacy served directly to your browser</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Within the digital identity ecosystem, verifiable credentials (VCs) refers to an open standard for digital credentials that represent information that would normally be found in passports, driver’s licences, university titles, and other forms of accreditation.</p>



<p>In this post, we explain the mechanics underpinning VCs and some potential use cases.</p>



 In another time and another place, there were trustworthy knights. 



<p>Ivanhoe is one of Walter Scott’s best-known works. Deemed a historical romance novel, the story follows Wilfred of Ivanhoe, a Saxon knight, and his beloved, Lady Rowena. The thrust of the plot is Ivanhoe’s determination to marry Lady Rowena, with whom she grew up after Rowena was orphaned and became the ward of Wilfred’s father, Cedric, a powerful Saxon lord. The conflict arises when Cedric betroths Rowena to another, Athelstane, out of political interest.</p>



<p>Wilfred is portrayed as the epitome of chivalry. He’s heroic, honourable, and loyal. Rowena is equally depicted as chaste, virtuous, and loyal to her true feelings of love for Ivanhoe. Becoming a knight was a big deal in those days. Indeed, knighthood came to be considered a form of nobility, though in the lower scale. But the point is that knights were respectable, trustworthy individuals. So much so that, often, knights were assigned as elite personal guards for lords, who trusted knights implicitly. Over time, and as methods of warfare evolved, knights gradually became obsolete and eventually morphed into the honorary titles that survive to this day.</p>



<p>Let’s focus on the trust part, as this has bearing on our narrative. Knighthood could be earned by different means: prowess on the battlefield, for certain. Social status did have an influence. The peasantry had a scant chance of being knighted, for example. And there were economic factors at play, too. Armour, weapons, and knight-related paraphernalia were expensive, and beyond the reach of most. But perhaps the key factor for a lord (or someone from the royalty) to bestow knighthood unto somebody was trust. A knight-to-be had to prove himself worthy of trust by the lord. This implied honour, the upholding and protection of the weak, and respect. All these attributes had to be proven before the dubbing ceremony took place, where the lord would place the flat of a sword on the shoulders of the man kneeling before him, thus bestowing knighthood upon him. A foundation of trust was vital for the lord-knight relationship to work.</p>



 The triangle of trust 



<p>Fast forward a few centuries to the present day. Blockchain technology has enabled a new identity framework, centred around digital credentials. VCs are part of that framework.</p>



<p>VCs stand at the centre of a triangle of trust, which features three vertices: Issuer, Holder, and Verifier. The triangle represents the following flow: the Issuer digitally signs a credential (or set of), and issues them to the Holder, which manages the credentials and, when required, presents them to the Verifier. In this context, the Issuer and the Holder trust each other. The Holder trusts the Verifier, and the Verifier trusts the Issuer. As we can see, VCs are anchored on implicit trust, much like the relationship between a knight and a lord was all those years ago. Furthermore, this identity model puts the individual (the knight, in our narrative) in control of their identity attributes.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: quick definition 



<p>We all carry a set of physical credentials in our wallets at all times. Driver licenses, government IDs, library cards, health insurance cards, a passport if we are abroad, and myriad others. These things are a) cumbersome, and b) antiquated. It is cumbersome because we have so many of them, all issued by different entities. And antiquated because, well, they come in physical form, which means they can be lost or damaged beyond usability. Both scenarios would require contacting the issuing entity’s help desk many times, and a lengthy wait until a replacement is issued.</p>



<p>Now imagine if, instead of having to carry all those documents on you at all times, all you had to do was show a QR code that contained all that information. If you needed to use any of your credentials, someone would just scan the QR code, and poof, voila. Done. This is the essence of VCs. A digital representation of credentials that enables the individual to selectively share their information, without having to actually show the actual data. VCs enable the third party to instantly verify that the information is true, without having to call or contact anyone else.</p>



<p>In short: VCs are tamper-proof credentials that can be instantly and cryptographically verified.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: properties and components 



<p>As specified in the W3 data model, VCs must fulfil three inherent properties. They must be:</p>



  Machine-verifiable  Secure and tamper-proof  Respectful of privacy  



<p>At a technical level, VCs have three basic components: metadata, claims, and proofs</p>



<p>Metadata – This is information cryptographically signed by the Issuer. Metadata reflects the properties of the credential (who the issuer is, expiry date, and a public key, among many other pieces of information).<br>Claims – A statement about the Holder. Date of birth, for example.<br>Proofs – Information about the Holder that accomplishes four things:</p>



  Allows others to verify the source of the data (i.e., the issuer)  Proves that the data belongs to the Holder, and to that Holder alone  Guarantees that the data has not been tampered with  Checks that the data has not been revoked by the Issuer  



<p>All this information is contained within a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file, which is an open specification format for transmitting data as a series of attributes and values, and also arrays. These JSON files can then be converted into a JSON Web Token (JWT), which is essentially a JSON file with a cryptographic signature added in. These signatures are kept secure by a pair of public and private keys.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: use cases 



<p>VCs can be applied to many different aspects of identity-related frameworks. For example:</p>



  Government-issued documents, including passports, driver licences, national ID cards, etc.  Travel visas  Healthcare certificates  Credit scoring information  Educational credentials (diplomas, university titles, and any other academic achievements)  Documentation required for opening bank accounts, and applying for <a href="https://zaisan.io/self-sovereign-identity-finance/">financial products</a> (loans, mortgages, etc.)  Credentials for opening a bank account or setting up payments  Verification of disability status  



<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list. Rather, it is a sample of some of the possible solutions that VCs can be part of.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>There are no knights in today’s world, at least not like the ones described in Ivanhoe, or so many other medieval-themed tales. But the image of the honourable and strait-laced Wilfred will do just fine for our analogy. Wilfred (and all those bestowed with a knighthood) embodied trust, truth, and honour. VCs play a very similar role, albeit several centuries later, and in a world that has moved away from the centralization of power that lords represented. You can think of VCs as the knights of a decentralised world, representing the system of trust, truth, and honour that every identity framework requires to function.</p>



 Key takeaways 



  VCs stand at the center of a triangle of trust, which features three vertices: Issuer, Holder, and Verifier  Current standards dictate that VCs must be machine-verifiable, secure and tamper-proof, and respectful of privacy  At a technical level, VCs have three basic components: metadata, claims, and proofs  VC information is usually presented in JSON format, which can be converted into a JWT. This adds a cryptographic signature to the credential

 Announcing Verus Block Reward Halving — Predictable, Transparent Monetary&nbsp;Policy  Every two years the Verus block reward is halved. This is part of the predictable and transparent monetary policy, set in place by its inception in May&nbsp;2018.  Halving Event <p>The current block reward is 12 VRSC — which means that miners and stakers who win a block are rewarded 12 VRSC for their efforts of securing the network. This number will go down to 6 VRSC, drastically lowering the number of coins coming into circulation. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/economy/#block-rewards">See the complete coin emission schedule&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>⭐ What: Block reward to 6&nbsp;VRSC</p><p>⏱️ When: Block height 2,329,920 ( ~ Saturday 17 Dec 2022) <a href="https://countdown.verus.io/halving/">see countdown</a></p> Introducing the Fee&nbsp;Pool <p>With the PBaaS-mainnet upgrade coming closer, let’s introduce one of its gaming-changing features that will reward miners and stakers with drastically higher block&nbsp;rewards.</p>Higher block rewards for miners and&nbsp;stakers.<p>When PBaaS is activated on mainnet, anyone can launch blockchains, tokens and currencies, and they can convert currencies through Verus’ L1 DeFi protocol. All these activities cost fees that directly go to the miners and stakers of the worldwide network.</p><p>So even though a halving to 6 VRSC might seem bad for miners and stakers at first glance, a lot of good things are on the&nbsp;horizon.</p><p>👉 <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.5-2">Be on the cutting edge of blockchain technology and try out the fully functional testnet and its Fee Pool&nbsp;economy</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discuss and explore all Verus has to offer on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/announcing-verus-block-reward-halving-predictable-transparent-monetary-policy-eec42c18ca4">Announcing Verus Block Reward Halving — Predictable, Transparent Monetary Policy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 zCloak Network Partners with Scroll to Provide a Privacy-Preserving Identity Service on Ethereum Layer&nbsp;2 <p>zCloak Network announced that it will work with Scroll to provide a privacy-preserving identity service on Ethereum L2 for Scroll users. The partnership will focus on bringing a W3C compatible DID and Verifiable Credential platform on Scroll’s L2 architecture. The collaboration will also include an exploration of call data cost optimization and general research on zk-STARK/zk-SNARK technology, etc.</p><p>Scroll is a native zkEVM layer 2 solution for the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to scale Ethereum with cutting-edge research and technology. With zkEVM to prove the correctness of EVM execution in Layer2 and the building of a complete L2 architecture around it, Scroll is providing a full zkRollup solution on Ethereum. Additionally, if Scroll provides its users with a full suite of DID and Verifiable Credential service, there will be more possibilities of use cases explored and better interaction on Scroll’s L2 structure with less friction.</p><p>zCloak Network can provide Scroll with such DID and Verifiable Credential services with its <a href="http://zkid.app/">zkID.app</a> product and related SDK. zkID.app helps users to establish their own DID on Scroll, and this decentralized identity will function as an avatar of an entity in cyberspace, and their real-world identity data will be linked to it in a privacy-preserving way, stored on user’s local devices through browser extension.</p><p>The link of real-world data to DID is made possible by verifiable credentials. In this case, zCloak wants to help Scroll construct a platform where Scroll’s users can have their identity data attested, generate Verifiable credentials (VC), and use their VCs in various applications on Scroll’s L2&nbsp;network.</p><p>In more advanced use cases, services provided by zCloak Network can also serve as proof of social relations between users and organizations. Moreover, organizations can use zCloak to do KYC on their clients with an approach that preserves user privacy and data sovereignty. There are many use cases for <a href="http://zkid.app/">zkID.app</a> to be applied on Scroll, for example, DAOs can prove their treasury is above a certain number without disclosing the exact portfolio. In another case, project founders can prove that they have certain education or work experience without giving away too many&nbsp;details.</p><p>In conclusion, by collaborating with Scroll, zCloak Network leverages zero-knowledge proof technology to provide a unique set of DID protocols and infrastructure for Scroll’s users to use their real-world data for on-chain activities while preserving privacy. There will be implementation of both parties’ technology and products within this partnership, mainly regarding identity verification, conveying trustworthiness, and privacy protection. Both zCloak Network and Scroll are bringing Web3.0 solutions to projects and users, and we believe our collaboration will drive higher trust within the Web3.0&nbsp;world.</p> About Scroll <p>Scroll is a native zkEVM Layer 2 scaling solution built to scale Ethereum. Scroll enables high-throughput, low cost smart contracts, trustless security, and the same developer experience as Ethereum L1. Scroll’s architecture consists of Scroll Node, Roller Network, and Rollup and Bridge Contracts. Putting all of these together, Scroll is able to execute native EVM bytecode on L2 while inheriting strong security guarantees from base layer Ethereum. Scroll’s visions are to empower humanity — starting with blockchain developers and users, to build in the open with the community, and to fight for decentralization and censorship resistance.</p><p><a href="https://scroll.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP">Twitter</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://discord.gg/GQxeCTA4dJ">Discord</a></p> About zCloak&nbsp;Network <p>zCloak Network is a privacy-first DID and verifiable computation infrastructure. It aims to deliver the Web3 dream of Self-Sovereignty by moving both the storage and the computation of user data into user device from centralized servers. The integrity of user computation is proven by a STARK-based ZK-VM in a browser extension. zCloak’s W3C compatible DID system can mirror real-world legal status and reputation in DeSoc. With zCloak Network, people can use their real-world data for e.g. DeFi, Identity, Biometric applications without disclosing their privacy. zCloak Network is chain-agnostic — its identity and ZKP service can be served for most public blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://zcloak.network/#/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/zCloakNetwork">Twitter</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/j3mATwNVSH">Discord</a></p>

 Nym Shipyard Academy — welcome to Stage&nbsp;2! <p>Congratulations to our Nymsters — the more than 600 graduates from Stage 1 of the Nym Shipyard Academy! Over the past two weeks, participants learned about the Nym privacy system and some of the main surveillance problems of digital infrastructures. Two quizzes tested their knowledge. Those who scored 60% or higher on at least one quiz during Stage 1 have graduated to Stage 2 — the Navigator stage. Those who scored 50% and more will receive Stage 1&nbsp;rewards.</p> Changes to Shipyard Academy&nbsp;Rewards <p>The total reward pool for the Nym Shipyard Academy was 100K NYM tokens, with a 15K prize pool for Stage 1. However, since we designed Shipyard Academy the market took a heavy hit, not to mention that probably quite a few participants of the Academy were personally affected by the FTX meltdown. We want to make sure to account for&nbsp;that.</p><p>For this reason, we decided to increase the overall prize pool to 115K NYM tokens, adding 5K to the prize pool of each stage. This means the prize pools of each stage&nbsp;are:</p>  Stage 1: 20K NYM tokens (from&nbsp;15K)  Stage 2: up to 40K NYM tokens (from&nbsp;35K)  Stage 3: up to 55K NYM tokens (from&nbsp;50K)   Stage 1&nbsp;rewards <p>When it comes to Stage 1, all pupils who achieved 50% or more on quiz 1 or quiz 2 get a share of the reward pool. The rewards scale with quiz performance, with top scorers receiving the highest&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Here is the Stage 1 leaderboard — check it to find out how you did and whether you graduated to become a&nbsp;Nymster!</p><p>Congratulations to all our participants! If you didn’t manage to graduate to Stage 2, but want to know about future opportunities? Sign up&nbsp;<a href="http://eepurl.com/gdor_f">here</a>.</p><p>To receive your NYM&nbsp;tokens:</p>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Download the Nym&nbsp;wallet</a>  Await further instructions…  <p>Did you know you can use your NYM tokens via the wallet to bond a mixnode and help run the Nym&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRMZY6Ez1bA">Learn more.</a></p><p>Did you know that you can delegate your NYM tokens via the wallet to help secure the Nym mixnet and earn rewards for doing&nbsp;so?</p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">Learn more.</a></p> Stage 2: Navigator <p>By the end of stage 2 you know how to navigate the digital oceans in a safe manner and will have become a privacy advocate.</p><p>Now that you have learned the basics about Nym, network layer privacy and digital surveillance, it is time for you to help others navigate the digital oceans securely. The second stage of the Nym Shipyard Academy is all about sharing what you have learned so far and start to take action — by protecting your privacy as you use some of the most common apps in&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>During this stage, you&nbsp;will:</p>  spread the word to others about privacy online and the problems of popular applications like Telegram and&nbsp;Discord;  learn to use <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/nym-connect">NymConnect</a> to protect the network layer as you chat online and tell the world you are doing&nbsp;so;  deepen your knowledge about the Nym network and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/choose-your-character-an-overview-of-nym-network-actors-19e6a9808540">the types of nodes</a> it consists&nbsp;of;  learn about the token economics and how incentives help to ensure the privacy and security of the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.  <p>As the stakes are getting higher, the quiz will be more difficult during Stage 2. You may want to look around on our Discord server for study groups, or create your own! Reach out to our Community Managers if you need info on study&nbsp;groups.</p> Stage 2&nbsp;rewards <p>When it comes to Stage 2, the final size of the prize pool is in your hands! You now understand what the Nym mixnet does, and the importance of using it to protect your privacy.

<p>An update on the tokenomics of the Nym mixnet with a new vest underway.</p><p>A new vest is underway this month. Over the course of two years, NYM tokens vest on a quarterly basis, meaning backers, team and Option 2 token holders receive a batch of tokens (testnet participants now fully vested!) This incrementally increases the circulating supply of NYM, stake supply and saturation point, affecting the token economic dynamics as the privacy network and the NYM supply grow. This blogpost gives an overview of changes as a result of the new quarterly vest.</p><p>In short, the main token economic changes you might want to be aware of&nbsp;are:</p>  The circulating supply of NYMs is now around 304 million&nbsp;NYM.  Staking supply is approximately 349 million&nbsp;NYM.  Target level of staking across the entire network is 50%, and thus mix node rewards are maximized when 174 million NYM (50% of the staking supply) are&nbsp;staked.  Stake saturation point is now 726K NYM saturation per node. It is determined by target stake divided by the target number of mix nodes (that remains unchanged at K=240 rewarded nodes per epoch). Dividing 174 million of target staked amount by 240 nodes results in approximately 726K NYM saturation per&nbsp;node.  The ability to delegate unvested tokens is now capped at 10% to prevent whales from receiving the largest proportion of rewards by staking locked tokens, thus ensuring a better rewards and wider distribution among all the stakeholders that stake unlocked NYM&nbsp;tokens.  <p>Circulating supply of&nbsp;NYM</p><p>The circulating supply (let’s denote it by C) of NYM is defined as the amount of unlocked tokens that are available. Currently, the circulating supply is around 304 million&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>The circulating supply increases on a per-epoch (hourly) basis with the rewards distributed from the mixmining pool and quarterly with the vesting of locked tokens (let’s denote by V the amount of tokens that are still in a vesting contract). The quarterly vest is currently underway, unlocking an additional tranche of tokens, hence a more drastic change to&nbsp;supply.</p><p>As of end November 2022, taking into account rewards distributed so far and newly vested tokens, the circulating supply stands at about C=304 million NYM — with about V=451 million NYM still locked in vesting accounts and the remaining 245 million NYM locked in the mixmining pool.</p><p>Staking supply of&nbsp;NYM</p><p>The staking supply (let’s denote it by S) of NYM is defined as the amount of NYM that is available to stake in nodes in the Nym mixnet. Currently, the staking supply is about 349 million&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>The amount of NYM tokens available to stake on nodes in the Nym mixnet is slightly higher than the circulating supply as people are also able to delegate stake using a portion of their locked&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>More precisely, the staking supply includes all the circulating supply C and part of unlocked tokens V. Thus S = C+f*V, where f is the fraction of unvested tokens that can be staked. The parameter f is set to 10%, resulting in a staking supply S = 304m+0.1*451m =&nbsp;349m.</p><p>The staking supply S is an important parameter, as it affects the mix node saturation point, meaning the stake required for a mix node to achieve maximum&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Mix node stake saturation point</p><p>The node stake saturation point, which we denote by Nsat, is given by the stake supply, target level of staking and number of rewarded nodes. The current node saturation point is approximately 726K NYM (after adjusting for the fact we aim for 50% of the supply being&nbsp;staked).</p><p>The node saturation point, Nsat, is the amount of stake (reputation) that a mix node needs in order to maximize its rewards. If all of the staking supply is taken into consideration, then the mix node saturation point is given by the staking supply S divided by the number of rewarded nodes (denoted by K and currently set to K=240 nodes), ie, the equilibrium (maximum distributed rewards) is reached when the entire staking supply S is distributed equally among K&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>Note however that this assumes that 100% of the tokens in the staking supply must be staked for the network to distribute maximum rewards. Since aiming for 100% staking is unrealistic, we have introduced a parameter b (with values between zero and one) that determines the target level of staking. Thus, for example if b=0.5, then the network reaches maximum rewards (equilibrium) when 50% of the supply S is staked on K nodes. Taking all of this into account, the node saturation point is computed as Nsat = b*S/K = b*(C+f*V)/K.</p><p>The parameters C and V (circulating and locked tokens) are given by the token distribution and vesting contracts. The parameter K (number of rewarded nodes) is selected so that there is a sufficient number of nodes in the mixnet to route all the user&nbsp;packets.</p><p>The fraction f of unvested tokens that can be staked is set to 10% as a compromise, to enable participation with locked tokens while keeping high rewards for staked circulating tokens. The target level of staking b is set to 50% to account for a fraction of the token supply not being staked. This results in Nsat = 0.5*(304m+0.1*451m)/240 = 726K&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Mixmining pool and per-epoch node&nbsp;rewards</p><p>The mixmining pool started out with 250 million NYM and it currently still contains about 245 million NYM, after having distributed about 5 million NYM in rewards to mix nodes over the last few months. The mixmining pool is configured to make 2% of its value per month available for rewards (currently 0.02*245m =&nbsp;4.9m).</p><p>The resulting mixmining rewards available per hourly epoch for the set of rewarded nodes are about 6.800 NYM per hour (4.9 million divided by 30*24 hours). Note that out of the 6.800 NYM rewards available for distribution in an epoch, not all is given out to nodes, e.g. due to low stake or underperformance. The unallocated rewards remain in the mixmining pool for future distribution.</p><p>Considering K=240 rewarded nodes, the maximum rewards received in an epoch by any given node are about 6.800/240 = 28 NYM/hour, which are reached when the node is fully saturated with stake, has perfect performance and a very high bond. In practice, a typical node that is close to saturated, has less-than-perfect performance and a minimal bond receives about 21 NYM/hour in&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Estimated APY</p><p>Estimated APY with the new node saturation stake is approximately 29%.</p><p>Considering 21 NYM/hour earned by a node, how does the node saturation point relate to the APY of tokens staked on the node? Simply put, the higher the saturation point, the lower the APY, because those 21 NYM are shared among all the tokens staked on the&nbsp;node.</p><p>Before the vest and corresponding increase in circulating supply, the node saturation was at Nsat=430K NYM, while now it has increased to Nsat=726K NYM. A saturated node receiving 21 NYM in an epoch provided 21/430.000 NYM rewards per staked token. With an increased Nsat=726K NYM, each staked token receives 21/726.000 NYM in&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The APY is an “annual” yield that takes compounding into account, and in the case of Nym compounding happens on an hourly basis (24 times per day and 365 days per year). Thus, if the rewards per token per epoch were 21/430.000, then the APY of that node was APY = (1+21/430.000)^(24*365) — 1 = 53%. With the increased saturation point, each staked token receives 21/726.000 in rewards, and the APY = (1+21/726.000)^(24*365) — 1 =&nbsp;29%.</p><p>Note that for simplicity we are considering that the node’s profit margin is zero. A higher profit margin increases rewards (and APY) for the node operator at the expense of decreasing rewards (and APY) for the node’s delegates. (The total mix node rewards stay constant regardless of profit margin, which only affects the operator / delegates split of rewards).</p><p>Whale defenses — cap on staking for unvested&nbsp;tokens</p><p>The parameter f determines the contribution of unvested tokens to the staking supply S = C+f*V. Bonding and delegating unvested tokens as stake is now capped at 10% in order to prevent whales from hoarding the majority of rewards and ensure a fair saturation point and rewards across the&nbsp;network.</p><p>On the upper bound, f=1 considers that all 755 million tokens (whether liquid or locked in a vesting contract) can be staked. This high value of f favors whales with a substantial amount of unvested stake, by making their locked tokens have the same staking power as unlocked tokens. Considering b=0.5 and f=1, this would lead to a saturation of Nsat=1.6million NYM per node! And a corresponding APY of only&nbsp;12%.</p><p>On the lower bound, f=0 considers that only the currently liquid 304 million NYM can be staked. This low value of f favors stakeholders that do not have any unvested tokens. Considering b=0.5 and f=0 leads to a saturation of Nsat=633K NYM per node and a corresponding APY of&nbsp;34%.</p><p>In order to allow stakeholders with unvested tokens to participate in staking while limiting their overall effect on the staking supply, we select f=0.1, i.e. 10% of unvested tokens can be staked. This 10% is applied equally to all accounts with unvested&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>This results in an overall staking supply S = 304m + 0.1*451m = 349m NYM which are then factored by b=0.5 to account for a 50% staking target, leading to a target staking supply of 174 million NYM. This results in node saturation Nsat = 726K NYM and APY of 29% when considering 21 NYM/hour in rewards for a typical near-saturated node.</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym.

Findora Postmortem Report<blockquote>This postmortem report is written for and provided to the community to provide transparency into a recent outage. This article will describe the event, its root cause, and its resolution while highlighting how improvements will be made in an effort to prevent a recurrence of the&nbsp;issue.</blockquote> Event Date <p>Tuesday, November 15,&nbsp;2022</p> Impact &amp;&nbsp;Duration   Mainnet consensus halted  Duration: 4.5&nbsp;Hours   Overview <p>The Discreet Labs DevOps team attempted to coordinate with a set of Findora community validators for a pilot upgrade on the Findora Mainnet network. During this attempt, the Mainnet network experienced an unexpected outage. Engineers identified the issue, immediately began troubleshooting efforts, and worked with the affected validators to revert the nodes to their previous version. More community validators joined the effort to restore their&nbsp;nodes.</p> What Occurred <p>At approximately 5 PM, Nov 15, 2022 (PST), the Findora Mainnet’s consensus stopped for 4.5 hours. The incident was triggered, not caused, by several transactions sent from a newer beta version of the Findora wallet after DevOps coordinated with a set of validators during a pilot upgrade with the v0.3.3X Mainnet&nbsp;update.</p><p>The event was detected proactively by the event monitoring system. Discreet Labs began troubleshooting efforts within 10 minutes of the notification.</p> Root Cause(s) <p>The v0.3.3X update includes a new transaction parameter in the transaction body. The transaction hash calculation logic of the node is as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>Deserialization -&gt; Signature Verification -&gt; Transaction Execution -&gt; Serialization -&gt; Compute Transaction Hash</blockquote><p>Since the new parameter did not exist in previous versions, nodes running v0.3.27 ignored the parameter when calculating the transaction hash. In version 0.3.3X, however, this field is involved in the transaction hash calculation, thus causing the transaction hashes to be inconsistent.</p> Resolution <p>The new transaction parameter will be ignored for hash calculation in v0.3.3X but will retain its role in signature verification. This update to release v0.3.3X will ensure transaction hashes remain backward compatible with v0.3.2X&nbsp;nodes.</p> Moving Forward <p>The Discreet Labs team has documented several lessons learned and preventive measures to take moving forward. The items below reflect the methods teams will use collaboratively to minimize risk and optimize communication.</p> Additional Testing via Mainnet-Mock   Upgrades with impact potential will undergo additional rounds of testing on a transient network called “Mainnet-Mock”. This network will be an identical copy of Mainnet, including its data and validators, acting as a mirror of Findora’s production network.  Mainnet-Mock will be created and deconstructed as needed. As a mirror copy of Mainnet, testing against the Mainnet-Mock network will require the assistance and close communication of Findora community validators to reach &gt; 66.67% consensus.  Upgrades that carry potential impact will be validated on the Mainnet-Mock network before being classified as “Mainnet-Ready”.   Change Management Process Improvements <p>Changes that can impact production will go through an improved change management process. These process improvements will ensure that all the appropriate stakeholders are in-sync with the engineering change&nbsp;task.</p>  Discreet Labs will continue to ensure that partners and CEX contacts are notified of upcoming changes using the schedule above. Technical support will continue to be provided when&nbsp;needed.  The details of changes that can impact production will be communicated extensively with the community well in advance of the scheduled change date. Discreet Labs will share information two weeks before the change, one week prior, three days prior, one day prior, the day of the change, and the day&nbsp;after.  Change information will be shared across social media, pinned to the official Discord and Telegram channels and Reddit as announcement posts. Discreet Labs will communicate to the validator community on validator-specific channels across Discord and Telegram.  Mainnet-Mock testing will be conducted as part of the change management process. See above for information on Mainnet-Mock.  <p>Special thanks to the validator community who worked together in restoring their nodes in a collaborative manner, reflecting the positive values the Findora community fosters and embraces. Your decision to help decentralize and secure the Findora network is greatly&nbsp;valued.</p><p>We look forward to upgrading Mainnet to v0.3.3X together.</p> About Findora <p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography.

<p>Secure multi-party computation is a well-known cryptographic technique designed to secure digital assets or protect information cryptographically. Today, several MPC theories and algorithms are leveraged in various sectors to safeguard information. Similarly, with the rise in popularity of blockchain-based financial solutions (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/cross-chain-defi-possible-or-forever-limited/">DeFi</a>), the interest in MPC has spiked, mainly due to the applications of MPC in safeguarding funds in crypto wallets.<br></p><p>In a nutshell, multi-party computation enables programmatic solutions to secure “secrets” by splitting them into multiple parts, such that no single participant know the underlying “truth”. Thanks to this, no single participant can reconstruct or leak secret information.<br></p><p>In this article, we will understand the concept of secure multi-party computation in detail, how it works, and its numerous applications.</p> What is multi-party computation (MPC)? <p>Multi-party computation is a cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties, each in possession of fragments of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-in-the-age-of-surveillance-a-pipedream-or-something-worth-fighting-for-341a67f1db76/">private data</a>, to participate in computing a specific result. This specific result is computed by combining their data without disclosing the nature or content of their inputs or any other secret information related to the process. <br></p><p>In simpler terms, multi-party computation brings together separate entities holding pieces of information that, when combined, can reveal a secret, sign a message, or approve a transaction. It’s also worth noting that MPC achieves this without revealing any details on the information in each individual's possession.<br></p><p>It’s worth noting that in MPC, the data split across multiple participants does not represent the secret if simply combined together. Instead, these pieces of information will serve as inputs to participate in the desired computation. Every valid MPC protocol must fulfill two specific requirements:<br></p>  Suppose participants reveal their secret information or discard the rules during the computation. In that case, the multi-party computation protocol will not allow dishonest participants to force the honest parties to disclose their confidential information or influence the outcome of the result.<br>  No one can deduce each party's secret information from the protocol's execution. This means that the result of the computation does not give its holders any hint of what the private information in the participants' possession is.<br>  <p>MPC as a concept is said to be born in 1980s when Chinese computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yao">Andrew Yao</a> first adopted two-party computation and introduced secure multi-party computation. Here's what the timeline of the evolution of MPC looks like:<br></p>  1982 – 1986: To solve the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_problem">Millionaire's Problem</a>, Andrew Yao introduced two-party computation and adapted it to any calculation involving two parties.<br>  1987: Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali, and Avi Wigderson release the <a href="https://wiki.mpcalliance.org/gmw.html">Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson protocol</a>, adapting two-party computation to a multi-party format.<br>  The 1990s: More studies on multi-party computation resulted in several breakthroughs, one of which was enabling MPC on mobile (i.e. less powerful) devices.<br>  2008: The first practical application of MPC at scale occurred in a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/meeting-on-privacy-enhancing-cryptography/documents/toft.pdf">sealed-bid sugar beet auction</a> in Denmark.<br>  2015: Following an increase in hacks and thefts from crypto wallets, crypto wallet providers and custodians begin utilizing MPC for private key and digital asset security.  2019: The <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/pushing-mpc-wallet-signing-speeds-8x-with-mpc-cmp-9/">MPC-CMP</a> debuted as the first automatic, one-round key-refreshing multi-party computation algorithm.   How does multi-party computation work? <p>To understand how multi-party computation works, let’s consider one famous example.<br></p><p>Greg and Smith, two employees holding similar roles at a company, are having lunch. Then, they want to know whether they earn the same amount or if any of them is being paid less than what they deserve. Yet, they do not want to reveal their wages. How do they solve this dilemma without revealing their secrets to one another?<br></p><p>A simple way to solve their problem would be to disclose their income to a trusted mutual friend, who can tell them if they earn the same wage based on the information she has received. However, the goal of a multi-party computation protocol is to help them figure out who's worth the most among them without third-party involvement.<br></p><p>Using oblivious transfers, Greg and Smith can solve their dilemma quickly. The oblivious transfer method is a non-technical way to explain secure multi-party computation. In this scenario, Greg gets four locked suggestion boxes and marks each box with a particular amount that may represent the hourly pay for their roles. Box-1 is marked $40, Box-2 is marked $50, Box-3 is marked $60, and Box-4 is marked $70.<br></p><p>Let’s say Greg earns $50 hourly, so he takes only the key for Box 2. Smith makes $60 hourly and has to select the box that matches his hourly earnings. On four pieces of paper, he writes a 'NO' on three sheets and a 'YES' on the fourth. These scribblings will go into each box, and the one with a 'YES' goes into Box-3 since Smith earns $60 per hour, while other boxes get a NO.<br></p><p>When Greg unlocks Box-2, he finds a NO, indicating that Smith does not earn $50 per hour. Greg now has to tell Smith that they do not make the same hourly wage, though neither of them knows who earns more or less. Their secrets are safe, and they have exchanged information without revealing anything. Note that this analogy depends on honesty from both parties.<br></p><p>Secure multi-party computation splits essential information that can be used to compute a specific result among multiple parties in total secrecy. Each participant only knows the information in their possession, and throughout the computation, no part of the secrets are revealed.<br></p>Another example, similar to one mentioned above, to understand the concept on MPC. (<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/secure-multi-party-computation/">Source</a>)‌ ‌<p></p>Threshold signature scheme MPC diagram. (<a href="https://www.qredo.com/blog/what-is-multi-party-computation-mpc">Source</a>) Applications of multi-party computation <p>Over the years, multi-party computation has found several use cases and applications. The earliest <a href="https://partisia.com/better-market-solutions/mpc-goes-live/">large-scale application</a> was recorded in 2008 at a sealed-bid sugar beet auction in Denmark. Farmers' bids were private, with the protocol responsible for determining the highest bid. The farmer with the winning bid went on to pay the second-highest request on the bidding log. Sealed-bid auctions remain popular still. <br></p><p>There are several variations and modifications of multi-party computation schemes enabling further applications. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">Threshold signature schemes</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shamirs-secret-sharing-algorithm-cryptography/">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a> are two famous examples of cryptographic methods leveraging MPC. <br></p><p>Other significant applications of MPC include:</p> Data Analytics <p>Big firms that deal with confidential user data, like healthcare companies or financial institutions, can collect data securely from an anonymous pool of users, compute, analyze, and gain insights from the data using MPC. This way, users will not reveal their personal information, and these organizations can <a href="https://soda-project.eu/mpcenterprise/">analyze</a> the data for insights without uncovering it. <br></p><p>This same method can be applied to autonomous cars, shipping or truck fleets, and aircraft fleets, with recipients like car companies, city planners, and service providers benefitting from the insights without knowing any details on the information provided.</p> Genetic Testing <p>Secure multi-party computation can also be utilized in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7545831">genetic testing</a>. Patients can access their genetic profiles privately and securely without revealing any confidential information on their metabolism rates, family traits, hereditary disease information, and other data thatthey would rather not share.</p> Threshold MultiSig in Blockchains <p>Threshold multi-signature schemes are a subfield of multi-party computation and can perform similar functions as a private key on the blockchain, including public address generation and transaction signing. <br></p><p>With MPC, the private keys of a crypto wallet can be split (<a href="https://silencelaboratories.com/silent-shard/">shards</a>) among several parties in such a way that for any function to be performed, a minimum number of people holding key shares have to be involved. <br></p><p>If some participants within the group become dishonest, they will not be able to have their way unless they reach the threshold for signing transactions. Usually, these participants do not know each other.</p> Digital Wallet Security <p>Multi-party computation protocols enhance private key security and, by extension, digital wallet security. Most cryptocurrency wallets use private keys, usually stored in a particular '<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusted</a>' device. While this method primarily depends on the strength of the device's security measures, it also presents a single point of failure. <br></p><p>Using MPC, private keys are split up between multiple entities, making it more difficult for attackers to compromise the digital wallet since they have to attack multiple points simultaneously.</p> Closing Thoughts <p>Multi-party computation has evolved over the years and remains a crucial breakthrough in the world of cryptography today. From sealed-bid auctions to crypto wallets, MPC protocols are being leveraged in various applications. <br></p><p>From a blockchain perspective, however, leveraging MPC for security of digital wallets is a critical, immediate application that multiple parties are invested on. As more and more wallet providers begin to adopt MPC protocols for wallet security, the era of seed phrases may be over. As of now, several <a href="https://zengo.com/mpc-wallet/">wallet providers</a> have already started opting MPC to offer better protection and an improved user experience.<br></p><p>In the coming year, hopefully, we'll have more real-life applications of multi-party computation touching our daily lives similar to what happened with <a href="https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication">public key authentication</a>.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Since joining Privy earlier this year, I’ve been spending most of my time working with web3 developers to help improve their products’ UX, onboarding flows, and user data privacy. I’ve spoken with over 100 founders in the space working on gaming, NFTs, web3 social, defi, payments/accounting, and much more. In spite of all the recent market uncertainty, my optimism about our market burns hotter than ever. Here are some learnings from a very deep dive with&nbsp;Privy.</p><p>Winter is here. As we bundle up and prepare for another cycle of hunkered down building, the Privy team has been reflecting on what it’ll take for web3 to unlock the next phase of adoption beyond financial use cases. In the coming months, seeds will be planted that’ll grow into the next wave of consumer apps to shape our lives. These apps must prove to be useful and fun enough to pull both my 15-year-old cousin and my 85-year-old grandma into our market (whether they know it or&nbsp;not).</p><p>Our work helping developers build better web3 products and bridge the gap between on and off chain data has given us a sense of the features these apps will need to have to hit mainstream adoption. Without further ado, here are our ingredients for developers cooking up the web3 consumer apps of tomorrow:</p>  Progressive onboarding — meet users where they are: The next billion blockchain users don’t have self-custodial wallets yet. While self-custody is perhaps the single most important feature of a web3 product, apps need first-class ways for walletless users to onboard and get immediate value. The best apps will have ways for users to onboard via email or social identities, and seamlessly upgrade to self-custody when they’re ready or as the app demands it. As the old saying goes: you’ll attract more bees with email auth than with mnemonics.  Mobile-first — bringing blockchains to every pocket: If you’ve given up on a web3 app after trying to connect on mobile, you’re not alone. The broken mobile user flow of getting misdirected to the app store upon wallet connection runs rampant, and for good reason: building mobile-optimized experiences in web3 is hard. But mobile accounts for &gt;60% of internet traffic (growing fast!). The web3 apps of tomorrow will be natively mobile — props to apps like OpenSea, Zapper, and dYdX for leading the way&nbsp;here!  Friction where it matters — when to slow a user down: Not all blockchain transactions are created equal. While it might make sense to interrupt a user session to prompt a signature on a financial transaction, many on-chain events should occur without user interruptions, notably in web3 social and gaming. Should you sign something every time you follow a new account, make an in-game move, or like a post? Of course not. Lots of exciting development in areas like session-specific keys and account abstraction will pull UX forward on this front. The best apps will be judicious about when to prompt users (shout out to our friends at Farcaster for showing us an example of what great looks&nbsp;like!).  Asset portability — open is the way to win: Whether they realize it or not, consumers will choose to use blockchain apps because they allow users to seamlessly bring their assets in and take their assets out. While it can be a tempting value capture play for developers to lock assets into their apps’ walled gardens, this misses the point! Games that let users bring their own leveling reputation and that let users leave with assets they earn in gameplay stand to attract new potential audiences and deliver much richer first time experiences for those audiences off the bat. Financial assets, user data, and identity will travel with users across the internet, and developers who build for more than just using blockchain as a financial backdrop for their apps can unlock new user experiences that are only possible in&nbsp;web3.  <p>It’s always darkest before dawn. Winters are exactly the sort of distraction-free environments necessary to breed the innovations that pull our market forward each cycle: it’s no coincidence that Ethereum and Uniswap were launched in the depths of 2015 and 2018, respectively. As long as we cook up the next generation of web3 apps with the above in mind, this should be the last winter before mainstream consumer adoption is here to&nbsp;stay.</p><p>We’re lucky to be serving the builders working day-and-night to turn mainstream adoption into a reality, and we can’t wait to show you all what we’ve been up to these past few&nbsp;months.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/how-crypto-goes-mainstream-from-here-d1371be33d5f">How Crypto Goes Mainstream from Here</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>NFT Community management tasks help to ensure the smooth running of the community and its future development in <a href="https://zaisan.io/web3-explained/">Web3</a>. It helps to keep track of community events and developments and to keep the community organised and cohesive to the project goal. Community management can help to resolve disputes and to show empathy to digital asset owners. Nevertheless, NFT holders are, in essence, shareholders of the project. NFT community management is becoming even more important as Web3 communities continue to grow, and remember, with a strong community, anything is possible.</p>



 Quick refresh: what is an NFT (community)? 



<p>The management of non-fungible tokens (NFT) communities is a critical but often overlooked aspect of developing and deploying these digital assets. NFTs are unique tokens on a blockchain that can represent ownership of digital or physical assets. In contrast to fungible tokens, which are interchangeable and can be divided into smaller units, NFTs are non-divisible. Due to their rarity or uniqueness, they are ideal to represent items like art, collectibles, and in-game items with monetary value.</p>



<p>NFT communities are flourishing online spaces where people with a shared interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can connect with one another. As the popularity of NFTs continues to grow, as do too the number of people flocking to these communities in search of information, advice, and support.</p>







 Why NFT community management is essential 



<p>With such a wide range of people with different levels of knowledge and expertise, NFT community management can be a challenge. It is important to strike a balance between providing content that is both informative and accessible to all, while also avoiding overwhelming newcomers with too much information.</p>



<p>While the technical aspects of creating and deploying NFTs are essential, it is equally important to have a well-managed community around the project. This is because NFTs are often bought and sold in online communities. The success of an NFT project depends on the strength of these communities. For example, an NFT gaming community needs players to support the game, therefore, enjoy playing the game<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/"> to transact in-game assets</a> with one another.</p>



<p>A good NFT community will have a variety of content that covers the basics of what NFTs are and how they work. Additionally, it includes more in-depth articles and discussions for those with a more advanced understanding. It is also essential to have a system in place for moderating content and managing users in order to keep the community respectful and welcoming to all. One way is by establishing rules and best practices written on communication channels, as well as creating a tutorial page for newcomers.</p>



<p>With the right mix of content and community management, NFT communities can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in this exciting technology. It can be a fun entry point to the Web3 world!</p>



 3 Tips to create a strong foundation for your NFT Community 



<p>There are a few things that project owners should keep in mind when managing their NFT communities.</p>



 1. Constantly remind people of your vision 



<p>Have a clear vision and to communicate constantly with your members. This way, you can keep everyone on the same page and working towards the same goals. Let’s take an example: using Web3 technology, an NFT online chess game allows users to interact with in-game assets and transact<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/"> </a>them. It creates a <a href="https://zaisan.io/play-to-earn-business-models-games/">Play-to-Earn (P2E) model</a>. For instance, this NFT game has the vision to create a community in which chess players can enjoy playing the game while earning rewards in forms of digital assets, NFTs and cryptocurrency. It is therefore necessary for the weekly content plan to include benefits and positive facts about NFT online chess in order to create rapport and build high beliefs about the project as more players join.</p>



 2. Active moderation is key 



<p>The project ambassadors should be active in the community and should engage with community members on a regular basis. This is essentially getting more experienced people in the community to be a moderator. They should be the ones who are zealously advocating for the project. But as a project that just started, it is indispensable to have a community manager to push forward content and to be listening to the market needs.</p>



 3. Get people involved in decision-making 



<p>Finally, it is vital to have a community-centered approach to decision-making. This means that the community should be involved in decisions about the project, such as what features to add or what direction to take the project in. This will lead the project to a democratic system. The funds spent on NFTs are being directed to the project development from a shared decision-making perspective. In practice, this can be done by a voting system or members’ livestream meetings with the project owner.</p>

I’ll keep things short and to the&nbsp;point.</p> Verus Desktop v0.9.5&nbsp;Update <p>⏰ Update your Verus Desktop wallet before 19 November 11 PM UTC. This release updates the Komodo notaries to season 6 and you must update to reliably stay synchronized to the Verus mainnet (activation height of block 2,291,830).</p><p>v0.9.5 introduces 2 new APIs and CLI commands, signdata and verifysignature, that encompass all of the capabilities of previous signing and verification APIs and add new capabilities for advanced signatures and verification — a more powerful and flexible framework for NFTs and ID-bound legal rights and agreements.</p><p>In addition to digital signing of documents or information using an ID, the new APIs enable easily binding together multiple sources of content, documents, identities, and VDXF keys together into one verifiable signature and then being able to verify that signature, including all of its specific bindings.</p><p>🔗 <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Download Verus Desktop&nbsp;v0.9.5</a></p> Verus PBaaS &amp; DeFi&nbsp;Updates <p>In anticipation of the Verus PBaaS mainnet upgrade — delivering no-programming needed blockchain and currency launches, MEV-free DeFi, non-custodial Ethereum bridging and so much more — community developers introduce a protocol improvement designed to make the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol even more resistant than what we believe was already the leading algorithm to multi-block attempts at&nbsp;MEV.</p><p>The protocol improvement makes the following adjustments:</p>  Conversions and cross-chain transfers still roll-up into exports that are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions, but to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next requires a random bit pulled from later&nbsp;blocks.  The last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, which is no longer the&nbsp;case.  Import transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.  <p>These changes together serve to disincentivize any miner or staker from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss. They would be better off saving their working capital to arbitrage imports by joining transactions, bringing them close to market, and earning money without risk of loss. In addition, if they do end up putting more value of transactions in a block that caps the export rollup, they will reliably earn meaningful rewards without risk of loss in that way as&nbsp;well.</p> Bug Bounties&nbsp;💰 <p>While we don’t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended.</p><p>If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000&nbsp;VRSC.</p><p>🗒️ <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.5-2">See PBaaS-Testnet Release&nbsp;Notes</a></p><p>🛎️ <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Join Discord and report&nbsp;bounties</a></p> Introducing VerusID to Verus&nbsp;Mobile <p>This version of Verus Mobile takes a major leap forward, enabling support for VerusID, including sending and receiving funds and use of your VerusID as a password-free, secure and self-sovereign web or mobile app sign-in, made possible with the VerusID authentication protocol.</p><p>Verus Mobile v0.3.0–24 supports the version 1.0 of the VerusID authentication protocol, which prepares for the PBaaS upgrade and supports application provisioning of IDs, an important way applications can onboard users, give them a verified self-sovereign ID and funds address, enable sending and receiving payments, and make applications more secure by design with an easy, password-free sign-in.</p><p>In addition to its new support for VerusID and the Verus Authentication Protocol, this version of Verus Mobile continues to include Wyre as a fiat on-ramp and maintains support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a variety of popular coins and&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>If you are an app developer who wants to benefit from and help pioneer a better, more user-centric, inherently commerce-enabled, verifiable application model for a true Internet of Value, this is the release that enables you!

<p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ethereum-competitors-advantages-and-disadvantages/">Ethereum</a> is at the forefront of the crypto charge, and Ethereum account abstraction might be a key aspect of bringing it to the masses. But what is it precisely, and what makes it necessary?</p><p>Many see the network as the future of blockchain finance, as it holds several advantages over Bitcoin. It is the first blockchain to support smart contracts and the largest (volume-wise) after<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/"> Bitcoin</a>. </p><p>But as beautiful as the future of Ethereum and crypto may look, mass adoption remains a genuine concern. </p><p>While crypto enthusiasts may not need help creating and preserving the security of their self-custodial Ethereum wallets, the user experience for newly onboarded users could be better. This is especially true when setting up a <a href="https://appinventiv.com/blog/custodial-vs-non-custodial-wallets/">non-custodial wallet</a>. The process of generating and safely storing seed phrases remains quite complicated and, if a user loses access to her seed phrase, they might as well forget about whatever coins their wallets hold because the funds will be beyond their reach. Surely, onboarding a billion users under such circumstances will remain to be seen as challenging.</p><p>To improve the existing technology and lower the barriers of entry for new users, developers at the<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/"> Ethereum Foundation</a> began to propose the concept of Ethereum account abstraction. In this article, we'll look at what Ethereum account abstraction is, how it works, and most importantly, how it will benefit users.</p> How do Ethereum accounts work? <p>To use the Ethereum network, you must create an Ethereum account. A typical Ethereum account has a public address and a private key. You should not confuse Ethereum accounts for Ethereum wallets, as the latter is only an interface that helps you interact with tokens on the blockchain.</p><p>An Ethereum account consists of four key components: nonce, balance, codeHash, and storageRoot.</p>  The<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-series-understanding-nonce-3858194b39bf"> nonce</a> is a counter that tracks the number of transactions an account sends or contracts an account creates, depending on the account type.<br>  The balance is the amount of<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/wei"> wei</a> owned by an account. Wei is a denomination of ether, Ethereum's native currency.<br>  The codeHash of an Ethereum account is the code tied to that account on the<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/"> Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>, a virtual computer built on the Ethereum blockchain. Since only contract accounts (explained below) are tied in code to the<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zkevm-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/"> EVM</a>, in accounts without code (also known as externally owned accounts or EOA), the codeHash is an empty string.<br>  The storageRoot of an Ethereum account is the hash that encodes the account's storage content. Also known as the storage hash, it is a<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/"> 256-bit hash</a> of a Merkle Patricia trie's root node. A<a href="https://medium.com/@chiqing/merkle-patricia-trie-explained-ae3ac6a7e123"> Patricia Merkle Trie</a> is one of the key data structures for Ethereum’s storage layer and provides a cryptographically authenticated data structure that can be used to store all (key, value) bindings.  <p>Essentially, Ethereum accounts are of two types: externally owned accounts (EOA) and contract accounts (CA).</p><p>Let’s have a look at both types of accounts and what differentiates them. <br></p>Ethereum account types – EOA &amp; CA. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-ethereum-accounts/">Source</a>) Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) <p>A 'regular' Ethereum account with which you can initiate transactions, send, and receive ETH or any other Ethereum-based token (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc), and interact with smart contracts is an externally owned account (EOA). The average Ethereum user owns an EOA, and through wallets, the account interacts with the blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/introduction/the-programmable-account/eoas-vs.-contract-accounts">Externally owned Ethereum accounts</a> cost nothing to create, as they incur no storage requirements. They are simple accounts unassociated with data storage or code. EOAs are the only Ethereum account type with private keys, and these private keys have control over transaction signing. Also, when two EOAs interact, they can only initiate ETH or token transfers. </p><p>In summary, an externally owned Ethereum account has a public address and a private key, can initiate transactions and interact with smart contracts, requires no storage, and is represented on the EVM with an empty code string.</p> Contract Accounts (CA) <p>Contract accounts are a tad different from EOAs, as a code written on the EVM controls their activities. They are also commonly known as smart contracts. This code, once written, cannot be altered and will define the nature of transactions the contract account can complete. CAs do not initiate transactions, unlike their EOA counterparts. Instead, they can only send transactions in response to a transaction received.</p><p>For example, if you send a token to a contract account to exchange said for ETH tokens, the CA receives your transaction and, through its code, sends the corresponding amount of ETH to your address. Apart from being able to transfer tokens, contract accounts can also create new contracts. </p><p>Since CAs are controlled by their code's logic, they do not have private keys. Also, contract accounts use network storage. As such, creating them comes at a<a href="https://medium.com/the-capital/how-much-does-it-cost-to-deploy-a-smart-contract-on-ethereum-11bcd64da1"> cost</a>. The nonce of a contract account counts the number of contracts every specific CA has created.</p> What is Ethereum account abstraction? <p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/data-abstraction">Data abstraction</a> in computer science translates to hiding information to increase efficiency. For example, a software developer can learn how to write a compiler or understand the mechanisms between the compiler, processors, or memory functions when building with high-level programming languages. Data abstraction keeps the 0s and 1s underneath, allowing developers to work directly with more friendly languages, saving time and allowing for more complex operations.</p><p>In the case of Ethereum, account abstraction seeks to eliminate the existence of two types of accounts by unifying them. Thus, a single contract account will be empowered to transact with tokens and create contracts, unifying both account types. Instead of being separate account types, both EOAs and CAs will fall under a single type.</p><p>With this change, transactions will move off the<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/modular-vs-monolithic-blockchains/"> blockchain</a> and onto the EVM, eliminating the distinction between accounts. Let’s look into what exactly motivates this idea, whether it is truly achievable, and what are its benefits.</p> Motivations for account abstraction <p>Earlier, we pointed out the problems with the existing technology of Ethereum accounts and how a lack of flexibility translates to a poor user experience. With the complexities involved in the current account model, the developers are severely limited in offering a better user experience.</p><p>The core motivation for account abstraction stems from the goal of reducing from two account types to only one account type i.e., contract type. A single account type for all the Ethereum accounts will enable developers to provide a seamless experience to users on a single account with the functionality to transact tokens as well as create new contracts. It will also make it easier for developers to create better protocols and services without the need to make distinctions between account types since transacting will be moved fully into the EVM and off of the blockchain protocol.</p><p>Another motivation for account abstraction is to offer a rich user experience such as <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-multisig-wallet">multi-signature</a> security, <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html">social recovery</a>, rate-limiting, creating allow/deny-list of addresses, and <a href="https://easyfinetwork.medium.com/meta-transactions-what-are-gasless-transactions-ee71b88d7fad">gasless meta-transactions</a>. Currently, only contract accounts (<a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/what-are-smart-contract-wallets-and-how-can-they-benefit-defi-users/">smart contract wallets</a>) are capable of offering these features, however, the UX offered by these accounts is hindered by relying on fluctuating gas prices. Additionally, since contract accounts cannot pay gas, the user needs an EOA to pay gas fees or leverage a relayer (usually centralized entities).</p><p>Account abstraction can offer the best of both worlds and drastically improve the user experience by taking steps toward a model where in the long term all accounts are contracts, contracts can pay for gas, and users are free to define their own security model.</p><p>To effect these numerous changes and pave the way for more implementations, better flexibility, and an upgrade in the Ethereum user experience, developers have created several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on account abstraction, spearheaded by<a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1576199517434949634"> Vitalik Buterin</a>, co-founder of Ethereum.</p> Proposed EIPs for account abstraction <p>EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal, which are the core methods through which updates and decisions are made on the Ethereum blockchain. Here are several EIPs that were proposed to tackle the issues of account abstraction.</p> EIP-86 (Status: inactive) <p>EIP-86 can be said to be the first EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) aimed at account abstraction. After an initial proposal to prepare a security abstraction, the<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-86.md"> EIP-86</a> proposed implementing changes that would abstract out signature verification and the nonce scheme. These changes would allow users to create contract accounts that are not hard-coded to follow the traditional model but could be programmed to use any signature or nonce scheme in transaction processing.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ECDSA</a> and the default nonce scheme were the only mechanisms providing account security in the traditional model. In the proposed model, all accounts would become contracts, contracts would be able to pay gas fees, and users could tweak the account security and implement their desired signature/nonce scheme.</p> EIP-2938 (Status: inactive) <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2938">EIP-2938</a> offers a restricted version of account abstraction. The proposal sought to allow smart contracts to function as EOAs, allowing them to initiate transactions and pay for gas. In EIP-2938, developers propose introducing a new type of transaction and two new<a href="https://github.com/crytic/evm-opcodes"> opcodes</a>, aiming to keep implementation simple and allow more complex features over time.</p><p>The account abstraction transaction type would contain three fields – nonce, target, and data – where data represents all parameters that the account abstraction contract must execute and the transaction must validate. In contrast, the target represents the smart contract with the logic to validate transactions.</p><p>EIP-2938 is a simple proposal. As such, it does not support several features of account abstraction like nonce abstractions and meta transactions and does not remove EOAs.</p> EIP-3074 (Status: in review stage) <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074">EIP-3074</a> takes another path, distinct from its predecessors attempted. Instead of converting smart contracts to EOAs, EIP-3074 tries to adapt EOAs, adding a few changes here and there to make them behave like smart contracts. </p><p>The proposal seeks to allow users to hand over control of their 'regular' accounts to a contract by signing a message with their account. With the signed message and two new opcodes, an invoker (the smart target contract) could initiate transactions in the EOAs instead.</p><p>EIP-3074 focuses on enabling transaction sponsoring and multicall execution and allowing users with EOA accounts to enjoy the benefits of account abstraction without creating new accounts or transferring their assets. The proposal could achieve flexibility, albeit it does not eliminate security concerns. Notably, users under EIP-3074 still have to back up their seed phrase.</p> EIP-4337 (Status: likely to be changed before activation) <p>The most recent proposal,<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337"> EIP-4337</a>, looks to improve smart contract wallets. In a drastic departure from the usual approach, EIP-4337 simplifies the creation and operation of smart contract wallets on Ethereum by sharing the load across the required on-chain and off-chain infrastructure.<br></p>Achieving account abstraction through EIP-4337. (<a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/account_abstraction_roadmap">Source</a>)‌ ‌<p>EIP-4337 eliminates the need for sending transactions, with users required to send a set of UserOperations instead. Bundlers then pack the UserOperations into a single transaction and send it to the EntryPoint contract, executing the transaction and compensating the bundlers duly. EIP-4337 eliminates the worry of subsidizing gas fees, but it fails to end the era of EOAs on Ethereum.</p> Use Cases <p>Ethereum account abstraction, when achieved, will drive several implementations and user experience changes and allow developers the freedom to build or operate accounts on their terms.</p><p>Account abstraction will also enable developers to use smart contract logic to determine not just the effects of transactions, but also the fee payment and validation logic. Hence it could allow several crucial security benefits such as multi-sig and smart recovery wallets, the ability to change keys without changing wallets, and quantum safety.</p><p>Here are some use cases which account abstraction will help bring to reality:</p>  Wallets: With account abstraction, users will be able to benefit from advanced security features such as multi-sig, and smart recovery as well as leverage the ability to change keys without changing wallets.  Sponsored transactions: Account abstraction will allow entities or their subsidiaries to transact in several ways, like paying fees on users' behalf and allowing users to pay gas fees in ERC-20 tokens, which will be converted and relayed to the blockchain as ETH.  Meta-transactions: With account abstraction, users can accept meta-transactions (gasless) and pay for gas without trusting a relayer.   So: Is Ethereum account abstraction the next massive change for the network? <p>While Ethereum account abstraction is not yet a reality, it has become a hot discussion topic since the success of the Merge. Over the years, Ethereum's developers have pushed back account abstraction, favoring urgent blockchain upgrades. </p><p>Now, it is only reasonable that Ethereum accounts become easier to use and understand and more welcoming to onboard the less tech-savvy. Ethereum account abstraction, as of now, appears to be the most likely way to effect a massive UX change for Ethereum to lead the mass adoption charge in crypto.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

    <p>TestZEN or tZEN is a testnet version of ZEN to be used for testing various products and services on Horizen, such as deploying a testnet sidechain, launching a token or NFT on TokenMint testnet, etc. tZEN is free and has unlimited supplies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can visit the Horizen tZEN faucet ( <a href="https://faucet.horizen.io/">https://faucet.horizen.io/</a> ) to get tZEN sent to either Sphere wallet or Cobalt wallet. You will receive 42 tZEN each time and there is no limit to how many times you can claim tZEN. The tZEN faucet is currently on MVP stage. New release coming soon with improved user experience and interface.</p>
 Mainchain Faucet – Send tZEN to Sphere Wallet 
<p>This is where you enter your testnet Sphere Address in order to receive TestZEN to Sphere Testnet Wallet.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Sidechain Faucet – Send tZEN to Cobalt Wallet&nbsp; 
<p>This is where you enter your testnet Cobalt Address to receive TestZEN direct to Cobalt!</p>
<p>You will also need the sidechain ID of the sidechain network that you will use the tZEN in. The sidechain ID can be found by clicking on Cobalt, clicking the hexagonal shape in the upper right corner and it will be displayed on the bottom. We are using TokenMint testnet as an example here:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once you click on GET TZEN, you will see a “Transaction successfully created! Your funds will arrive shortly.” You can track the transaction on the sidechain block explorer and activity history in Cobalt.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You will receive a fixed amount of 42 tZEN each transaction. </p>

 PHASE 1&nbsp;Update  Game of&nbsp;Chains✨ <p>Dear Cosmonauts,<br>Phase 1 of Game of Chains is officially COMPLETE!</p><p>Read on for an update on how it&nbsp;went:</p><p>Game of Chains will be running for the rest of the month of November. In our first week of running the public incentivized testnet, we experienced some delays with launching consumer chains, however those bugs have been fixed! Validators, read on for more information on when to expect those governance proposals during Game of&nbsp;Chains!</p> HIGHLIGHTS 🎉 <p>We started Game of Chains on November 7th by launching two “dummy” consumer chains — Apollo and Sputnik. While we had over 150+ validators sign up, we currently have about 90 validators in the active set. You can check out the group of validators <a href="https://provider-explorer.goc.earthball.xyz/validators">here</a>.</p><p>We’ve also launched a public <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">leaderboard</a> that anyone can follow to see which validators are in contention for WINNING Game of Chains! This <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">leaderboard</a> is a running tally and we will try to update it on a regular basis as tasks are submitted and evidence is confirmed. You can check out how the judges will be evaluating validator participation <a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022">here</a>.</p> Bugs, bugs, bugs!&nbsp;🐜🐜🐜 <p>During the testnet a bug was discovered in Gaia (Cosmos Hub) with ICS v0.2.0. The result of the bug was that multiple consumer chains were unable to start. This bug was fixed, and validators were able to successfully upgrade the network to the version of ICS v0.2.1 on Friday November 11 (morning EST), following which validators successfully launched two consumer&nbsp;chains!</p><p>Additionally, relayer operators found that validator set updates were not being propagated. This was investigated by Hermes and Interchain Security teams (thank you to the Informal Systems team!) and a patch for Hermes is now available</p> Memes, memes, memes!&nbsp;😂 <p>We have testnet awards for the best memes generated by the community and we’ve already seen some great memes by Stakecito and Jabbey in Discord and on Twitter! Stakecito contemplates what <a href="https://twitter.com/stakecito/status/1590029735421444097">sabotage</a> might look like in Game of Chains and Chainapsis asks us to let that <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_ck89/status/1590634392141332481?s=46&amp;t=PmmoBj2Wb4A2zDs8RB5JnQ">sink&nbsp;in</a>!</p> Public Goods&nbsp;💗 <p>Thank you to all the validators that are supporting this testnet through block explorers, RPC end points and more. Some highlights of the public goods that we’ve seen so far&nbsp;include:</p>  Polkachu offering a variety of community <a href="https://polkachu.com/testnets/cosmos">tools and&nbsp;services</a>  PingPub added the ConsumerAdditionProposal to their dashboard and also offered RPC endpoints including <a href="https://provider-rpc.ztake.org/">this</a> one for the provider chain (Cosmos&nbsp;Hub)!  Thank you to Chainapsis for supporting Game of Chains through the <a href="https://testnet.keplr.app/chains/goc---provider">Keplr</a>&nbsp;wallet!   Auditing 🔐 <p>CrowdControl, Virtual Hive, and CryptoCrew have been investigating an issue where validator set updates seem to be inconsistent between provider and consumer chains. Plus, CryptoCrew published their script for auditing the validator set changes between consumer and provider sets (check it out&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/clemensgg/579983404afd4e906a4419fe4e81d100">here</a>).</p> Next Steps&nbsp;👇👇👇 <p>Over the next week, we will continue running Game of Chains, this time with consumer chains that are planning to launch in production once Interchain Security goes live! This includes the Generic Asset Issuance Chain (or GAH for short). This chain will host USDC when deployed, and hopefully other blue-chip assets in the future. We will also be running Duality, a novel DEX/AMM coming to Cosmos. You can read more about them&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dualityxyz/status/1590333430104932352">here</a>.</p><p>Following these proposals, validators will run Stride and Neutron — two additional consumer chains coming to&nbsp;Cosmos!</p><p>Last, but not least, thank you to the entire validators for your incredible support throughout Game of Chains. Interchain Security would not be what it is without the dedication of the Cosmos validator community. Cheers to you and stay tuned for updates on the next phase of Game of&nbsp;Chains!</p><p>About the Author:<br>Jelena Djuric works at <a href="https://informal.systems/about">Informal Systems</a> as product Marketing Manager. <br>Jelena is on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Gnomeskiiihttps://twitter.com/jelenaaa____">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/phase-1-update-game-of-chains-85a40bc27572">PHASE 1 Update — Game of Chains✨</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

This is obvious on the individual level – how you order goods, the way you chat with friends, and the news you consume… all from a handheld computer. It’s also becoming more obvious at the company level. The pandemic shook the world into remote work and many companies have decided that maybe work can be done in ways they never imagined.

Could the network rival the state?&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode we’ll explore what a nation state even is and how it may be challenged by a new Leviathan: the network. We also cover the difference between a nation and a state, how constants become variables, the cloud continent, digital power, your identity stack, calibrating risk, polycentric law, cloud regulations, building fast with atoms, founding vs inheriting, the powerful vs the powerless, and just about everything in between.</p><p>Timestamps:&nbsp;</p><p>0:00 - Introduction</p><p>2:41 - Nation vs state</p><p>14:38 - Constants becoming variables</p><p>16:12 - The cloud continent</p><p>20:10 - The three leviathans</p><p>30:00 - Digital power</p><p>37:20 - The identity stack</p><p>53:22 - Cloud first, land last</p><p>55:49 - Diplomatic recognition</p><p>1:01:47 - Root access to land</p><p>1:06:35 - Calibrating risk as society</p><p>1:16:13 - Regulatory harmonization</p><p>1:28:15 - Polycentric law</p><p>1:34:49 - Building fast with atoms</p><p>1:38:57 - Looking to history</p><p>1:42:00 - Founding vs inheriting</p><p>1:50:46 - The one commandment</p><p>2:17:33 - The powerful vs powerless</p><p>2:28:46 - The competition for people</p><p>2:33:45 - Historical lines</p><p>2:42:23 - v3 of governance</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Balaji’s Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">https://twitter.com/balajis</a></p><p>Balaji’s website: <a href="https://balajis.com/">https://balajis.com/</a></p><p>The Network State: <a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/">https://thenetworkstate.com/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find us on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.com/podcasts">https://a16z.com/podcasts</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund.

Off-ramping crypto usually requires users to transfer on-chain assets from their wallet into a centralized exchange (or first complete swaps on a decentralized exchange), where they can sell their crypto for fiat cash, then finally transfer funds to their bank account. The process can be costly and time consuming, as users often have to pay fees for each transaction they make with their crypto on-chain. If they have to swap their tokens multiple times, the process can become even more costly by triggering multiple taxable events.&nbsp;</p>

 In September 2022, the first ZenCon, the conference dedicated to the Horizen ecosystem, took place. It was the first opportunity to gather the whole team and the community around the same event. If you follow Horizen news, you've heard about Zencon0, the first event organized by Horizen Labs for the Horizen ecosystem. After five years, […]

    <p>In September 2022, the first <a href="https://zencon.events/">ZenCon</a>, the conference dedicated to the Horizen ecosystem, took place. It was the first opportunity to gather the whole team and the community around the same event.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/community-NA_V1700-Copie.jpg"></a><br>If you follow Horizen news, you’ve heard about Zencon0, the first event organized by Horizen Labs for the Horizen ecosystem.</p>
<p>After five years, it was time to celebrate Horizen’s accomplishments surrounded by those who were there to help lay the foundations of the project and all those who, along the way, came to bring their strength to take Horizen’s ecosystem even further.</p>
<p>At this level of expansion, it was essential to exchange thoughts. Horizen’s growth was made in the image of its decentralized blockchain. The team and community members are spread across all continents. To me, that’s what makes the project so strong. It’s a machine that never sleeps, designed with the help of a multitude of different cultures and interests. A successful scalability challenge!</p>
<p>Since its inception, the goal has evolved to reflect the community as it grows and changes.</p>
<p>That’s Horizen: In essence, it provides privacy through zk-SNARKs, and for all, it’s bringing privacy to life. This is an important issue for everyone who goes online and is careful with their digital footprint.</p>
<p>Another facet of Horizen is decentralization. The project started its Secure Nodes and Super Nodes system in 2018, which has since been in the top 3 most extensive networks, surpassing Ethereum and Bitcoin combined: It is unbounded by design.</p>
<p>Since then, Horizen has become the zero-knowledge-enabled network of blockchains, thanks to its impressive team of cryptographers.</p>
<p>That’s Horizen: A project that has brought together enough passion and talent to evolve continually.</p>
<p>This story was told at Zencon0, through panels, presentations, brainstorming sessions, and aperitivos. It was an absolute pleasure and hype machine to work together, or simply to gather with blockchain and technology experts and enthusiasts at the center of all discussions for three days in a row.</p>
<p>Among the guests, I would like to highlight four Zenvangelists who were present. Michael, Guan, Jonghung, Jongchan, and Psyrax are more than Zenvangelists; they are OGs. Without them, the Horizen community would be very different. It was truly fantastic to meet all of them.</p>
 Interviewing Horizen’s Zenvangelists 
 Michael 
<p>We’ll start with the one from Australia, Telegram, Korea, and/or Discord, our dear Michael. If you’ve interacted with the Horizen community, you’ve probably come across him. He is now a Zenvangelist that cannot be ignored!</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG20220913215558-Copie.jpg"></a>Our dear Michael, who had the chance to pose with Rob Viglione
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an amazing experience meeting the teams behind Horizen and Horizen Labs. Being able to see firsthand how the companies and teams operate from such a professional standpoint really gave me a lot of confidence in the future success of Horizen. I have walked away inspired and with a lot of ideas to build something great on Horizen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting everyone in real life! I felt like I knew so many people, even though we had only previously connected online. Being able to meet in person was really special.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will definitely be there!</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V1798-Copie.jpg"></a>Our marketing team and community brainstorming about the Horizen community
 Guan 
<p>Without Guan, the Horizen community in China would not be the same. It feels like Guan was there when Horizen was founded. So much so that he has become essential. It was great to meet him finally to talk about Horizen, and his cats face to face.</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the zencon0 is good because everyone in Horizen’s ecosystem can meet each other in person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite part was I visited the Horizen Labs’ workplace. I witnessed the huge team expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s an amazing event, and I will be there next year!</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V2550.jpg"></a>The Horizen Labs office is superb! We enjoyed the rooftop and took this amazing picture.
 Psyrax 
<p>Psyrax also joined us. If you have needed support from Horizen, I am sure Psyrax assisted you. He is our node, mining – well – global Horizen expert. Psyrax also protects our Discord and Telegram communities by protecting them from scammers and bots!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed Zencon0. It was a really amazing experience to hear about what has been going on behind the scenes and listening to a great cross-section of society that can use the ecosystem. I really liked Sebastien Micke’s perspective and use case for NFTs and photographers retaining their digital rights to their productions.</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can’t say that I had a favorite moment, as the whole experience was great, but if I had to choose, I would say that networking across the conference with the new people that I met and being able to put faces to names I have only known through the computer.</p>
<p>Q: If we do Zencon next year, will you be there?</p>
<p>I will definitely be keen to attend next year. If the team announced dates and locations, I would book our flights in a heartbeat.</p>

 Jonghun 
<p>Last but not least is Jonghun, our Korean OG. He was a long-time community member and has done a fantastic job promoting Horizen in his country. Thanks to him, our Korean community is bustling and passionate about the project!</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was such an honor for me to be able to attend this gathering of people interested in Horizen from all over the world. Also, I was excited to be able to announce the start of Horizen Korea in Korea for the first time at Zencon0. It was very beneficial because it was a place where people from various fields could share their thoughts on blockchain and Horizen. It was an opportunity for me to broaden my insight personally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked all the moments when I could see everyone in one space regardless of time zone. We communicated, but there were some delay issues due to the time zone, but the moment we communicated with everyone in one place was memorable. The discussion about Horizen Community is also very memorable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
 Community Spotlights at ZenCon 
<p>The community was in the spotlight throughout the conference, with three slots dedicated to the community. We even had the honor of sharing a panel with Lou Kerner to talk about the Horizen community’s presence in Asia, thanks largely to Guan and Jonghun, whom we introduced earlier.</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V1618.jpg"></a>Lou Kerner, Lucy Wang, Guan Yin, and Jonghun and Jongchan Hong talking during the panel.
<p>Even our Marketing team OGs went on stage. Thank you, Lucy and Erica, for shining a light on this beautiful Horizen community.</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V1480.jpg"></a>As you see, we were delighted to share the news!
<p>To conclude, I would say that the Horizen community is terrific. Everything started in 2017 as a cryptocurrency. Five years later, Horizen is an entire blockchain ecosystem, soon to have an EVM-compatible sidechain. Meanwhile, these steps would have been for nothing if we hadn’t done them with the community. Together, we are building the future of blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
