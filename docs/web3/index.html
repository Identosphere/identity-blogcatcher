Is this just summertime slowness or is the bull market over?  ------ ✨ Mint the episode on Zora ✨ <a href="https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x0c294913a7596b427add7dcbd6d7bbfc7338d53f/21"> https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x0c294913a7596b427add7dcbd6d7bbfc7338d53f/21</a>   ------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:  🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE <a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; ⁠  🌐 TRANSPORTER | CROSS CHAINS WITH CONFIDENCE <a href="https://transporter.io/">https://transporter.io/</a>  🔗CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>  🛞MANTLE | MODULAR LAYER 2 NETWORK <a href="https://bankless.cc/Mantle">https://bankless.cc/Mantle</a>  ⚡️ CARTESI | LINUX-POWERED ROLLUPS <a href="https://bankless.cc/CartesiGovernance">https://bankless.cc/CartesiGovernance</a>&nbsp;  &nbsp; ⚖️ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS &amp; RESOURCES  0:00 Intro  1:15 Current Market Sentiment <a href="https://x.com/splitcapital/status/1805346083981201775">https://x.com/splitcapital/status/1805346083981201775</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1805341535967527200">https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1805341535967527200</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/SplitCapital/status/1805349168229367936">https://x.com/SplitCapital/status/1805349168229367936</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/cryptobran_/status/1805331025905729983">https://x.com/cryptobran_/status/1805331025905729983</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/mrjasonchoi/status/1804107651854594071">https://x.com/mrjasonchoi/status/1804107651854594071</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/tmnxeq/status/1804913082571071679">https://x.com/tmnxeq/status/1804913082571071679</a>   12:49 ETH ETF is Bearish <a href="https://x.com/Rewkang/status/1804735595111211104">https://x.com/Rewkang/status/1804735595111211104</a>   16:26 Gox will Dump on You&nbsp; <a href="https://x.com/WatcherGuru/status/1805168222645244311">https://x.com/WatcherGuru/status/1805168222645244311</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/RyanSAdams/status/1804138577204289900">https://x.com/RyanSAdams/status/1804138577204289900</a>   19:20 No New Crypto Use Cases <a href="https://x.com/0xCygaar/status/1801667353207521364">https://x.com/0xCygaar/status/1801667353207521364</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/divine_economy/status/1802510497633198565">https://x.com/divine_economy/status/1802510497633198565</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/milesdeutscher/status/1800190273517211699">https://x.com/milesdeutscher/status/1800190273517211699</a>   26:09 Any Bulls Left?&nbsp; <a href="https://x.com/econoar/status/1805447135141544280">https://x.com/econoar/status/1805447135141544280</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/milesdeutscher/status/1805249025643581761">https://x.com/milesdeutscher/status/1805249025643581761</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/fejau_inc/status/1805242741494005780">https://x.com/fejau_inc/status/1805242741494005780</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://x.com/intangiblecoins/status/1805244957252284916">https://x.com/intangiblecoins/status/1805244957252284916</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/intangiblecoins/status/1805244973261914582">https://x.com/intangiblecoins/status/1805244973261914582</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/pythianism/status/1805608579422208061">https://x.com/pythianism/status/1805608579422208061</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/pythianism/status/1804987849059787113">https://x.com/pythianism/status/1804987849059787113</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1804998114090389795">https://x.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1804998114090389795</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://x.com/cburniske/status/1805308535611502763">https://x.com/cburniske/status/1805308535611502763</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://imgur.com/DXcyjMS">https://imgur.com/DXcyjMS</a>  43:27 &nbsp;Closing &amp; Disclosures  ------ Not financial or tax advice.

  The Compound Lever: AI for Software Engineering  <p>For decades, software has provided the lever to move the world—now AI that can create software is levering that lever.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/pat-grady/">Pat Grady</a>	 



Published June 25, 2024
  



 
<p>In the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-act-two/">Generative AI application landscape</a>, a single market category stands out as the Schelling point where many of this generation’s best entrepreneurs have gathered and focused their talents: building the AI software engineer.</p>



<p>There is no shortage of elite teams in this race, and they are approaching the problem from a myriad of angles, from ambitious teams building their own custom cognitive architectures and Droids (e.g. Factory) to researchers building their own foundation models for code (e.g. Magic) to incumbents who have found a formidable second wind (e.g. GitHub Copilot).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But is this white-hot market worth the hype? Are autonomous software engineers really that magical, or are engineers just doing what they like to do, building tools for other engineers?</p>



<p>We spoke with Matan Grinberg and Eno Reyes of Factory in our latest <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/38Z6aRkFADPtvLAz4INord?si=8b2f99b5835348a6&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=b34b6d506c8f4fa7">Training Data</a> episode to better understand what’s at stake. If everything goes right, could autonomous software engineers be the killer app for generative AI? Could it usher in a new golden age of technology?</p>



 The dream: compounding Archimedes’ lever 



<p>Archimedes famously said, “Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.”</p>



<p>For the last several decades, software engineering has been the perfect lever with which to move the world. Thanks to computer programming, we have enjoyed an ever-increasing standard of living: the world’s information searchable at our fingertips; fast and reliable banking anywhere; fashion and commerce from all over the world at our doorstep; medical software that has elevated the standard of living globally.</p>



<p>Matan and Eno challenged us to take this analogy one step further. Software engineering may be the perfect lever with which to move the world, but it is still bottlenecked by supply of talent (there are only 30 million software developers globally, with no quick fix – it takes years to train a non-software engineer to become a coder) and by hours in the day (it takes time to code things up). In other words, we cannot yet create software at the speed of our imagination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI that can create software would be the perfect lever on software itself, which in turn is the perfect lever upon the world. In Matan’s words, AI has a chance to become the greatest compound lever in human history—if we can create autonomous software engineers.</p>



 Tracking our progress 



<p>In order for AI software engineers to become the ideal compound lever, they first need to actually work. We’re still a ways off—but things are progressing at a very fast pace.</p>



<p>Take, for example, <a href="https://www.swebench.com/">SWE-bench</a>, the canonical benchmark for tasks that the average human software engineer performs. We’ve gone from 1% to 4% to 14% to 19% on this key benchmark in the past 11 weeks.</p>







<p>And SWE-bench is a very general set of problems, drawn from actual GitHub issues in popular open source projects. As Harrison Chase and Eno pointed out in our conversations, when you constrain the software engineering problem to a more specific problem space (e.g., software testing or code review) the success rates are far greater.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, in some problem spaces the success rates already meet the “good enough” threshold for software engineers.&nbsp; One example is <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0 by Vercel</a>, which allows anybody to create working frontends using natural language, ranging from calculators to SaaS pricing pages. Other examples include AI coding for use cases from database migrations and codebase refactoring to writing API integrations and ETL pipelines.</p>



 Implications 



<p>With the emergence of AI as a new compound lever, the fulcrum of impact is shifting from “learning code” to “instructing a machine in natural language.”</p>



<p>This means the most critical bottleneck will no longer be the supply of software engineering talent, but the supply of ideas. If AI software engineering fulfills its promise and becomes the ultimate compound lever, then creators with imagination, not developers, may become the scarcest and most valuable resource. We are headed towards a future that is a meritocracy of ideas.&nbsp;</p>



 Recursion: The machine that builds the machine 



<p>Let’s assume that AI is on track to build software autonomously—can we push the analogy even further? Can AI build the AI and be a compound lever upon itself?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some encouraging clues that this may just be the case:</p>



 
 In the race to the ARC AGI Prize (next week’s episode), the solution in the lead involves generating <a href="https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt">thousands of python programs</a>. 



 Similarly, DeepMind famously cracked one of the hardest unsolved math problems through <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/14/1085318/google-deepmind-large-language-model-solve-unsolvable-math-problem-cap-set/">code generation and program synthesis</a>. 
 



<p>If AI becomes a compound lever upon AI—that’s when things will really get wild. (Cue infinite recursions.)</p>



 The path ahead 



<p>The industry is quickly building Archimedes’ compound lever. We have rapidly scaled from 1% to 19% on SWE-bench, a benchmark that under-states AIs’ actual performance on properly scoped coding tasks. And there are a plethora of highly capable teams attacking this problem from multiple angles.</p>



<p>That said, open questions remain.</p>



<p>How much further can the field run on the current generation of foundation models before needing order(s)-of-magnitude more powerful models, or new techniques (like inference-time compute)?</p>



<p>Moreover, do you need to train your own foundation model to build a human-quality AI software engineer? What about a Jeff Dean-quality software engineer?</p>

<p>Today, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/f219e72a-2f12-11ef-a4d3-360fad1b0509/view">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), which will run until June 30th. The purpose of this poll is twofold:&nbsp;</p>



 
 to fill two seats on the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee, and&nbsp; 



 to solicit further input from ZCAP regarding the design of a potential future Dev Fund, with a view to drafting a formal proposal based on that feedback. 
 



<p></p>



<p>ZCAP members should check their mailbox for instructions on how to vote. In the past, Helios emails have sometimes been flagged as spam, so if you can’t find the instructions please check your spam folder.&nbsp;</p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>Members of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), and serve a one year term. Two of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of June. Last month, we invited candidates to express their interest in serving on the committee.</p>



<p>Seven candidates are standing for two seats on the committee. Here is the list of candidates, with links to their candidacy announcements on the Zcash community forum:&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Last Monday, the candidates took part in a Community Call, during which they introduced themselves and answered questions from the Zcash community. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/3z3E2lhBUH0?si=6VKdBolWIr9gVw4u">a recording of the call on Youtube</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The poll will be decided by approval voting for two members out of the seven candidates. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st July 2024. As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The two candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 30th June 2025.</p>



<p>Good luck to all the candidates, and thank you for volunteering to serve on the ZCG committee!</p>



 Polling ZCAP on the Design of a Proposal for a new Dev Fund 



<p>The results of the <a href="https://zfnd.org/results-of-the-first-exploratory-dev-fund-poll-june2024/">first exploratory ZCAP poll</a> indicated support for a new Dev Fund, and majority approval of the Bootstrap Project (parent of the Electric Coin Company), the Zcash Community Grants program (ZCG), and the Zcash Foundation as potential recipients of a future Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the question of how long a new Dev Fund should last, the results were ambiguous, with substantial minority support for both a 1 year and 2 year duration. This aligns with the result of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XOhprdj0iVDPqlUOM8D3IfYMF6UMz67J6849pQbTL0s/edit#gid=0">alternative polls</a> conducted by community members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of this Helios poll, we are asking the following questions:&nbsp;</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q2: If the Dev Fund is renewed, it: </p>



 
 Should remain 20% of the block reward 



 Should be less than 20% of the block reward 



 Should be more than 20% of the block reward 
 



<p></p>



<p>Q3: If the Dev Fund is renewed, how long should it last for before having to be renewed again?</p>



 
 1 year 



 2 years 
 



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>We are also conducting a separate survey to solicit input regarding how the Dev Fund should be allocated between the recipients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Helios is our preferred polling platform, it does not support arbitrary input by poll respondents. In this case, we want to allow ZCAP members to enter percentages to indicate how they believe the Dev Fund should be allocated.&nbsp; Therefore, we will be using the Jotform platform for this survey.</p>



<p>The Jotform survey will ask the question: What percentage of a new Dev Fund should be allocated to each recipient?</p>



<p>Respondents will be able to enter percentage values to reflect how they believe the Dev Fund should be allocated between the Bootstrap Project (parent of the Electric Coin Company), the Zcash Community Grants program (ZCG), and the Zcash Foundation (ZF).&nbsp;</p>



<p>ZCAP members will receive emails directly from Jotform inviting them to register their responses. Those responses will be averaged, and rounded to the nearest whole percentage point to produce an allocation that will form part of the ZIP proposal that the Zcash Foundation will draft and present for the community’s consideration, alongside other proposals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note that ECC has <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/eccs-position-on-the-zcash-dev-fund/">stated</a> that they are open to either (a) allowing the Dev Fund to expire in November, while the community works on a model where development funds flow into a grants pool(s) that are managed in a decentralized way, or (b) <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/draft-zip-to-modify-zip-1014-extending-the-dev-fund-by-one-year/47732">extending the existing development fund for no longer than one year</a>.</p>



<p>In the event that ECC declines to accept funding under a proposal that is drafted based on the results of this survey, ZF may adapt the proposal accordingly, taking into account other feedback from our exploratory polling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the community indicates a preference for a two year Dev Fund but ECC will only accept funding for one year, the remaining funds will be assigned to ZCG.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As previously stated above, the objective of this exploratory Dev Fund polling process is to obtain sufficient insight into the Zcash community’s collective sentiment to draft a Dev Fund proposal that reflects that sentiment, and can be assessed alongside other proposals from ECC and other community members. We expect that there will be a final run-off poll to determine whether any proposal has consensus support across the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both the Helios poll and Jotform survey will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st July 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, we welcome the community’s feedback. If you have comments or suggestions, please join the conversation on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/moving-the-dev-fund-discussion-forward/47464">Zcash community forum</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  AI’s $600B Question  <p>The AI bubble is reaching a tipping point. Navigating what comes next will be essential.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 



Published June 20, 2024
  



 
<p>In September 2023, I published <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/">AI’s $200B Question</a>. The goal of the piece was to ask the question: “Where is all the revenue?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that time, I noticed a big gap between the revenue expectations implied by the AI infrastructure build-out, and actual revenue growth in the AI ecosystem, which is also a proxy for end-user value. I described this as a “$125B hole that needs to be filled for each year of CapEx at today’s levels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This week, Nvidia completed its ascent to become the most valuable company in the world. In the weeks leading up to this, I’ve received numerous requests for the updated math behind my analysis. Has AI’s $200B question been solved, or exacerbated?</p>



<p>If you run this analysis again today, here are the results you get: AI’s $200B question is now AI’s $600B question.</p>
 







 
<p>Note: It’s easy to calculate this metric directly. All you have to do is to take Nvidia’s run-rate revenue forecast and multiply it by 2x to reflect the total cost of AI data centers (GPUs are half of the total cost of ownership—the other half includes energy, buildings, backup generators, etc)1. Then you multiply by 2x again, to reflect a 50% gross margin for the end-user of the GPU, (e.g., the startup or business buying AI compute from Azure or AWS or GCP, who needs to make money as well).</p>



<p>What has changed since September 2023?&nbsp;</p>



 
 The supply shortage has subsided: Late 2023 was the peak of the GPU supply shortage. Startups were calling VCs, calling anyone that would talk to them, asking for help getting access to GPUs. Today, that concern has been almost entirely eliminated. For most people I speak with, it’s relatively easy to get GPUs now with reasonable lead times. 



 GPU stockpiles are growing: Nvidia reported in Q4 that about half of its data center revenue came from the large cloud providers. Microsoft alone likely represented approximately <a href="https://platformonomics.com/2024/02/follow-the-capex-triangulating-nvidia/comment-page-1/">22% of Nvidia’s Q4 revenue</a>. Hyperscale CapEx is reaching historic levels. These investments were a major theme of Big Tech Q1 ‘24 earnings, with CEOs effectively telling the market: “We’re going to invest in GPUs whether you like it or not.” Stockpiling hardware is not a new phenomenon, and the catalyst for a reset will be once the stockpiles are large enough that demand decreases. 



 OpenAI still has the lion’s share of AI revenue: The Information recently reported that OpenAI’s revenue is now <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-annualized-revenue-doubles-to-3-4-billion-since-late-2023?rc=0uxjjk">$3.4B</a>, up from $1.6B in late 2023. While we’ve seen a handful of startups scale revenues into the &lt;$100M range, the gap between OpenAI and everyone else continues to loom large. Outside of ChatGPT, how many AI products are consumers really using today? Consider how much value you get from Netflix for $15.49/month or Spotify for $11.99. Long term, AI companies will need to deliver significant value for consumers to continue opening their wallets.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 The $125B hole is now a $500B hole: In the last analysis, I generously assumed that each of Google, Microsoft, Apple and Meta will be able to generate $10B annually from new AI-related revenue. I also assumed $5B in new AI revenue for each of Oracle, ByteDance, Alibaba, Tencent, X, and Tesla. Even if this remains true and we add a few more companies to the list, the $125B hole is now going to become a $500B hole.&nbsp; 



 It’s not over—the B100 is coming: Earlier this year, Nvidia announced their B100 chip, which will have <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/03/18/with-blackwell-gpus-ai-gets-cheaper-and-easier-competing-with-nvidia-gets-harder/">2.5x better performance</a> for only 25% more cost. I expect this will lead to a final surge in demand for NVDA chips. The B100 represents a dramatic cost vs. performance improvement over the H100, and there will likely be yet another supply shortage as everyone tries to get their hands on B100s later this year. 
 



<p>One of the major rebuttals to my last piece was that “GPU CapEx is like building railroads” and eventually the trains will come, as will the destinations—the new agriculture exports, amusement parks, malls, etc. I actually agree with this, but I think it misses a few points:</p>



 
 Lack of pricing power: In the case of physical infrastructure build outs, there is some intrinsic value associated with the infrastructure you are building. If you own the tracks between San Francisco and Los Angeles, you likely have some kind of monopolistic pricing power, because there can only be so many tracks laid between place A and place B. In the case of GPU data centers, there is much less pricing power. GPU computing is increasingly turning into a commodity, metered per hour. Unlike the CPU cloud, which became an oligopoly, new entrants building dedicated AI clouds continue to flood the market. Without a monopoly or oligopoly, high fixed cost + low marginal cost businesses almost always see prices competed down to marginal cost (e.g., airlines). 



 Investment incineration: Even in the case of railroads—and in the case of many new technologies—speculative investment frenzies often lead to high rates of capital incineration. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Engines-That-Markets-Alisdair-Nairn/dp/0857195999">The Engines that Moves Markets</a> is one of the best textbooks on technology investing, and the major takeaway—indeed, focused on railroads—is that a lot of people lose a lot of money during speculative technology waves. It’s hard to pick winners, but much easier to pick losers (canals, in the case of railroads). 



 Depreciation: We know from the history of technology that semiconductors tend to get better and better. Nvidia is going to keep producing better next-generation chips like the B100. This will lead to more rapid depreciation of the last-gen chips. Because the market under-appreciates the B100 and the rate at which next-gen chips will improve, it overestimates the extent to which H100s purchased today will hold their value in 3-4 years. Again, this parallel doesn’t exist for physical infrastructure, which does not follow any “Moore’s Law” type curve, such that cost vs. performance continuously improves.&nbsp; 



 Winners vs. losers: I think we need to look carefully at winners and losers—there are always winners during periods of excess infrastructure building. AI is likely to be the next transformative technology wave, and as I mentioned in the last piece, declining prices for GPU computing is actually good for long-term innovation and good for startups. If my forecast comes to bear, it will cause harm primarily to investors. Founders and company builders will continue to build in AI—and they will be more likely to succeed, because they will benefit both from lower costs and from learnings accrued during this period of experimentation.&nbsp; 
 



<p>A huge amount of economic value is going to be created by AI. Company builders focused on delivering value to end users will be rewarded handsomely. We are living through what has the potential to be a generation-defining technology wave. Companies like Nvidia deserve enormous credit for the role they’ve played in enabling this transition, and are likely to play a critical role in the ecosystem for a long time to come.</p>



<p>Speculative frenzies are part of technology, and so they are not something to be afraid of. Those who remain level-headed through this moment have the chance to build extremely important companies. But we need to make sure not to believe in the delusion that has now spread from Silicon Valley to the rest of the country, and indeed the world. That delusion says that we’re all going to get rich quick, because AGI is coming tomorrow, and we all need to stockpile the only valuable resource, which is GPUs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality, the road ahead is going to be a long one. It will have ups and downs. But almost certainly it will be worthwhile.</p>

 Some commenters challenged my 50% assumption on non-GPU data center costs, which I summarized as energy costs. Nvidia actually came to the exact same metric, which you can see on <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_presentations/2023/Oct/01/ndr_presentation_oct_2023_final.pdf">Page 14 of their October 2023</a> analyst day presentation, published a few days after my last piece.

  Partnering with Day.ai: Customer Obsession, Productized  <p>A decade after Christopher and Michael built HubSpot’s original sales suite, AI is opening up new pathways for forging customer relationships—and Day.ai is leading the way.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/dannie-herzberg/">Dannie Herzberg</a>	 



Published June 20, 2024
  



Day.ai co-founders Christopher O’Donnell and Michael Pici at Sequoia’s office in New York.



 
<p>The story of Hubspot, where I first met Christopher O’Donnell and Michael Pici, is a tale with two distinct chapters. In chapter one, the company built a world-class marketing and sales machine. But that was just the beginning. Chapter two focused on creating a sales product that served as its own flywheel for growth—and impressively, it arguably eclipsed chapter one, in large part thanks to Christopher and Michael.</p>



<p>When I joined the team in 2010, Hubspot was in its earliest innings with a lean startup team striving to build a comprehensive marketing suite. A few years later, our leadership made the bold decision to expand into a sales product suite, and Christopher and Michael led the execution. They were a dynamic duo; Michael took a highly customer-centric approach and interviewed every early user he could find, while on the product side Christopher used that feedback to build a simple, intuitive interface that people loved. Together they incubated, launched and scaled what are now called CRM and Sales Hub.</p>



<p>For the rest of their tenure at Hubspot, they continued working closely. Christopher built a reputation for his ability to not only execute but also recruit, and ultimately rose to CPO, while Michael was beloved for his range across both sales and product and became VP of Product, Revenue. Eventually, each of them left to explore new opportunities; Christopher hired 100 PMs, designers and engineers in just a year as CPO of Thrive, while Michael became a growth advisor to B2B SaaS companies, including several in Sequoia’s portfolio.</p>



<p>But after less than two years apart, they came back together—this time, to build <a href="http://day.ai">Day.ai</a>.</p>



<p>Christopher and Michael understood that at the heart of any sales process is a nuanced relationship between a company offering its product and a buyer eager to solve a pain point—and they knew that even in the best CRM platform, subtleties get lost. Maybe you schedule a Zoom call, then you take notes manually—and then you pull out your takeaways to share with your team. Each step is time-consuming, and it’s also subjective: you probably aren’t sharing the way someone’s voice changed at a key moment in your call, or the exact questions they asked, or the fact that you’re now talking on text as well as email and have shared photos of your kids. In short, you’re capturing imperfect information—which makes your forecasts imperfect, too.</p>



<p>But Christopher and Michael also recognized something else: that AI has ushered in a categorical shift in how software can serve humanity. What would happen if they combined that fact with everything they’d already learned about the customer journey, and how to bake it into a product?</p>



<p>It was an exciting question—so exciting that I boarded a redeye last May to visit Christopher at his home and discuss it. I remember touring his music studio and collection of guitars, and then his kids’ Lego collection, and thinking how well the combination summed up Christopher—an artist and a builder in one. At the time, Day.ai was barely a week old; they had a brand-new idea and no code. But we knew Christopher and Michael were a team we could believe in, and we were delighted that they gave us the opportunity to lead their seed round.</p>



<p>Since then, they have been hard at work, designing Day.ai from first principles of what relationship-building really means. Through our partnership and in <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, Sequoia’s immersion for pre-seed and seed-stage founders, we’ve had a front-row seat to Christoper and Michael’s time-tested process, as they conducted hundreds of interviews, collected data in—where else?—Day.ai, and used it to test their hypotheses. And just as they did a decade ago, they are constantly trading notes, iterating and looking for ways to improve. Already, <a href="https://day.ai/">early access</a> users are praising Day.ai’s seamless integration with existing productivity tools, and seeing real benefits from bringing customer voices into more of their daily decisions.</p>



<p>Here’s one user perspective: As an investor, I want to give my full focus to the founders I meet. I need to understand what they’re building so I can share it with my partners, but I also want to foster a relationship with them, and make sure they feel known and remembered the next time we talk. Sometimes those two goals are at odds. When I use Day.ai, though, I know it will save all the key points from a meeting automatically. I can give a founder all my attention and never miss a beat.</p>



<p>Even more exciting, this is just the beginning. While Christopher, Michael and their team have started by automating notes and action items from meetings and emails, they have a broader vision that includes pairing those captured conversations with other data to organize all business relationship data and suggest steps forward. To be sure, it will be no small feat to fundamentally change how relationships are managed at scale—but with this dynamic duo leading the way, there’s no telling what Day.ai can do.</p>

  “Goldilocks” Agents and the Power of Custom Cognitive Architectures
  <p>The quickening evolution of more capable and reliable AI agents.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/pat-grady/">Pat Grady</a>	 



Published June 18, 2024
  



 
<p>After ChatGPT, the next big turning point for AI was the arrival of agents that could use LLMs to interact with the world autonomously. Projects like AutoGPT skyrocketed in popularity, but then died down just as quickly as reality didn’t live up to the hype.</p>



<p>But this year something interesting started to happen—more realistic agents have come online and are gaining product traction, whether in customer support or coding. New ways to build and deploy agents are improving their performance and reliability.</p>



<p>This is important because agents are still key to the promise of AI: LLMs are great, but having the AI actually be able to plan and act on your behalf…that’s where things get really interesting. The more AI can be a worker rather than a tool, the more leverage it can provide us.</p>



<p>To explore this theme, we talked to Harrison Chase, founder and CEO of LangChain, on our <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/786INOhYIkgCKS9LMfcv8B?si=duAmCERET_6S6i1wb9V1og&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=f9a0ee896fc940fd">Training Data podcast</a>. Harrison started creating the infrastructure for LLM-powered agents before ChatGPT was even launched, and LangChain has become the default framework for developing agentic applications. He’s well positioned to help us learn about the evolution underway with agents.</p>



 The spectrum of agents 



<p>Let’s define an agent as any application that lets an LLM control the flow of the application.</p>



<p>With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, it is clear that AutoGPT was too general and unconstrained to match our expectations. While it was exciting for capturing imagination, as a proof-of-concept for how LLMs might evolve to become general agents, it was too unconstrained to do useful things reliably.</p>



<p>The secret sauce behind the newest cohort of agents is that they use custom cognitive architectures to provide guardrails and a framework for controlling state to keep agents focused and not flying off the rails, while also embracing the full power and capabilities of LLMs.</p>



<p>One helpful way to frame the types of agents we see in the wild is a spectrum between simple, hard-coded agents and full-blown autonomous agents. This framing illuminates the “happy middle” where we are most likely to see useful agents emerge in the near to medium term.</p>



<p>On the simplest end of the spectrum, LLMs act as “routers” to decide which path to go down, with perhaps a classification step. In this case LLM calls govern the flow of the application, but most of the logic is still hard coded. At the other extreme, you have fully autonomous agents, like AutoGPT. Agents based on simple chains are not flexible or powerful enough to really take advantage of the LLM paradigm, while fully autonomous agents fail too often to be useful.</p>







<p>Developers are finding their Goldilocks “just right” balance in the middle of the agent spectrum, where they hand over a lot of the control flow to LLMs, but still maintain a set of rails and a sense of “state.”</p>



<p>The Goldilocks middle provides the best balance of power, flexibility and control, but it is also the hardest type of agent for developers to build—it requires a custom cognitive architecture that is structured but also non-deterministic. A fully autonomous agent can be implemented with very little code; at the extreme, you just have the agent in a for-loop picking an action every move. Simple agents are also easy to code, since there is very little stochastic variability to control for. Developing in the middle requires you to hand substantial control (and thus, stochastic variability) over to LLMs, while also controlling a high-level application flow and state management.</p>



<p>Harrison shared a brilliant quote from Jeff Bezos on our podcast, “Focus on what makes your beer taste better,” making an analogy between how breweries at the turn of the 20th century made their own electricity and tech companies ran their own infrastructure before AWS. In a world where agents fall over more often than not, where 12-13% on SWE-bench is considered state-of-the-art, implementing a custom cognitive architecture absolutely makes your beer taste better.&nbsp;</p>



 Keeping ahead of the models 



<p>But for how long? Harrison also raised this issue in his talk at our AI Ascent conference where he asked whether improvements in the underlying LLMs will subsume more and more of the reasoning and planning developers are building in the “happy middle.” In other words, are custom cognitive architectures a stop-gap solution?</p>



<p>This is a fair question: many of the earliest prompt-engineering-based agent architectures (like chain of thought) became baked into future iterations of LLMs by default, obviating the need to build them around the LLM. We believe that many of the large research labs have their researchers focused squarely on the reasoning, planning and search problems.<br></p>



<p>Harrison’s take is that more and more general-purpose reasoning will become baked into the LLMs by default, but there is still a need for application or domain-specific reasoning. The way you plan and prosecute actions to reach your goals as a software engineer is vastly different from how you would work as a scientist, and moreover it’s different as a scientist at different companies. There is so much room for domain and application-specific reasoning that simply cannot efficiently be encoded in a general model.</p>







 Software 2.0 



<p>Developing applications with LLMs is a different paradigm from software 1.0 development and requires new approaches to observability and evaluation. Harrison’s bet is that many of the traditional software development tools are insufficient to deal with the non-deterministic nature of LLM applications. With agents and new ways of controlling application logic, monitoring the behavior of the application with observability and testing become paramount. If you are building a custom cognitive architecture, here are some things to think about:</p>



 
 On application development: You probably need to design in a “state” graph which then needs to be managed and deployed with a persistence layer, background asynchronous orchestration, cyclical handling of state, etc. Harrison is seeing this pattern come up frequently in agent deployments, and LangGraph is intended to help developers build for this new paradigm. 



 On observability and testing: Existing monitoring tools don’t provide the level of insights you need to trace what went wrong with an LLM call. And testing is different in a stochastic world, too—you’re not running a simple “test that 2=2” unit test that a computer can easily verify. Testing becomes a more nuanced concept with techniques like pairwise comparisons (e.g. Langsmith, Lmsys) and tracking improvements/regressions. All of this calls for a new set of developer tools. 
 



<p>What’s exciting about the rise of “Goldilocks” agents is the tremendous potential to create software that works on our behalf and that is within our control. Realizing this potential is not only dependent on the models getting better (they surely will) but also on this whole new ecosystem of tools to manage this radically new kind of application development.</p>



<p>This theme of crafting more reliable agents with custom cognitive architectures factors into our next episode, with Matan Grinberg and Eno Reyes of Factory, and in an upcoming episode with Clay Bevor of Sierra.</p>

<p>Proprietary investment strategies have always been among the most closely guarded secrets in finance. Traditionally, these strategies were protected by the nature of how trades are transacted, giving brokers and financial institutions the ability to leverage their proprietary strategies to their advantage. The rise of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new level of transparency. This openness, while fostering trust, poses significant risks as it exposes sensitive trading patterns and strategies to public scrutiny.</p> Exposure of investment strategies <p>In traditional finance, investment strategies are often the real value of what is being provided to the client or fund. Hedge funds, asset managers, and brokers invest significant resources into developing proprietary trading strategies that provide them a competitive edge. However, in the realm of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), the inherent transparency of public ledgers poses a significant threat to these proprietary strategies.</p><p>Every transaction on public blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin is recorded in a publicly accessible ledger. While this transparency promotes trust and verification, it also means that anyone can analyze transaction data to uncover trading patterns and strategies. This exposure can be detrimental to asset managers,&nbsp; brokers and financial institutions that rely on the confidentiality of their trading methods.</p><p>Blockchain analytics tools such as Nansen have made it increasingly easy to scrutinize and interpret blockchain data. Nansen, for instance, labels and analyzes millions of wallet addresses, providing insights into the activities of various market participants. These tools can track large transactions, identify trends, and even link transactions to specific entities. For asset managers, this means that their trades can be monitored, virtually in real-time. It’s possible that their strategies could be reverse-engineered by competitors or malicious actors.</p><p>When proprietary trading strategies are exposed, the risk of financial loss increases substantially. Competitors can replicate successful strategies, diluting competitive advantage. Worse still, malicious actors can engage in counteracting strategies such as front-running, where they anticipate trades and execute their own trades in advance to profit from the price movements triggered by the asset manager’s transactions.</p><p>For example, if an asset manager plans to purchase a large amount of a specific cryptocurrency, front-runners can detect the initial buying activity and buy the cryptocurrency themselves, driving up the price. By the time the purchase is complete, the price has increased, causing the asset manager to pay more than intended. Once the asset manager’s purchase is complete, the front-runners can sell their holdings at a profit, leaving the asset manager at a disadvantage.</p><p>In addition to financial losses, the exposure of investment strategies undermines the trust and credibility of asset managers and other financial professionals. Clients expect their asset managers, brokers and other advisors to maintain the confidentiality of their strategies and transactions. If asset managers cannot guarantee this privacy, they risk losing clients to non-crypto or private alternative investments.&nbsp;</p> Front-running <p>One of the most significant issues that comes with transparent blockchain ledgers is front-running. Front-running occurs when malicious actors observe patterns that suggest an impending transaction is coming and execute their trades ahead of it to capitalize on the expected price movement. For example, if an asset manager intends to buy a large amount of a particular token, front-runners might detect the client’s typical pre-cursory activity and purchase the cryptocurrency first. This buying activity drives up the price, and by the time the transaction is completed, they end up paying a higher price than anticipated. The front-runners then sell their holdings at the increased price, profiting from the transaction while the portfolio suffers from the inflated costs.</p><p>This lack of privacy not only results in financial losses but also erodes your ability to execute effective trading strategies. With open blockchains, competitors can analyze trading patterns, replicate successful strategies, or even devise counter-strategies that exploit your clients’ positions. This constant surveillance can lead to a loss of competitive edge, as asset managers, brokers and others are unable to maintain the secrecy of their clients’ strategies.&nbsp;</p> MEV Bots <p>MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bots underscore the importance of privacy in the trading strategies used by asset managers. These bots are sophisticated algorithms that monitor blockchain networks for pending transactions and exploit opportunities to extract additional value. By analyzing transaction data in real-time, MEV bots can execute trades such as arbitrage, front-running, and sandwich attacks, allowing them to profit from price discrepancies and transaction sequencing. The transparency of blockchain networks, while beneficial for trust and verification, makes it easier for these bots to operate, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining transaction confidentiality for all users, but asset managers who engage in high volume or high frequency trades on behalf of clients may be at higher risk. According to Flashbots, MEV bots <a href="https://www.tastycrypto.com/defi/mev-bots/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">extract around 500M USD off Ethereum</a> alone per year.&nbsp;</p> Options are limited <p>As of this writing, your options as an asset manager are limited if you wish to preserve your privacy and that of your clients. Many of today’s best-known privacy-enhancing technologies can create regulatory issues. For example, the virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash was infamously sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury and faced investigations and actions from other regulators around the world, due to its involvement in illicit activities. Regulators <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">recognize</a> that there is an opportunity for privacy-enhancement for DeFi trading, and are calling for <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">innovations that can simultaneously preserve the privacy of users while also enabling AML/CFT obligations</a>. It is worth noting that Panther Protocol is being built to address this challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol <p>Panther’s cutting-edge decentralized privacy protocol will empower enterprises with customizable, private operating environments to manage portfolios and assets. Leveraging Zero-Knowledge proofs and a proprietary Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) design, Panther Protocol will deliver a suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p> Benefits For Asset Managers (In development)   Private Portfolio Management Supports confidential client portfolio management, ensuring transaction details and holdings remain private, maintaining investor confidentiality.  Custom Investment Strategies Tailored investment access with specific DeFi applications and asset lists, optimizing returns while adhering to client risk profiles.  Compliance and Reporting Encrypted data storage for transactional details, simplifying compliance and reporting processes with secure transaction detail exports.   Conclusion <p>The transparency of blockchain technology presents both opportunities and challenges for asset managers and financial institutions. While it promotes trust and accountability, it also exposes proprietary strategies to potential competitors and malicious actors. This exposure necessitates that asset managers take steps to enhance their privacy measures and stay vigilant against threats like front-running. Navigating this landscape requires balancing the benefits of blockchain transparency with the need to protect confidential trading strategies.</p>

        <p><a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42406-draft-technical-roadmap-for-the-migration-of-zen-and-eon/648/18">On June 6th, the official ZenIP for the technical roadmap of the migration of $ZEN and EON went live on Discourse</a>, there’s a lot to cover on it, so we wanted to provide a high level overview of the proposal and what it means for the Horizen Ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a high level, Horizen ($ZEN) and EON are currently built on older technology stacks. The Horizen Mainchain is a fork of the Bitcoin C++ codebase with a block time of 2.5 minutes, while EON is written in Scala based on the Scorex SDK with an 18-second block time. To address the limitations of these legacy systems and align with the vision of Horizen as a home for ZK and an enduring utility for $ZEN, Horizen Labs is proposing to migrate to EON 2.0.</p>
 Key Points 
 
 EON 2.0 will be a fully-compatible EVM. This includes backward compatibility to provide a smooth transition for existing $ZEN holders and EON developers, including incentives, emissions, staking, partner integrations, exchange continuity, and EVM compatibility. This means that existing smart contracts on EON will be transitioned over, including $ZEN in current liquidity pools. 
 This is a technical ZenIP, laying out the technical roadmap for the migration mechanics for $ZEN and EON. Tokenomics are not in scope for this ZenIP. Topics such as allocations and emissions are explicitly excluded since they will be covered in greater detail in a separate proposal. 
 It will be a snapshot-based migration, where comprehensive state snapshots of both EON 1.0 and Horizen will be taken to ensure a seamless transition to EON 2.0. We will provide the ability for anyone to independently verify the integrity of both snapshots. 
 For Mainchain $ZEN, there will be a claim process overtime, where eligible users can claim their old Mainchain $ZEN by proving the ownership of their address. As for $ZEN on EON, it will not require any claim, since balances will be migrated with the state snapshot. 
 EON 2.0 will be built using the Substrate framework (written in Rust) with tight integration with the zkVerify protocol (which is also built on Substrate) for fast and cost-efficient verification of zk proofs. Specifically, EON 2.0 will be a parachain connected to the zkVerify Relay Chain. It is not associated with the Polkadot ecosystem. 
 
 Visual Representation of the Migration Proposal

 Voting Timeline 
<p>Voting for ZenIP 42406 will start on Tuesday, June 18th, 2024 at 12pm EST and end on Friday, June 21st, 2024 at 12pm EST. The snapshot will be taken as soon as the vote goes live. In order to prepare for the vote, please be sure to follow our instructions here: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-vote-on-zenips-using-your-staked-zen/">https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-vote-on-zenips-using-your-staked-zen/</a></p>
 Frequently Asked Questions 
 
 What will be the consensus of the new EON chain?
 
 Delegated Proof of Stake 
 Same as the previous EON chain 
 
 
 Is $ZEN going to be the block reward on the new chain?
 
 Yes, but allocations, emissions, and tokenomics are not covered in this technical ZenIP, but in a separate and dedicated proposal.&nbsp; 
 
 
 If there are no forger nodes, will there be some other type of staking?
 
 Yes there will be staking on EON collators.&nbsp; 
 
 
 What will be EON’s connection to zkVerify?
 
 EON 2.0 will integrate tightly with the zkVerify protocol, ensuring fast and cost-efficient verification of zk proofs.&nbsp; 
 zkVerify will operate as its own relay chain. EON 2.0 will also utilize the substrate framework as a parachain to zkVerify.&nbsp; 
 
 
 What will happen to the Horizen mainchain?
 
 It will be deprecated. 
 
 
 What will happen to my mainchain $ZEN?
 
 $ZEN will be the native token for EON 2.0 
 A comprehensive snapshot will be taken.&nbsp; 
 Eligible users can claim their $ZEN through a claiming mechanism over time.&nbsp; 
 
 
 How will exchanges support this deprecation and migration?
 
 We will work closely with exchanges to coordinate a seamless upgrade.&nbsp; 
 
 
 How will forger nodes migrate?
 
 They will migrate to EON collators, migration steps will be provided. 
 
 
 What will happen to Super Nodes?
 
 They will migrate to EON collators 
 Will be rewarded based on the blocks that they are chosen to forge.&nbsp; 
 
 
 What wallet will I have to hold ZEN in? What will happen to Sphere?
 
 MetaMask will be used to store $ZEN, Sphere will be deprecated.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Leo—Brave’s in-browser AI assistant—is now even more useful, thanks to its integration with Brave Search. With today’s release, Leo can incorporate search-augmented responses into its answers, powered by the <a>Brave Search API</a>. This new integration allows Leo to provide more accurate and up-to-date answers, especially for queries related to current events or topics where the initial language model training may be outdated or lack full context.</p>
<p>Brave Leo with Brave Search results is now available to desktop users with today’s 1.67 browser update, and will be coming to mobile platforms very soon.&nbsp;</p>

 The benefits of real-time Web data in your AI assistant, and how to get started 
<p>There are countless instances where you might need real-time information incorporated into your conversation with Leo. For example, if you ask Leo about upcoming events like concerts or sporting events, it can now reference Brave Search results to supplement its response with the timeliest news and information. Or, if you’re researching a complex topic like financial markets, Leo can weave in current data and insights from credible sources to give you a well-rounded perspective.</p>
<p>Importantly, any Leo response that incorporates search results includes links to Brave Search to explore more results, and in an upcoming release will also include links to the sources used to inform the answer. This helps you understand the source of the answers you receive, and fact check before you proceed.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Asking Leo “What are the latest reviews for Inside Out 2?”</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Asking Leo “When is Game 4 of the NBA Finals?”</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Asking Leo “What’s happening with the stock market today?”</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on-page chat experience, desktop users can click  in the sidebar, while mobile users can tap “…” (iOS) or “⋮” (Android) and then tap Leo to get started.</p>
<p>While Leo’s search integration provides valuable context, it’s still important to verify information from third-party sources, especially for critical topics. Brave encourages users to think critically and fact-check key claims against authoritative sources. For this reason, answers that incorporate information from Brave Search are clearly labeled, and include a link to a search results page (SERP) where you can investigate further.</p>

 AI assistance that’s both smart and privacy-protecting 
<p>By seamlessly blending contextual search results into natural conversations, Leo offers a uniquely powerful yet privacy-preserving AI experience. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo never uses your chats for model training and no account or login is required to use Leo. Additionally, Leo includes some specific privacy protections, including:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as IP address). Responses generated with Brave-hosted models are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training; no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 
<p>For an added layer of privacy, you can clear all local Leo data stored on your device through the Settings menu.</p>
<p><a>Learn more about Leo and data privacy in our Privacy Policy.</a></p>

 Using Brave Search to build your own AI applications 
<p>Want to connect your AI to the Web? The Brave Search API allows any developer to integrate Brave Search results into their applications. The Brave Search API provides access to an index of billions of pages via Brave’s privacy-preserving Web index, for building everything from search engines to AI apps. <a>Learn more</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/43f54162-22a6-11ef-a530-2e4ac73212b5/view">first Exploratory Dev Fund poll</a> has now closed and the results are in!</p>



<p>The purpose of this poll is to solicit input from the Zcash community regarding a potential future Dev Fund, with a view to drafting a formal proposal based on that feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be clear: the purpose of this poll is not to reach a formal decision regarding what should happen in November.&nbsp;Instead, this poll is intended to solicit feedback from the community that ZF will then use to draft a proposal that can be evaluated and discussed alongside other proposals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The percentages displayed below are based on the total number of votes cast (140). </p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q1: Should a new Dev Fund be put in place when the current Dev Fund ends in November 2024?</p>



 
 Yes – 100 votes (71.4%) 



 No – 40 votes (28.6%) 
 



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q2: If there is to be a new Dev Fund, should its recipients’ allocations reduce over time, with the balance allocated to an Unissued Reserve, as proposed by GGuy?</p>



 
 Yes&nbsp;– 48 votes (34.3%) 



 No, recipients’ allocation should remain constant for the duration of the new Dev Fund.&nbsp;– 89 votes (63.6%) 
 



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q3: If there is to be a new Dev Fund, how long should it last?</p>



 
 1 year – 49 votes (35%) 



 18 months – 3 votes (2.1%) 



 2 years – 51 votes (36.4%) 



 3 years – 7 votes (5%) 



 4 years – 24 votes (17.1%) 
 



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q4: Which organizations and programs should receive funding from a new Dev Fund?</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.bootstrapproject.org/">Bootstrap Project</a> (parent of the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/">Electric Coin Company</a>)&nbsp;– 91 votes (65% approval) 



 <a href="https://www.financialprivacyfoundation.org/">Financial Privacy Foundation</a> – 57 votes (40.7% approval) 



 a Legal Defense Fund – 46 votes (32.9% approval) 



 <a href="https://qed-it.com/">QEDIT</a> – 52 votes (37.1% approval) 



 <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants program</a> – 97 votes (69.3% approval) 



 <a href="https://zfnd.org/">Zcash Foundation</a> – 99 votes (70.7% approval) 



 <a href="https://zechub.wiki/">ZecHub</a> – 67 votes (47.9% approval) 
 



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>We’ll now take some time – and give the community time – to digest, consider and discuss these results, along with the results of <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/alternative-dev-fund-sentiment-polls/47848">other polls that are being conducted</a> across the community. </p>



<p>We plan to run a second exploratory poll alongside the ZCG committee election that will take place later this month. </p>

   Over the past decade, usage-based pricing has soared in popularity. Why? Because it aligns cost with value, letting customers pay only for what they use. But, that flexibility is not without issues - especially when it comes to predicting revenue. Fortunately, with the right process and infrastructure, your usage-based revenue can become more predictable than the traditional seat-based SaaS model.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>First and foremost, thank you to the community of over 3000 testnet users who have been testing and sharing valuable feedback. Your continued support and patience are critically important to our mission.</p><p>Testnet Stage 5 is now complete, and it provided us with valuable insights, resulting in several updates to our codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 6 of our testnet is live. Stage 6 includes simulated fee management, AMM refilling mechanisms, simulated limited subsidy rewards, onboarding enhancements using a bundler service, and several technical improvements to our testing environment.</p><p>Note: Panther’s test network is now live on Amoy, Polygon’s test network, and can be accessed <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>. Due to this network change, users will need to complete the onboarding process again and activate their test zAccount. Users who are using their old accounts, however, will not have to go through PureFi credential process again and will be moved directly to the account activation. This is a one-time activity required to access Panther.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Getting started with Stage 6 <p>To start testing Stage 6, visit <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> for the updated dApp test link and follow the steps. Here are some of the features you can look forward to testing in Stage 6:</p><p>Fees<br>This release introduces the mechanism for charging different types of fees within the simulated testnet, including Protocol Fees, Network Gas Fees, KYT fees and KYC Fees. All simulated fees are paid from the Panther Gas account in tZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>AMM Refilling with Protocol Fees<br>Simulated protocol fees collected during the testing will be deposited into the AMM’s pool of tZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>Limited Subsidy Rewards<br>The production (mainnet) version of Panther Protocol will include a feature that will allow to introduce additional rewards to partially or fully compensate costs like Network Gas Cost, KYC, KYT and Miner fees, in service of encouraging use of the platform. Stage 6 of our testnet simulates this feature for testing purposes. </p><p>Note: This feature is designed to cover only tZKP-nominated fees, and will not involved test MATIC or other native test network tokens unless using the relayer service.</p><p>Note: As the protocol developer, Panther Ventures Limited is resuming the testnet after re-deployment on Amoy. Panther Protocol Foundation is finalizing the details of the reward mechanism and will ensure that testers are rewarded proportionally to their efforts and we expect all incentives will be distributed via airdrop. This blog will be updated with more specifics in the coming days.</p> <p>Disclaimer</p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, tZKP, tzZKP, tPRP, test MATIC, and any other tokens mentioned in this announcement or within the product are for testing purposes only and have no economic value, nor can they be exchanged for value.&nbsp;</p><p>Participation on our incentivized Testnet versions may result in you earning rewards, but such credits are not represented on any blockchain as tokens.</p>

         Overview 
<p>This document will outline the various changes that were introduced with the 1.4 update. It will provide a list of areas you should be aware of and also instructions on how to update your forger with new capabilities.</p>
<p>In version 1.4, we’ve improved the usability of the staking system at the protocol level by automating the reward distribution among the forger hosting provider and the ZEN holders who stake their ZEN to the forger node. Forgers are now able to designate a smart contract that will allow delegators to claim rewards. The percentage of the forger’s incomes redirected to the smart contract will be declared by each forger when first registering.</p>
<p>Horizen will provide a factory contract that can be used to distribute rewards to forgers, although any contract can be used. The smart contract provided will distribute rewards proportionally to delegators according to the amount they stake. </p>
<p>Version 1.4 also introduces a minimum staking requirement (10 ZEN)&nbsp; to forgers for security best practices.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that no changes need to be made by existing forger nodes, 100% of the forger incomes will continue being sent to the reward address specified by the forger as it does currently. Otherwise, you can designate a smart contract for reward distribution (instructions provided within this document).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EON 1.4 hardfork will happen on Thursday, June 27th at Epoch 1593 (16:55pm UTC)</p>
 
 EON 1.4&nbsp; mainnet release tag <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/releases/tag/1.4.0">https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/releases/tag/1.4.0</a> :&nbsp; 
 Docker Compose Updates: <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/compose-evm-simplified/releases/tag/1.4.0">https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/compose-evm-simplified/releases/tag/1.4.0</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>Horizen Reward Factory Contract Address: TBD (currently under audit will be available soon). We will communicate the factory contract to partners once ready. Nodes can begin installing the update and continue receiving rewards as they do currently. Once the contract is ready you will have the option to set the factory contract to distribute rewards to delegators. </p>
 Changes in Stakes Management 
<p>Please review the following information to understand the changes that occurred with this update. This is important for those of you running forger nodes as some functionality has changed.</p>
<p>A new native smart contract will be available to manage stake-related operations. It will be available at the address 0x0000000000000000000022222222222222222333. Full documentation <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/nativesc/contracts/ForgerStakesV2.md">of its interface can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The old smart contract exposed at address 0x0000000000000000000022222222222222222222 will be deprecated and all its methods will error if called after the 1.4 hardfork.</p>

 Deploying the Factory Contract to EON for Distribution 
<p>Horizen provides a default implementation of a smart contract handling the redistribution of rewards between forger’s delegators.</p>
<p>The Factory contract to deploy is the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/development/doc/howto/DelegatedStaking.sol">DelegatedStakingFactory.sol</a>.</p>
<p>To perform the deploy, a script is already present in the repository. The following steps should be performed:<br></p>
 
 Clone project. 
 Ensure that the DelegatedStaking contract is using the correct hard-coded address for ForgerStakesV2 native smart contract. 
 Run npm run install to install project dependencies – Node.JS and NPM are required. 
 Copy/rename the .env.example file in .env file and fill the PRIVATE_KEY parameter with the private key of the wallet that should deploy the Factory smart contract. No other parameters are required. 
 Run the command npx hardhat run ./scripts/deployFactory.ts –network &lt;network_name&gt; <br>Replacing &lt;network_name&gt; with the name of the chain on which the contract will be deployed between the one defined into the hardhat.config.ts file.&nbsp; 
 
 Forger Registration and Setting Smart Contract for Distribution of Rewards 
<p>The instructions below are all steps required when setting up a new forger node. If you already have a node, you only need to (optionally) follow Step 2 to assign an EON smart contract for reward distribution.</p>
 Step 1: Registration of&nbsp; Forgers 
<p>Each forger must now register before being able to participate in the lottery and receive stake delegations. This is an additional step compared to the actual flow (so far, was enough to create an initial stake).</p>
<p>The registration can be performed by calling&nbsp; a new http endpoint on the forger node:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/api/transaction/registerForger.md">/transaction/registerForger</a></p>
<p>The method will accept the following parameters:</p>
 
 signPubKey 
 vrfPubKey 
 rewardShare 
 smartContractAddress 
 stakedAmount 
 
<p>(see above link for further info)</p>
<p>Please note that rewardShare and smartContractAddress once set are considered immutable and can’t be changed later&nbsp; (to use different values a forger would have to register new keys, and ask the delegators to unstake+stake to the new key).</p>
 Step 2: Update of a Forger Already Present Before EON 1.4 
<p>Forgers already present before EON 1.4 will not require an explicit registration described in Step 1: they will be automatically migrated and registered.</p>
<p>But please note that if they own a total stake (own + delegated)&nbsp; &lt; 10 ZEN&nbsp; they will no longer be able to forge any block after the 1.4 hardfork activation, and you will need to increase the stake to 10 ZEN or more.</p>
<p>All migrated forgers will have the fields rewardShare = 0 and smartContractAddress&nbsp; = none, meaning they will not redirect any percentage of the reward to an additional smart contract (the same behavior happens in old EON versions).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A method to update these fields is available in the http endpoints:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/api/transaction/updateForger.md">/transaction/updateForger</a></p>
<p>The method will accept the following parameters:</p>
 
 signPubKey 
 vrfPubKey 
 rewardShare 
 rewardAddress 
 
<p>(see above link for further info)</p>
<p>Please note this method can be called only once and only if their value is equal to: (rewardShare=0, smartContractAddress=null). In other words,&nbsp; rewardShare and smartContractAddress once set are considered immutable and&nbsp; can’t be changed (to use different values a forger would have to register new keys, and ask the delegators to unstake+stake to the new key).</p>
<p>Important: for security reasons the updateForger operation will be doable only starting from two consensus epochs after the hard fork activation (25 hours).</p>
 Step 3: Collect Stakes 
<p>Similar to the actual smart contract, the new native smart contract will expose methods to delegate stake to a forger and withdraw them.</p>
<p>delegate(bytes32 signPubKey, bytes32 vrf1, bytes1 vrf2)</p>
<p>The method will fail if the forger was not previously registered (remember forgers existing before the hard fork activation will be considered registered by default).</p>
<p>withdraw(bytes32 signPubKey, bytes32 vrf1, bytes1 vrf2, uint256 amount)</p>
<p>The owner of the stake must be the one sending the tx.</p>
<p>Enough stake must exist, but now will be possible also to partially withdraw the stake.</p>
<p>Amount unstaked will be sent back to the sender balance.</p>
<p>Please note that with the new system the stake handling is simplified, since:</p>
 
 There is no more the concept of “stakeId”. A stake is now just an amount associated with a specific forger and delegator address, that can be incremented or decremented over-time with multiple delegate and withdrawal operations.&nbsp; 
 No additional signatures other than the standard Ethereum-like transaction signature will be required to call delegate and withdraw methods: this allows them to be called easily also from hardware wallets like Ledger. 
 
 Step 4: Reward Calculation&nbsp; 
<p>The same algorithm&nbsp; will be applied at the end of each withdrawal epoch to reward forgers, but the amount previously sent to the forger address will be split in two parts if the rewardShare specified by the forger is &gt; 0.</p>
<p>An additional change has been also implemented in the:</p>
 
 Endpoints /block/getFeePayments&nbsp; 
 RPC endpoint zen_getFeePayments 
 
<p>Their result will keep the same format as now, but will also include the reward paid to the address of the smart contracts (if defined).</p>
<p>We will also detail the amount coming from the mainchain redistribution: to be retrocompatible they will be into additional fields valueFromMainchain and valueFromFees:</p>
<p></p>
 Step 5: Claim of Delegators Rewards 
<p>The amounts directed to the smart contract will have to be redistributed among delegators through the contract. Distribution is the responsibility of the contract implementation. Horizen’s contract provides a fair distribution based on the amount staked and epoch of staking. The default smart contract implementation provided by Horizen exposes a claim method to do it:&nbsp;</p>
<p>claimReward(address owner)</p>
<p>Note that anyone could call the claim method on behalf of the owner (no restrictions on the sender of the transaction).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Documentation on the factory contract is located here: <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0/doc/howto/delegatedstakingcontract.md">https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/development/doc/howto/delegatedstakingcontract.md</a></p>
<p>Any forger is free to deploy its own smart contract. Please read the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/nativesc/contracts/ForgerStakesV2.md">native smart contract documentation</a> for useful methods that could be used inside the smart contract logic.</p>
 Reward from Mainchain – New Rules 
<p>The maximum ZEN amount redistributed to forgers from the special address 0x000000000000000000003333333333333333333 in a single withdrawal epoch is now limited to a maximum value expressed by the following formula:</p>
 
 
<p>MAX_VALUE_REDISTRIBUTED = sum [10% of Mainchain’s block-reward Coinbase of each mainchain block reference included in the withdrawal epoch]</p>
 
 
<p>Funds over the limit will stay in the address balance and will be redistributed in the following epochs.</p>
 
 
<p>For example:<br>Current Mainchain block reward: 6.25 ZEN<br>Number of mainchain block-reference in a withdrawal epoch: 100<br>MAX_VALUE_REDISTRIBUTED = 10%(6.25) * 100 = 62.5 ZEN</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Since the first November 2020, 20% of Zcash mining rewards has been allocated to a Dev Fund, which is distributed to the Electric Coin Company (ECC), the Zcash Foundation (ZF), and the Zcash Community Grants program (ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current Dev Fund will end when the next Zcash halving occurs in November 2024. If a new Dev Fund is to activate when the current one expires, the Zcash community must reach consensus within the next few months, so that the new Dev Fund can be designed and codified in the Zcash protocol, and deployed in the Zcashd and Zebra node implementations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question that the Zcash community faces is this: What should happen when the current Dev Fund expires in November 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>A range of ideas have been put forward, including allowing the Dev Fund to expire without any extension or replacement, directing a new Dev Fund into a “lockbox” to hold the funds until a new funding and governance model can be put in place, and several community members have put forward <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/moving-the-dev-fund-discussion-forward/47464">proposals for new Dev Funds</a> (or an extension of the current Dev Fund).</p>



<p>Based on community feedback, the Zcash Foundation (ZF) has decided to conduct a series of exploratory opinion polls of ZCAP members, to assess the community’s sentiment regarding a potential future Dev Fund, with a view to drafting a formal proposal based on that feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be clear: the purpose of this poll is not to reach a formal decision regarding what should happen in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, this poll is intended to solicit feedback from the community that ZF will then use to draft a proposal that can be evaluated and discussed alongside other proposals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With limited time available to design and implement a new Dev Fund before November, we will base the proposal on the existing “funding streams” model, whereby a percentage of Zcash mining rewards is allocated to a Dev Fund which is then distributed amongst a number of recipients.</p>



<p>The initial scope is based on several proposals for new Dev Funds that have already been put forward by members of the Zcash community, and have been discussed on the Zcash community forum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We expect that it will require several polls to narrow a wide set of options down, and we hope that the end result will be a set of specific choices that attract broad support from across the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our priority is to ensure that the Zcash community has a voice in what happens come November, and our goal is to help the community reach consensus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may be that consensus cannot be reached, in which case there will be no new Dev Fund in November. As we have stated <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-future-of-zcash-ecosystem-development-funding/">previously</a>, if the Zcash community decides that the Dev Fund should end and not be replaced (or that it should be replaced but that ZF should not receive any funding), ZF will support that decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may also be that the community reaches consensus on adopting a different approach, such as ECC’s proposed extension of the current Dev Fund, or Skylar’s proposed “lockbox”. Again, ZF will support the community’s decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/43f54162-22a6-11ef-a530-2e4ac73212b5/questions">first poll</a>, we are asking the following questions, and provide the following response options.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q1: Should a new Dev Fund be put in place when the current Dev Fund ends in November 2024?</p>



 
 Yes 



 No 
 



<p></p>



<p>In this question, “a new Dev Fund” means a Dev Fund that follows the existing Dev Fund’s “funding streams” model, whereby a portion of the mining reward goes directly to organizations such as ZF and the Bootstrap Project (the parent of the Electric Coin Company) to either fund their own operations or for redistribution to another organization (as with Bootstrap and ECC) or program (as with ZF and ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the percentage of the block reward allocated to the new Dev Fund, the recipients, and how the new Dev Fund is split between those recipients may be different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should answer “Yes” if you believe that any of the organizations or programs listed under Q4 below should be funded from a new Dev Fund from November 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should answer “No” if you believe that none of the organizations or programs listed under Q4 below should be funded from a new Dev Fund from November 2024.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q2: If there is to be a new Dev Fund, should its recipients’ allocations reduce over time, with the balance allocated to an Unissued Reserve, as proposed by GGuy?</p>



 
 Yes&nbsp; 



 No, recipients’ allocation should remain constant for the duration of the new Dev Fund.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>GGuy has suggested that the amount allocated to each Dev Fund recipient should follow a declining schedule, with the surplus funds allocated to an Unissued Reserve, that can only be issued through community consensus. More information can be found <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/moving-the-dev-fund-discussion-forward/47464/54">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q3: If there is to be a new Dev Fund, how long should it last?</p>



 
 1 year 



 18 months 



 2 years 



 3 years 



 4 years 
 



<p></p>



<p>If a new Dev Fund is to start in November, it must be specified with a default duration. This does not mean that the new Dev Fund will necessarily last for its full duration – the community may opt to change it, end it early or replace it with a new Dev Fund of an entirely different design. </p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q4: Which organizations and programs should receive funding from a new Dev Fund?</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.bootstrapproject.org/">Bootstrap Project</a> (parent of the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/">Electric Coin Company</a>)&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.financialprivacyfoundation.org/">Financial Privacy Foundation</a> 



 a Legal Defense Fund 



 <a href="https://qed-it.com/">QEDIT</a> 



 <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants program</a> 



 <a href="https://zfnd.org/">Zcash Foundation</a> 



 <a href="https://zechub.wiki/">ZecHub</a> 
 



<p></p>



<p>Respondents can select up to seven options in response to this question.</p>



<p>Please note that Bootstrap/ECC have stated that they will not receive funding directly from the chain except in the case of a one-year extension with a clear mandate to move to a non-direct funding model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Receipt of a Dev Fund slice is voluntary, and any of the organizations listed may request that they not be considered as a potential recipient (as <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/moving-the-dev-fund-discussion-forward/47464/37">Shielded Labs have already done</a>). If that happens, that organization will not be included in any draft proposal that emerges from this process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Legal Defense Fund option reflects a suggestion that a portion of any new Dev Fund should be allocated to fund legal action to challenge any regulatory action or legislation that negatively impacts the overall Zcash project.</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>This first poll is <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/43f54162-22a6-11ef-a530-2e4ac73212b5/questions">now open</a> for ZCAP members to vote, and will close at 09:00 UTC on 12th June 2024. </p>



<p>Future polls will solicit input on questions such as what percentage of coin issuance should be allocated to a new Dev Fund, and how the Dev Fund should be distributed amongst the recipients.</p>



<p>As stated above, the objective of this process is to obtain sufficient insight into the Zcash community’s collective sentiment to draft a Dev Fund proposal that reflects that sentiment, and can be assessed alongside other proposals from the community. We expect that there will be a final run-off poll to determine whether any proposal has consensus support across the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, we welcome the community’s feedback. If you have comments or suggestions, please join the conversation on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/moving-the-dev-fund-discussion-forward/47464">Zcash community forum</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greetings community,</p><p>In this blog post, we’re excited to present a comprehensive list of updates made in May that didn’t make it into the Alexandria update. While these changes may seem minor, we believe in transparency and the importance of highlighting even the smallest tweaks to our application to enhance user experience.</p><p>First on the list is a fix to the bridge button, addressing instances where it would mysteriously “gray out” without warning. Additionally, we’ve streamlined the process by adding sSCRT support on the Shade Bridge page, simplifying the management of SCRT and sSCRT balances. Another significant change includes filtering the swap dropdown by user balances, eliminating the need for manual scrolling.</p><p>Furthermore, we’ve introduced toast notifications on the Shade bridge page to alert users when they lack sufficient gas for bridging operations. Excitingly, we’ve updated the SILK/SHD circulating supply in anticipation of the June 18th upgrade, alongside migrating the Shade API infrastructure to the latest version of Secret Network post successful mainnet&nbsp;upgrade!</p><p>Other improvements include fixing bugs on the portfolio page and updating data feeds for Quicksilver, Stride, and Persistence oracles in light of the Secret Network&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>While this technical rundown may seem brief, we aim to foster trust within the community by providing insight into the ongoing enhancements of the Syracuse upgrade (v0.1) on its journey towards the Shade Protocol private DeFi&nbsp;suite.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/alexandria-unveiled-shade-v2-1-607297bac97b">Alexandria Unveiled — Shade v2.1</a></p> Conclusion <p>In conclusion, the Syracuse v0.1 gets us one step closer to the launch of Alexandria — a significant milestones in Shade Protocol’s journey towards revolutionizing decentralized finance. Inspired by the legacy of ancient Alexandria and the valor of the Spartans, Shade Protocol stands as a beacon of innovation and financial autonomy in the decentralized landscape.</p><p>With its commitment to privacy, ease of use, and continuous improvement through Syracuse upgrades, Shade Protocol is not only shaping the future of DeFi but also empowering individuals to reclaim control over their finances and data. As the community eagerly anticipates the release of Alexandria and beyond, Shade Protocol remains dedicated to its mission of building an unstoppable, decentralized financial ecosystem for&nbsp;all.</p><p>Website: <a href="http://app.shadeprotocol.io/">app.shadeprotocol.io</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p>

<p>Featured image: <a href="https://r2-collectibles.com/">R2-Rewards.com</a></p>



<p>So you’ve got a nice collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). After a few months, you have managed to amass a respectable amount of those little digital wonders. You might have been able to sell one or two, earning you enough for a couple of cups of coffee in your nearest franchised outlet. But as you take sips off that hard-earned coffee and browse through your NFT portfolio, you can’t help but wonder about the value hidden there, just waiting to be uncovered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question is, how to unlock the value in those NFTs?&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 NFT staking: definition 



<p>When they hear the word staking, most people think back to the old Hammer films, when the nefarious Dracula would meet his demise with a wooden stake through the heart. And yes, that is one traditional understanding of the word staking.&nbsp;But it’s 2022 now, and though Count Dracula still roams somewhere down the darkest halls of our dreams, staking now means something altogether more profitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today’s digital context of NFTs, staking is sort of a game of investment/rewards. You commit (‘lock’) your NFTs into a platform or protocol for a set period, and you receive rewards (or other benefits) in exchange for such a commitment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Staking addresses one NFT’s inherent issue: liquidity. Remember, NFTs are tokenized assets that you can sell, trade, or, as we see in this article, stake for a yield. Staking enables earning passive income off your NFT portfolio while retaining ownership.</p>



<p></p>



 Fungible vs non-fungible: an explanation 



<p>For a long time, the concepts of fungibility and non-fungibility had been well outside the layman’s lexicon. But once NFTs entered public discourse, people began to learn more about what these concepts mean.</p>



<p>In short, fungibility means the possibility of using goods, items, or commodities interchangeably because they have the same value. Banknotes or coins, pieces of the same fruit, or a liter of petrol are good examples of fungibility.</p>



<p>Non-fungibility denotes uniqueness. Collectible items, including original oil paintings, baseball cards, art pieces, diamonds, and vintage cars can be considered non-fungible.</p>



<p>It is the latter concept that emerges as most interesting, as non-fungibility carries value, and it is a value that NFT staking unlocks.</p>



Image: <a href="https://r2-collectibles.com/">R2-</a><a href="https://r2-rewards.com/">rewards.com</a>



 NFT staking: how it works 



<p>Unlocking the value of your NFTs through staking is easier than you think. All you need is a crypto wallet and, well, NFTs. The more the better. Then, choose a protocol or a platform to stake your NFTs in, and wait for the rewards, which might be distributed daily, weekly, or in any other fashion. It really is that simple.</p>



<p>NFT staking is akin to yield farming, insofar as you lock a certain amount of wealth (NFTs in this case) and receive a certain percentage of rewards based on the amount staked, the period of time that the NFTS will be locked, and other parameters.</p>



<p></p>



 All about staking rewards 



<p>When you invest in traditional financial products (bonds, stocks, mutual funds, etc.), you expect your investment to produce a certain yield. Equally, the ultimate purpose of staking your NFTs is to get a return – a reward.</p>



<p>But this raises several questions: what kind of rewards do you get? And who issues those rewards?</p>



<p>If you purchase an investment bond, your reward at the end of the investment term will usually be money, a certain percentage based on the bond’s performance, length of investment, etc. The staking rewards system works similarly. You lock your stake in for a certain amount of time and you get rewards. Some platforms might offer a fixed amount, while others might give users different amounts, depending on how many people are participating, and the total size of the rewards pool.</p>



<p>And who pays these rewards? Well, the platform or protocol where you stake your NFTs. Normally, an algorithm would calculate the due rewards based on specified parameters, and the rewards would be deposited into your account at the agreed intervals. Now, what these rewards are, depends on the protocol or platform. Sometimes, you get the platform’s native tokens, other times you get tokens that you can exchange for fiat, and certain protocols issue tokens that can only be used within their own environment (a gaming platform, for example). Always check the terms and conditions when you sign up so you know exactly what rewards you will get, and how often.</p>



<p></p>



 Risk versus Reward 



<p>As with most financial endeavors, returns are never guaranteed and are not entirely without risk. If you put up collateral it means you risk losing that. In the case of a staking system, there are often 2 things to keep in mind. First of all, in most staking systems you will need to purchase a staking key to get started. Buying the key can be seen as an entrance fee to the platform and there are often a variety of keys, ranging from cheap and small ones to big and expensive keys. Of course, you hope to earn your investment into the key back but this is never guaranteed.</p>



<p>Another risk is that the staking platform can be hacked and you may lose your NFTs since they’re not in your custody anymore. While the right permissions setup (along with responsible project owners) can drastically reduce this risk, hacks are and will always be a risk for platforms holding considerable amounts of value.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>NFT staking is a subset of the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It is a relatively new practice in the space, but there already are several NFT management companies that offer staking services, including Zaisan, which launched a <a href="https://r2-rewards.com/">staking platform in collaboration with R2</a>. While there is an inherent risk to using and creating a staking platform, this risk can be minimised by choosing the right partners and using secure setups.</p>



<p>All in all, staking is just another cool utility of NFTs, which are proving to be rather versatile assets that break new ground almost every day.</p>

One of the greatest hurdles in modern science is access to research funding, and DeSci aims to provide a solution through decentralised crowdfunding. In addition, IP rights are incontestably attributed with the help of blockchain technology, as they cannot be altered at a later date. However, as the human mind is unique and moulded by each individual’s life story, establishing a causal relationship between consumption and their beneficial or detrimental effects can be extremely biased.</p><p>We were joined by Dima Buterin &amp; Paul Kohlhaas, to discuss the vast subject of psychedelics (especially in relationship to trauma), how research has progressed and how decentralisation pushes the field forward (DeSci).</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Dima’s &amp; Paul’s backgrounds  Discovering psychedelics  Dealing with trauma  Psychedelics throughout history and societies  How Molecule DAO was founded  DeSci &amp; on-chain IP  Ethereum early days, causality &amp; rationality  PsyDAO  Network states  Misc  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/dimabuterin">Dima Buterin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/paulkhls">Paul Kohlhaas on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/molecule_dao">Molecule DAO on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/psy_dao">Psy DAO on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>After <a>nearly 18 months</a> of testing and feedback from initial partners, Brave Search Ads have exited their beta phase and are now available in major markets as part of Brave’s innovative privacy-preserving ad platform. Leading brands such as Amazon Ads Sponsored Products, <a href="https://www.dell.com/">Dell</a>, <a href="https://www.fubo.tv/welcome">Fubo</a>, <a href="https://insurify.com/">Insurify</a>, <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/">Shutterstock</a>, and <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/">Thumbtack</a> are using Brave Search Ads as part of their performance marketing strategies.</p>
<p>As of April 2024, a third of the top search advertisers in the US by media spend are either currently testing or have moved to paid Brave Search Ads campaigns. Since the beginning of the year, 89% of customers who started Brave Search Ads campaigns have continued to advertise in consecutive months.</p>
<p><a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a> is available globally to all desktop and mobile users at <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a>, and is also the default search engine in the Brave browser, which has over 65 million monthly active users. It’s the fastest growing search engine since Bing, with over 10 billion annual queries. For advertisers, Brave Search Ads are a vital new channel to augment their existing strategy, helping them reach highly qualified—but otherwise unreachable—audiences.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
An example of an ad on Brave Search</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m grateful to our partners for their contributions to the development of Brave Search Ads. With their insight, we’ve built a highly effective ad platform that, with time and continued support from global advertisers, has the power to challenge Google’s monopoly on search advertising. We’re excited to be expanding our offering to even more of the world’s leading brands, and encourage industry leaders to try Brave Search Ads for free before committing any paid spend.</p>
<p>— Jean-Paul Schmetz, Head of Search Ads, Brave</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building a better user-first search experience</p>
<p>Brave Search is attracting users who have become dissatisfied with the quality of search results from Google and Bing, as well as those concerned with the invasive collection and use of data by Big Tech. Brave Search offers an alternative to Google’s <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">share of the global search market</a>, which has led them to prioritize revenue generation at the expense of user experience and privacy.</p>

Drawing parallels between the early public oversight of television and the current state of the internet, Frank highlights the commodification of our data and identities online. He advocates for new protocols and a movement inspired by historical fights against oppression to secure genuine data rights and agency online. As we look to the future, Project Liberty's endeavors may play a crucial role.

<p>NFT Community management can help ensure the smooth operation of non-fungible token (NFT) communities and their future development in <a href="https://zaisan.io/web3-explained/">Web3</a>. The idea is to keep track of community events and developments while keeping the community organised and cohesive toward the project goal. Community management can help to resolve disputes and to show empathy to digital asset owners. Nevertheless, NFT holders are, in essence, shareholders of the project. NFT community management is becoming increasingly more important as Web3 communities grow, and with a strong community, anything is possible.</p>



<p></p>



 Quick refresh: what is an NFT (community)? 



<p>The management of NFT communities is a critical but often overlooked aspect of developing and deploying these digital assets. NFTs are unique tokens on a blockchain that can represent ownership of digital or physical assets. In contrast to fungible tokens, which are interchangeable and can be divided into smaller units, NFTs are non-divisible. Due to their rarity or uniqueness, they are ideal for representing items like art, collectibles, or in-game items with monetary value.</p>



<p>NFT communities are flourishing online spaces where people with a shared interest in NFTs can connect with one another. As the popularity of NFTs continue to grow, as does the number of people flocking to these communities in search of information, advice, and support.</p>







<p></p>



 Why NFT community management is essential 



<p>With a wide range of people with different levels of knowledge and expertise, NFT community management can be a challenge. It is important to strike a balance between providing content that is both informative and accessible to all while avoiding overwhelming newcomers with too much information.</p>



<p>While the technical aspects of creating and deploying NFTs are essential, it is equally important to have a well-managed community around the project. This is because NFTs are often bought and sold in online communities. The success of an NFT project depends on the strength of these communities. For example, an NFT gaming organisation needs players to enjoy the game enough<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/"> to transact in-game assets</a> with one another.</p>



<p>A good NFT community will contain a variety of content that covers the basics of what NFTs are and how they work. Additionally, it includes more in-depth articles and discussions for those with a more advanced understanding. It is also essential to have a protocol for moderating content and managing users to keep the community respectful and welcoming to all. One way is by establishing rules and best practices written on communication channels or creating a tutorial page for newcomers.</p>



<p>With the right mix of content and community management, NFT communities can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in this exciting technology. It can be a fun entry point to the Web3 world!</p>



<p></p>



 3 Tips to create a strong foundation for your NFT Community 



<p>There are a few things that project owners should keep in mind when managing their NFT communities.</p>



 1. Constantly remind people of your vision 



<p>Have a clear vision and communicate constantly with your members. This way, you can keep everyone on the same page and working towards the same goals. Let’s take, for example, an NFT online chess game that allows users to interact with in-game assets and transact them. This creates a <a href="https://zaisan.io/play-to-earn-business-models-games/">Play-to-Earn (P2E) model</a>. The NFT game envisions creating a community where chess players can enjoy the game while earning rewards in the form of digital assets, NFTs and cryptocurrency. It is therefore necessary for a weekly content plan to include benefits and positive facts about NFT online chess, to create rapport and build trust in the project as more players join.</p>



 2. Active moderation is key 



<p>The project ambassadors should be active in the community and should engage with community members regularly. This is essentially getting more experienced people in the community to become a moderator. They should be the ones who are zealously advocating for the project. However, a community manager is needed to push content forward and stay attentive to the market needs.</p>



 3. Get people involved in decision-making 



<p>Finally, it is vital to have a community-centred approach to decision-making. This means that the community should be involved in decisions about the project, such as what features to add or what direction to take the project in. This will lead the project to a democratic system. The funds spent on NFTs are being directed to the project development from a shared decision-making perspective. In practice, this can be done through a voting system or members’ livestream meetings with the project owner.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Two of the current committee members’ terms are expiring at the end of June (Wobbzz and GGuy). Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in June.</p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">ZCG Elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining why they believe they should be elected to the ZCG Committee. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly by replying to their individual posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Monday 10th June 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>In mid-June the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community.</p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select two candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st July 2024.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The two candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 30th June 2025.</p>



<p>Prospective candidates should familiarize themselves with the Conflict of Interest policy (see below).</p>

<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications, in accordance with the strictures and guidelines set forth in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a>. Currently, formal Committee meetings are held every two weeks, and the Committee meets informally for brainstorming sessions on a weekly basis.</p>



<p>Committee members receive a stipend of $1,725 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC). </p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Zcash Foundation is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement, and is obligated to have an appropriate policy and processes in place to ensure that actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed appropriately, in order to avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial authority.. </p>



<p>Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members are required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following policies also apply in relation to ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.

<p>The approval of Ethereum spot ETFs sent shockwaves through the industry as policymakers pivoted abruptly from threatening to veto FIT21 bill, to a pro-crypto discourse. One could say their hand was forced by the imminent US elections, but Ethereum is now officially classified as a commodity, nonetheless. As the regulatory hurdle seems, for the time being, surpassed, one should not forget the values promoted by the crypto movement from the get-go: decentralisation and permissionlessness. However, everyday users tend to overlook these aspects in favour of a more streamlined user experience. As technology evolves and scaling solutions mature, better UI &amp; UX represent crucial goals in the race for end user adoption.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Crypto regulations: FIT21 &amp; Tornado Cash trial  Ethereum spot ETF  Is Ethereum a commodity or a security?  Scaling solutions &amp; end user adoption  The importance of decentralisation  How Web3 lowers barriers of (permissionless) competition  Regulatory and legal hurdles  Educating ‘normies’ &amp; UX  Technology: depoliticising money  Berlin blockchain week &amp; Dappcon 2024 wrap-up  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/austingriffith">Austin Griffith on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/mona_el_isa">Mona El Isa on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/valkenburgh">Peter Van Valkenburgh on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

The Spartan&nbsp;Creed<blockquote>In the digital realm, where Spartans&nbsp;roam,</blockquote><blockquote>We rise, united, to defend our&nbsp;own.</blockquote><blockquote>With shields of privacy, and spears of autonomy,</blockquote><blockquote>We march forth, in steadfast sovereignty.</blockquote><blockquote>Guardians of data, warriors of&nbsp;finance,</blockquote><blockquote>In every byte, we take a&nbsp;stance.</blockquote><blockquote>Our information is not for&nbsp;sale,</blockquote><blockquote>Our sovereignty is not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our dignity is not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our autonomy is not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our property rights are not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our souls are not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>For we are Spartans, hearts&nbsp;aflame,</blockquote><blockquote>In the digital realm, we stake our&nbsp;claim.</blockquote><p>Greetings Spartans,</p><p>The origin of the Shade Spartans is a simple tale — to be a staunch advocate of privacy and freedom inevitably puts you in the crosshairs of those who see our claims to digital sovereignty as a threat to their power. There are those who believe people must be protected at every turn. That security should be prioritized above the human experiment of individualism and experimentation. The powers at be are leaving an entire generation chained to the burden of malicious (not all) regulation. Disdainful pen &amp; paper, stale and unromantic. Uninspired dead documents that stifle human ingenuity, and at worse, diminish&nbsp;it.</p><p>We Spartans.</p><p>We few, we chose&nbsp;few.</p><p>Pushed to the brink, night near&nbsp;extinct.</p><p>In the arena of the digital and physical world we lay it all on the line. We deeply value our dignity. We stake our future on the truth that there is no greater love than this: that a Shade Spartan would lay his security and freedom on the line to protect the future rights of his&nbsp;enemies.</p><p>You see, Spartans fight for the rights of those who oppress us. We fight to remove the chains from those that seek to place us in&nbsp;chains.</p><p>This is what it takes to be a city on a hill — a light in the darkness.</p><p>This is what it takes to have the moral high&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Your rights are our responsibility, no matter who you&nbsp;are.</p><p>We reject the notion that security should come at the expense of freedom, and we pledge to uphold the rights of all, regardless of creed or circumstance.</p><p>The Shade Spartans are inspired by three different sets of cultural icons. The first is Master Chief from the Halo video game series. We are aligned with the never surrender attitude, and embrace the story parallels of humanity versus the dark unknown. We stand against the forces at large that wish to seize and destroy all that makes us&nbsp;human.</p><p>A scene that particular resonates with Shade Spartans:</p><p>In this scene, Master Chief is given the choice: abandon his mission of protecting humanity, or disobey a direct order. He responds with a simple line: “No,&nbsp;sir.”</p><p>Shade Spartans are polite, but firm. Spartans have a backbone, and refuse to give an inch when it comes to commands to surrender our morals and principles.</p><p>Another Master Chief line that resonates with Shade Spartans is: “…asking is not my strong suite…” We are unapologetic about our rights, and we believe that we do not need to ask permission to build technology that protects and empowers our freedoms that are not granted by governments, but rather are inalienable rights that exist within all of humanity.</p><p>The second piece of culture we are inspired by is the ancient Greek civilization Sparta. The ancient Spartans were renowned for their distinctive values and way of life, which were deeply ingrained in their society and culture. Here’s a rundown of some of their key&nbsp;values:</p>  Military Excellence: Spartans placed paramount importance on military prowess and discipline. From a young age, Spartan boys underwent rigorous training in combat skills, endurance, and discipline, preparing them for a life dedicated to military&nbsp;service.  Discipline and Self-Control: Discipline was instilled in every aspect of Spartan life. Spartans were expected to exercise self-control and endure hardships without complaint. This discipline extended beyond the battlefield to everyday life, fostering a sense of self-mastery and resilience.  Courage and Bravery: Spartans revered courage and bravery above all else. Fearlessness in the face of danger, whether in battle or in daily life, was highly valued. Spartans were taught to confront challenges head-on and never back down from a&nbsp;fight.  Equality (among citizens): While Spartan society was hierarchical, with a clear distinction between citizens (Spartiates) and non-citizens (helots and perioikoi), within the citizen class, there was a degree of equality. All Spartiates, regardless of wealth or status, were expected to contribute to the defence of the state and adhere to the same rigorous standards.  Spartan Unity: Solidarity and unity were central to Spartan society. Spartans were taught to prioritize the needs of the community over individual desires, fostering a strong sense of camaraderie and loyalty among citizens.  Simplicity and Frugality: Spartans valued simplicity and frugality in their way of life. Material wealth and luxury were viewed with suspicion, and excess was discouraged. Spartans lived austere lives focused on the essentials, believing that hardship bred strength.  Education and Intellectual Development: While Spartan education primarily focused on physical training and military skills, intellectual development was also valued. Spartan youths were taught to read, write, and engage in philosophical discourse, albeit to a lesser extent than in other Greek city-states.  <p>We believe real change comes from a commitment to individual excellence combined with teamwork around winning battles at large. Your voice matters. Your action matters. How you conduct yourself matters. In isolation, you can achieve a little. Combined in a phalanx of fellow privacy advocates, we become unstoppable. Shade Spartans believe that actions speak louder than words in an era where words are cheap, ideas are manufactured, and where discourse is often controlled.</p><p>The third piece of culture we are inspired by is the modern cypherpunk movement. The modern cypherpunk movement is a decentralized community of individuals who advocate for the use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies to promote individual freedoms and protect against surveillance and censorship. Emerging in the late 20th century, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, the cypherpunk movement was heavily influenced by the rapid advancement of digital technologies and the growing concerns over government surveillance and control in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>At its core, the cypherpunk movement emphasizes the importance of privacy, anonymity, and encryption as fundamental human rights in the digital era. Cypherpunks believe that individuals should have the ability to communicate, transact, and interact online without fear of eavesdropping, censorship, or manipulation by governments, corporations, or other third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Key principles of the modern cypherpunk movement&nbsp;include:</p>  Privacy: Cypherpunks assert that privacy is essential for maintaining personal autonomy and freedom of expression. They advocate for the widespread adoption of encryption tools and privacy-enhancing technologies to protect individuals’ digital privacy from intrusive surveillance.  Cryptography: Cryptography is seen as a powerful tool for securing communications, transactions, and digital identities. Cypherpunks promote the development and use of strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of online interactions.  Decentralization: Centralized systems are viewed as vulnerable to censorship, surveillance, and control. Cypherpunks advocate for decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, which distribute power and control among a network of participants, reducing the influence of centralized authorities.  Anonymity: Anonymity allows individuals to communicate and transact online without revealing their identities or personal information. Cypherpunks support the use of anonymous communication tools, such as Tor and anonymous cryptocurrencies, to protect against surveillance and maintain privacy&nbsp;online.  Freedom of Information: Cypherpunks believe in the free flow of information and oppose censorship and restrictions on access to knowledge and expression. They advocate for the use of encryption to bypass censorship and promote the dissemination of information without interference from authorities.

  Partnering with Neros: Next-Gen Drones, Made in America  <p>Soren and Olaf started out as teenage drone racers. Now, they’re building machines to keep the United States and allies safe.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/shaun-maguire/">Shaun Maguire</a>

Team Neros



 
<p>When Soren Monroe-Anderson and Olaf Hichwa first met, they were competitors with a lot in common. Both were first-person view drone pilots racing at the professional level, both ran their own businesses designing and selling drone components—and both were still in high school.</p>



<p>Soren grew up racing in Alaska before moving to New England, where his parents took jobs at Dartmouth, while Olaf built his skills near Washington, D.C., where he was part of the extended Sequoia family—his father spent his career as a leader at Oracle, a legendary part of our portfolio. By the time he was 17, Soren was a world champion in the MultiGP drone racing league; Olaf, meanwhile, had ranked third on the league’s global leaderboard a few years earlier and went on to design and sell thousands of drone circuit boards to the world’s top pilots.</p>



<p>MultiGP is like the Formula 1 of the drone world—to succeed at Soren’s and Olaf’s level requires elite skills in not just piloting but engineering. And now, these competitors turned co-founders are using that dual expertise to build the drones that they always wanted—and that they know soldiers need.</p>



<p>When I was in Afghanistan in 2012, the U.S. military was using what were then called drones—but they were large, fixed-wing devices that had more in common with airplanes than with the drones of today. Advances in technology in the decade since are on par with the jump between World War II and Vietnam; for the past two years, Ukraine’s military has defended against the Russia invasion not just with planes, ships and tanks but also electromagnetic energy, Starlink, hypersonic weapons—and modern, quadcopter drones.</p>



<p>Drones are a foundational technology for the future of warfare, with use cases going far beyond offensive missions; they are also used, in massive quantities, to gather intelligence, clear mines and more. But the U.S. is currently far behind in production of both these machines and their components, with 85% of global drone manufacturing capacity owned by China. Under the Department of Defense’s <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3657609/defense-innovation-official-says-replicator-initiative-remains-on-track/">Replicator initiative</a>, large U.S. defense companies will produce thousands of drones, but Ukraine will use an estimated 2.5 million this year alone.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.neros.tech/">Neros</a>, Soren and Olaf are determined to change that math.</p>



<p>Last year, a few days after we first met, Soren traveled to the front lines of Ukraine—to share what he knew about flying drones, and to see firsthand what the soldiers there needed. He came back with a clear vision for what Neros should build, and for how they should build it: a new generation of drones, from a fully American supply chain. We partnered soon after.</p>



<p>And then we saw just how quickly Soren, Olaf and their team work. They began in earnest in June, and by September, Neros—still a pre-seed company at the time—had successfully tested and deployed functional drones in Ukraine. Today, those drones remain a critical tool on the battlefield, and Neros recently completed an exercise with the U.S. Army, successfully removing anti-tank landmines in every attempt.</p>



<p>It’s an incredibly impressive track record for any new company, much less one led by co-founders who are barely in their 20s. But once you know Soren and Olaf, it’s difficult to be surprised. They are amazing: laser-focused on understanding their customers and iterating quickly to meet soldiers’ needs, and they are bringing on top talent to help them scale. With this round of seed funding, Neros will continue <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/nerostechnologies">building that team</a>, and will open a new 15,500-square-foot factory, enabling them to produce thousands of drones each month. From there, Soren and Olaf plan to bring production of more components in house—continuing progress toward their dream of a fully American drone supply chain—and eventually, to expand beyond drones to more aspects of defense, reshoring manufacturing as they go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Less than a decade after they faced off as racers, these two teenage competitors turned friends and their team are already making a life-saving difference for soldiers in Ukraine—and soon, for the men and women who serve in the U.S. military and all around the world.</p>

<p>The massive success of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETF showed tremendous interest from large institutional players. Even despite negative takes in public appearances, behind the curtain, more and more ‘smart money’ accumulate $BTC, either directly or through ETF shares. The same is to be expected for Ethereum, yet uncertainty still looms due to its proof-of-stake consensus model and, ultimately, staking yield. While crypto natives quickly embraced both ETH staking as well as liquid staking, institutions could not justify the higher risk profile and lack of regulatory compliance. Alluvial and Liquid Collective seek to change this and provide ultrasound infrastructure for enterprise-grade security in liquid staking.&nbsp;</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Mara’s background  ETH 2.0 and the current staking landscape  Liquid Collective  ETH ETF and staking concerns  The risks of adjusting staking emissions  Restaking and new opportunities  Institutional staking and risk optimization  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/maraschmiedt">Mara Schmiedt on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/alluvialfinance">Alluvial on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/liquid_col">Liquid Collective on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Imagine a group of small islands dotted around an area of an ocean. Each island has a small settlement of people, going about their business and living as best they know how. But there’s a problem. One island has wood but little food. They can build rudimentary huts but can scarcely eat. Their closest island has plenty of food but no wood, so they lack shelter. A third island has wood and food but no hay for their animals. Another island is brimming with hay but little coal to light fires. However, the island with the wood does have coal reserves. Then, one day, someone has an idea. Why not build bridges connecting all the islands so all the islanders can share resources? Soon, wood, food, coal, and hay are moving across the islands, and islanders’ business grows tenfold.</p>



<p>Now, imagine each of those islands is a blockchain. Each blockchain hosts a set of tokenised assets, which had remained confined to their blockchain. Why not build bridges across the blockchains so that assets can be easily shared and traded, similar to what the islanders did?</p>



<p></p>



 Cross-chain bridges: a simple solution to a big problem 







<p>In computing environments, some terms can be obscure and non-descript. That is not the case here. A cross-chain bridge does exactly what it says. It is a mechanism that enables the transfer of assets back and forth between two or more chains. Those assets can be tokens, cryptocurrencies, or any other tokenised assets hosted on the chains.</p>



<p>You might be wondering what sort of wizardry this is. Furthermore, you might question how it is possible to move assets between two chains whose protocols, rules, etc. might be completely different. These are valid questions, and here’s the answer. The bridge acts as a neutral zone (a no man’s land of sorts) where the switch occurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An example: two blockchain games, one hosted on an Ethereum chain, the second hosted on WAX. Ethereum uses a proof-of-work consensus protocol, while WAX uses a proof-of-stake one, each with its own set of rules. And each of these games has some cool in-game assets, maps, etc. Each game world features a thriving game economy and has something that the other gaming environment lacks (remember the islanders?) Why not connect the two chains with a bridge and enable asset swapping, so that both gaming worlds (and their in-game economies) expand and grow?</p>



<p></p>



 Exponential growth for GameFi and DeFi environments 



<p>Blockchain has yielded much disruption and innovation throughout its relatively short lifespan, and the <a href="https://zaisan.io/alien-worlds-cross-chain-bridge/">future</a> looks just as innovative and bright.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For some time, this technology has been associated with decentralised finance (DeFi). That is the provision of financial instruments without reliance on centralised intermediaries, such as banks, credit unions, or brokerages. The marriage between blockchain and DeFi has been a successful one,  fostering a new era of financial inclusivity and autonomy.<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/"> </a><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/">According to Statista</a><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/">,</a> there are currently billions held in DeFi environments, showcasing its widespread acceptance and potential for further growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in more recent times, blockchain has spread its area of influence to gaming in the form of game finance (GameFi), combining cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other tokenised assets to create a gaming environment where players can play, trade, and earn.  This development provides players with true ownership of their in-game items and the ability to earn real-world value through gameplay.</p>



<p>The mechanics underlying GameFi are relatively simple. <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/">In-game assets are distributed in NFT form</a>, which guarantees ownership. This is key, as it enables the players to trade these assets as they see fit, sell them to other players, etc. And this is where cross-chain bridges come in. These two-way paths enable these assets to be moved from one chain to another, thus not only safeguarding the liquidity but also enhancing it by facilitating a wider marketplace. By doing this, the player pool grows exponentially, as players can participate in multiple gaming environments without being restricted by the boundaries of a single blockchain.</p>



<p>The same applies to DeFi environments, albeit without the gaming part. Users of different blockchains can have their assets exchanged on the bridge so they can be used on another blockchain. This is sometimes called ‘cross-chain swap.’ It is crucial for building a more interconnected and fluid blockchain ecosystem, where assets can freely move across different platforms, enhancing the user experience and broadening the scope of possibilities.</p>

 Cross-chain bridging with Zaisan 



<p>The benefits of multi-chain bridging are clear. The islanders knew it, and now you know too. Scalability, portability, and a massively expanded user or player pool are just the tip of the iceberg. These advancements signify a shift towards a more integrated, versatile, and user-centric blockchain ecosystem. </p>



<p>As blockchain technology continues to evolve, it promises to unlock even more innovative applications and opportunities, potentially transforming industries beyond finance and gaming, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and beyond. The journey of blockchain from a novel digital ledger to a bedrock of digital innovation illustrates its immense potential and the myriad of possibilities it holds for the future.</p>

        Replicate founders Ben Firshman and Andreas Jansson are bringing open-source AI models to the developer community—and sparking imagination on how to use them.         
Published May 14, 2024

<p>In August 2022, Ben Firshman woke with a splitting headache. He stumbled through his San Francisco apartment wracked by achiness and chills and grabbed a COVID test. That’s when he noticed something strange on his computer screen. It was a massive spike in traffic to the site he and fellow software engineer Andreas Jansson had launched in 2021, called Replicate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Replicate is a platform that hosts open-source machine learning models that anyone can run in the cloud with a single line of code. While the company had a small subset of dedicated users since its founding, it had struggled to gain meaningful traction—until now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sitting at his computer, waiting for the results of his COVID test, Firshman studied the uptick in visitors. Stable Diffusion, the most advanced text-to-image model to date, had just been released. Thousands of developers wanted to use it, but most were not AI experts able to navigate the complexity and cost of running the model on their own. And so they were turning to Replicate, which had packaged, optimized and deployed Stable Diffusion, making the model available for anyone—AI expert or not—to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Terrified that the onslaught of API calls would crash the site, Firshman phoned Jansson. They agreed they needed to work fast to ensure Replicate could handle the surge of developers coming to the platform to build and collaborate on AI-based tools and products. This was why Firshman and Jansson had started Replicate in the first place: to make machine learning accessible to software engineers.</p>



<p>Just then, Firshman’s timer went off. He checked his test: positive. He wouldn’t be leaving the house, but he would be working day and night to capitalize on this moment. Firshman ordered some Paxlovid and dove in.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>In the 1950s, if you wanted to use a computer you most likely needed a Ph.D. in electrical engineering—that’s how complicated they were. But over time, software was introduced that made using computers easy, no matter a person’s background or experience level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the greater part of the 2000s and 2010s, machine learning’s useability was akin to mid-century computers, despite its growing ubiquity. Machine learning models were bulky, complex, on-prem systems, inaccessible to most engineers. To run them required expertise in the field and resources only available to larger institutions that could afford expensive servers and GPUs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jansson, who had been a machine learning engineer at Spotify prior to founding Replicate, understood firsthand the barriers developers faced in using AI models. “I could read all about new developments in AI, but there were no tools readily available to actually apply any of it,” Jansson says. When he encountered an issue at Spotify, he would delve into relevant research, which would be in the form of scientific papers—not usable code. “Experts would write software, turn it into prose for the sake of academia, and then engineers like Andreas would have to turn their research back into software in order to use it,” Firshman says. “The whole process was bananas.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I could read all about new developments in AI, but there were no tools readily available to actually apply any of it.”</p>
Andreas Jansson</blockquote>



<p>Once the prose had been translated back into code, there came another issue: deployment. There was no guarantee that the software would run properly when it was transferred between computer systems. Researchers and engineers would have to work together for weeks to ensure other engineers could run the models on their own computers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jansson and Firshman didn’t understand why AI models couldn’t just be distributed as software ready for production. This question connected directly to the work Firshman was doing at the time at Docker. Docker allows developers to package their code into containers (think shipping containers), which ensures that software runs the way it is supposed to on any computer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Firshman and Jansson wanted to build such a container, but for AI. “If only we could define a standard box for machine learning models, then researchers could put their models inside it,” said Firshman. “They could be shared with other people. They could be deployed to production. They could run anywhere, and always keep on running.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2019, Firshman and Jansson began working on Replicate. As Firshman explains, “The heart of Replicate is taking all of these incredible new advances in AI and making them accessible to software engineers who don’t understand those things, but know how to build great products.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Replicate would be a platform where machine learning researchers could host and share AI models, and where engineers of all backgrounds could use those models to build applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Firshman and Jansson believed in Replicate’s potential, they knew they were taking a calculated risk. “Generative AI is everywhere now, but back then, it was not a term at all,” says Stephanie Zhan, a partner at Sequoia. “Ben and Andreas’ bet was that there would be a flourishing open-source model ecosystem, and they could become an important enabler of it by providing the easiest-to-use tools and infrastructure for developers to use these models.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To confirm Replicate’s viability, Firshman and Jansson spent weeks talking with machine learning experts and software developers, assessing their needs and experiences and comparing them with their own. Open-source machine learning was a nascent field and Replicate was a gamble on its future. Ultimately, Firshman and Jansson determined it was a gamble they were ready to take.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Generative AI is everywhere now, but back then, it was not a term at all.”</p>
Stephanie Zhan</blockquote>



 



<p>Firshman and Jansson first met in London in 2012 while working as developers for a music platform called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210926084455/https://www.thisismyjam.com/">This Is My Jam</a>. On a team of just four people, Firshman and Jansson quickly formed a friendship, bonding over favorite bands and a shared attitude towards their work. “In a field where it’s easy to be cynical, we both had a childish enthusiasm for programming,” Jansson says. “We were both excited about building things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Firshman’s interest in building came from his father, who he describes as a “nerd who was always tinkering with things.” Firshman’s mother was a classical guitar teacher, and during the hours she was with students, Firshman and his father would build and take apart anything they could get their hands on, from model airplanes to the family’s car. Firshman recalled being five years old and attempting to turn a landline into a wireless phone using a soldering iron. His father encouraged him to explore how the world worked, and Firshman seized every opportunity to do so.</p>



<p>As a teenager, Firshman applied his curiosity to software. He became involved with an online developer community who attached cell phones and cameras to weather balloons and sent them to the edge of space, where the cameras would take pictures and the phones would text their location. Firshman helped write the code for these explorations, collaborating and learning from other engineers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, deep in the forest outside Habo, Sweden, twelve-year-old Jansson was also learning to code. Armed with only a book about BASIC and an old Amiga 500, he began to recreate the games his friends had on their more advanced computers, like Brick Breaker. He was proud when he finally got the physics of the bouncing ball to work properly, and soon started building games of his own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When he was 15, Jansson left home to pursue his other passion, music, enrolling at a high school in Rättvik specializing in Swedish folk music. Following graduation he completed his military service, worked a stint as a forklift driver, and then moved to England to study sound engineering and, later, computer science.&nbsp; “Maybe there’s a way to combine music and engineering,” Jansson thought. He was right. Soon after graduating, Jansson started working at This Is My Jam and met Firshman.</p>



<p>In 2014, the two friends parted ways. Jansson accepted a job as a software engineer at Spotify and moved to New York. Firshman began working at Docker, but over time began to question his purpose. “I felt like I always stumbled into the next opportunity,” Firshman says. “I really wanted to figure out what I wanted to do with my life and what was important to me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, Firshman quit his job and decided to travel. He cycled across India and drove a van through China. He ate homemade pasta for breakfast at a stranger’s house in Italy. Eventually, he made his way to Greece, where he met up with his old friend, Jansson, on a small island called Naxos.</p>



<p>One afternoon, sitting by a pool, Firshman watched as Jansson struggled to read a research paper about AI on his phone. The paper, only available as a PDF, wasn’t designed to be read on a smartphone, so Jansson had to zoom in on every sentence. Firshman understood his exasperation. In the early days of their friendship, they’d talked about how the internet had originally been designed to share academic work. But decades after the internet’s founding, so much scientific research remained needlessly difficult to consume, like these mobile-unfriendly PDFs. Lifting his legs out of the water, Firshman proposed they work together to find a solution. Over the next few days, Firshman and Jansson built a program that converted research papers to web pages. Using the program, papers could be scaled appropriately to phone screens, and the hyperlinks, which previously would have to be copied and pasted into a new browser, were clickable. Now anyone anywhere, and on any platform, could easily read and digest a paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Firshman didn’t know it at the time, he’d found what was important to him: he had a passion for making the inaccessible accessible, and he loved working with his friend. Whatever project came next, he wanted it to involve Jansson.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Back in his apartment in the summer of 2022, the positive COVID test beside him, Firshman realized that for Replicate to handle the incoming surge of traffic, he, Jansson and their two other employees didn’t just need to patch the site, “we needed to rewrite our entire infrastructure,” he says. “It wasn’t working like we needed it to. It wasn’t up to par.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Firshman recalls the next few days as “24/7, all hands on deck.” One of their users informed them that an application built using Replicate was going to be featured on Japanese national television. “The show’s airdate was our deadline,” Firshman says. “And we managed to meet it. We rebuilt the whole Replicate infrastructure in a couple of weeks.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The show’s airdate was our deadline, and we managed to meet it. We rebuilt the whole Replicate infrastructure in a couple of weeks.”</p>
Ben Firshman</blockquote>



<p>Their work paid off. Following the launch of Stable Diffusion, software engineers and AI enthusiasts across industries flocked to Replicate to create new products. One popular app allowed users to upload pictures of their homes, describe an interior decorating style, and watch as the program generated images of their homes in that style. Another converted blurry, old photos into crisp, high-definition images. More than growing Replicate’s user base, Stable Diffusion’s release brought attention and legitimacy to the idea of open-source AI models. And it underscored the value of Replicate, a platform where they could live and be deployed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July 2023, Meta and Microsoft released Llama 2, a large language model whose addition to Replicate’s library resulted in the platform’s biggest week of growth to date. For Replicate, this represented yet another vote of confidence—this time from two of the world’s most significant tech companies—in open-source AI models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Replicate’s initial challenge was getting people to buy into open-source AI models and believe they could be easy to use, today its biggest challenge is competitors crowding into the space. “Developers care about cost, performance, and the developer experience of running these models,” Zhan says. “The ecosystem of models is flourishing and ever-evolving, so pushing the envelope on these dimensions is a continuous journey.”</p>



<p>Cost and performance aside, according to Zhan, what sets Replicate apart from the host of other AI inference platforms is empathy. “They understand what developers actually want,” Zhan says. “They didn’t just build something that works, they built something that is delightful—a few lines of code to run any model in the cloud directly via their API.” Replicate’s website features a neon background gradation and large, stylized image tiles for each model in its library. Detailed instructions, replete with colorful visual aids, guide users through how to run, customize and deploy models. It’s a platform that front to back inspires the imagination.</p>



 



<p>Scaling a startup is almost impossibly complex, but similar to how AI models learn, Firshman and Jansson have gotten better at it over time. “At first, we tackled every responsibility together,” Jansson says. They soon realized this was a quick path to burning out and decided to delineate duties. Firshman focuses more on products and the business side of the platform, while Jansson keeps up with developments in machine learning. A decade into their friendship, the two maintain the highest admiration for each other. Jansson says he got an MBA by osmosis just by working with Firshman, who understands business and people “in a magical way.” Firshman describes Jansson as a “ridiculous, multi-talented person.” They’re certain that at the core of what makes Replicate successful are their friendship, respect and shared ethos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Firshman lives in San Francisco and Jansson in rural Sweden, they make it a point to spend time together. Firshman visits Jansson about four times a year, and the two take walks through the forest, discussing the future of Replicate and AI in general. They continue to share the youthful passion about software they had when they first met, and they still can’t help but build together. When Jansson was getting married in July 2022, he constructed a dance floor in the woods near his home for Swedish folk dancing. A week before the wedding, he realized it needed a roof. Firshman, who had flown out early, spent days with Jansson building the roof for the dance floor. The last plank went in at dawn, hours before Jansson’s wedding. That night, the two celebrated with friends and family, dancing beneath their creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article explores the critical role of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and other advanced privacy tools in safeguarding user privacy within the burgeoning Web3 landscape, addressing the inherent transparency of blockchain technology and introducing next-generation solutions for scalable, privacy-focused blockchain applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Although blockchain’s benefits are undeniable, the decentralized and immutable nature of open blockchain’s record-keeping creates unique privacy challenges. Blockchain's transparency means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable by anyone. While this promotes trust and accountability, it also poses significant risks to personal privacy if identities can be linked to public addresses and can expose trading strategies for professional investors and other successful traders. Additionally, integrating decentralized applications (dApps) with these technologies further complicates the privacy landscape, as user interactions on one platform can be traced across multiple platforms and transactions.</p><p>To address these privacy challenges, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) emerge as a potent solution, allowing transaction validation without compromising private data. ZKPs, such as<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/"> zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs</a>, are cryptographic methods that allow the validation of transactions without revealing any underlying data, playing a crucial role in maintaining privacy on the blockchain.</p><p>Beyond enhancing privacy, ZKP technology can be instrumental in DeFi contexts, where it ensures that financial transactions remain confidential yet verifiable, believed to be the key to fostering trust and participation in open financial ecosystems. The technology can make transactions more private, ensuring that while the integrity and rules of the transaction are publicly verifiable, the specifics of the amounts and the parties involved in the transaction remain private.</p><p>Relative to non-succinct privacy-preserving proofs, zk-SNARKs can make for more scalable projects compared with, for example, non-succint alternatives such as zk-STARKs. By enabling transaction validation without disclosing or processing extensive data on the blockchain, zk-SNARK technology can be implemented in ways that lessen the network burden. Ultimately the result is a more efficient blockchain, potentially increasing transaction throughput and enhancing overall performance.</p> Other privacy-preserving technologies <p>While ZKPs are pivotal, a broad array of privacy-preserving technologies, including Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multi-Party Computation that are available for Web3 developers:</p>  ​​Homomorphic encryption: Enables computations on encrypted data, ensuring data privacy even during processing.  Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC): Allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function while keeping their inputs private.  Decentralized identifiers (DIDs): DIDs allow individuals to control and verify their identity independently of a central authority, enhancing privacy and control over personal identity data.  Blockchain sharding: Although its primary function is to help scale networks, by dividing the entire blockchain into smaller partitions known as shards, privacy is enhanced by limiting the data each node can access.  Differential privacy: Integrating differential privacy techniques into blockchain applications can add noise to aggregated data, making it difficult to identify individual users while maintaining the utility of the data.  Confidential smart contracts: Leveraging cryptographic techniques to execute smart contracts confidentially ensures that the data within these contracts is not exposed to other network participants.   Tools for enhancing privacy in Web3 <p>The development of these foundational technologies paves the way for practical, user-facing privacy tools in Web3, ranging from enhanced wallets to comprehensive on-chain and off-chain solutions. Some of these tools include:</p>  Privacy-enhancing wallets: These wallets integrate features like stealth addresses and ring signatures to conceal user identities.  On-chain privacy protocols: On-chain privacy protocols like the one Panther Protocol is developing will use zk-SNARK and other privacy technologies to conduct private transactions on public blockchains while preserving privacy.  Off-chain privacy solutions: Off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network for Bitcoin or Raiden Network for Ethereum help scale transactions off the main chain while improving privacy by reducing the on-chain footprint.  Data protection tools: Tools like NuCypher use proxy re-encryption and SMPC to secure shared data among multiple participants without exposing the raw data to external parties.   Conclusion <p>Web3 aims to revolutionize online interactions by emphasizing privacy and control over personal data, while still maintaining the inherent benefits that transparent blockchain technology brings. As this technology advances, it’s critical to develop tools that uphold privacy without compromising transparency. This balancing act involves both innovative technological solutions and stringent regulatory measures, ensuring Web3 can offer transparent yet secure digital environments.</p> For more information about privacy-preserving technologies <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-deep-dive-into-secure-multi-party-computation-mpc/">A Deep Dive Into Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">Threshold Cryptography, MPC, and MultiSigs: A Complete Overview</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bulletproofs-in-crypto-an-introduction-to-a-non-interactive-zk-proof/">Bulletproofs In Crypto – An introduction to a Non-Interactive ZKP</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/">zk-SNARKs vs zk-STARKs: Comparing Zero-knowledge Proofs</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-example-explaining-zkps/">What is a zero-knowledge proof?

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra v1.7.0. With this release we have added a number of usability improvements, bug fixes and new features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zebra now supports Regtest without proof-of-work validation. In order to support regtest network mode in Zebra, we have started to include some functionality to enable the creation of new networks with a configurable set of parameters.</p>



<p>We made changes that will allow Zebra nodes behind firewalls contribute to the P2P network by using the external address to communicate with peers. We have additionally made updates to ensure that zebra can build and run on Windows as a <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/target-tier-policies.html#tier-2-platform-policy">Tier 2 supported platform</a>.</p>



<p>This release fixes a bug with the <code>z_get_treestate</code> RPC method which could potentially return data from different blocks and we have fixed a panic when the elasticsearch feature is enabled without a backing elasticsearch server.</p>



<p>Finally, we adjusted the Zebra release interval from 2 weeks to approximately 6 weeks, to match Rust stable release cadence.</p>

  Partnering with Apex Security: The AI-Empowered Future, Secured  <p>Matan, Tomer and their team are helping AI dreams come true—by preventing security teams’ worst nightmares.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a>	 



Published May 2, 2024
  



Apex Security co-founders Tomer Avni and Matan Derman in the Sequoia London Office.



 
<p>As the old saying goes, in the midst of every crisis is an opportunity. But in technology, the reverse is often true, as well: every opportunity also creates a crisis. AI is undoubtedly a generational opportunity—a force multiplier for productivity that has quickly become essential for teams to compete, with ChatGPT already in use by at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-altman-pitches-chatgpt-enterprise-large-firms-including-some-microsoft-2024-04-12/#:~:text=They%20noted%20the%20consumer%20version,92%25%20of%20Fortune%20500%20companies.">92% of the Fortune 500</a>. But AI is also a force multiplier for malicious actors, creating new vectors, and lowering the barrier, for mounting attacks. While the rest of us dream about what AI will enable for the future of our work, security teams are growing increasingly concerned about evolving—and ever-more sophisticated—threats.</p>



<p>When the age of generative AI services began in late 2022, the initial worry—no surprise, considering security professionals’ long-standing dedication to data loss prevention (DLP)—was that sensitive corporate data would leak. In many cases, existing DLP tools proved up to the task. But the focus quickly shifted from the inputs of third-party gen AI tools to their outputs. How, for example, do you ensure that the code generated by your copilot, and then woven into your corporate fabric, does not bring with it compromised open-source dependencies or other vulnerabilities? And beyond these “known unknowns” of gen AI security, there are many unknown unknowns—security risks we’ve yet to imagine.</p>



<p><a href="https://apexhq.ai/">Apex Security</a> was founded to address those concerns. By providing real-time detection, investigation and response to the cyberattacks that target AI platforms, Apex helps teams resolve the tension between leveraging transformative AI innovations and ensuring robust protection against risks. We get to use our favorite AI tools and models, and security teams get peace of mind.</p>



<p>Co-founders Matan Derman and Tomer Avni are the perfect team for the job. Matan graduated from Stanford GSB and the prestigious leadership training program of the Israeli Defense Forces, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program">Talpiot</a>, where alumni also include founders of Sequoia companies Wiz, Cyera, Oasis Security and Zafran.&nbsp; Tomer hails from Harvard Business School and MIT. The two met while working at the elite IDF intelligence unit 8200.</p>



<p>Now, Matan and Tomer are putting what they learned through that work, and through dozens of conversations with security executives, into Apex Security. The platform gives security teams full visibility into their organizations’ AI activity, allows them to set and enforce policies around that usage, and monitors both the inputs and outputs of gen AI services, detecting and responding to attacks. It’s become a crucial security layer for AI applications and LLMs used by customers including Fortune 500 companies.</p>



Tomer, Bogomil and Matan at Arc.



<p>It has been a pleasure to get to know Matan and Tomer over the past year as we welcomed them to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, Sequoia’s immersion for pre-seed and seed-stage founders, and as they built on Apex Security’s early success. We are proud to lead their seed round and to support them as they continue to grow their product and their team, empowering the companies of the future to swiftly and securely embrace the power of AI.</p>

<p>1-Please tell us a little bit about yourself.</p><p>Am not shy or modest, but honestly feel anything related to blockchain, decentralization and DAOs is not about an individual, least of all me. But can best be described as literally one of the dinosaurs of the ecosystem. Have an interest in almost anything I don’t understand which is probably how I got into blockchain! Apart from new technology I love (random order) travelling, company of friends and family, food, something to wash the food down with, art, politics, economy, society and sports. A moment of happiness is when coming home after a trip crashing on the couch with a cheese sandwich.</p><p>2- When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>This is a bit of a fluid answer I have noticed, and can change depending on setting. Guess we all like to think we were part of the “smart few” who joined early. Reminds me a bit of when people speak about epic events and stuff: 10 million people claim to have attended Woodstock, yet only 10,000 actually did…. So, there’s that! Anyway, my interested started when Bitcoin tipped $ 100 and thought, well there must be something in it. The actually journey of reading up on blockchain, decentralization and thinking of the wider implications started in 2015. Think the ICO boom of 2017 made me first question and challenge the crypto community and started to make me the decentralization and privacy advocate I am&nbsp;today.</p><p>3- Why the interest in&nbsp;DAOs?</p><p>For me blockchain has always been much, much more than a technology. I always see it as a social fabric, a new way on organizing and managing cooperation. That cooperation I see in a wide context: between organizations, people, computers and a mixture thereof. In a way you could say that after launching the blockchain, the chain will look after itself. People not so much as history shows us regularly. To me the DAO is the core of that cooperation, there where the social aspect of the project comes alive. Perhaps better said as there where community demand meets community supply. And that social aspect can be anything really: cooperation, participation, engagement, involvement in any shape or form YOU choose, be it active, passive, one-off, continuous. That this is possible I find extraordinary, and something that is really missed in today’s society. Say you are really passionate about a specific topic. To express that you need to get involved in an NGO, special interest group, political movement etc. That is a massive hurdle, and assuming you can take that hurdle it is questionable if you can actually voice your thoughts and provide input. And, literally, at what cost? That is where the DAO distinguishes itself, as it provides a vehicle that is permissionless in many, many ways. My passion is to ensure we keep this part of blockchain not only alive but also make sure we develop it into something that meets and suits demand of the ecosystem now and in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>4- Hans, could you share some insights into how PIVX has embraced the DAO model and how it has impacted the project’s governance and decision-making processes?</p><p>To me the crux of a project is how and when decentralization is embraced. Very important to me is that it is not an afterthought, but has been put centre stage from inception. That is something we see in Bitcoin — still a great standard — but luckily also in many other projects, PIVX included. Personally I also believe an important component of a true DAO is to not try to invent the wheel all over again, and to not make it depending on specific people. That is also something PIVX has embraced, and by doing so set a new standard in the ecosystem. An important part of a DAO is governance and specifically its decision making process. That is a bit of an Achilles heel for many projects. Who can vote, who can table an idea, where comes the funding from? In PIVX everyone can develop a proposal, and that is being voted on by the masternode holders. That is in my view still an issue, as I would love to lower that barrier and be able to include an even wider community to decision making. The “1 Coin 1 Vote” system which PIVX uses a variance of is flawed in that sense, but also seems to be what we have for the moment. To me the low key approach and the wide accessibility of the DAO is what keeps me involved.</p><p>5 — What are some notable features or characteristics of PIVX as a DAO that sets it apart from other cryptocurrency projects?</p><p>The route PIVX has chosen — community designed governance — is very close to my heart, and again industry leading. PIVX was very lucky to have really smart people making really smart decision when created. In case you are wondering, no, that wasn’t me: I wish! Community designed governance (CDG) is a decentralized form of governance, where decisions that affect the blockchain and the community are made in a decentralized way. That means anyone can make a proposal, express their thoughts, check the validity and necessity of a proposal making everyone a stakeholder if you choose to be one. But although we sometimes thing governance equals decision making, CDG is much more than decision making. It is a way in where values, beliefs and thoughts come together. Perhaps it can be described as that what gives a face to PIVX. In the simplest terms to me the most notable feature it is Proof of Community.</p><p>6- How has PIVX leveraged the DAO structure to foster community involvement and ownership?</p><p>The already mentioned community aspect of governance combined with the funding structure of PIVX creates an environment that allows wide participation. That is a crucial condition for any project I would say, and often overlooked. Compare this to the corporate world where a company says the customer is key but there is no way to contact them if I want. The infrastructure, the environment needs to be okay first and foremost. PIVX has done that from the onset. Another important component is collectivism: we are all in this because we value decentralization, privacy and feel an alternative tool is needed to facilitate transactions. That collectiveness is a strength for PIVX and is also reflected in the DAO. How else can you have a project operating so successfully by community that is geographically dispersed, often doesn’t each other’s real names, or has ever met each other in person for so many years? That is Proof of Community in&nbsp;actions.</p><p>7 -Given your respective interests and expertise in blockchain, decentralization, and governance, what initially sparked your interest in DAOs and why do you believe they hold significant importance in the evolution of the crypto industry and&nbsp;beyond?</p><p>The DAO isn’t only the face of the project it is also the heart and soul of it. And the DAO needs to be treated as your body: use it or lose it! That sounds like a cheap one-liner, but that is far from my intention. The Proof of Community aspect is something I value, cherish and want to protect and preserve. That combined with my strong personal belief that blockchain is much more than technology alone made me and keeps me involved. I believe that today’s world and society — perhaps better said our way of cooperation, including the current state of democracy — needs a new, fresh approach. Going back to basic way of cooperating, just you and I, peer to peer, making and living by decentralization, only organizing there where it makes sense, is probably something we could use. The good old coop for instance has addressed and successfully resolved many societal issues in the past like housing, financial inclusion and independence and labor issues. It is in that sense also good to realize decentralization isn’t a new and revolutionary movement but is a useful and proven concept combined with technology. That is exciting, and I want to be part of&nbsp;that.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-hans-koning-dao-specialist-and-pivx-advisor-aa1650ff170b">PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on Hans Koning, DAO Specialist and PIVX advisor.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Alexandria Unveiled — Shade&nbsp;v2.1 <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/</a><p>Greetings community,</p><p>At Shade Protocol we build Unstoppable Finance — a world of DeFi that is globally accessible, censorship resistant, privacy-preserving, and easy to use. We believe that privacy is the key to unlocking the full value of a decentralized future. Without privacy, we fail to achieve what DeFi is fully capable&nbsp;of.</p><blockquote>Your Money.</blockquote><blockquote>Your Data.</blockquote><blockquote>Your Decisions.</blockquote><p>Shade Protocol has existed for 2+ years — collectively achieving over $350M+ of trading volume on ShadeSwap, 40M+ TVL (at peak), with thousand of daily smart contract interactions.</p><p>As referenced in <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/the-preamble-road-to-easy-private-defi-b5852fd4e3a2">The Preamble — Road to Easy Private DeFi</a> we have set our eyes on making Shade Protocol the easiest to use private DeFi in all of Web3. Additionally, after much user feedback we have decided to begin bundling multiple features and utilities into single upgrades, empowering upgrade packages to be more meaningful and easier to explain to&nbsp;users.</p> The Upgrade <blockquote>ALEXANDRIA Upgrade will be released June 18th, 2024 at 8:00 pm. GMT&nbsp;+0</blockquote> 1. Analytics Tab - (TVL, Volume, # of trades, fees accrued, PoL, etc.)<br>2. Prices Tab - (historical candlestick charts / line charts / etc.)<br>3. dSHD - (private liquid staking for SHD)<br>4. Silk Analytics V2 - (SILK peg performance, basket performance, etc.)<br>5. New pools - (dSHD/USDC, dSHD/SHD, etc.)<br>6. New SILK collaterals <br>7. Shade Spartan NFTs <p>The next upgrade after Alexandria will be released September 18th, 2024. The name of the next upgrade bundle has yet to be revealed, nor has its features.</p> Analytics Overhaul Early stages of Silk Analytics V2<p>Across the Shade Protocol suite there are countless pieces of protocol data forming a story that has been previously untold. Information such as Silk collateral backing, peg performance data, protocol wide TVL, volume, # of trades, historical staking APY, etc. The Alexandria Upgrade represents a massive leap forward in visual storytelling — representing half a year of infrastructure overhaul empowering in app story telling that will provide the information and data users need to make informed decisions.</p><p>One of the key principles that drive Shade Protocol design decisions is a simple modicum: “…don’t make the user leave the&nbsp;app…”</p><p>As we investigated where users are spending their time to make decisions, we realized that block explorers and Coingecko are the two destinations where many users camp out. With the release of the Shade Protocol transaction history, one of these problem was solved (block explorer).</p><p>This left us with the need to create an in-app Coingecko esque experience:</p>Early stage implementation…imagine mainnet / June&nbsp;18th<p>You can expect with the release of Alexandria to have the ability to seamlessly scroll through price charts &amp; price tables similar to Coingecko — empowering you to make decisions on the fly without needing to open another&nbsp;tab.</p><p>One could even imagine what an overhauled ShadeSwap experience could like in the future with these new features intertwined.</p> dSHD — Private $SHD Liquid&nbsp;Staking <p>One of the key decisions users have had to choose while interacting with Shade Protocol is between the choice to stake or become a liquidity provider with their SHD tokens. With the launch of dSHD, users will be able to enjoy yield from both liquidity providing &amp; from staking — unlocking new DeFi strategies and flexibility previously impossible.</p><p>dSHD represents the first ever LST for a natively private token; yet another first for Shade Protocol. You can expect major pools to be spun up such&nbsp;as:</p>  dSHD /&nbsp;SHD  dSHD/ USDC.noble  <p>Additionally, Shade Protocol is looking to integrate dSHD into a variety of other DeFi protocols throughout the Cosmos — setting up SHD to become the apex private omnichain asset.</p> Ancient Greek&nbsp;Theme <p>The parallels between Greek society, the historical city of Alexandria, and the ethos of Shade Protocol are intriguing and rich with significance. Just as ancient Greece was a hub for innovation, philosophy, and intellectual exchange, Alexandria stood as a beacon of knowledge, blending cultures and fostering groundbreaking advancements in various fields. Similarly, Shade Protocol embodies a commitment to innovation and progress within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, mirroring the spirit of exploration and discovery that defined ancient Alexandria.</p><p>The city of Alexandria served as a melting pot for ideas and culture. Similarly, Shade Protocol embraces the free market of ideas — aiming to build a global ecosystem where financial autonomy is not just a possibility, but a reality for all. Through its upcoming Alexandria bundle release and beyond, Shade Protocol continues to forge a path towards a more equitable and decentralized future, echoing the legacy of the great civilizations that came before&nbsp;it.</p> Shade Spartan “300” NFT&nbsp;Launch Example NFT<p>The launch of the legendary 300 Spartans is set for May 2024 on Stashh — the whitelist (for a randomized chance to be part of the mint) has begun to be developed.</p><p>Curious on how to join the whitelist? Keep your eyes peeled for the following:</p>  Free badge&nbsp;mints  Social media&nbsp;tasks  Telegram &amp; discord active user account selection  <p>Are you an active community member? Your work shall be noticed,&nbsp;Spartan.</p><blockquote>We believe in protecting “Your Money. Your Data. Your Decisions.”</blockquote><blockquote>Those who hold Shade Spartans are participants in the fight against centralization, censorship, and digital encroachment.</blockquote><blockquote>We are the tip of the spear.<br>We are the protectors of privacy.<br>We are Spartans.</blockquote><blockquote>Don’t give them an&nbsp;inch.</blockquote><p><a href="https://stashh.io/collection/shade-spartans/badges?show_templates=true">Stashh - Where Creators and Collectors Connect</a></p> Syracuse 0.1 — “The Floating&nbsp;City” <p>In addition to regularly scheduled bundle upgrades, Shade Protocol will now be releasing monthly Syracuse upgrades starting with 0.1— these are quality of life changes to the Shade Protocol app, smart contracts, &amp; infrastructure that are outside of the scope of official upgrade&nbsp;bundles.</p><p>The first Syracuse release (0.1) is set for June 2nd,&nbsp;2024.</p> Conclusion <p>In conclusion, the unveiling of Alexandria and the upcoming launch of Shade Spartan NFTs mark significant milestones in Shade Protocol’s journey towards revolutionizing decentralized finance. Inspired by the legacy of ancient Alexandria and the valor of the Spartans, Shade Protocol stands as a beacon of innovation and financial autonomy in the decentralized landscape.</p><p>With its commitment to privacy, ease of use, and continuous improvement through Syracuse upgrades, Shade Protocol is not only shaping the future of DeFi but also empowering individuals to reclaim control over their finances and data.

<p>In today’s episode, Matt Prewitt engages in a thought-provoking dialogue with Tahir Amin, the Co-Founder and CEO of the Initiative for Medicines, Access, and Knowledge (I-MAK). Together, they delve into the history of the patent and trademark systems – flaws and all, especially within the pharmaceutical realm. Tahir, drawing from his experience as a former intellectual property lawyer turned reform advocate, sheds light on how these systems have been manipulated by large corporations to prolong monopolies rather than foster invention. He proposes substantial reforms to address these systemic issues, advocating for a fundamental restructuring of the patent system. This insightful conversation highlights the complexities and challenges within the patent system and the quest for a more just and equitable approach to intellectual property.</p><p>Links &amp; References:&nbsp;</p><p>References:</p>  <a href="https://www.i-mak.org/">I-MAK</a>  <a href="https://www.wto.org/">World Trade Organization (WTO)</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests">"Battle of Seattle" | 1999 Seattle WTO protests</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_patent_law">History of patent law - Wikipedia</a>  <a href="https://lawliberty.org/forum/why-intellectual-property-rights-a-lockean-justification/">Why Intellectual Property Rights?

        <p>This quick guide is meant to help you go over the simple steps to vote on ZenIPs.</p> FAQ <p>1. How much voting power do I have?</p><p>Your voting power is a sum of the following criteria:</p>  $ZEN in your EON wallet.  $ZEN in your linked mainchain wallet.  The total amount of $ZEN that was delegated to forger nodes from your EON Wallet.  <p>Please note that Horizen uses Snapshot for voting. This means that your voting power will be a total of the items above at a specific block height on EON. If token values change after that specified block height it will not be included in your voting power.&nbsp;</p><p>2. How do I link my mainchain wallet to my EON address?&nbsp;</p><p>Being that many users prefer to keep their $ZEN on Horizen’s mainchain we’ve made it possible to vote on proposals while keeping $ZEN on the mainchain. Please use the following guide to link your mainchain and EON addresses: <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address">https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Do I have to do anything if I stake $ZEN to a forger node to vote on proposals?</p><p>No. As long as you are using the same wallet which was used to delegate stake, your voting power will include all $ZEN that is staked to forger nodes.</p> How do I vote on ZenIPs using my staked $ZEN? <p>Voting is done on Snapshot using Horizen EON.&nbsp;</p>    Go to the Horizen Foundation Snapshot page: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth</a>  Make sure to join the Horizen Foundation as a member on Snapshot.&nbsp;    Connect your wallet.  Choose a proposal you would like to vote on.  Read through the proposal and look at the possible voting options.&nbsp;  Select a choice, you will be asked to sign a message with your wallet to vote on the proposal (this does not incur any gas fees).    <p>We look forward to the continuous participation of our community and stay tuned as many exciting things are on the Horizen!</p>

<p>As businesses and organisations continue growing and expanding, prioritising environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly important. One way to do this is by implementing blockchain technology into your business. Let’s dive deeper!</p>



<p></p>



 Why Your Business Should Adopt Blockchain for Environmental Sustainability 



<p>Blockchain is a decentralised digital ledger. Blockchain technology allows for the secure recording and verification of transactions without a central authority. This technology can potentially revolutionise how businesses operate, namely by making them more environmentally friendly. By using blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your business can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future. Outside of the obvious benefits for the environment, it can also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/10/why-corporate-strategies-should-be-focused-on-sustainability/?sh=604551947e9f">help propel your business forward in different ways.</a></p>



<p></p>



 How Blockchain Can Help Your Business Go Green 



<p>Multiple ways exist in which blockchain technology can help your <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">business go green</a>. Summarised below are some of the main ways in which blockchain technology can make an impact:</p>



 
 Tracking and verifying environmentally responsible practices 



 Facilitating the exchange of renewable energy 



 Blockchain-powered waste management systems 



 Creating and managing carbon credits 
 



 Using Blockchain To Track and Verify Environmentally Responsible Practices 



<p>One way that blockchain can help is by enabling the tracking and verification of environmentally responsible practices. For example, by using blockchain technology, a supply chain can track the origin and journey of products, ensuring that they are produced using sustainable methods.</p>



<p>This level of transparency can help consumers make more informed choices about the products they purchase. Moreover, it encourages businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices to maintain their reputation. Additionally, the use of blockchain can help businesses detect and prevent fraud, such as the sale of counterfeit or environmentally damaging products.</p>



<p>In this way, blockchain can help promote environmental responsibility and sustainability within the business community. By enabling more transparent and accountable business practices, blockchain technology can support the development of a more sustainable and environmentally friendly economy.</p>



 Facilitating the Exchange of Renewable Energy Using Blockchain 



<p>Blockchain can also be used to facilitate the exchange of renewable energy. It ensures renewable energy can be tracked, traded, and sold securely and transparently. This can help create a more efficient and reliable renewable energy market, as well as enable individuals and businesses easy access and use renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the use of smart contracts on the blockchain can automate the process of buying and selling renewable energy. This makes it even more convenient and efficient. Overall, the use of blockchain in the renewable energy industry can greatly accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy system that is less reliant on fossil fuels.</p>



 Using Blockchain To Create and Manage Carbon Credits 



<p>Another way in which blockchain technology can help businesses become more environmentally friendly is by enabling the creation and management of carbon credits. Carbon credits are a way for businesses to offset their carbon emissions by supporting renewable energy projects or other initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



Source:<a href="https://www.shell.com/business-customers/trading-and-supply/trading/shell-energy-europe/clean-energy-solutions/voluntary-carbon-credits.html"> Shell </a>



<p>Through blockchain, businesses can create and trade carbon credits transparently and securely. This allows for the efficient and cost-effective management of carbon emissions. It provides businesses with a way to offset their environmental impact. Furthermore, blockchain can help ensure the integrity and verifiability of carbon credits, making it easier for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.</p>



<p>Overall, the use of blockchain for carbon credit management can support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Therefore, it can help businesses reduce/offset their environmental impact.</p>



 Blockchain-Powered Waste Management Systems 



<p>In addition to the previous benefits, blockchain technology can also help improve supply chain efficiency, reducing waste and enabling more transparent and accountable business practices through creating decentralised waste management systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a decentralised waste management system, blockchain can be implemented to track and verify the disposal of waste materials. This can help to ensure that waste is disposed of sustainably and responsibly, reducing the environmental impact of waste. Additionally, one can use blockchain technology to incentivise sustainable waste disposal practices, such as recycling and composting. For example, businesses and individuals could be rewarded with tokens or other digital assets for properly disposing of waste.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the use of blockchain can help to improve the efficiency of waste management systems. By securely and transparently tracking waste materials, blockchain can help to reduce waste and prevent fraud, such as the illegal dumping of waste materials. Thus, aiding in making waste management systems more cost-effective and sustainable.</p>







<p></p>



 Blockchains Do Not Have To Consume Tons of Energy 



<p>But what about the energy consumption of blockchains in general? It is true that many blockchain protocols, such as the one used by the Bitcoin network, rely on energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanisms. This means that validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain requires a large amount of computing power. However, it is important to note that not all blockchain protocols operate this way.</p>



<p>There are also blockchain protocols that use different kinds of consensus mechanisms, such as the delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is much more energy efficient. In a delegated proof-of-stake system, the token holders are constantly voting on “delegates”. The delegates who have the most votes at any certain point in time run the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>As a result, delegated proof-of-stake systems are much more energy-efficient and scalable than proof-of-work systems. They do not require a large amount of computing power to validate transactions. This makes them a more <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">environmentally friendly and viable option for businesses and organisations</a> that want to use public or private blockchains and require high scalability.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Implementing blockchain technology into your enterprise may require significant investment and resources. However, the long-term benefits of environmental sustainability and improved efficiency are well worth the effort. By utilising blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your enterprise can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>Long regarded as an impending black swan, Tether has successfully weathered out the contagion and bank runs caused by Luna’s collapse in the depths of the 2022-2023 bearmarket. Since then, a large portion of Tether’s reserves has been shifted to treasury bills, which are the closest dollar proxy, positioning Tether among the top 20 holders of T-bills, worldwide. However, navigating the Tether FUD was not the first rodeo for Paolo Ardoino, as he has also previously led Bitfinex, which successfully recovered after a $72M hack, back in 2016. The worldwide adoption of USDT, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, serves as a testament to Tether’s commitment to create a product with tangible real-life applications.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Paolo’s background  How Bitfinex succeeded  DEX vs. CEX UX  Entrepreneurship and company culture  Founding Tether and its use cases  Expanding Tether’s cross-chain support  Tether’s reserves and long-term vision  Stablecoin wars: BUSD &amp; USDC  Decentralized stablecoins and bank runs  The potential of diversifying physical backing  Holepunch &amp; Keet - the P2P renaissance  Incentivising P2P interactions  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino">Paolo Ardoino on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/tether_to">Tether on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/bitfinex">Bitfinex on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/holepunch_to">Holepunch on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/keet_io">Keet on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Please tell us a little bit about yourself.</p><p>I’m Cryptosi, from the UK, been in Crypto since 2012 mostly interested in DAOs, Privacy and NFTs. Away from Crypto I’m a huge Arsenal FC fan and enjoy spending endless hours playing video&nbsp;games.</p><p>When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>Got into crypto currency in 2012, came across it while delving into different apps on linux and the power of open source software I was looking into the most popular open source projects and I found Bitcoin as one of them, marrying the power of decentralisation with the importance of money was a no brainer and I was immediately hooked.</p><p>Why the interest in&nbsp;DAOs?</p><p>My interest in DAOs formed after the split of PIVX from Dash, I was sure Dash had come to the right decision by prioritising regulatory fears over privacy, but I was frustrated that none of the coin holders were polled infact there still is not any proper ways to poll stakeholders within a network, I’m fascinated by the concepts and opportunities around finding concensus in private and decentralised networks and applications.</p><p>CryptoSi could you share some insights into how PIVX has embraced the DAO model and how it has impacted the project’s governance and decision-making processes?</p><p>PIVX is unique in that its one of the few DAOs in the industry which is truly DAO led, especially now that there is not 1 recognized CORE team. The DAO is self sufficient and has been funding it’s own development for years. There have been some amazing progressions within the DAO itself such as the alliances protocol which remains the only Decentralised partnerships protocol in the world. There is still plenty of work to be done improving the voting model, factors such as one coin one vote and masternode only voting need to be addressed.</p><p>What are some notable features or characteristics of PIVX as a DAO that sets it apart from other cryptocurrency projects?</p><p>The main notable characteristic is the community, as the coin is so well aged the community all have plenty of experience working within a DAO, this means that drama around proposals is thinning out and people are finding ways to identify their common interests and overcome their differences, this is also allowing people who wouldnt usually be found in cutting edge tech startups to thrive, regardless of nationality, age or political leaning, everyone is seemingly gettin a fair crack of the whip within&nbsp;pivx.</p><p>How has PIVX leveraged the DAO structure to foster community involvement and ownership?</p><p>PIVX uses the DAO structure to incentivise engagement from various corners of the globe by funding marketing initiatives and tutorials by people from all over the world, in the past PIVX had a huge translations team and ambassador program which was very successful in fostering grass roots engagement and getting people to bring PIVX into their local communities, this is super evident within the Latam and portuguese communities.</p><p>Given your respective interests and expertise in blockchain, decentralization, and governance, what initially sparked your interest in DAOs and why do you believe they hold significant importance in the evolution of the crypto industry and&nbsp;beyond?</p><p>DAOs are the best way to harness the collective experience and intelligence of the community or the crowd, but also and possibly more importantly they allow a clean and open way to identify stars and mavericks and promote them to powerful positions within the organisation regardless of their so-called ‘experience’, ‘professionalism’ and sometimes purely on their&nbsp;merit.</p><p>Many thanks to Cryptosi for sitting down with leacymck for this interview.</p><p>To learn more about Cryptosi, an awesome former member of PIVX, founder of Bidify.org and co-founder of Smartreach1, please find him on Twitter at Crypto_SI</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-cryptosi-dao-specialist-da11bffa3188">PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on Cryptosi, DAO Specialist.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>Improvement proposals are made to enhance an existing process, address a challenge, or create a new product or service. Their only goal is improvement. At Horizen we call them ZenIPs or EONIPs, depending on the blockchain to which they pertain. Since September 2023, they are voted on by the community</p>



 From improvement proposals to DAOs 



<p>Improvement proposals can be submitted by anyone in the community: team members, users, or community participants.</p>



<p>Improvement proposals have been part of Horizen’s governance since the project’s inception, but with the launch of Horizen DAO in 2023, public voting on ZenIPs afforded greater community participation in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This ZenIP process embodies to the spirit of decentralized governance – anyone in the community can submit a proposal, and proposals require sufficient support from the community to be adopted.</p>



<p>However, it is incumbent upon community members to ensure that they have understand the improvement proposal process to wield this power responsibly. This article aims to help everyone understand that process.</p>



 Take part in Horizen 



<p>You have many ways to be included in the Horizen ecosystem. By deploying on <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/">EON</a>, deploying on <a href="https://www.horizen.io/zendoo/">Zendoo</a>, marking PRs on <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial">Github</a>, hosting a <a href="https://www.horizen.io/supernodes/">Super Node</a>, hosting or delegating a <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/staking/run_a_forger_node/">Forger Node</a>, etc.</p>



<p>You can also submit proposals, and vote on proposals already submitted. First, let’s see what you need to do to make a proposal.</p>



<p>The whole process is exhaustively published on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance">Horizen’s docs website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2 kinds of proposals can be made:</p>



 
 Technical ZenIP/EONIP 



 Non-techinal ZenIP/EONIP 
 



<p>Technical proposals cover changes involving core technology or the governance of the Horizen DAO, and as such have higher thresholds for submitting proposals and achieving a vote quorum. Non-technical proposals cover everything else, such as grants or making agreements with third-party service providers.</p>



<p>The Horizen Foundation and its partners, such as Horizen Labs, can help build and scope the proposals but don’t need to develop the ideas themselves. If you are proposing a technical ZenIP, make sure you can develop the idea or have it developed after scoping the work.<br>Since <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42401-updating-proposal-and-quorum-thresholds/440?u=manon">ZenIP 42401</a> passed in March 2024, the threshold and quorum are determined as the following:</p>



TypeThreshold (to post)Quorum (vote to pass)ExamplesTechnical100,000 ZEN&nbsp;<br>(previously 200,000)5%<br>(previously 10%)Removal of privacy, mainchain and sidechains improvementsNon-technical25,000 ZEN<br>(previously 100,000)3%<br>(previously 5%)Website branding, next meetups location, grant program



<p></p>



 What are the different phases from the idea to its implementation? 



<p></p>







<p>Phase 1: Proposal Idea and Research</p>



<p>Broadly speaking, the idea stage is intended to introduce an idea for a potential improvement proposal and gauge community sentiment. The idea stage is made of the first three phases of the ZenIP process.</p>



<p>In the first phase, a community member who has an idea for an improvement proposal should research it and verify whether the concept or similar proposals have previously been explored or suggested.</p>



<p>This phase places the onus entirely on the proposer(s). It is strongly advised to support the proposal with relevant sources whenever possible thoroughly.</p>



<p>Phase 2: Idea Modification</p>



<p>Once a proposer has confirmed that the idea has not been proposed and has completed sufficient research, they publish an idea on <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/c/governance/zenip-discussion/6">Discourse</a>. We recommend using the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_template.md">ZenIP/EONIP template</a> for this phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phase 3: Community Feedback</p>



<p>Once an idea is posted on Discourse, the community provides feedback.&nbsp; This phase lasts a minimum of 7 days to ensure sufficient input from other community members. It is important to note that a ZenIP idea is just that – an idea – until put forth as a formal ZenIP.</p>



<p>Phase 4: Proposal Draft Creation</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_template.md">template</a>, the idea must be posted on Github or under the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/c/governance/8">“governance” section on Discourse</a>. In this phase the use of the template is mandatory. The proposal is on the DRAFT status.</p>



<p>Phase 5: Draft Review and Moderator Feedback</p>



<p>The person or people making the proposal have 30 days to answer any moderator’s questions, if any. This delay can be shortened by the moderators.</p>



<p>Phase 6: Administrative Review</p>



<p>The <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-dao-voting-is-open-and-announces-inaugural-special-council-members/">Special Council</a> reviews the proposal, with a maximum of 3 revisions. The DAO Special Council can ask for more clarifications or additional information.</p>



<p>Phase 7: Voting</p>



<p>The vote takes place on <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a>, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting platform. You’ll need to follow up on the <a href="https://01470710.evm-documentation.pages.dev/governance/overview/constitution">threshold requirements</a> to post the proposal. The status is moved to PROPOSED.</p>



<p>Phase 8: Cooldown Period</p>



<p>A final 30 days phase commences. The proposal undergoes another review to confirm compliance with the Foundation’s Governing Documents and relevant laws.</p>



<p>Phase 9: Implementation</p>



<p>The idea becomes real. If the technical ZenIP/EONIP includes codes implemented on Github, the PR is merged. If the proposal is budget-related, the necessary funds are transferred. Status is either IMPLEMENTED or FINAL if the idea is also activated on the network.</p>



<p>Foundation moderators or DAO members must remain informed and involved throughout.</p>



<p>It’s possible to delegate voting power on Snapshot, when you publish the ZenIP IDEA or DRAFT, you can create a second topic to ask for delegated funds to post the proposal.</p>



 ZenIP naming convention 



<p>The revised ZenIP numbering conventions will use a format starting with “424” followed by two unique, sequential digits. Once the number 42499 is reached, the numbering will continue starting from 42500 onwards. This system ensures a cohesive and orderly sequence for all ZenIPs, maintaining a straightforward approach to their identification and categorization.</p>



<p>For the previous ZenIPs, editors used the following conventions when numbering ZenIPs:</p>



 
 All ZenIP numbers are prefixed with a 42 and followed by three digits. E.g. his very first ZenIP has the number 42000. 



 If a ZenIP directly corresponds to a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) or ZIP (Zcash Improvement Proposal), the same number is used, but without the prefix “42”. 



 Process and Informational ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42000 to 42199. 



 Consensus ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42200 to 42399. 



 Standard Track ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42400 to 42599. 



 ZenIPs that should or will be deployed together will be numbered consecutively (wherever possible), and in a coherent reading order. 
 



<p>These conventions are subject to change by a majority decision of the Editors.</p>



 Express yourself through the vote 



<p>Your vote will be weighted regarding the tokens you hold on the Horizen mainchain (the historic one) and/or the Horizen EON chain (the EVM chain).</p>



<p>The vote happens on Snapshot and is done through MetaMask and therefore via the Horizen EON network.</p>



<p>Before going through the tutorial, we assume that the Horizen EON network is well configured on your MetaMask wallet. If not, <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">please follow this guide</a>.</p>



<p>If you already linked your address for a previous vote, then it’s very simple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We still advise you to verify if your mainchain address is well-linked on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance app</a>.</p>



<p>If your address is not linked, <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-improvement-proposals-how-to-vote-tutorial/">follow the tutorial here</a>.</p>



<p>When linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.castelion.com/">Castelion</a> is a defense manufacturing company building the systems America and its partners need to keep liberal democracies safe and deter future wars. The company’s first product is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) for the US Department of Defense. Traditional defense primes such as Lockheed &amp; Raytheon have failed to develop an HGV despite receiving billions of dollars per year in funding for the last 20 years. Meanwhile, China &amp; Russia have developed fully operational HGVs, emboldening them to expand their borders militarily.</p><blockquote>“To counter this growing threat, and to support democracy for generations to come, America’s defense industry needs new technologies, new manufacturing approaches, and new ideas to stay unequivocally ahead. That’s why we founded Castelion — a new kind of defense manufacturing company.”</blockquote><p>The Castelion team comes from SpaceX, where they made substantial contributions, including leading the development of Starlink &amp; Starshield, and billions of dollars in sales to governments.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Incumbent defense primes will be unable to attract the necessary talent to iterate fast enough to keep up with adversary nations on hypersonic glide vehicles. The SpaceX approach provides the best odds of liberal democracies catching up technologically while also providing venture-scale returns.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>As this week wraps up, we’re excited to share our latest news. This week’s update covers the latest updates regarding our ecosystem and testnet development.</p> Ecosystem updates  Alpha Protection Through Privacy: A Web3 privacy primitive for DeFi <p>Did you miss Panther Co-Founder and CEO Oliver Gale’s presentation at last week’s ETHDam conference? Don’t worry, we have you covered. Read our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/alpha-protection-through-privacy-a-web3-privacy-primitive-for-defi/">latest blog</a> for a recap.&nbsp;</p> Panther’s CTO, Anish Mohammed, on Proof of Podcast <p>This week, our Co-Founder and CTO, Anish Mohammed, joined Hake from the <a href="https://twitter.com/ProofOf_Podcast/status/1780734964742390235?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Proof of Podcast </a>to discuss tokenomics design and cryptography.</p> Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, at ETH Dam <p>Our Co-Founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, was on the stage at Crypto Canal’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP6LxjQxdIo&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ETHDam</a> on April 13 to share his insights on alpha protection through privacy for DeFi users.</p> Product updates.  Testnet re-deployment on Ethereum Sepolia <p>As the Mumbai testnet has ceased operations, Panther will deploy the testnet to Ethereum Sepolia network next week. We will publish more details on how to test and receive test rewards on Sepolia in our docs next week.&nbsp;</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management and basic disclosures. Development for Stage 6 is complete and currently under testing. The team plans to release Stage 6 for community testing later this month.&nbsp;</p> Stage 7 development <p>Stage 7 of the testnet dApp includes DeFi swaps, advanced disclosures, other supported assets, and canary deployment (use of real tokens). The team is working on Stage 7 parallel to Stage 6 and Enhancement Stage 2. We are working on UI/UX development and integration with different DeFi tools, including Uniswap, and expects to release Stage 7 for community testing in the first week of May.</p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>Did you miss Panther co-founder and CEO Oliver Gale’s presentation at last week’s ETHDam conference? Don’t worry, we have you covered.&nbsp;</p><p>The session, “Alpha Protection Through Privacy: A Web3 privacy primitive for DeFi,” explored the $2.6T problem of open blockchain privacy and Panther Protocol’s solution. A recap of the presentation follows.&nbsp;</p> Pseudonymity: A $2.6 trillion problem <p>Open ledgers are supposed to be a good thing. They help to ensure that users can’t commit fraud, prevent duplicate transactions, and more. All of these things are true and important, but until now, they have come at the expense of another basic human need: privacy. On pseudonymous blockchains, if a third party can link a wallet address to a user, they can follow, measure, and use the complete transaction history associated with that wallet address. Every transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>This is wrong. Although we recognize blockchain technology’s enormous benefits, financial privacy should be a fundamental human right.&nbsp;</p><p>And it’s a huge problem. Of the approximately $2.6 trillion invested in crypto, all but a relatively tiny amount is on public blockchains.&nbsp;</p> Your Data is YOUR Data <p>The problem with pseudonymous blockchains goes beyond third parties monitoring your spending habits: your data is valuable– and it should be YOUR data. Europe’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> reflects a broader shift in how we perceive ownership of information. Just as it set a benchmark for consumer privacy and control, DeFi users should have ownership of their data both as a personal matter and because there is value in your data.&nbsp;</p><p>This is especially true for high-volume traders and institutions, who risk having others copy their trades, their “alpha,” and their strategy.&nbsp;</p> The “solution” created a new problem. <p>The reaction to this problem to date has been the creation of privacy protocols, which sever the link between wallet and on-chain public ledger, using a variety of technologies. Unfortunately, this causes a new problem: compliance hurdles. Tornado Cash is a prototypical example of how severing the link between the public chain and wallet alone is not a viable solution to privacy. Tornado Cash has been accused of facilitating money laundering and sanctioned by the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">U.S. Treasury</a>, among actions from other regulators. If DeFi is going to welcome a new era of mainstream adoption, it is clear that privacy protocols also need to enable compliance. In fact, regulators, including the U.S. Treasury have specifically <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">called this out as a market need</a>.&nbsp;</p> Market requirements for any solution <p>Greenfield Capital’s <a href="https://greenfield.xyz/2023/11/22/reviving-transaction-privacy/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Report on Reviving Transaction Privacy: Approaches To Combat Compliance And Usage Challenges</a> covers this exact issue. In the report, they recognize the enormous potential of removing a major obstacle to mainstream DeFi adoption by enabling compliance and privacy simultaneously. They state that any such solution would need to keep bad actors from abusing the system, especially through KYC, and that it would need to navigate regulatory ambiguity, given that regulatory requirements may vary from one jurisdiction to another, giving the Travel Rule as an example. The Travel Rule is a regulatory mandate by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization formed by the G7 to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, which requires cryptocurrency exchanges and other virtual asset service providers to share specific transaction details of the parties involved in transfers​.</p><p>Greenfield also points out that success for any protocol hinges on:&nbsp;</p>  Providing sufficient value relative to any fees associated with its use (keeping gas relatively low).  Ensuring there is a large enough anonymity set to keep transactions private.  Integration with existing DeFi protocols: Users are unlikely to use protocols that don’t enable use across the most popular tokens and chains.&nbsp;   Enter Panther Protocol <p>Panther Protocol will add a privacy layer to blockchain transactions and DeFi applications. Using advanced cryptographic techniques, including zkSNARKs, the protocol will provide users with the ability to preserve their privacy while also enabling them to disclose data to whoever they choose. Flagship features include:&nbsp;</p>  Preservation of privacy: Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a> technology will help to preserve your privacy by separating your transactions from the public ledger, safeguarding your identity.&nbsp;  Control over your data: Enable KYC validations without exposing your personal details. Our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-example-explaining-zkps/">Zero-Knowledge proof</a>-based technology will let you choose exactly who can see your identity and transaction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Panther’s DeFi adapters will facilitate seamless integration with existing DeFi protocols, ensuring privacy without sacrificing functionality and allowing users to engage with DeFi platforms while keeping their transactions private.  Decentralized Identity: Your zAccount will act as a decentralized ID that helps safeguard your personal details, allowing you to make crypto transactions while protecting your identity.  Modular and expandable: Zones will offer customization for asset lists, user lists, transaction limits, and DeFi application access.  <p>For more detailed information about Panther Protocol, please click <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-panther-protocol-and-why-it-exists-a3fd4470de55/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Competitive Landscape <p>Greenfield identifies 11 elements that can enable the solution to the issue of privacy in blockchain. Panther’s model includes all of these, with the exception of compliance committees, which is by design and not necessary for Panther’s privacy preservation and compliance enablement.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther is also one of only two projects in Greenfield’s report that includes KYC in its model, which is a requirement in nearly every major jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p> How to get involved <p>If you are interested in helping Panther usher in a new era of DeFi adoption where your right to privacy is respected, we would love you to join us:&nbsp;</p>  Have coding skills?

Thematic Tease<p>Greetings community,</p><p>On May 1st, we will begin to reveal an internal initiative, story, and brand that outlines the future of Shade Protocol. The first two years of Shade Protocol was sharply focused on building the key building blocks for unstoppable finance — a world of decentralized money and products that help people reclaim their autonomy &amp; digital sovereignty.</p><p>The road has been&nbsp;arduous.</p><p>In early 2024 we collectively had a chance to take a deep breathe and reflect. We considered what has been built, how it was built, and why it was built. We’ve built the following primitives:</p>  SILK (unstoppable private stablecoin tracking a basket of currencies &amp; commodities)  ShadeSwap (DEX that protects your&nbsp;privacy)  ShadeLend (private collateralized positions)  Bridge (onboard &amp; wrap public assets into private&nbsp;assets)  Staking (passively earn real yield for securing Shade Protocol)  Bonds (protocol treasury management tool)  Transaction History (examine your private transactions)  <p>A deep analysis left us dissatisfied. This is an absurd amount of product; what is stopping growth? What is disabling our ability to onboard millions into true unstoppable finance?</p><a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-a-helmet-and-a-bulletriddled-plane-perfectly-demonstrates-survivor-bias-60930">https://www.iflscience.com/how-a-helmet-and-a-bulletriddled-plane-perfectly-demonstrates-survivor-bias-60930</a><p>Enter survivorship bias.</p><p>You see, we started noticing a trend — thousands of new users were interacting or checking on Shade Protocol for the first time that never came&nbsp;back.</p><p>It was troubling.</p><p>The brand penetration of Shade Protocol is consistently generating new users, which considering our size is somewhat remarkable. However, when users actually landed on the product suite and tried to start using it we began to uncover a common&nbsp;trend:</p><blockquote>Shade Protocol is too hard to&nbsp;use.</blockquote><p>The core contributors began to talk to users. Hop on calls. We gathered the harshest feedback from the fiercest critics. It gave us the realization that if we continue down the path of building more and more complexity into the product suite, it will go unused. The beautiful, innovative pieces of the DeFi puzzle that have set the stage so well would slowly be wiped off the table of the Free&nbsp;Market.</p><p>Utility without simplicity is unused&nbsp;utility.</p><p>At it’s worst, complex utility is a repellent.</p><p>Naturally, the current users are okay with the user experience. If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be here continuing to use the app. This consumer survivorship bias has perhaps blinded us to the truth of the quality of what we have&nbsp;built.</p><p>Await our next blog post on May 1st, where we reveal the next stage of Shade Protocol’s evolution — a quest for simplicity that will redefine unstoppable finance, expanding its reach in ways yet&nbsp;unseen.</p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">https://t.me/ShadeProtocol</a></p>

Casey is the creator of the Ordinals Protocol, a harmless protocol that simply allowed for arbitrary data to be inscribed into individual Bitcoin UTXOs, creating what are called Bitcoin NFTs. He is now also the creators of Runes, a second protocol, working to bring fungible tokens to Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bitcoin is changing and Casey appears to be one of main reasons for the change. Soon he’ll be unveiling a new protocol standard for Bitcoin - called Runes, which wants to be a bitcoin-native version of fungible tokens, on the Bitcoin L1 - which is going to be the topic of the show today.</p> <p>------ 📣 PERMISSIONLESS III | BUY TICKETS NOW&nbsp; Bankless Citizens get 30% off: <a href="https://www.bankless.com/tools/perks">https://www.bankless.com/tools/perks</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Use BANKLESS10 for 10% off: <a href="https://bankless.cc/PermissionlessIII">https://bankless.cc/PermissionlessIII</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE <a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; ⁠&nbsp;</p> <p>🔗CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🔐 SAFE | ATTEND SAFE{CON} <a href="https://bankless.cc/SafeCon">https://bankless.cc/SafeCon</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> &nbsp;</p> <p>🛞MANTLE | MODULAR LAYER 2 NETWORK <a href="https://bankless.cc/Mantle">https://bankless.cc/Mantle</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/toku">https://bankless.cc/toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 5:00 The Guy Who Changed Bitcoin 10:21 Why Casey’s Building 16:45 Ordinals Cultural Shift 22:43 Runes 31:40 The Ord Standard&nbsp; 45:27 Bitcoin Blocks &amp; Blockspace Limit 57:47 Bitcoin Innovation Implications&nbsp; 1:02:41 Rune Parameters 1:11:20 The First Runes (Uncommon Goods)&nbsp; 1:14:34 Timeline on Runes &amp; Trading Ecosystem 1:17:12 The Future of Runes/Ordinals 1:19:48 The Bitcoin Renaissance&nbsp; 1:21:34 Winning Over Bitcoin Maximalists 1:23:45 Casey’s Podcast &nbsp; &nbsp; 1:24:58 Runes Team 1:26:37 Closing &amp; Disclaimers&nbsp; &nbsp; ------ RESOURCES</p> <p>Casey’s 1st Bankless Episode&nbsp; <a href="https://youtu.be/ktL77zEWcEc">https://youtu.be/ktL77zEWcEc</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Casey’s Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/rodarmor">https://twitter.com/rodarmor</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Casey’s Hellmoney Podcast&nbsp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCflejnUswWof6yEMk9dRzOA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCflejnUswWof6yEMk9dRzOA</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Not financial or tax advice.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.6.1. This release adds an OpenAPI specification for Zebra’s RPC methods and improves the startup and shutdown logs with information about Zebra’s storage usage and other useful database information, such as column family sizes in a human readable format.</p>



<p>With this release we have made some improvements to the getblock RPC method in response to user feedback as well as taking the opportunity to improve its performance. We have also fixed a bug that caused hangs in the zebra-scan service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This release also includes some of the necessary changes to enable regtest network mode in zebra although this is still a work in progress. Our thanks go out to Zingo Labs for their contributions to this feature.</p>



<p>We have also updated our CI to use the official lightwalletd image, instead of the fork that we were using previously.</p>

<p>Answer with AI is the only large real-time answer engine that puts privacy first and does not rely on Big Tech search engines</p>
<p>Today, Brave is announcing a major update to Brave Search and to how users find answers online. The new Brave Search answer engine synthesizes information from multiple sources into a single, intelligible answer to almost any query—a significant step forward from Brave’s <a>AI Summarizer released in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave Search Answer with AI is unique in several respects:</p>
 
 It is the first privacy-preserving answer engine available at scale, serving the almost 10 billion queries a year that Brave Search currently receives, making it, overnight, one of the largest AI solutions on the market.&nbsp; 
 It produces near instant answers (with sources cited) with sources alongside traditional search results. 
 The answers result from the only independent search index at scale outside of Big Tech, as the largest real-time answer engines rely on the Google or Bing search engines, directly or indirectly.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Brave Search’s Answer with AI feature is available for free to all users across platforms, on both desktop and mobile. No matter which browser users choose, it can be accessed on the Web at <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a>. The answer engine also supports multiple languages besides English. Brave Search’s 27 million queries a day makes it the fastest growing search engine since Bing.&nbsp;</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Clicking the Answer with AI button</p>

 The need for answer engines 
<p>Web-scale search engines have undergone many iterations: directory listings, ten blue links, query-dependent snippets, knowledge graphs and featured snippets. The Brave Search Answer with AI feature evolves this paradigm. An answer engine is a system that tries to answer a question, rather than point to websites about the question. Thanks to the proliferation and quality of <a>large language models</a> (LLMs), search-integrated answer engines are now a possibility at scale. In fact, several companies that operate search engines have released similar systems (including Bing Copilot and Google Gemini). Other answer engines rely on API access to existing search solutions to serve at least some portion of their real-time results.</p>
<p><a>Brave Search released an AI tool for synthesized results</a> known as the Summarizer in March 2023 to help users better navigate search results. With today’s release, we’re taking a big step forward in delivering a next-level search experience, whether an answer or links of page results.</p>
<p>“With the new Brave Search and its integration of Answer with AI, users get the best of both worlds: one place to get generative answers as well as up-to-date links, providing instant and highly relevant results,” said Josep M. Pujol, Chief of Search at Brave. “Brave Search is uniquely positioned in this landscape, with the only independent search index besides Bing and Google. Unlike many search companies that are forced to rely on results from third parties, or others that solely offer answer engines, Brave now combines its index with AI to redefine the search experience and raise the bar on immediate pertinence in results, while preserving users’ privacy.”</p>

                <p>[00:00:00] Luke: From privacy concerns to limitless potential, AI is rapidly impacting our evolving society. In this new season of the Brave Technologist podcast, we’re demystifying artificial intelligence, challenging the status quo, and empowering everyday people to embrace the digital revolution. I’m your host Luke Mulks, VP of Business Operations at Brave Software.</p>
<p>Makers of the privacy respecting Brave browser and search engine, now powering AI with the Brave Search API. You’re listening to a new episode of The Brave Technologist, and this one features two guests from the Brave team, Josep, our lead at Brave Search, and Remi, the principal engineer at Brave. They joined us on the podcast this week to discuss our Answer with AI launch, which shipped a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Today we dove into how Answer with AI is different from other chatbots, what this innovation means for traditional search, Our privacy policy with this engine, how we’re handling hallucinations. And what the main challenges have been in building this new system. These were the perfect guests to discuss this.</p>
<p>Joseph is the chief of search at Brave and has been working on an alternative search engine since 2014. Before being involved with search, he was a research scientist at multiple institutions, working on AI, distributed systems. And complex networks. He has authored over 30 papers and holds four patents.</p>
<p>He also holds a Ph. D. in A. I. from the Technical University of Catalonia. Remi has been working with A. I. since 2014 and currently as a Senior Software Engineer at BraveSearch, where he has been involved in scaling the ML infrastructure to serve continuously growing traffic and increasingly advanced needs, as well as in the development of BraveSearch’s latest feature, Answer with A.</p>
<p>I. We’re excited to share this update with you and why we’re so optimistic about it. Now for this week’s episode of the Brave Technologist. Remi and Joseph, welcome to the Brave Technologists podcast. How are you guys doing today? Good, good. Very well. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks for having us. Yeah, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Excited to have you back, Joseph and Remi. Excited to have you here for the first time. I think a lot of what we’re talking about today is around this kind of new answer with AI summarizer feature that we just recently released. Remi, how is different from the typical chatbot like chatGPT or, Cloud?</p>
<p>[00:02:11] Remi: Yeah, great question. I think people sometimes kind of oppose them. I think, I mean, my opinion, our opinion is more complimentary. So if you take, you know, chat GPT or cloud, their goal is to build the best model for open ended conversation, you know, like, you know, having multiple rounds with a user on any, topic really.</p>
<p>One issue is that is often the lack of context, right? So like the only context they get is what the user gives them. And then they use the knowledge they have acquired during training to come up with answers, right? I like to think of them sometimes how they are called as foundational models. And I like this term because This is what we are doing.</p>
<p>We are building on top of this model. So they are kind of complimentary to what we do. And with answer with AI, basically what we do is like, we give access to this model, an entire independent search index, which is the brave search index, right? So they have quote unquote, perfect context in a way, right?</p>
<p>So for any user query, they are going to have access to the best information we can find on the web out of billions of pages. And we are going to synthesize this into, you know, the best answer we can, right? Okay. One, maybe like drawback with this approach is it’s off by design, a bit less interactive. So once you have your answer, you are a bit less free in the way that you can follow up.</p>
<p>You know, you cannot just start a conversation and it’s why, I mean, we’re going to talk, I think a bit later about that, but that’s why we’re working on integrating Leo so that we can offer, you know, both experiences, both like best answers, based on the web web, and then also following up in arbitrary ways and, you know, back and forth conversation ways of chatbots.</p>
<p>[00:03:45] Luke: No, it’s great. That’s awesome. And I think Joseph, when we had you here last, I think the summarizer, the first iteration of it had been out for a little bit. We’ve kind of addressed this question too, but I’m just kind of curious, like, as this new update rolls out and continue to see progress on the summarizer stuff, like, how’s your position changed?</p>
<p>Like, you think that, you know, answer engines are going to end up replacing traditional search or, Augmented or end of an era kind of thing, or what was your take on this?</p>
<p>[00:04:09] Josep: I get this question quite a lot. Well, I mean, first disclaimer, I mean, I’m better at predicting the past than the future.</p>
<p>It depends what you mean by replacement, right? Certainly answer engines are here to stay. They will constitute an evolution to search engines. That’s the fact. Are they going to replace them entirely? No, I don’t think so, right? For, like, for many reasons. some, right? First of all, I mean, not all the queries are amenable.</p>
<p>to be answered by an article type answer. We actually know from experience because of Summarizer v1, which was the toned down version of what we just released, the answers with AI, that was released more than a year ago. So we got a lot of data. And we estimate the queries that are amenable to be answered by answers with AI to be between a fourth and a third of the total queries.</p>
<p>So that means that you still have two thirds that are not, what are those two thirds, right? I mean, I don’t know, Bank of America login, NumPy download, Hotmail, the phone of a restaurant. I mean, can they be answered by an answer? Yes, but it’s not the most convenient way. To do it right, in a way, that’s why I don’t believe that answer engines are replacement and your answer engines are just like one extra thing that certain engines will have, right?</p>
<p>The same as feature the snippets or the same as knowledge graphs, right? I mean, and answer engines actually totally subsumed those two, right? But it will not subsume the 10 links and actually it shouldn’t, hopefully, right, because answers are very good, are very convenient, convenience have, have drawbacks, right?</p>
<p>Less choice, less sources of truth. So you don’t, you don’t want an article type answer. At least, that’s what I believe. And in any case, that’s what we experienced and, and that’s, I think that’s gonna be like this for a long time. Also in, and if you actually go more into the technical details, right? I mean, an answer engine needs a search engine nevertheless, right?</p>
<p>Because why are you going to pull the data from my knowledge on the LLMs? I mean, only has training data. So you need a lot of like context. To the rack generation, right? Who is the best search engine to get that context in, but you need to do things like grounding, provide citations. So you need to search engine, right?</p>
<p>Even if if everything was answers, you will just need a search engine. Or an a p to a search engine, right? Which is like the typical, the typical case. And then just lemme elaborate a little bit on, on those two. Yeah, please do. I mean, more like on the, on the strategy of what we want to do at Brave, right?</p>
<p>Just to have answers would not be actually on the best internet of the user in our opinion. Right? Because what we want to do is like an alternative to the big tech, right? So we need to do like a, to provide the same technology and the same specify the same user needs. It wouldn’t be optimal for the user to have, like, this dichotomy where they have to do certain type of queries.</p>
<p>It’s better one system, certain type of queries is better another system, right? People love convenience. When people search, they are not something that they do it for fun. Usually search is because you are doing a task. So you don’t want to do crazy experiments. Your need satisfied as soon as possible, right?</p>
<p>Regardless of the delivery methods, right? So we need to be like, we need to be one stop shop. Unless we are one stop shop, well, we cannot be the default, right? And we all know that the defaults are very important, right? I mean, there is a reason why Google pays 20 billion to Apple every year, just to be the default on Apple devices, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it’s like, so No, I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p>[00:08:04] Luke: It is kind of a silly question too, right? Because I think one of the strengths of, of what we’ve been doing at Brave, that you guys have put a lot of care into, even with the first version of Summarizer, like making sure that things were, the citations were there and linkable and that, you know, and even with this new version, the blue links are there, right underneath, you guys are giving them for the full, like corpus of information they need.</p>
<p>From that summary. And I think that it’s really kind of a cool way that you guys are doing it, where you’ve mixed these two things together, where, when they serve, but I think even to unpack that a little bit, the fact that you all put so much care into just knowing what’s addressable by an answer versus what’s just a great thing to put us a search engine result page in front of, right?</p>
<p>Like, I think that’s even something that, you know, a level of thought that’s going into this that I think a lot of other companies probably wouldn’t apply because we’re thinking about the user like that.</p>
<p>[00:08:52] Josep: That’s a good point. I mean, we, one of the most challenging tasks is like the triggering, right? Like one, two, one, two, like do normal search and one to do like a answer type search, right?</p>
<p>And tell you, of course the user still is on control, but it’s always like a button. And then next to the query box where you can invoke the summarizer. But we try like to, you know, I try to double guess, well, to guess what is their real intent as much as possible again, like, because when I stop shop, satisfy, maximize this satisfaction, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So that’s kind of like, that’s one of the things and something I forgot to mention, which is like, it’s not only that, but for me, it would be better to talk about this, but I’ll do it anyway. I think the normal results on the bottom. We actually put a lot of emphasis on expanding beyond the wall of text.</p>
<p>People have noticed that we actually named entities and we add the structure of information into the generated answer just to understand. You know, like to be more like a friendly to the, not an eye candy, but actually like more like an informational value, right? I mean, that’s kind of like a important thing.</p>
<p>Like take for instance, like a phone number, right? When you don’t want to fish for a phone number on a wall of text, you want to know where it is. And just like, look there.</p>
<p>[00:10:10] Luke: I’ve got a great anecdote on that one too. I, it’s my go to in, business calls. I do now where, I have a feeling the person on the other end is a golfer because actually it was, look, I have these old golf clubs from like 2007.</p>
<p>And if anybody golfs, like when you’re putting a set together, you end up diving into these older sites where you’re like, I hope somebody put it in a HTML table of all of these, like, you know, different lofts and clubs. I actually like. Put it into the answer engine and just put everything in a beautiful table right there.</p>
<p>I knew all the lock degrees, all the club links, everything like that. So now it’s been kind of my go to because not only does it give me what I want, it cut probably three or four steps out of my journey of like digging up these specs and, and, and looking at it again. And I can just easily kind of share it with people.</p>
<p>So it’s super useful, like</p>
<p>[00:10:52] Josep: it’s very useful. And that’s why, like, it would be pretty short sighted not to provide answers. Right. Even with some of the drawbacks that they, they can cost, right? Like, minimize choice, narrow down, narrow down the ability for people to see other sites than, than the one that you’re providing.</p>
<p>I mean, those like things are, are important, but convenience. It’s like, you cannot fight the times.</p>
<p>[00:11:16] Remi: I love what you say about like, picking the right format of answer for any query, because in a way, like, if you forget about answer with AI, it’s what we’ve done since the beginning. You know, like, for some queries, you want a sport widget, sometimes you want a weather widget, sometimes you want, you know, something else, and answer with AI is just a continuation of that on more types of queries, where we can say, okay, for that particular query, it’s the best way to answer the user, right?</p>
<p>[00:11:41] Luke: It sounds like there’s probably opportunities too for, for some of these areas of concerns to kind of evolve and kind of upgrade with some of these things too, right? I mean, I’m sure that like people are concerned about, Oh, well, you know, it seems like nobody’s really monetizing the AI side other than doing premium and other things either, but it seems like a pretty greenfield there.</p>
<p>And when I see these things, I’m like, wow, there’s just like, this is a whole new level of interesting, useful things that users can benefit from that, you know, it’s just opening the doors to, which I think is super cool. Yeah. Joseph, you’re combining this AIML kind of SERP approach. You kind of touched on it, how giving the answer can be beneficial for users, but is there any other elaboration you want to break down on how like unique this is compared to what other competitors are doing, especially when it comes to like benefiting user?</p>
<p>[00:12:24] Josep: The main benefit is that, well, it’s like the one of Topshop, right? The ability that the user get the best answer or results, they get the best satisfaction of their query intent. If you want to go technical, you know, in a single place, right? That’s kind of like the main benefit, the integration. However, we must say that anyone can build an answering engine, right?</p>
<p>Actually, there’s plenty of YouTube videos that use Brave Search API, OpenAI. They combine quickly and they create like a complexity clone kind of thing. in, in a matter of a few hours, those things actually work fairly well. So that’s not the, there’s like the meat of the problem is not the, for me, we’ll talk more about that.</p>
<p>Right. But like the complicated thing of an answer engine is not the application in a way it’s like how you scale it and how you do the context creation and how you put the prompt and how you do the grounding, et cetera, et cetera. Right. And all those things. Basically, yeah, we have the same ingredients, right?</p>
<p>Because we do use Brave Search API. One of the things that we are important for people to remember is that Brave Search uses Brave Search API. So we, we, we try to do our own dog food so that we have the best API there is. Well, at least,</p>
<p>[00:13:43] Luke: It’s really interesting too. I mean, I think how does it feel for you guys when you see other people? I guess AI is one of these fields where it’s almost like if somebody can think it, they’re going to make a proof of concept for it, right? Like when you start seeing other people using, whether it’s the API, I saw somebody tweeting about this the other day where they were, you know, kind of leveraging the API, when you start to see people, experimenting with this.</p>
<p>Tech that you guys have built, how is that seeing that in the wild? Is it exciting? Is it something kind of like you hope to see, do you hope to see more people doing that type of thing? No, no, we, we hope to see it. I</p>
<p>[00:14:13] Josep: mean, look at the end of the day, innovation can happen anywhere, right?</p>
<p>There is no prototype that doesn’t have some value, right? And there is no company that doesn’t provide some value. The other thing. Which could be discussed is like why are those things are fundamental and can really affect the ecosystem on the long run to for the benefit of the users, which is one of the brave missions.</p>
<p>Or they’re just like, like, lemme quote, application layer things, right? , well, that can gather a lot of attention, can gather a lot of press, but at the end of the day, they are not, they’re not fundamental, but still, they provide value. We look, we copy, they copy from us. it is like cost evolution at the end on the benefit of the user.</p>
<p>[00:15:00] Luke: And digging into the fundamentals a bit too, Brave’s always big on privacy, right? What’s the privacy approach with the answer engine? How does that kind of compare to what’s out there? Should users be worried of, okay, I start to treat this more like a AI bot, right? Like, and I’m worried about what I’m inputting, you know, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>how, how’s Brave approaching this?</p>
<p>[00:15:18] Josep: For answer with AI, we treat it exactly as a query, which basically means that we do not keep a user history of the queries that the user does to break. So we have actually no technical ability to do a profile of someone. Even the data that we, that we get. We don’t have personal identifiable information, but even the IP gets dropped before it reaches to us, right?</p>
<p>Oh, wow. For, for privacy. So long story short, we have no concept of sessions, history, or anything like this. That’s actually a big departure, right? Because, having user sessions can be beneficial, especially for like, AI tasks, right? Because it’s good to have some context of prior answers, but we, we prefer not to do it because first, You can get almost the same value, if not the same, without the risk that that entails. User profiles are very dangerous, right? I mean, imagine, and companies may have the highest moral standards, no question, right? But if the government were to ask the data, you would be obliged to give it to them, like with a judge involved, right?</p>
<p>But anyway, that data, uh, it’s not to have it, right? So we do not have it. So we actually sleep very well at night, knowing that. If someone gained access to all our data, they would not be able to learn who are the queries of loop. Oh, like what? I love it. You have to, like, yeah. Yeah, I’m too late,</p>
<p>[00:16:52] Luke: asking too many weird things.</p>
<p>No, I think I, you know, but such a cool thing hearing you say that. I mean, you know, like had a search in, in what we’re doing here, because it’s literally the same thing that Brendan said too, from the beginning of the company, right? Like where it’s just, you know, they can’t take what they don’t have.</p>
<p>I think, you know, even more now than ever, people are seeing how their data is being impacted. Just, you know, even by good actors that are not even doing anything necessarily bad, but just the fact that, you know, software things happen and, and, people reach systems, right?</p>
<p>[00:17:20] Josep: Accidents can happen. And also like a good actor today can become a bad actor tomorrow.</p>
<p>this premise on privacy on why privacy is not something that needs to be sacrificed to build good tech. That’s like the DNA of Brave. And that’s actually one of the reasons why Remi and I joined Brave two years ago.</p>
<p>[00:17:38] Luke: Right. I mean, what a journey too. It’s been, I think, you know, just seeing like, I mean, in the past, you know, six months, it’s just been awesome from when we had you here, last time to now.</p>
<p>And, and, you know, hearing Remi talk about this stuff too, it’s, it’s been really cool to like, see just how fast the iterations have been and, how you guys are keeping that ethos alive with what you’re doing. I’m going to ask you guys now too, cause, we talk about this sometimes with, prospects and partners and things like that around how, you know, Brave’s really like the only other, you Independent option out there.</p>
<p>Like, and especially, I mean, for me, it was surprising coming from, you know, the advertising and monetization world before it came to brave, like, I thought that was a small circle of people, but then you start to look at the search world and it’s even smaller, right. We’re talking about using like the in house AML, AI ML and fine tuned LLMs and.</p>
<p>Open source LLMs, like how important is it that Brave is independent when looking at the landscape? And maybe, you guys can give the audience a sense because I have a feeling it’s really not well known just how small of a circle it is out there with indexes and a search out there.</p>
<p>[00:18:38]  Josep: Yeah.</p>
<p>Independence is like a very odd quality, right? Everybody knows what it is, but it’s difficult to actually define. Brave’s mission is to, again, like build, Equal or better technology than big tech without compromising the privacy, right? And you cannot do that without building it period Because like if we’re if brave was using i don’t know google or being api There would be a dependency there where we could be a stronghold If only because companies can can go rogue, but also like terms of service can change So there’s like no real there is no real alternative, right?</p>
<p>So we need to build that is something that not everyone wants to do There are like many people who are, again, like working at the application layer, right? They want to actually build some cool feature or cool product that satisfy the user needs. And that’s totally legit, right? My only wish would be that they would be a little bit more transparent about it, right?</p>
<p>Right. But because in a way, why do you have to be transparent about it? Because basically, like, because users make a choice, right? And when people make a choice, they are giving with their boat, they are giving some value to the choices they make, right? I do believe that people would be actually, would do different choices if they actually knew the whole implications of the things they are doing, right?</p>
<p>Right. They always like, I use this analogy, which is kind of like the, the person like who drives An electric car, but doesn’t care where the electricity comes from. Sure. Yeah. You can drive a lot like your car because it’s nice looking. That’s awesome acceleration, but then don’t claim it’s beer. I mean, but don’t claim it.</p>
<p>That is good for the environment. If you do not care about where the electricity comes from. Right. So do you want choice? Then support brave. If you just want answers. Well, but it has answers too, but other people have answers. No, it’s not, they couldn’t be better or worse. We do believe it’s better. One important thing to build our own is that technology and our own search is that basically we changing the problem.</p>
<p>We can actually change the underlying architecture and the underlying system to provide different types of data that are more relevant to a new feature, right? So if you use an API at the end of the day, you know, like the set of ingredients is fixed. Right. We can make our own ingredients as we move along.</p>
<p>And that’s a fundamental reason why, you know, we can be one step ahead and of course be more sustainable, which is like what matters to us.</p>
<p>[00:21:20] Luke: Yeah. That’s awesome. That was a great way of putting it with the ingredients too. We’ve seen too, I mean, one of those interesting things that think people aren’t really aware of either is just, we have this whole verified creator system with Brave and we even introduced a premium right before we even had monetization on search.</p>
<p>But there’s a real, it seems like there’s a real appetite from people that do know to support solutions that are different and are breaking free. I mean, even the secondary effects of these things, when. Geopolitical things happen and then something, it might impact how results are presented, right?</p>
<p>Because, and it might not even be the impact of directly of the partner, but it’s just some, it’s how something’s working underneath. And we saw some of this too, like with Russia and Ukraine and Dukkako, for example, right? Where it was kind of controversial and they’re kind of, I mean, when you’re married to a partner, you’re married to a partner, so I think it’s a, it’s a really good point, right?</p>
<p>[00:22:07] Josep: It’s not only the, Potential censorship, so things like the terms of service might might change. I mean, the service does not allow to do AI integrations, perhaps some search engines that seem to be lacking on AI features is because of the terms of service. But nobody knows for a fact, right? Because it’s not being publicized in any case, like, but, but bottom line, what is important is like everyone provides some value, right?</p>
<p>Brief. It’s not just to build a product. It’s a product that doesn’t sacrifice privacy and that is from the, that is from the fundamental, right? That is provides an alternative. And right now, if you are in the US, most of the people listening probably are in the US. There’s only three search engines that have their own index, is Google, Microsoft, and Brave.</p>
<p>And the sizes of those three companies are pretty different, right?</p>
<p>[00:23:04] Luke: I mean, that’s something that people don’t realize, I don’t think, is that even when you’re going to other search engines, most of the time they’re just powered by, you know, one of these big companies, right? I think it’s, awesome that you’re putting light to that too.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>[00:23:16] Josep: some of them now, because we have a search API and some of the. Those search engines that they provide some value again. I mean, it’s not, I’m not trying to like talk them down or like think that we are better. No, no. It’s just like, we have a different value of position.</p>
<p>[00:23:30] Luke: Right. Totally. We came into market at a different time too, right.</p>
<p>Where we could, that’s one of the things that I see with ad tech too, where even if people aren’t necessarily malicious, right, like their intentions weren’t bad. It’s just that when tech exponentially. Scales and adoption, right? Sometimes important ethical questions get ignored, but we’ve had this great positions coming in later to where we can kind of, from first principles, really tackle these things that need tackling, which I think is fantastic that you guys are doing, but speaking of which, Remi, like how much traffic is a new answer with the AI system handling?</p>
<p>Are you guys seeing like a lot of use?</p>
<p>[00:24:05] Remi: I mean, what we’ve seen so far is that, you know, we are handling around a hundred requests per second. On this new system, right out of like more than 300 requests per second. So as Joseph said, it’s like around a third of the queries, you know, depending on the language and countries and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But then this hundred requests per second translates into more than 500 concurrent generation sessions because, you know, we get a hundred new requests every second, each of these requests takes a few seconds to generate the answer. Right. So overall the load on the system is much higher. Okay. And if I can maybe just like elaborate on how this is broken down is like, you know, if a user can trigger answer with AI by a press of a button, basically, right?</p>
<p>So like, you could, as a user have answered with AI on any query you make, right? But then what we’ve seen drives the load is basically this automatic triggering mechanism that Josette talked about. Describe where we actually decide we try to find the best, you know, queries for which answer with AI makes sense.</p>
<p>And then we’ve seen that tweaking these heuristics and this decision can increase or decrease the load. And as a matter of fact, because we are now extending this, this triggering mechanism to more queries, it’s increasing over time and we expect it to keep increasing in the coming weeks as we handle more types of queries automatically.</p>
<p>[00:25:22] Luke: And just for folks that are unaware, that might not know what we’re talking about when you’re talking about forcing it to answer with AI, there’s this like a little four diamond icon that’s next to where kind of the magnifying glasses. If you click on that, it’ll force it to answer with AI, right? Like, I’m just curious on that front.</p>
<p>Like, are you seeing people, like, are we measuring that? Are you able to see like how often that gets invoked or is it, are people like, Using it often or people kind of, I mean, I know with defaults, we tend to see people just kind of let the thing do what it’s supposed to do, but are you seeing users like invoking that a lot?</p>
<p>[00:25:55] Remi: Yeah, I think it’s, it’s fairly small, but as you said, defaults as are what matters in the end. Right. So like, even though. I mean, there needs to be a bit of time for people to kind of learn about the future. So we’ve tried to do some in, you know, in page education where we have this little purpose and you can click on this button, right?</p>
<p>When it makes sense. So we’ve seen that in the past with code LLM, so this like code assistant that we’ve built and integrated last year. And over time, the clicks rate increased as people realize, okay, I can do it. Right. And then in the future queries, they start doing it more and more. And I guess there is a bit of that, but</p>
<p>[00:26:33] Josep: it’s very low, as you said, but that’s in a way, that’s like the point, right?</p>
<p>Because that’s why we put so much emphasis on the automatic triggering. Right. I mean, if too much, but of course there’s a confounder there, right? I mean, we do not know if, but in principle, I think it’s like less, a little bit less than 1%. I’m pretty happy about it.</p>
<p>[00:26:54] Luke: And that’s one of those things, I think, too, that’s kind of not necessarily unique to us, but the fact that we have so many early adopters, you know, that try out brave stuff, the people that are more likely to kind of push all the knobs around, you know, like, in a lot of cases, at least from what I see, because it’s been interesting for my position, you know, being out there with the community a lot is that, you know, I see what I see often where it’s, anecdotally, some people want AI to answer everything, but then some people are really repulsed by the idea of AI answering everything.</p>
<p>Right. And when I see that, it usually means we’re doing something right. If I see things skewing too much one way or the other, when we release these things, it’s, but, but yeah, I think that you nailed it. Like the user shouldn’t need to know whether to answer it with AI or not. It should just give them a good answer, right?</p>
<p>Like whether it’s a search result query or,</p>
<p>[00:27:35] Josep: That’s our bet in a way, right? I mean that we don’t want to go either one way or the other. We believe that both options have values, have intrinsic values, and also like to always like have the choice of the user, right? Because at the day, the query intents are very complex.</p>
<p>Same query can have different intents depending on a context that we do not have. Perhaps you are like in the mood of reading a lot of text, or perhaps you just want to know like, what is the last album of Lady Gaga, right? I mean, the same, the same query last album of Lady Gaga can be anything. It could be like the actual answer.</p>
<p>you actually want to buy it or like, you want to know the ups and downs of the story behind it. Right. It’s not, it’s a no.</p>
<p>[00:28:24] Luke: Well, and it’s one of those things I really love about this too, is that it’s kind of like when I’m using it, it feels like a, for a lot of the zeitgeist is kind of looking at, at AI and thinking, okay, it’s a little staple, like a, what’s his name from Microsoft days.</p>
<p>I don’t know that that Clippy, yeah, yeah. Where, okay. It’s constrained into this little sidecar of a prompt. Right. But when I’m using this feature, it’s actually like, okay, wait a minute. Like, here’s something that. I don’t need to need some early adopter to use it. Everybody’s using search, right?</p>
<p>It’s one of those things where it’s actually useful AI application in something that you can get in front of millions of people and actually have them use it right away, which kind of rare, right? One thing I want to kind of ask about that though, is, you know, when you look at like these prompts, there’s a lot of concern around like hallucinations with results.</p>
<p>Like how are we handling that at Brave when we do things like this answer engine, where it’s kind of almost like a hybrid of, The serpent and what you see, like with these AI prompts.</p>
<p>[00:29:19] Remi: That’s a good point. I mean, it’s hallucinations are most likely the biggest issue with LLMs as we’ve seen, you know, in chat GPT and like the answer confidently and you’re like, is it true or not?</p>
<p>Right. So one thing to remember, I think is the answer with AI is like by design. grounded in the search result, right? So like, this means that for any user query, we already providing relevant information to the model. So already it’s kind of constrained to a scope, which is much more limited compared to like chat GPT, where it’s like, you know, you ask a question and then the model can pick up any knowledge it might have from its pre training, right?</p>
<p>So like the context matters. One caveat on that is that. Grounded doesn’t mean truth, right? Because what the answer reflects is the quality of the search results. And you might have multiple perspectives in there, and we try to make sure that the final answer reflects all of them if possible, right? So we try to make sure you get the best overview possible of the search results.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t mean, you know, This is truthful and you still need to check, you know, critical, critical facts, right? But at least you minimize the likelihood of the model just going completely astray and, you know, like inventing,</p>
<p>[00:30:33] Josep: making up something. I would like to like to congratulate the team, but especially Rene, because like those things are really like an art, right?</p>
<p>Like on how you actually like, because like all these LLMs. And systems that are actually fairly new, might sound stupid like what they’re going to say, but nobody actually understands fully how they actually work. So it’s kind of like, you know, like what happens with MLM is that you actually put them in an input, the output amazes you.</p>
<p>But then if you want to make them do something specific, it usually refuses to, right? And there is a lot of like, back and forth and trial and error and educated guesses that the team has been, that’s put on it just to make this kind of like thing that, well, I mean, the, the output of the answer should be based on the.</p>
<p>Content of the web and on the knowledge of the content of the web, rather than the knowledge of the model itself, all the things, I mean, congratulations to Remi and Tim, because it’s a</p>
<p>[00:31:36] Luke: good point. I was going to sing your praises a little more. I mean, it’s one of those things where when I was seeing, you know, having been at Brave for a long time, when we brought you guys on with the search engine, the comparisons we always used to hear from people were like, okay, how does this compare to DuckDuckGo?</p>
<p>But like, when I see what you guys are doing now. The comparisons I’m seeing from people are like, I can use this instead of Google, right? Like it’s getting to the point where I can like, it doesn’t happen unless you have a good product that you’re putting out there, which, I mean, all this thought and care and consideration, when, especially when you compare it to how, like I used to looking at a windows 11 install and seeing that I’ve got this.</p>
<p>Co-piloting everywhere that I didn’t ask for, right? Like and, and, and trying to force these things on me all over the place. Like it’s a balance, right? Like, and, and, I think that you guys are doing a, a lot of great work on focusing on where these things could be most useful and then really kind of attacking that and trying to give quality, you know, with that, that’s useful.</p>
<p>Which is not an easy thing to balance, right? I mean, like, you know, we’re still finding our. Product market fit as a, as a whole company and how you guys are in here kind of like with the scalpel, trying to kind of take on some giants, which is awesome, I think, how do you guys measure quality when you’re looking at these things?</p>
<p>I mean, cause it is, it’s almost like a higher bar that you guys have to aim for because it’s married with the search result page and people are using that for research and thing like, how do you guys measure quality when you’re looking at these AI answers?</p>
<p>[00:32:56] Remi: Yeah. Yeah. All right. So it’s a great question.</p>
<p>And quality in search is already hard. I think if you put LLMs in the mix, it becomes even harder because the output of this. Models are non deterministic by nature, right? So you have like a search index which is constantly being updated, refreshed, new pages, pages updated, new events. Then you have a model which whose output is non deterministic, you mix the two, then the output is Kind of hard to reason about in an automated way, right?</p>
<p>So what we’ve done is like, we have multiple, let’s say, layers of testing. the first one is automated testing. So we do manage to kind of, you know, replay hundreds of queries, real queries that we’ve seen for which we know what kind of things to expect in the answer, right? If you take, let’s say, height of Everest, well, no matter it’s phrased, you want to see 8, 800 meters somewhere.</p>
<p>Right. Like you can do it a bit fuzzy, of course, but like you kind of have this expectation. We can do some checks on the, you know, the entities that you expect in the answer on the format. So it’s not perfect, but it gives you kind of a good approximation of you didn’t break something fundamentally if you make a change, right?</p>
<p>So it’s like very helpful to iterate. You make a change, you run it again. It takes maybe a couple of minutes or three minutes. So it’s like very nice. And then in the end, you still need human assessment, kind of validate any meaningful change. So we do have a quality team whose job is to actually evaluate the search results, but now also sensor with AI.</p>
<p>And we’ve built like custom tooling for that. So the, I mean, one of the tools we’ve built is like some kind of chatbot arena internally, where you have a blind testing tool, you get a random query, you get a screenshot of two versions of the system. Randomized. And you need to say which one is better.</p>
<p>Right. And it’s used by the quality team. It’s used by, you know, anyone internally in the team. So we get like multiple opinions because as we’ve seen, you know, different people might prefer slightly different things. People prefer more verbose, less verbose, more concise, etc. Right. So it’s important to have a bit of a panel of different people assessing to get kind of a balanced view in the end.</p>
<p>Right. And then of course the last part is dog fooding. I mean, everyone that you know in the team uses Brave Search, every day at work, outside of work, and we get like great feedback from that. So it’s like super valuable.</p>
<p>[00:35:21] Luke: How’s the user feedback been so far? Are you seeing anything that’s kind of surprising?</p>
<p>I always see this when we throw stuff in market, you know, you see we few things or you’re like, whoa, I didn’t anticipate that. You know?</p>
<p>[00:35:30] Remi: Yeah. You have no idea what , what are people gonna do . I, I think one data point is, it ties back to what you said. A bit earlier, but some people saying, you know, there is AI.</p>
<p>How do I disable this thing? Right. And we’ve seen, you know, on communities like Reddit and Hacker News, people write, Oh, I didn’t like it, or I didn’t know I needed it, but now that I. See it in action. I cannot do without it. I think that’s the best feedback because people realize that this is valuable. It helps them, you know, find answers faster, or maybe it helps them do what they could not do at all without rates.</p>
<p>So that’s like pretty amazing to, to see this kind of feedback.</p>
<p>[00:36:08] Luke: What about you, Joseph? Anything surprising coming in?</p>
<p>[00:36:12] Josep: No, no, we have a lot of very good testimonials. We, of course, have a couple of testimonials that like this is factually incorrect. And then we actually checked and the web is wrong. Some other things are opinions.</p>
<p>There is a lot of like controversial topics where no good answer exists that doesn’t offend someone and answers just make that thing worse because someone is going to get offended in a way or another, but in general, the feedback is very good. And like Remi said, like the biggest positive feedback is that we have shown these answers to a lot of people, but like not everyone is like, on Hacker News all day long, but I know all the startups or they, or they did have, YouTube tutorials that they do X, Y, Z, right?</p>
<p>And we do serve about like 27 million queries per day. One third of those trigger the answers, right? So that’s almost like a, let’s say rounded up 10 million answers per day. That’s a lot of eyeballs, right? And it has raised awareness that that thing exists. For</p>
<p>[00:37:22] Luke: me too, looking at this space broadly, it’s like, you see when all the hype cycles happening and people are starting to use their buzzword bingo about stuff and you know, Oh, AI is ubiquitous.</p>
<p>It’s everywhere. What this has done for me is it’s kind of actually brought it home in a way where it’s like, look, like, sure, these things will be ubiquitous, but really like it. Putting this stuff in search, search is ubiquitous. Everyone’s using it, right? Like, like this, this is one of the best use cases for AI.</p>
<p>I think I’ve, I’ve, I’ve seen to date that as far as like utility and mass and, and actually like getting something that people could have help from right away that they’re not going to forget about, which is also something that I’m getting users to change their habits is really hard. And I think that, you know, by approaching this with this way and search, it’s really, really clever.</p>
<p>And. And with those ethos that you guys kind of were covering earlier aligned so well with what we’re doing here. I think it’s, it’s really kind of an under, underrated, undervalued thing in market right now, when you look at all of the kind of stuff that’s driving the hype out there. So I, I, my hat, tip my hat to you guys for cooking all this up.</p>
<p>This is amazing. and, I think this is really going to be impactful. I think one kind of out there question, like, you know, looking at the horizon for things, right. And I know Brendan talks about. There’s a lot in, in our ad platform too, kind of leverages some of the local data. Like when you guys look at things like answer engine long term, right?</p>
<p>Like beyond, I’m talking, you know, future, future, like do you see a a, a potential here for having it answers enhanced about, based on what’s locally in my browser by where I am in the world. Like all of these types of like, you know, next level types of results you could get. Do you see us going in that direction eventually?</p>
<p>[00:38:57] Josep: Yes, I mean, where you are in the world, I mean, already being used, but in any case, like, you mean, like, more like a personalized context? Yes, but that doesn’t have to be done in the context of, of Leo, right? Like the in browser. AI, right? That’s why Leo is like the in browser AI of, of reform and your audience shouldn’t be familiar with it right now.</p>
<p>There is no integration per se, but we are working heavily on, on how to integrate, right? Because like, you know, where they are complimentary, right? Like a search is more like a, a one off for a task. Of course it can be iterative, but that’s not meant to be where Leo is more like the user agent, where you can.</p>
<p>Like, you can expand and you can, like, really dig down into a particular topic. And of course, because it’s local, it could have like local information that is private to you, user sessions, and all the things that we do not want to keep. Again, for privacy considerations, they could be kept in the browser in a much safer way.</p>
<p>So we are like working on that. That’s kind of the big step forward. We haven’t done it so far. It’s mostly because the, you know, I just want to stop shop. I keep referring to right now because right now it’s actually difficult to transition from one system to another without the user, without the user.</p>
<p>Getting lost in the, in the way. Right. So there has to be like, once we have the integration worked out where like people understand clearly, like what’s going on, what’s going to get happened when you do something. Right. When we work out on this details, which hopefully is going to be very soon, then we will have like a clear winner, right?</p>
<p>Where like, you know, you start on search, then you transition to Leo and then you do like the, the heavy lifting. Or the other way around you’re liking or leo can actually have access to real time information using research</p>
<p>[00:40:47] Luke: Yeah, it’s really interesting because it’s kind of almost like we’re catering to two sides of a coin where you’ve got real like power AI users that might be using something like Leo and early adopters or people that are using it as part of their, you know, even a work function.</p>
<p>Right? And then you’ve got also like everybody else is doing like a search. Eventually these things kind of like a purging effort for both sides is really interesting and it’ll be cool to see them come together. I know we’re way over time. I really appreciate you guys making the time to come here and talk through this.</p>
<p>Is there anything we didn’t cover that you all want the audience to know about that they might find interesting whether it’s about the AI engine or about any of the broader stuff you guys are working on?</p>
<p>[00:41:29] Remi: And maybe we can touch briefly on some of the challenges that we faced while building it. Yeah, please do.</p>
<p>[00:41:34] Josep: I mean, to me, because that’s what I love, you know, building and solving problems, that’s one of the most interesting aspect of it. and we faced like quite a bunch of them.</p>
<p>I mean, there are two kind of categories of challenges. One is like performance because, you know, with the traffic that we mentioned, it’s actually not a trivial thing to serve, you know, these big LLMs at scale, although we did have a. Lot of experience because we’ve been, you know, using transformers for years now, but on, you know, smaller models, a stricter latency budget and everything, right?</p>
<p>[00:42:06] Remi: So like this new feature requires like a different kind of way of, of, of deploying this model. It is like streaming continuous matching all of these things. So we have had to do a lot of work to make sure we find the sweet spot in terms of costs, because we don’t want to, you know, spend mindlessly all the money on the GPUs and performance.</p>
<p>So that the users, you know, get a great, great experience that is fast and snappy, and they get the answer they need quickly. Right. Second aspect is quality. Of course, we’ve touched on it. Just want to maybe add like a few, few more elements on that, like to take a step back, like, you know, when you have a traditional search engine, like What you do is you take any user query with any intent, and you’re going to try to find the top 10 pages out of billions that you have in your index, right?</p>
<p>And that’s already extremely hard, as we know, because we built it, right? Built it. At this point, you kind of expect the user to go open a few pages and find the answer wherever it is. Maybe it’s in a paragraph, maybe it’s Whatever, right? But you know, like from the perspective of answer with AI, it’s not because the first page on the result set is there, but the whole content of the page is relevant, right?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a subset of it, right? So with answer with AI, you kind of take on this job for the user and you need to go look. in a much more granular way to pick up the right information, right? And the right information might be, as I said, like paragraph, maybe it’s a single sentence, maybe it’s a table, maybe it’s a row in a table, maybe it’s like some structured data, you know, like JSON schemas, these kinds of things.</p>
<p>So we’ve had to kind of, Leverage a lot of technology we had, you know, like embeddings, models, Q, Q and A, question answering models, semantic understanding, which we already had built in house for like all the other search features we built over the years. But now we’re able to leverage that to go, you know, much finer grained.</p>
<p>And go pick up the right context and then have the model work on that and produce the final answer. So I think that’s kind of this mindset change is pretty interesting and also where the challenge lies, right? When you, when you build such feature. Maybe one last thing is on this, like, you know, entities we’ve mentioned before, I think Joseph touched on that earlier.</p>
<p>Some answers are texts, some answers are not text, right? You have like cards, maybe like a thumbnail. It’s kind of interesting because What we are doing here is you take a stream of tokens from a model and then on the fly, you’re transforming the stream of token into a different representation, right? So you’re like detecting, oh, this is about entities of type, let’s say albums, right?</p>
<p>And then you kind of fetch more information on the fly and then present it in the end with like all the metadata that makes sense, like some label. And title and stuff like that. And we’re going to expand on that in the future. So it’s going to be hopefully more and more useful for the user. But it’s kind of an interesting challenge to, to build this system.</p>
<p>[00:45:14] Luke: Yeah. I mean, I just remember even before any of this AI stuff or summarizer got worked in, like being on a call with a colleague, Jan and Aldo, and he’s pulling up, we were talking about a partner. He’s pulling them up and comparing them just on the basic search results and making sure that they’re fast enough.</p>
<p>And one thing that’s kind of stood out here is that, yeah, there is kind of a little bit of time, but if I compare that against answer outputs on like, you know, chat GPT or other things, it’s, it’s much faster than what I would typically get in a bot, right, or prompt. Whatever you guys are doing there, it sounds like you guys are having a chisel at some pretty interesting, you know, automation, custom stuff to make that performance side of it works, but it’s cool.</p>
<p>I mean, like, yeah, it is neat to see this kind of richer experience when it, when it’s necessary. But I really also kind of like what, what Joseph’s talking about too, where like, I think part of the wrench is that we don’t have to show you something every time, getting that part right is, is much harder than people think, I think, or appreciate, but there’s value in that too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just so people know, I mean, like some of this is, is probably obvious, but, but like, you know, if people see a result that they think is an accurate, or if they see something that could be improved, like I know there’s feed, there’s always in feedback loops and in search, like what’s the best way for people to get you actionable information?</p>
<p>Is it to use those feedback loops and like thumbs up, thumbs down, things are in the product or what would you guys recommend like specifically on quality?</p>
<p>[00:46:35] Josep: There is like a feedback button on every result on the page. A fair amount of people submit feedback, probably only a fraction of the feedback.</p>
<p>Sometimes actually like I’m surprised to see like how often the feedback is positive, which means that we have very nice users who actually report positive feedback, which is rare. But that’s one way. Then for things that are like really offensive or really like dangerous, Like community forums on the web or Twitter is also acceptable for like things are dangerous.</p>
<p>Last on the list, I mean, if we actually have some, because like the web could contain like personal information, you know, like a phone number, like names, things like we do respect the right to be forgotten that is mandatory in the U S on the EU, but we expand it also to the whole world. So if there is like some data that shouldn’t be indexed, There is like, an email where, like, privacy at brave.</p>
<p>com, where like, you can submit and actually it’s not privacy, don’t check the email later, but basically like people can submit like, read to be forgotten, which is also important. An important thing, right? Because the web, as Remi said, the web has everything for the good and for the bad.</p>
<p>[00:47:53] Remi: Everything and more.</p>
<p>[00:47:56] Luke: Great point too. I mean, about, about people, you find information in there too. And we just actually interviewed Pat Walsh recently too. And</p>
<p>[00:48:02] Josep: yeah, Pat is the one who’s reviewing those cases because those cases is not that you can send URLs, like, okay, I want those removed. No, no, I mean, that has to be, you have to prove that you actually are the person behind that, that thing.</p>
<p>And that’s like. Damaging for you, you have to demonstrate, certain aspects, but then we, we got, we get those as any search engine there is that has its own index. Those are problems that others do not have, but we do have that because, we need to clean up our own index.</p>
<p>[00:48:30] Luke: Joseph, Remi, I really appreciate you guys, coming on the show today.</p>
<p>I’d love to have you all back too, when we’ve got more new things to roll out. Thanks so much. Until next time, have a good one, you guys.</p>
<p>[00:48:43] Josep: Thank you for having us.</p>
<p>[00:48:47] Luke: Thanks for listening to the Brave Technologist podcast. To never miss an episode, make sure you hit follow in your podcast app. If you haven’t already made the switch to the Brave browser, you can download it for free today at brave.com and start using Brave Search, which enables you to search the web privately. Brave also shields you from the ads, trackers, and other creepy stuff following you across the web.</p>

             
         
     
    
 

 What the Brave Search answer engine can do&nbsp; 
<p>The secret ingredient of an answer engine is not the LLM that powers it, but the combination of a model with up-to-date, reliable data. Such data can help supply the context from which the model derives the answers it presents to the user. Or, to put it another way: an effective answer engine requires both a model and access to a search engine. With API access to a search engine, even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43ZCeBTcsS8">individual contributors</a> can generate a reasonable answer engine.</p>
<p>This is why Brave Search—with its index of 20 billion pages, curated and cleansed of the SEO spam and junk content that plagues other indexes—is uniquely positioned to provide such a powerful answer engine. It has the data needed to generate an accurate and timely answer, and the context.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Answers enriched with text and other media</p>
<p>With the new answer engine, Brave Search aims to provide not just answers, but an integrated system to satisfy the multiple intents a user might have, and to do so at scale (currently Brave Search serves more than 27 million queries per day). Loosely speaking, these intents fall into one of a handful of categories:</p>
 
 Navigational: Queries for specific sites, such as “Facebook” or “Twitter.” 
 Informational: Question-based queries, or those seeking information, which generally fall into two subcategories:
 
 Specific lookups: These are often served by rich user interfaces built around structured realtime information (e.g. currency conversion rates, weather, or sports results) or custom widgets with non-real time based, deterministic data (e.g. unit conversion or time and timezone conversions). 
 Question-like queries: Queries such as “How do I find north when hiking?” 
 
 
 Commercial: Queries with the intent of finding or researching products and services. 
 Transactional: Queries with the intent of completing an action (e.g. buying a product). 
 
<p>Given relevant context, most existing answer engines do well at informational, question-like queries. However, they tend not to perform as well on other kinds of queries. With this latest release, Brave Search will default to an answer engine experience for likely informational, question-like queries.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Answers for informational queries</p>
<p>For all other categories, users can trigger the answer engine on demand by simply clicking Answer with AI. This offers a best-in-class experience of both options: an answer engine that’s both predictive and optional.</p>
<p>Brave Search’s generative answers are not just text. The deep integration between the index and model makes it possible for us to combine online, contextual, named entities enrichments (a process that adds more context to a person, place, or thing) as the answer is generated. This means that answers combine generative text with other media types, including informational cards and images.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Answer with AI results</p>
<p>The Brave Search answer engine can even combine data from the index and geo local results to provide rich information on points of interest. To date, the Brave Search index has more than 1 billion location-based schemas, from which we can extract more than 100 million businesses and other points of interest. These listings—larger than any public dataset—mean the answer engine can provide rich, instant results for points of interest all over the world.</p>

 How to try Brave Search’s Answer with AI feature 
<p>Brave Search can be accessed by anyone on the Web at <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a>, and is also the default search engine in the Brave browser for multiple countries. Answer with AI is available for all Brave Search users for searches in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish (the answer engine functionality is available in other languages as well, but some answers may appear in English). It’s available on all platforms, on desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>If Brave Search is already your default search engine, simply start a search in the address bar of your browser. For question-like queries, the answer engine should produce an answer by default, which will appear at the top of the search results page. Users also have the option to request answers on-demand by clicking / tapping the Answer with AI icon that appears beside the search bar on any search results page.</p>


    
    

    


    



<p>The Brave Search answer engine is free to all users, and we hope to keep it this way, as we believe this is a natural evolution of search engines. In the future, we may also add a paid option, with premium experiences such as the ability to have an open ended chat, possibly in conjunction with <a>the premium options offered by Brave Leo</a>, the AI assistant in the Brave browser.</p>

 The impact of answer engines on the Web 
<p>There is a clear demand from users for convenient methods of consuming content, and AI-augmented answers are a key example. On the other hand, delivering on this demand can contribute to the erosion of the incentives for publishers to put out content on the Web, ultimately changing its very nature.</p>
<p>This challenge is not unique to Brave Search, but present across most AI-powered answer engines and chatbots, premium or open. Brave, as both a browser and search engine, is aware of these challenges. Consequently, we will be monitoring and quantifying the impact of AI-generated content on site visits, and eventually will address the disruptions that could be caused by the drop in traffic. We hope others are working on this as well.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology has many different use cases. Some are more suitable for public blockchains, and others are more suitable for private blockchains. The difference between public and private blockchains can be confusing, leaving many people wondering which of the two is most suitable for their situation.&nbsp;In this article, we will explain the main differences between public and private blockchains, and when you should use which one.</p>



<p></p>



 What is a public blockchain? 



<p>Let’s start with the definition of a public blockchain. A public blockchain is a <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">permissionless blockchain</a> that allows anyone to join and participate in blockchain activities. This means anyone can contribute to the blockchain and can access the data on it.</p>



<p>In addition, public blockchains are decentralised, ensuring no single entity has control over the blockchain. This decentralisation also ensures that transactions on the (public) blockchain are verified by all nodes and are immutable once they’re on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Differences between public and private blockchains 







<p></p>



<p>While the above features sound nice, private blockchains might seem very similar at first glance. What are the differences and benefits of both types of blockchains?</p>



<p>The main difference between public and private blockchains lies in who can write and read data from that blockchain. On public blockchains, everyone can write data to and read data from the blockchain. On private blockchains though, a permissions system is in place, which determines who can perform certain actions, including reading and writing data.</p>



<p>Another important difference is the ownership of the blockchain. Generally speaking, public blockchains are decentralised and do not have an owner. Private blockchains, however, are generally owned by a single entity. This makes public blockchains more resistant to censorship than private blockchains.</p>



<p>Anonymity is another key difference between the two. Due to the permissionless nature of public blockchains, participating entities are anonymous. This can be both a benefit and a downside, depending on the use case.</p>



<p>Other differences are speed and scalability. Public blockchains tend to be slower and less scalable, due to their decentralised nature, while private blockchains are generally much faster and more scalable, as they don’t have to worry about decentralisation.</p>



<p></p>



 Picking the right blockchain 



<p>Now that you understand the differences between public blockchains and private blockchains, you should consider <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy">which blockchain is most suitable for your solution</a>.</p>



<p>If your solution requires censorship resistance and the added security of decentralisation, a public blockchain is the best fit. However, if the need for high scalability, fast transactions, and a permission system take priority, a private blockchain is likely more suited.</p>



 Which public blockchain should I use? 



<p>While picking the right kind of blockchain to suit your situation best can be quite challenging, picking the right public blockchain can be even more challenging. There’s a wide variety of available public blockchains, each of them designed to serve a specific use case and/or industry. So, which one should you use?</p>



<p>A lot of people assume Bitcoin or Ethereum are the best public blockchains, and in a sense, they are. They are the first of their kind and are very resistant to censorship due to the high number of participants. However, these blockchains have relatively low transaction speeds and suffer from scalability issues, due to outdated consensus mechanisms used.</p>



<p>Modern-day, public blockchains use newer, faster, and more scalable consensus mechanisms that safeguard the benefits of public blockchains while tackling the transaction speed and scalability issues generally associated with public blockchains.</p>



<p>One of these public blockchains is the <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">Europechain by Zaisan, an enterprise blockchain</a> created by a group of system integrators and technology providers from around the European Union. This public blockchain uses the latest software to ensure fast transaction speeds and enterprise-level scalability. In addition, the blockchain offers solutions that ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), making blockchain legal issues a problem of the past.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 A public blockchain is a permissionless blockchain that allows anyone to join and participate in blockchain activities. 



 Public blockchains are decentralised, which means that no single entity has control over the blockchain. 



 Private blockchains feature a permissions system that determines who can perform certain actions, including reading and writing data. 



 Private blockchains tend to be owned by a single entity, which makes public blockchains more censorship-resistant. 



 Public blockchains are better suited for solutions that require censorship resistance, added security, and decentralisation 



 Private blockchains are better suited for solutions that require high scalability, fast transactions, and a permission system. 



 Zaisan offers a <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">public, GDPR-compliant blockchain</a> built with the latest technology to offer fast transaction speeds and enterprise-level scalability.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>As this week wraps up, we’re excited to share our latest news with you. This week’s update covers the latest updates regarding our ecosystem and testnet development.</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 5 is now live with enhanced gas management and improved transaction processing <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-5-is-now-live-with-enhanced-gas-management-and-improved-transaction-processing/">Stage 5</a> of our testnet is live. Stage 5 includes using a third party Relayer service (a.k.a Bundler) and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.&nbsp;</p> Panther’s CTO, Anish Mohammed, on Proof of Podcast <p>Last week, our Co-Founder Anish Mohammed joined Hake from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUoziPJ55j8&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Proof of Podcast </a>to discuss tokenomics design and cryptography.</p> Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, at ETH Dam <p>Our Co-Founder and CTO, Oliver Gale, will take the stage at Crypto Canal’s ETHDam on April 13 to share his insights on alpha protection through privacy for DeFi users.</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update <p>Current testnet users: 3000+</p><p>Total rewards distributed: 700,000+ $ZKP</p><p>Our testnet rewards pot is 2 million $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link from Panther’s docs</a> to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates.  Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management and basic disclosures. Development for Stage 6 is complete and currently under testing. The team plans to release Stage 6 later this month.&nbsp;</p> Completion of the first round of audit&nbsp; <p>Panther recently completed Veridise’s first round of audits for circuits and smart contracts. The team is working on Enhancement Stage 2 to incorporate feedback from Veridise’s recent audits and other dApp improvements. We expect to release updates made to the dApp together with Stage 6 for community testing. </p> Mumbai Network Shutdown <p>As Polygon transitions to a new test network in response to the deprecation of the Ethereum Goerli test network (the underlying L1 for Mumbai), Mumbai has ceased operations. This development was somewhat unexpected, as we anticipated that Mumbai would remain operational until full network support for Amoy was established.</p><p>In the interim, we want our testers to know that their $ZKP rewards are SAFE and that the $ZKP rewards accumulated from Stage 1 testing up to the present are secure. You will receive these rewards as planned.</p><p>Next Steps: The Panther team is actively exploring alternatives to continue our testing processes effectively. Stay tuned for further updates on our<a href="https://discord.com/channels/801604563115180063/801637790290804766?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Discord</a> and<a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Telegram</a> groups, and thank you for your continued support and understanding.</p> Stage 7 development <p>Stage 7 of the testnet dApp includes DeFi swaps, advanced disclosures, other supported assets, and canary deployment (use of real tokens). The team is working on Stage 7 in parallel with Stage 6 and Enhancement Stage 2. We are currently working on UI/UX development and expect to release Stage 7 for community testing in the first week of May.</p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>Backing open-ended breakthrough research is at the core of BlueYard’s investing philosophy, whether it’s nuclear fusion, programmable stem cells or novel crypto-compute infrastructure. Hackers and researchers remain the essential backbone of the crypto industry. We are proud to have supported the work of research-focused companies like <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>, <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a>, <a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a>, <a href="https://www.tromero.ai/">Tromero</a> and more in solving critical crypto compute and infrastructure challenges, including those that could be key to unlocking adoption and enabling groundbreaking novel use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>This brings us to our core thesis underpinning our crypto investing strategy:</p><p>In the history of technology, economics and organizations — never has there been a technology and incentive system that can autonomously coordinate machines (compute, storage, etc), algorithms, data and capital at such an incredible scale, so quickly — all while providing independent, robust and trustless infrastructure for economic activity and data. Although still early in its development, crypto might be the ultimate solution to the collective action problem. Also, if one believes in a future where the autonomous coordination between compute, data and capital will play an increasing role, crypto networks could be the “under the hood” operating system for large economic networks.</p><p>Due to crypto’s inherent properties (ability to cut out gatekeepers, separation of state and money, internet native assets with open access) — crypto’s potential will unfold both through novel applications and decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>We are excited to be expanding the BlueYard team with a dedicated Crypto Associate position. This is designed to be a two-year role based in the US (ideally New York, but we’re flexible with the right candidate), supporting the team in backing entrepreneurs that are decentralizing markets and empowering humanity using crypto. At the core of BlueYard is the belief that venture capital is a product for entrepreneurs (and networks / protocols…), and if you are inspired by working with an intellectually curious, small and value-driven team, we want to hear from&nbsp;you.</p><p>The Associate role includes:</p>  Identifying technologies and trends that will positively impact economies and societies and represent attractive early stage venture investment opportunities in&nbsp;crypto  Carrying out market, company and protocol due diligence on investment opportunities  Working with our portfolio companies and networks / protocols to support&nbsp;them  Helping with our community management and&nbsp;events  Supporting with fund reporting and&nbsp;analyses  <p>Here’s what we’d like you to bring to the&nbsp;table:</p>  A strong understanding of and passion for all things&nbsp;crypto  Self-(fire)starter — be able to run on your own, identify opportunities and prioritize without much&nbsp;guidance  The ability to clearly articulate thoughts and opinions about markets, companies and networks / protocols, both in written and spoken&nbsp;form  Strong interpersonal skills — happy to work extensively within the team and with entrepreneurs  Ability to carry out market and financial analyses  Native (or close to) English language skills both written and&nbsp;oral  The willingness to roll up your&nbsp;sleeves  <p>There is no ideal background for this role and a formal degree is not required. We however think that the role will be most suitable for folks with a few years of work experience and with a track record of working in&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>If you are interested in the position please send the following to team@blueyard.com:</p>  Your CV  If applicable, a collection of links that best characterize your online&nbsp;presence

  AI 50: Companies of the Future  <p>The 2024 edition of the AI 50 shows how Gen AI is starting to transform enterprise productivity.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a>	 



Published April 11, 2024
  



 
<p>Last year generative AI moved from the background to the foreground of the AI 50 list. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/?sh=14d96301290f">This year</a> it is front and center as we see the beginnings of major AI productivity gains for both enterprise customers and consumers. Although the majority of 2023’s AI venture funding in the U.S. went to infrastructure—<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c6b47d24-b435-4f41-b197-2d826cce9532">60%</a> to the biggest large language model (LLM) providers—application companies continue to dominate the AI 50 list.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, we are beginning to see what AI-infused companies will look like. Today, many are integrating AI into their processes as a way to accelerate KPIs. We’re seeing large companies benefit from integrating AI into their products. Workflow automation platform ServiceNow is achieving <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/blogs/2024/generative-ai-use-cases.html">case avoidance rates of nearly 20%</a> with their AI-powered Now Assist. Palo Alto Networks has reduced the cost of processing expenses with AI. Hubspot has scaled customer support with AI. And Swedish fintech Klarna recently announced over <a href="https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/">$40 million in run-rate savings</a> by building AI into their customer support. Thousands of companies are now integrating AI into their workflows to see increased growth and decrease costs. AI 50 companies are enabling these rapid improvements.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, we expect to see UX and UI reimagined around the capabilities of AI. Replicating existing functions better and cheaper, will be followed by evolving entirely new user interfaces to deliver valuable new experiences.</p>
 







 
 What’s new this year? 



<p>The big movements in this year’s AI 50 list highlight how generative AI is increasing enterprise and industry productivity. The category of enterprise general productivity doubled this year, going from four companies to eight as they broadened&nbsp; their offerings to meet customers’ growing demands. Writer, previously in our enterprise marketing category, fleshed out their product lines to apply across all corporate departments. Notion, new to the list, integrated an AI assistant across their productivity platform, and added new capabilities like calendering.</p>



<p>Five productivity apps, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, DeepL, Notion and Tome are now catering to customers at the consumer, prosumer and enterprise levels. Image editor Photoroom, video generation app Pika and game-builder Rosebud show that the lines are blurring between consumer and prosumer for creative software. Overall, companies in that category also doubled, going from three to six.</p>



<p>There are fewer industry vertical categories this year, but a new industrial sector emerged. Figure in robotics, Tractian in industrial maintenance and Waabi in self-driving are beginning to show how the integration of AI software with hardware will transform work in the physical world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2023 was a strong year for infrastructure overall, and includes some formidable new entrants like Mistral, a major contender in foundation models. In the cloud data platform category, Pinecone and Weaviate demonstrated the importance of vector databases. Meanwhile, Databricks, through its acquisition of MosaicML last year, has also moved to join Anyscale, Baseten, Replicate and Together in the inference provider category. And LangChain has established itself in a category of its own as an all-purpose application development framework for working with LLMs.</p>



 Companies of the future 



<p>Previous waves of tech innovation—networking, the internet and mobile—have largely been communication revolutions. AI promises to be something different—a productivity revolution, more akin to the personal computer, which shaped the future of business and industry.</p>



<p>As more AIs are developed, they will begin to work together as networks of AIs. In the past year, we have seen generative AI extend beyond simple text or code generation to agentic interaction. Just as the rise of the PC and then the smartphone drove demand for internet bandwidth to transmit data, the evolution of AI agents will drive demand for new infrastructure to support ever more powerful computation and crosstalk.</p>



<p>We are entering a world where, as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says, “every pixel will be generated.” In this generative future, company building itself could become the work of AI agents; And someday entire companies might work like neural networks.</p>







<p>What we are seeing in the application landscape now are the first iterations of the tools that will be used by the next generation of companies. We can probably expect these companies to be smaller, but the ease of company generation means there will be far more of them. Company formation will become faster and more fluid, with new ownership and management structures. Someday, there may be large companies operated by a single AI engineer.</p>



<p>Most companies of the near future will not be one-person companies, but they will have different needs and different pain points than the companies of today. They’ll require enterprise products that can solve challenges in knowledge management and content generation, in trust, safety and authentication. The amount of software these companies will run will expand and change, with code generation and software agents enabling more customization and fast-cycle iteration.</p>



<p>To win the hearts and minds of the businesses of the future, founders will need to answer some critical questions. What kinds of products will these companies make? What kinds of infrastructure and applications will they need? How will the workforce change? How will patterns of distribution and value capture change? What share of their total addressable market will be composed of people vs autonomous AI agents?</p>



 What’s Next 



<p>Productivity revolutions like the AI revolution drive costs down. Technological progress this century has radically driven down the cost of hardware, but the costs of services delivered by humans, from healthcare to education, have skyrocketed. AI has the potential to reduce costs in such crucial areas making them more accessible and affordable. These changes need to be made responsibly to mitigate job loss and drive job creation. AI will enable us to do much more with less, but we will need both government and private efforts to retrain and empower everyone.</p>







<p>AI is positioned to change the cost structure and increase productivity in some of the most crucial areas in our society. It has the potential to lead to better education, healthier populations and more productive people by abstracting away mundane work and allowing us to focus our attention on more important issues and better tools for the future. It can free up more people to tackle more problems to create a better society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2024 AI 50 captures this broadening scope of AI. The list has applications that are more general than ever, and we expect it to expand in both depth and breadth in the coming years. 2024 is really just the beginning.</p>

<p>Today, Brave is announcing the latest integration of Leo, our privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser. Brave Talk Premium users can now find Leo within <a>Brave Talk</a>—our privacy-preserving video calling tool—on both desktop and Android. With this integration, Leo can take Brave Talk transcriptions and summarize them, create clean meeting notes and task lists, answer follow up questions, and more.</p>
<p>Leo for Brave Talk allows call participants to fully participate in meetings and stay focused on discussions, and let Leo handle the logistics. As with all Brave products, this is done with our full privacy protections by default.</p>

 What are Brave Talk and Brave Leo? 
<p>Brave Talk—first launched in May 2020, and built on 8x8’s Jitsi Open Source video conferencing software—is our privacy-focused video conferencing feature built directly into the Brave browser. With Brave Talk, any Brave user can start a virtual meeting, livestream, hangout, or any other collaborative session. And anyone—even if they’re not using Brave—can join a Talk call.</p>
<p>Brave Talk offers video/audio conferencing, screen sharing, chat, and more, with no extra apps or extensions required—it’s built right into the Brave browser, and offers Brave-level privacy. With Brave Talk, what you say or type in the service is not logged or saved (except to enable call recordings and transcriptions); who you talk to, when, and how, stays private to you. Talk is free for up to 4 participants, with no limit on the number or length of calls. It’s also available as a Premium offering for larger groups, with call recordings and expanded moderation tools.</p>
<p>Leo is Brave’s private AI assistant available right in the browser. Leo can create real-time summaries of webpages or videos; answer questions about content, or generate new content; translate pages, analyze them, rewrite them, and more.</p>
<p>Leo combines this easy access to AI with the privacy focus of Brave. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. With cutting-edge technology and privacy, Brave Leo pushes the boundaries of AI chatbot services. Leo is free for all Brave users, and also includes a Premium offering with higher rate limits.</p>
<p>The Leo integration is available for all Brave Talk Premium users and their meeting attendees on the Brave browser.</p>

 What does Brave Talk with Leo do? 
<p>Brave Talk can already provide call transcripts to moderators of Premium calls. With Leo integrated into Brave Talk, those transcripts suddenly become dynamic.</p>
<p>Whether you’re discussing project updates, brainstorming ideas, or conducting interviews, Leo can follow along with the conversation and make it easier for you to reference important points. Leo can use Brave Talk call transcripts to:</p>
 
 Summarize them into useful meeting notes 
 Highlight key topics, decisions, and action items 
 Find quotes, and consider follow-up questions 
 Quickly catch up if you’re late or step away 
 
<p>With these logistical tasks handled, participants can stay focused, productive, and fully present during meetings. No more scrambling to capture details or struggling to recall important points with real-time note-taking, and no more disagreement about the content of a meeting.</p>
<p>“With Leo, meetings are now much more efficient. Teams can focus on the conversations instead of getting bogged down in note taking,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave. “Brave is committed to pairing AI with user privacy, and this applies to AI assistance in video conferencing as well. We’re excited to bring frictionless AI productivity to Brave Talk, and thrilled to continue our work with 8x8 to bring an exceptional conferencing experience to the millions of Brave users worldwide.”</p>
<p>“As technology providers, we are constantly looking for ways to innovate and provide our users with the tools and solutions they need to be more productive and efficient in their roles”, said&nbsp; Emil Ivov, VP of Product for Video Platform and Services at 8x8.&nbsp; “We’re excited to continue our partnership with Brave to couple industry-leading private video conferencing technology with a first-of-its-kind integration of private AI into calls, creating an enhanced employee and customer experience.”</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Privacy and security 
<p>Unlike other AI meeting assistants, Brave Talk with Leo doesn’t share your data with anyone. Brave and 8x8 will store call recordings and transcripts for up to 24 hours to allow time for call moderators to download them. What you say or type in the service is otherwise never logged or saved. Who you talk to, when, and how, is private to you. Furthermore, when call recordings are initiated, users are made aware of this by a voice announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave Talk users can enable multiple layers of encryption on calls, which can prevent eavesdroppers from listening in. Brave Talk is powered by the <a href="https://jaas.8x8.vc/#/">Jitsi as a Service</a> open-source video meeting platform from 8x8, a leading integrated cloud contact center and unified communications platform provider (NASDAQ: EGHT). 8x8 uses WebRTC open-source technology, enabling developers to embed HD video directly into the browser.</p>
<p>As for Leo’s privacy protections, Leo hides IP addresses using a reverse proxy, so requests cannot be linked to a user. Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers or used for model training. No personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models (though if you select the Anthropic model, Leo queries will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted). No login or account is required for access, and Leo Premium subscriptions are unlinkable to the user.</p>

 Get started with Brave Talk + Leo 
<p>The Leo integration is available for all Brave Talk Premium users and their meeting attendees on the Brave browser.</p>
<p>To start a Brave Talk call, Brave browser users can open a new tab and click the  icon, or visit talk.brave.com. Once the call link is created, it can be shared with anyone, even if they’re not using Brave.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Brave Talk with Leo is available to Premium subscribers. To get a Premium subscription ($7/month), users can visit account.brave.com to get started. Once a Premium call is started, the meeting creator with the Premium subscription can visit Settings and turn on Record transcription (A red icon will appear at the top of the screen for all participants, indicating the call is being recorded.)</p>
<p>The call moderator will have access to the audio or video recording, or the transcription, for 24 hours after the call ends. The moderator can share the transcription with the meeting attendees. Those attending a Premium call from the Brave browser can click  in the Brave Sidebar to ask Leo to summarize key points both during and after the meeting. Don’t see the sidebar? Visit Settings » Appearance, and toggle on Show Sidebar button. Afterwards, click the icon that appears in the address bar to use Leo in the Sidebar.</p>
<p>Note that Leo in Brave Talk calls are subject to Leo’s standard rate limits.</p>

  The Arc Product-Market Fit Framework  <p></p>   
	By Team Sequoia	 
  



 
<p>Finding product-market fit is the central quest of every early-stage startup. As we have seen over years of partnering with companies before they reached PMF, there are many ways of thinking about and approaching this quest. We walk founders through the following framework during <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, our company-building immersion for pre-seed and seed stage companies. Rather than diagnosing whether you have product-market fit, this framework outlines three distinct archetypes of PMF which help you understand your product’s place in the market and determine how your company operates.</p>



 3 Archetypes of Product-Market Fit 



<p>Ultimately, product-market fit is about your product’s place in the world. There are different aspects to how your product fits into the world that you could hone in on—competitive landscape, the technical merits of your product, etc. We think the best way is to start by focusing on how the customer relates to the problem your product solves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are different kinds of problems, and different ways customers relate to them. We see three basic archetypes, each with its own distinct customer-product relationship dynamics.</p>







 Hair on Fire 



<p>You solve a problem that’s a clear, urgent need for customers. The demand is obvious. Because of this, your category is likely crowded with competitors vying for market share. Your customers are actively wrestling with the problem, and likely comparing existing products to solve it. To succeed in such a dynamic, you must rise above the noise. The only way to do so is by delivering the best-in-class solution. And best-in-class products stand out because they are different, not merely better. You can’t just be faster or cheaper—you need a truly differentiated customer experience to have a durable advantage.</p>







 Hard Fact 



<p>You take a pain point universally accepted as a hard fact of life, and see that it’s merely a hard problem that your product solves for the customer. Your customers have resigned themselves to just living with the problem. They’re not urgently engaged with trying to solve it. The status quo is just how it is, and change doesn’t seem like an option. You upend how things are done with an unexpected approach: Facts can’t be changed—but problems can be solved. The challenge to overcome is force of habit. Customers will have to change their current behaviors, and inertia is powerful. You need an approach that’s novel enough, for a problem that matters enough, to be worth making a change.</p>







 Future Vision 



<p>You enable a new reality through visionary innovation. It sounds like science fiction to customers, either because the concept is familiar but sounds impossible (like abundant cheap energy from nuclear fusion) or because no one ever imagined it (like the iPhone). Customers are not only not trying to solve the problem, they are either oblivious to it or predisposed to think it’s a pipe dream. Either way, the obstacle is disbelief: Customers must believe that your product represents a whole new paradigm—often with its own ecosystem. (The iPhone wasn’t just a device; its App Store was a new way of interfacing with the internet. Tesla isn’t just a car; it’s a network of cameras and self-driving software that’s a new driving experience.) Customers must find the paradigm and its possibilities irresistible. As we’ll discuss below, this path is often long, and finding the right route with the right commercial opportunities along the way is usually critical.</p>
 







 
 How to Operate in Each Path&nbsp; 



<p>Once you understand these archetypes, you can self-identify which path your company is on. Many founders we encounter in Arc assume they’re supposed to be in the Hair on Fire path. They have absorbed the adage to listen to what customers need. That’s good advice. But it often comes as a revelation that Hard Fact or Future Vision dynamics are viable options for finding PMF.</p>



<p>Hopefully you’re already working on a problem you have a unique advantage in solving. Your path, however, will be defined by how your customer relates to this problem (and how they feel about your solution). You can find success on any path—but each brings a distinct set of operating priorities that are essential to understand.</p>



 Path 1 – Hair on Fire 



<p>The Hair on Fire path requires both a great product and a great go-to-market effort—in quick succession. This combination of solution, selling and speed is the key to overcoming the competition.&nbsp;</p>
 



<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Hair-on-fire-desktop.png"></a>



 
 Hair on Fire – Case Studies 



<p>Along with product velocity, one hallmark of companies that break through to find success in the Hair on Fire path is the ability to aggressively out-maneuver the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assaf Rappaport and his Wiz co-founders had previously founded Adallom together. For their new company, they were intrigued by the problem of cloud infrastructure security—but it was already a crowded space with incumbents like Palo Alto Networks and startups like Orca Security offering products on the market. However, when they interviewed CISOs, the topic kept surfacing at the top of everyone’s wish list. There was evident demand in a large market—but it took some digging to find the opportunity for differentiation. Most cloud security products relied on agents, a piece of software that needs to be installed in every server in order to monitor it. Wiz conceived an “agentless” solution that not only reduced friction and headaches, but surfaced vulnerabilities more effectively. Even better, once connected it could surface those vulnerabilities in the course of a 15-minute customer demo. Assaf and his team found their advantage, and floored the accelerator, aggressively out-maneuvering the competition: engineers built the product during their workday Israel time, and worked double-duty as sales reps at night—daytime in the U.S. They went from $0 to $2.8M in a single quarter and reached $100M in ARR in 18 months, setting a new record for the fastest-growing software company, ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Parker Conrad founded Rippling, he was entering a large Hair on Fire market. Every company needs HR software, and this urgency was reflected in the steep competition: there were already at least half a dozen incumbents fighting for market share. In fact one of them was Parker’s own previous company Zenefits. Why bother? Because his deep expertise meant he knew what needed to be done differently: While other providers stitched together disparate datasets to offer a single platform for HR and benefits, Rippling’s approach was to build a unified database. This foundation layer for employee data could then “ripple” out to any aspect of the employee experience, from benefits to expenses to device management. Their technical advantage created a different experience for HR, finance and IT administrators, which allowed Rippling to stand out and quickly grow market share in a field of incumbents. And their strategy of bundling the widest set of employee experiences gave it pricing power even in a Hair on Fire dynamic where price leverage can be challenging for new entrants.</p>



 Path 2 – Hard Fact 



<p>The Hard Fact path entails getting customers to re-evaluate and change the way they approach a current process. This requires first educating the market, and then capturing the opportunity.</p>
 



<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Hard-Fact.png"></a>



 
 Hard Fact – Case Studies 



<p>Your novel approach may replace an existing market (like Salesforce moving CRM to the cloud) or it may create a new market (like Uber reimagining the taxi experience as a rideshare marketplace). Either way, you will likely face less competition on the Hard Fact path because the difficulty of changing the status quo has discouraged other founders from taking on the problem. To succeed, Uber had to not only convince legions of everyday people to drive strangers around, but also engage with taxi unions, local regulations and labor laws. Others’ natural aversion to such difficulty means you’ll likely get more of a greenfield opportunity.</p>



<p>When Block (then Square) first launched, the hard fact they were addressing was widely known and acknowledged: “cash only.” For many small businesses or at any farmers’ market, there was no way to accept credit cards. Consumers would trudge off to find ATMs and merchants would often miss out on sales. Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey’s unique insight was that smartphones, which were just becoming ubiquitous, could be effectively turned into mobile credit card terminals. Square realized that this supposed hard fact of life was actually a hard problem that it could solve. But finding success meant getting the world to see it no longer had to live with this pain point, and to trust Square’s solution enough to adopt their new way. In order to activate this epiphany and win over early adopters who would evangelize the product, Square made an early decision to give its hardware and software away for free to merchants and figure out a business model later. Eventually, Square became a new standard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2006, marketing mainly consisted of advertising, mailers and telemarketing. This put small businesses at a disadvantage, as these were all high-cost channels. Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah realized there was a new way: small companies could leverage the properties of the fast-maturing internet—blogs, social media, SEO, email newsletters—to reach audiences at a fraction of the cost of traditional channels. HubSpot’s suite of content, SEO and email management tools solved this problem for customers. But in order for customers to believe in their approach and begin adopting their product, HubSpot needed to crystalize the new way in customers’ minds—to make them aware that the old way was broken and could be replaced with something better. They did this by coining a term for their new way—“inbound marketing”— and even wrote a book about it. They were so effective at educating the market that the idea caught on and started a marketing revolution in the small business world, propelling HubSpot to product-market fit and beyond.</p>



 Path 3 – Future Vision 



<p>The Future Vision path has the most ways to fail and the fewest to succeed, but potentially the largest payoff. Taking this path requires endurance and the ability to attract and retain top talent for the long haul.</p>
 



<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Future-Vision.png"></a>



 
 Future Vision – Case Studies 



<p>Philosopher Søren Kierkegaard said, “Life can only be understood by looking backward, but it must be lived looking forward.” Future Vision founders like Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, who took a tortuous 30-year path to reach the company’s founding ambition, can probably relate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nvidia’s initial vision was to uplevel what PCs are capable of with a 3D graphics chip that would transform the experience of using a computer. When Nvidia released its first chip, it was so ahead of its time that no one knew what to do with it. It took six years and three product lines to find product-market fit in an industry where the GPU enabled irresistible new possibilities: video games. While Nvidia’s original ambition wasn’t limited to the video game industry, it became synonymous with gaming innovation, with its GPUs powering both PCs and Xboxes. Were it not for that very productive pit stop—which propelled Nvidia to profitability and IPO—the company never would have survived long enough to power today’s AI revolution. In fact, they were teetering on bankruptcy before finding PMF in gaming. Thirty years from its founding, Nvidia is enabling a new computing paradigm as GPUs transform everything from data centers to cloud computing.</p>



<p>Future Vision products that fail to find PMF are often described as being “too early.” For instance, 11 years after Google Glass launched, augmented reality still hasn’t gone mainstream. This is precisely why finding pit stops with commercial traction along the way is so critical. Assuming your vision is correct and you can find a viable path, time is on your side with the Future Vision archetype: You can amass an insurmountable headstart while the world comes around to your paradigm. But finding the right pit stops can be difficult. You must act with imperfect information—“live looking forward,” as Kierkegaard said—and the pitfalls are always more obvious in hindsight. Oftentimes finding the right path means embracing unexpected turns, both with the technology you produce and the market you serve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>OpenAI is one of the most interesting Future Vision stories of our time. Its vision is to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI)—long considered a pipe dream in technology circles—and to do so for the benefit of humanity. To achieve this, they started as a non-profit, since the founders thought the profit motive of a company would undermine their mission of human benefit. A few years into the journey, however, they realized that the cost of compute needed to innovate their large language models outstripped the fundraising capacity of even the best-connected non-profit. Their path required a turn into the for-profit sector. Adopting a more traditional startup structure brought funding as well as expectations for product launches—hence ChatGPT. It instantly found product-market fit in the iPhone paradigm of “I couldn’t imagine wanting it until I saw it.” Consumer demand for generative AI was nascent in 2022. In 2023, OpenAI generated $<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-annualized-revenue-tops-16-billion-information-2023-12-30/">1.6B</a>. While ChatGPT achieved the fastest adoption of any consumer technology product ever, for OpenAI it’s the pit stop they need on the way toward their real ambition.</p>



 Putting it All Together 



<p>Using the framework of these three paths—and keeping in mind that one isn’t better than the others—you can reflect on your own product’s place in the world. What path are you on? How do customers relate to the problem you’re solving? Are you thinking about the right category dynamics? What are your operating priorities? Do you need to optimize for velocity and scale, land an epiphany with early adopters, or strategize the pit stops in your journey?</p>
 



<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Diagnostic-Desktop.png"></a>



 
 The Quest Continues&nbsp; 



<p>Practice is always messier than theory, and as you apply this thinking in the real world there are several important nuances to keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Product-market relationship dynamics are fluid. Over time, many companies end up moving from one path to another as they introduce new products or as customer attitudes change about an existing product and underlying problem. Some companies straddle two paths at once. The point of this framework is not to irrevocably set your path in stone; it would be a mistake to identify yourself too narrowly with any one of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apple, for instance, started as a Future Vision. The company’s initial memo to Sequoia in 1978 acknowledged that there was zero demand for household computers. “Apple management,” it stated, “believes that most potential customers of 1980 do not today have the slightest interest in purchasing a home computer.” As they captured imaginations and grew in popularity in the ’80s, however, the category of personal computers was no longer a Future Vision. By 1998, with the launch of iMac, Apple addressed a Hard Fact: computers, while increasingly ubiquitous, were impersonal. The iPhone instantly found PMF as a Future Vision when Steve Jobs unveiled it in 2007. The smartphone category then quickly shifted to Hair on Fire dynamics and a flood of new smartphones entered the market. Apple managed to retain its dominance by defining the category, being right and continuing to innovate. Today, Apple is introducing yet another Future Vision with Apple Vision Pro. The device leverages the 10X advancements in sensors developed for the iPhone: the fruits of one product’s PMF journey can create seeds for the next. Will Apple Vision Pro enable entirely new experiences we can’t yet imagine, and fall squarely in the Hair on Fire path a few years from now? Time will tell.</p>
 



<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Legacy.png"></a>



 
<p>Legendary companies string together multiple product lines that evolve through one path of product-market fit to another. While one product may plateau, the next product starts rising.</p>



<p>You can use this framework to orient yourself regardless of where you are in this cycle. PMF may seem like a destination you’re trying to reach—but keeping and expanding on it once you arrive is an ongoing quest that will last as long as your company does.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The development for Stage 5 is complete and will be announced separately.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management and basic disclosures. The team has made significant progress on Stage 6 development and is looking forward to releasing it for community testing by mid-April.&nbsp;</p> Stage 7 developments <p>Stage 7 of the testnet will allow testers to swap zAssets on top 3 Swap protocols on Polygon, including Uniswap V3 while keeping and tracking your operation history in the dApp. The team plans to work on the Stage 7 development in April. </p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2023, New York City was shrouded in smoke. Staring out the window of my office in the Financial District, I could barely see the East River. I dreaded going outside. The haze, which partially obscured not-so-distant Brooklyn from view, came from a series of devastating Canadian wildfires <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-wildfire-july-18-1.6909596">unlike</a> anything on record, with air quality indexes in NYC reaching 800% above what is considered “safe.” It was also very hot—here, and in so many other cities around the world. A relatively recent phenomenon, the effects of human-induced climate change are staring us in the face. Meanwhile, most experts agree that all of this, and so much <a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/climate-change-fueling-migration-do-climate-migrants-have-legal-protections">more</a>, is only going to get worse.</p>



<p>I’m fascinated by the idea of “climate awakenings”—the moment when the climate crisis goes from an abstract notion to a real and present danger for a person. Why does it occur for some people as children after hearing a story about deforestation of the Amazon, while for others it takes a Category 3 hurricane barrelling toward their doorstep to finally acknowledge it might be real?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Motivating climate awakenings is what Taylor Francis, Avi Itskovich and Christian Anderson hope to do with Watershed, the company they co-founded. “The world needs to decarbonize between 5 to 10% per year,” says Francis. “We wanted to build something that could be a really big contributor to that.” Rather than targeting individuals, Watershed aims to awaken companies, inspiring them to minimize their carbon footprint and transition to clean power sources.</p>



<p>For Francis, 31, the aha moment came via a former Vice President the summer before eighth grade. He remembers seeing Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth” in the theater with his mother and being “pretty shaken.” With no real summer plans to speak of, and with newfound existential dread, Francis took it upon himself to cold-email Al Gore’s office to see how he could lend a hand in saving the planet. To his surprise, he got a response just a few days later: an invitation to Nashville for the following month to attend the Climate Reality Project, a mini-climate advocacy bootcamp.</p>



<p>Over the course of three harrowing days, climate experts walked Francis and a couple hundred activists (all then-13-year-old Francis’s elders by at least 15 years, and one of whom, John Doerr, would later join the board of Watershed) through every slide of the “An Inconvenient Truth” PowerPoint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis walked away inspired, but also overwhelmed by the enormity of the challenge ahead. Determined to do something, he started giving hyper-localized, high school-friendly versions of the “Inconvenient Truth” talks in schools and libraries and community centers around the Bay Area. “I talked about the California droughts and wildfires, and I had little handouts to bring home to their parents that said things like ‘switch lightbulbs, buy a Prius, vote,’” he remembers, “and I think kids went home and yelled at their parents in a pretty big way.”</p>



<p>He kept at it in college, studying public policy and nursing a dream of working on climate legislation. But after graduating from Princeton in 2014 (and helping to convince Al Gore to be his “<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2014/02/14/al-gore-selected-2014-class-day-speaker">Class Day” speaker</a>), that passion was hard to maintain in the face of the government’s seeming apathy on the issue, especially after the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/anatomy-of-a-senate-climate-bill-death/">Cap and Trade Bill</a> had died in Congress that year. “It was a bit of a ‘what’s next?’ moment for climate policy,” he says—and realizing he didn’t yet know the answer, Francis decided to pivot careers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If I can’t work on climate policy,” he remembers thinking, “I might as well work in an amazing company and learn as much as I can about how to build a company of my own. And that kind of led me back to the Bay Area, into Stripe.”&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Itskovich, 31, never saw “An Inconvenient Truth” as a teen—his attentions in middle school were elsewhere. “My family kind of hopped around a lot,” Itskovich remembers. “I was born in the former USSR, when I was two I moved to Israel and then when I was about 10 I moved to Canada. I think we were preoccupied with, like, other things than climate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of those things was academic excellence; when Itskovich brought home a 97% on a middle school report card, he was admonished by his dad, who had been schooled in the Soviet system where “anything less than a perfect score meant you weren’t great,” remembers Itskovich. As a high schooler, Itskovich steered this work ethic toward software engineering. After finishing his school’s computer science curriculum, he built an entirely new internal grading system for the school from scratch. By then, CS didn’t feel forced; it felt more like a calling—not just because of what it enabled Itskovich to do, but because of what it enabled others to do. “The power of being able to program is not like, ‘cool, I created the thing,’” says Itskovich. “It’s watching someone else use it, and in ways you might not even have expected.”</p>



<p>After graduating from the University of Waterloo with a degree in computer science and four tech internships in San Francisco under his belt, Itskovich knew he wanted to be at the center of the world’s greatest coding ecosystem, building tools that could empower millions. He returned to the Bay, where he’d landed an engineering gig at Stripe. There, he would meet a couple of key friends who would pull him away from his computer and into the outdoors—and in the process, help him find his life’s next major calling.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>For Anderson, 32, more than either of his co-founders, his climate awakening was something of a foregone conclusion—his father is an environmental policy lawyer who largely worked from home. “He always gave me a solid glimpse into the work he was doing,” remembers Anderson. A passion for climate action felt inevitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 10, Anderson made his first foray into early climate tech: He made a website. By then a consummate lover of backpacking and forests, Anderson couldn’t stand the idea of losing the world’s largest one. “It’s the kind of thing that’s so visual when you’re a kid, right?” says Anderson. “Imagine these forests in the Amazon getting chopped to death.” With his dad’s help, he built a web page titled “Foundation for our Future” to educate about conservation and accept donations to protect the Amazon rainforest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was only in high school that the concept of man-made climate change really clicked for Anderson. He remembers learning about it in his classes and feeling moved intellectually. He switched to vegetarianism and became a stickler for recycling, but felt mostly powerless otherwise. Like Francis, he says he couldn’t “connect with it as a problem that I could solve the way you might solve local environmental issues. I saw it as too huge a problem to affect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So instead, he followed other, more “accessible” passions, earning dual undergraduate degrees in physics and math at Harvard before being accepted into a physics PhD program at MIT for quantum informatics. But before fully “veering into a deep science direction” and committing to another six or seven years in Boston, Anderson decided he needed a gap year on the other side of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What he found in the Bay Area’s tech scene reawakened a years-dormant urgency in Anderson. “There were a lot of people in San Francisco working to try to make the world better in an immediate way,” says Anderson. In this crucial juncture, as he was considering the impact he wanted to make in his life and work, that immediacy resonated. “For me it was, do we try to make the world better in a somewhat long-running roundabout way through science or, you know, could I try to build something with my own two hands that makes the world better?” says Anderson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anderson decided to delay his PhD, and within weeks he had secured an engineering role at a promising young payments startup.</p>



<blockquote>

Christian Anderson</blockquote>



 



<p>Once their lives converged at Stripe, so did most of the trio’s weekends. Anderson had started organizing small backpacking and camping trips for fellow Stripe outdoors enthusiasts, and while there weren’t many takers, in Itskovich and Francis he found kindred spirits, who were equally intense about outdoor activities. The three would calculate exactly how much outdoor time they could compress into the window between signing off on Friday and logging back in on Monday morning. They would go backcountry skiing in Tahoe, belaying up Mount Diablo and sprint-hiking a Lost Coast route in a day when it was meant to be done in two. “We bonded over this outdoor stuff where it’s all about pushing yourself, taking a risk, taking a challenge, kind of trusting somebody else,” says Anderson. “When something goes wrong and it becomes an adventure—that’s when that bond truly forms,” adds Itskovich with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their weekends away also reawakened something that Francis and Anderson, for one reason or another, had placed on the back burner: climate urgency. Back in the office, much like their backpacking intensity, their collective interest in climate-focused work compounded as they worked together. In 2019, Christian started pitching in with Stripe’s early climate efforts, wrangling funds from the company to buy carbon offsets. Eventually, Francis and Itskovich joined him, encouraging other corporations to do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2018, their dedication to climate action would be put to the test. In October of that year, an intergovernmental panel on climate change published a report that became known colloquially as the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/">1.5 degree report</a>. Its main claim was that if humanity can limit global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celcius, we can avoid many of the more extreme, damaging impacts of climate change. But that doing so would require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anderson read the report while visiting a friend on a wooded island off the coast of Vancouver, Canada. Surrounded by water and trees, he remembers thinking, “They did such a good job in that report, balancing the message of, ‘We are not past the point of no return, but the window for action really is closing.’” Just a few months later, Francis and Itskovich felt the same sentiment at an event hosted by the nonprofit Protect Our Winters (POW). One of the speakers presented the reality of climate change in stark terms: “We are the first generation to see the effects of climate change and the last generation to have an impact on it,” Itskovich remembers hearing. “It’s the kind of sentence that gets lodged in your brain and drives urgency. It means oh, maybe I shouldn’t wait five or 10 years to work on climate change. Maybe the time is now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike so many people who hear the alarm bells but find ways to quiet them and carry on with business as usual, the ringing remained deafening for the trio. They started mulling over, first individually, then collectively, what they could do—and how they could do it, fast. Francis and Itskovich left Stripe shortly thereafter, in mid-2019, to focus on climate action full-time, with the understanding that Anderson would join them soon. A few months later, after finalizing his work with Stripe’s climate initiative and handing off his teams, he did.</p>
 



Avi Itskovich, Christian Anderson and Taylor Francis



 
<p>In late fall 2019, the three ex-Stripes gathered around a whiteboard in Anderson’s apartment near Buena Vista Park. They knew only two things for certain: They wanted to work together on something, and that something would be climate-related. What exactly it would be, well, that’s where the whiteboard came in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the next two weeks, they workshopped a different idea every day, sketching out the pros and cons of each on the board. The ideas drew upon each of their respective areas of expertise, and ranged from altering public consciousness (starting a climate-focused media company), to tracking personal emissions (like Strava, but counting carbon instead of kilometers), to structural changes (political advocacy to mobilize bipartisan support for climate legislation), to more consumer-oriented fare (a slickly branded site that enabled consumers to buy clean power with the click of a button).&nbsp;</p>



<p>They evaluated each idea on its ability to remove or reduce 500 million tons of CO2 every year (“We thought it would be pretty awesome to build something that could be driving 10 to 20% of global decarbonization, which needs to be 5 gigatons of CO2 per year,” says Francis), and their ability to make an impact without relying on external societal or technological changes. At the end of two weeks, they concluded that changing hearts and minds wasn’t enough, that creating low-carbon materials like cement and concrete was just one piece of the puzzle (albeit an essential one), and that a consumer focus couldn’t scale. What they needed was to harness the enormous scale of corporate spending and direct it toward renewable energy—a mass corporate climate awakening.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We thought it would be pretty awesome to build something that could be driving 10 to 20% of global decarbonization.”</p>
Taylor Francis</blockquote>



<p>“We wanted to enable companies to take the geyser of money that they currently point at dirty technologies and redirect as much of that as possible toward the clean stuff,” says Francis. “If we could pull that off, we could enable not just one low-carbon cement company, but dozens of low-carbon cement companies and also low-carbon agriculture companies and low-carbon transportation companies and more demand for all the sustainable aviation fuel innovators. We could be this kind of leverage point.” As a bonus, it would give corporations a productive means of responding to any pressure they might face from investors, regulators and customers to take action on climate change.</p>



<p>In Anderson’s living room, the co-founders drafted the first slide of the deck they’d use for sales calls and pitches to investors, putting their value prop in plain terms: They would enable companies to measure their carbon footprint, meaningfully reduce it and report on their progress to employees, customers and investors. “The first slide of the sales deck that we made in 2019 is the same first slide of the sales deck today,” says Francis.</p>



<p>They added a title slide for their still-nameless company. It read: “Powering Carbon Reductions for _____.” Now, in order to catalyze the change they were hoping to accomplish, they just needed to fill in that blank a few thousand times over.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Two days before Christmas 2019, Francis hopped on a flight for an unexpected trip down to Los Angeles. The founders had received an early holiday gift: an email from Sweetgreen’s then head of supply chain and sustainability—a customer they’d been courting for weeks—saying he was free for a last-minute meeting. With Anderson and Itskovich away with their respective families for the holidays, Francis went to take the team’s first major meeting on his own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis walked into Sweetgreen’s Culver City office with their pitch deck and an early version of the Watershed platform that Itskovich and Anderson had built in the previous months (they’d settled on their name a month earlier for its dual ecological and idiomatic significance). The product wasn’t pretty—regarding its design, an early advisor had noted, “Whenever I’m in your product, I want to not be in your product.”—but it was functional, and showed how their dashboard could help companies measure and interpret their various sources of carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis walked through the pitch deck, highlighting the existential nature of their mission and reinforcing their belief in the crucial role companies can play in reducing global carbon emissions. An hour later, he drove home, pleased with the presentation, but unsure how Sweetgreen would respond. “We were so early on doing enterprise sales, I had no idea how it went,” he remembers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within a matter of weeks, Sweetgreen got back to Francis: the restaurant brand had been moved by their vision and was eager to act. And thanks to Watershed’s platform, they could do so in a way that didn’t compromise profits, something instrumental to Watershed’s pitch. They’d officially landed their first major customer. “The key thing here is we’re not pitching ‘climate action at the expense of the corporation.’ We’re helping the corporation put climate into its core and treat it like a business priority,” says Itskovich.</p>



<blockquote>

<p>Over the following months, the founders onboarded Sweetgreen onto a considerably more beautiful (and functional) version of their platform, plugging in the restaurant chain’s food suppliers, farmers and transportation teams in order to understand where they could use the most carbon-friendly adjustments. All the data pointed to two key areas for carbon emission reduction: “Chicken and cheese,” says Itskovich. “You gotta solve your chicken and cheese emissions.”</p>



<p>With that in mind, Watershed helped Sweetgreen develop methodologies for engaging their poultry and dairy suppliers in ways that would increase awareness of their carbon emissions, and foster best practices for reducing them. First, they asked suppliers to fill out a survey. “The key question on the survey that you had to answer was, do you have a methane digester for your manure? For cheese creameries, it’s all about what you do with the manure,” says Francis. Using survey results, Watershed then offered recommendations for Sweetgreen’s suppliers to lower their carbon footprint, and encouraged Sweetgreen to seek out new suppliers if their original ones were unwilling to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using insights from Watershed’s platform, Sweetgreen has changed its menu to reflect more carbon-conscious ingredients and deploy clean power in every store. With Watershed’s help, the restaurant chain is aiming for complete carbon neutrality by 2027. “The partnership with Sweetgreen has paved the way for what is possible for sustainability in a food system and supply chain like theirs,” says Francis.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Anderson hung up the phone, exhausted. It was early 2020, and in the wake of their Sweetgreen success, Watershed had managed to secure partnerships with Airbnb, Segment, Square and Shopify, all of whom were eager to make climate-friendly changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team got to work on Watershed Marketplace, a hub where customers could access vetted carbon credits, nascent carbon removal technologies, and, in theory, clean energy sources. But the latter was proving difficult to secure. “I legitimately called every major clean power developer in the United States to try to find one who would be willing to do business with a small tech startup,” says Anderson. This was a not-so-short list of 14 or so companies, who without fail would make their opinion of Watershed known. “We were small fries!” remembers Anderson. “It’s this big, expensive, really physically complex industry. They would get some tech startup on the phone that’s like, ‘Hey, we’re building the customer base, we think we could move a lot of your product!’ They were like, ‘Right, okay, sure man.’”</p>



<p>After upwards of 15 calls with a DC-based solar energy company called Sol Systems, Anderson finally got the response he was looking for. Convinced by Watershed’s mission and growing roster of customers, “They said ‘yes,’” remembers Anderson. “Sol Systems was our first Marketplace partner. This was the moment the Watershed Marketplace really got off the ground.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Marketplace established, the co-founders realized it was time to graduate out of Anderson’s living room. In mid-2020, they hired their first two employees and raised a Series A. Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins co-led the round, which also included backing from their former bosses at Stripe, the Collison brothers. “They were amazing mentors to us, so it meant a lot to have their investment—actual and symbolic—in the company,” says Francis.</p>



<p>They moved into a SoMa office space with an airy courtyard (“That was still mega COVID time, so we would do masked outdoor meetings,” says Francis). As the company grew, the trio enjoyed the same jolt of wonder with each new customer that Itskovich had first felt building his school’s grading system—of seeing their creation used in ways they’d never imagined. Like Sweetgreen, some companies used Watershed’s platform to make their supply chain more carbon-friendly. Others, like DoorDash, focused on the vehicles being used to deliver food, increasing the amount of bikes and EVs, while Shopify used Watershed to hone their logistics. For software companies, it was all about changing their data center usage, finding ways to be more carbon-efficient in their use of cloud computing and storage. “Every software company’s supply chain eventually gets very physical,” says Anderson. “What I think people probably don’t know is how much concrete is going into building a data center for, you know, an hour of a Netflix video. Every company is built on the physical world—there’s no company that escapes it.”</p>



<p>Each partnership felt like meaningful, incremental progress toward their monumental goal (i.e., saving the planet). More customers and more data also helped them refine their product, allowing them to work with customers to identify which climate-friendly changes could be made immediately and easily, and which would be the most impactful. “For example,” says Itskovich, “in the food space, the packaging pales in comparison to the food inside the packaging. There’s a big difference between the thing that sounds good and the thing that matters.”</p>



<p>With their business taking off, they realized that their joint professional history had some drawbacks. “One of our weaknesses as a founding team was all coming from the same company,” says Anderson. “And we did a big push to get outside of that, to recognize our blind spots and make a big effort in the first year of the company to build relationships with founders and executives from very different companies and industries.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of those blind spots was hiring. “We had to play catch-up in terms of growing the team. There was a bit of scrambling, kind of misjudging the market time,” says Anderson. For founders schooled in Stripe’s comparatively deliberate growth strategy, rapid expansion posed a challenge. Like their mentors, the founders wanted to personally meet and vet each potential new hire. But gradually, necessity and the advice of their advisors pushed them to delegate hiring responsibilities to other trusted people on their team. “For Watershed, this climate tech market arrived like a tidal wave,” says Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, all three admit that even in their most optimistic projections, they were blown away by that tidal wave. “I think we were very wrong in 2019—we thought it was gonna be five to 10 years before the climate imperative broadened out from these early adopters,” says Anderson. But the reality is that the industry was hungry for what they were offering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They attribute this hunger to a broader, collective climate awakening. Not only the kind that’s reflected in accelerating legislation and subsidies and technological progress, but, perhaps more important, the kind I saw outside my window earlier this summer, the kind that’s apparent in wildfire smoke and canceled flights and record-breaking heat and rising tides and shrinking biodiversity. The kind of existential awakening that’s increasingly become difficult to deny, on a personal or a professional level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis believes that this awakening has triggered a fundamental corporate shift, “from a mindset around environmentalism as conservation, to solving climate change as an economic, industrial, technological, capitalistic endeavor,” he says. “We have to build a ton of stuff. And the thing that has changed is that clean technologies are a lot cheaper today than they were 10 years ago.” It helps that today, as Maguire puts it, “Certain green technologies have already gotten so good. They’re already better and cheaper.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Certain green technologies have already gotten so good. They’re already better and cheaper.”</p>
Shaun Maguire</blockquote>



<p>This is why a large part of Watershed’s mission is to make it impossible for corporations to participate in climate denial on economic grounds. “I think the fundamental thing that enables Watershed is that even the most ruthless business can prioritize climate right now,” says Anderson. “We can surface the data so they can cut 20 to 40% of carbon today, and then there’ll be another 20 to 40% available by the time you’re done because of technological progress.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sangwon Suh, Watershed’s head scientist and former <a href="https://www.unep.org/">UNEP</a> member, sees businesses as playing an instrumental role in combating climate change. “So many changes are induced by the private sector,” says Suh. “If we can harness the power of the private sector—a sector that’s quick, efficient and not subject to congressional consensus—I think that there is a reason to be hopeful and optimistic about solving this climate change problem.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anderson sees this corporate climate awakening as fundamentally social, feeding off of communication. “I think the x variable that we failed to factor in was that there would be this feedback loop of, as more companies get in, and you get more proof points, it’s easier for the next company to get in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these shifts in mindsets, technologies and climate mean that much more of the world is now attuned to the reality of climate change. “At least in the business world, we’re past the climate denialism phase,” says Anderson. But as all three founders experienced at one point or another, more understanding can also mean more dread. “Climate doomerism is the feeling that there’s nothing [we can] do. Or the only thing that we can do is some sort of complete systemic change that eradicates existing businesses altogether. This is one of these other challenges—getting really clear data to businesses on the short-term action that you could actually do that will actually move the numbers this year,” says Anderson. “I think if we can just keep getting that message successfully out there, it’ll succeed.”</p>



 



<p>Now that more corporations are awakened to the challenge, the real work can begin. “We have a long way to go, but already more than 527 million tons of CO2 are managed by companies that use Watershed,” says Francis. “So we’ve gotta scale that number up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While most people would find the task daunting, Watershed’s founders see more reasons for optimism than ever, in part because of their front-row seat to all of the talent and ingenuity being devoted to averting the climate crisis. “Cement and steel are great examples of industry sectors where historically there has been no low-carbon alternative,” says Anderson. “And we are just now at the threshold of having commercially viable low-carbon options for both.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carbon removal technologies are also making strides. Suh is particularly excited about “biological approaches like growing biomass and turning that into more permanent storage for carbon, or using carbon to produce more permanent polymers that do not degrade over time.” he says. There’s also the development of “direct air capture,” a solution that works by capturing carbon from the air, heating it up to the point of saturation, then storing it all in rock form where it can’t leak back into the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Every week at our all-hands, we have this thing called climate corner,” says Itskovich. In recent meetings, the team has learned about which materials in the apparel industry are most emissive (animal-based products like wool), about ways to create lower-carbon cement (reducing the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement_clinker">clinker</a>) and about pathways to net-zero emissions from aviation (replacing fossil jet fuel with biofuels or synthetic fuels).&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s this idea, this regular, communal exposure to climate science, more than anything else the founders have told me, that feels like an answer to my question of why their climate awakenings occurred earlier than most. Crucially, it also reveals an answer of sorts to how we can ensure that others have similar awakenings before it’s too late. For Watershed’s founders, it took seeing the impacts of climate change, but it also took engaging in a meaningful climate dialogue with people they trusted. It’s what Watershed is doing internally, and it’s a conversation they’re continuing to foster in the private sector around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re doing a rafting trip with our executive team in Montana in late September,” Francis shares as we wrap up our conversation, a reminder of the foundational joy that fuels all their urgency and long hours and coding and selling and problem-solving. “It would be the first time we’ve done an outdoors trip with a broader group within the company—but I think it could be very successful,” adds Anderson with a smile. That “could” seems to imply that the trio hasn’t completely ruled out sprint-hiking from the agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Recently, Brave announced the first step of our goal to bring Leo—our privacy-preserving AI assistant in the browser—to Brave mobile with our <a>Android release</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Brave is happy to announce the completion of this goal, with the release of Leo for iOS. iPhone and iPad users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages and PDFs, translate pages, create content, and more from the browser address bar.</p>
<p>Leo enables natural conversations on a wide range of topics. With AI built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way.</p>
<p>For the second half of our mobile launch, we’ve added in a special feature available only on iOS. With voice-to-text capability, iOS users can speak their input and have it converted to text without needing to type. This streamlines the interaction and makes conveying information to the AI assistant even easier. Couple this with document integrations and <a>new models like Mixtral</a>, and Leo for iOS becomes a powerful, mobile AI assistant you can take with you wherever you go.</p>

 What can Leo do? 
<p>Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages you’re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:</p>
 
 Create real-time summaries of webpages and PDFs 
 Answer questions about content 
 Get instant answers for queries 
 Generate new long-form written content such as reports, articles, or social media 
 Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them 
 Write and suggest software code for multiple languages&nbsp; 
 
<p>In addition to these great core use cases, we integrated Leo in the Brave browser app especially with mobile users in mind, including:</p>
 
 Voice-to-text: Use your iOS device’s voice-to-text functionality to speak prompts directly to Leo, converting your spoken words into written text without typing. 
 Docs and PDF summaries: Leo can summarize different types of content files—including PDFs—making it much easier to consume dense content on a small screen. 
 Google Docs integration: You can use Leo to power your mobile productivity with the Google Docs and Google Sheets integration. Brainstorm and assist on writing, create quick summaries, translate, and more. 
 
<p>With Leo on iOS, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, there’s no login or signup required—you just open your browser and chat.</p>

 Mixtral as the default LLM brings higher quality answers 
<p>Brave Leo gives access to several high-quality large-language models (LLMs), ensuring better, more relevant answers to even niche questions, and fewer of the hallucinations that plague other AI experiences.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Leo includes access to Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B. Mixtral—the default LLM—can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, <a>we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM</a> for Leo on desktop, and we’ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for iOS as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.</p>

 Leo Premium&nbsp; 
<p>The Brave Leo experience is free to all users. For those who’d like access to higher rate limits, however, Leo is also available as a Premium experience. Users can subscribe to Leo Premium for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$14.99/month</a>, and one subscription covers up to 5 different devices across iOS, Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.</p>

 Smart AI, still private by default 
<p>As with all of Brave’s other features, privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. These specific privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address. 
 Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as <a>IP address</a>), and no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models. If you select a model from Anthropic and submit Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted. See more in our <a>Privacy Policy</a>. 
 No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo. 
 Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience. 
 

 What’s next for Leo, and how to get started 
<p>Brave Leo for iOS is now available to all Brave iOS users who’ve updated to version 1.63. Note that it will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today.</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on page chat experience, iOS users can tap “…” and then tap Leo to get started.</p>
<p>Leo is an opt-in feature and can be disabled at any time. Users can easily disable auto suggestions by going to Settings, tapping Leo and disabling Show autocomplete suggestions in the address bar.</p>

<p>Anish Mohammed, Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist at Panther Protocol, recently joined Meher Roy on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwhBWdn3R5M&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Epicenter Podcast</a>. They discussed Anish’s journey into crypto, the genesis of Panther Protocol, how Panther will preserve the privacy of its users, what’s coming in its Mainnet launch, and its mission to enable privacy and compliance in the DeFi space.&nbsp;</p> Who is Anish Mohammed? <p>Anish Mohammed’s foray into the tech world began at Ericsson, where he developed payment systems and became familiar with cryptography. His two decade-long career in security and cryptography has seen him design and audit several blockchain protocols and advise leading Web3 projects. His previous roles include being the lead security architect at HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group, and he’s held strategic positions at Accenture and Capgemini. Four years ago, Anish and Oliver Gale embarked on a journey to found Panther Protocol, a Zero-Knowledge, cross-protocol layer to safeguard user data and facilitate compliant DeFi access.</p> The need to preserve privacy and enable compliance <p>Panther Protocol addresses a critical gap in current blockchain technologies, where public ledgers like Bitcoin and Ethereum expose all transactions and smart contract interactions. This lack of privacy can disadvantage high-performing investors and significantly impact high-volume traders and corporations, who may want to protect the insights and advantages (or alpha) gleaned from their trading strategies. Unlike many 'dark’ pools and privacy chains, which lack transparency and complicate regulatory compliance, Panther provides DeFi users with access to its privacy-preserving protocol but also enables their transaction history to be disclosed to anyone of their choosing, in part or as a whole, at will, enabling compliance. For example, a user might disclose certain information to a tax authority or a regulator, as required in their jurisdiction. Panther uses Zero-Knowledge proof-enabled KYC checks to ensure malicious actors do not use the protocol.</p> Preserving privacy amid disclosure <p>While Panther Protocol allows users to disclose transactions as needed, Panther takes steps to ensure there is always sufficient overall volume to mask non-disclosed transactions effectively.</p><p>One key component of how this gets done is via network participants who are rewarded for staking their assets to generate additional transactions and increase liquidity pools. In the process, the privacy of non-disclosed transactions is preserved.&nbsp;</p> The importance of Shielded Pools for DeFi's future <p>Shielded Pools are at the heart of Panther Protocol, offering a privacy-centric solution for DeFi transactions. These pools, supported by advanced cryptographic methods like zk-SNARKs, allow users to transact while retaining the option to disclose information for compliance. The Shielded Pool is pivotal for the Protocol, enabling users to interact with DeFi applications privately and securely.</p><p>For a deeper dive into Shielded Pools, including the intricacies of Zones and Zone Managers, visit<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-shielded-pools-the-cornerstone-of-panther-protocol/"> Panther’s blog on </a>Shielded Pools.</p> What’s coming in Panther’s Mainnet beta launch? <p>Anish presented some of the features that Protocol participants can expect to see in the upcoming&nbsp; Mainnet beta product:&nbsp;</p>  zAccount registration. A zAccount is your private identity and entry point to Panther, aligning with KYC protocols and using Zero-Knowledge proofs.  Privacy-staking reward mechanism: Panther incentivizes network participants to enhance the pool’s transaction set and liquidity by staking assets.  Transactions and communication between Zones: exchange of assets and information across different Zones in Panther.  Withdrawals: The action of converting and transferring zAssets back to standard tokens.  Basic disclosures: The user can reveal details about transactions conducted within Panther, allowing for compliance and verification.  Advanced disclosures: Offers users the capability to selectively disclose specific aspects of their transactions, providing flexibility in privacy and compliance.  zAccount renewals: Regular verification and update of a user’s KYC information to ensure ongoing compliance and integrity of their zAccount.  DeFi Swap adapter: A tool that integrates Panther with external DeFi platforms, facilitating private and compliant swaps and other transactions.  zTrade: Zero-Knowledge trades with others in the same Zone.   Conclusion <p>As DeFi continues to evolve, the need for on-chain privacy solutions that accommodate regulatory compliance becomes increasingly critical. Panther Protocol, under the guidance of Co-Founder Anish Mohammed, is at the forefront of addressing this challenge. By pioneering Shielded Pools and facilitating the role of Zone Managers, Panther is setting a new standard for privacy preservation and compliance in DeFi. Panther Protocol’s innovative approach protects users’ data and paves the way for institutional participation in the DeFi ecosystem. As Panther progresses toward its next development phases, the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">call for testers</a> lets you, the community contribute to a more private and compliant DeFi future.&nbsp;</p><p>Join Panther’s journey in shaping a balanced world where privacy meets compliance, empowering users and institutions to navigate the DeFi landscape securely and transparently.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

         TL;DR&nbsp; 
 
 Horizen’s proof verification chain is live on testnet!&nbsp; 
 Aims to redefine blockchain efficiency with ZK proof verification and settlement layers 
 Marks a significant milestone for web3 as the first instance of a modular proof verification network 
 Future plans include enhancing zkStack compatibility and opening up testnet access to the public 
 
<p>We are excited to announce that Horizen has achieved a major milestone: the deployment of our proof verification chain to testnet.&nbsp; This leap forward signals a new era for the Horizen ecosystem, where we aim to redefine blockchain efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
 Backstory: 
<p>Horizen is pioneering a new layer in the modular blockchain stack focusing on ZK proofs verification and settlement. This focus dramatically reduces costs and improves efficiency for zk rollups and appchains. Following the passing of <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP 42400</a>, we have been heads down building and leveraging dev tools like Substrate, Polkascan, and other open-source resources to bring our vision to life rapidly. Check out this 10-minute demo to see Horizen’s proof verification chain live in action!</p>     
 

 
                     
             
                                    
                                 
            
         
        
             

 
         
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why This Matters? 
<p>The launch of this testnet marks a significant point for the broader web3 space as the first instance of a modular proof verification network. The New Horizen network is composed of the following key components:</p>
 
 A Revamped Mainchain: Powered by Substrate, the Horizen mainchain is the foundation for our modular proof verification network. This network allows for the exchange of $ZEN (Horizen’s native token) and verification of FFLONK Proofs produced by Polygon zkEVM instances. 
 Proof Submission Interface: A user-friendly interface that enables zk-rollups to submit proofs seamlessly to the Horizen network for verification. 
 Attestation Mechanism: A protocol published on date to Ethereum and validates proofs (providing additional transparency). 
 New Horizen Smart Contract: The storage and validation mechanism on Ethereum that allows Horizen users to verify that their proof was included in an attestation. 
 Polygon zk-EVM Rollup: A rollup built with Polygon’s CDK that generates and submits proofs to Horizen’s proof verification chain. 
 
 Looking Ahead: 
<p>Celebrating this milestone is just the beginning. Horizen is committed to pioneering advancements in the modular blockchain space, focusing on dramatically reducing costs and improving efficiency for rollups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are already setting our sights on the next development phase, with lots of exciting developments on the horizon!</p>
<p>Here’s what you can expect from us in the coming months:</p>
 
 Enhanced Compatibility with zkStack: We aim to expand the compatibility of New Horizen with zkStack, and further broaden its interoperability and market reach. 
 Opening Up Access to the Public: In the spirit of bringing our community along for feedback, we will open up access for the Horizen community to run testnet nodes and become validators.

<p>As of <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra-launcher/releases/tag/v0.0.0-alpha.1">Zebra Launcher v0.0.0-alpha.1</a>, there are now installers for Windows, MacOS, and Debian.</p>



<p>The Zebra Launcher bundles the compiled binary from the latest zebrad code on the main branch, as of the March 7th 2024, <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/tree/9b91d4bc0e7a78566e62af8b129c14be82f8d67e">commit</a>, with the latest changes in zcash_script from<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/108"> Restore Windows support with MSVC</a> building on another hack sprint project for restoring Windows support to Zebra. (Thanks Conrado!!) It streams Zebra’s logs to a native desktop application window, displays Zebra’s configuration, and allows for updating the configuration from within the app.</p>



<p>Made with a web-based UI and a Rust backend, it uses <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a> as the application framework for inter-process communication and SolidJS as its UI framework.</p>



<p>SolidJS is a relatively new UI framework with a reactive architecture for managing state and displaying updates that offers a robust developer experience, a minimal memory footprint, and minimal updates to the webview that helps keep the UI quick when it’s displaying lots of data and to keep the project maintainable as it grows.</p>



<p>Using a web-based UI with Tauri and SolidJS allows for embedding other web-based projects, such as Grafana or Zingo-PC, into the Zebra Launcher’s UI, enabling users to access them all in one place.</p>



<p></p>



 What’s Next 



<p>The Zebra Launcher currently includes checks and example data for displaying previews of its appearance in-browser without the Rust backend, and a CI workflow for deploying those previews on every pull request so that it’s easy to review style changes. However, there aren’t any automated tests checking the states in either the TypeScript frontend or the Rust backend, we would need to add these initial tests to help find and fix bugs, and to ensure that bugs aren’t reintroduced as we add features or make changes.</p>



<p>There are also several low-effort, high-impact fixes and improvements on the horizon:</p>



 
 Zebra icons (it currently uses the default Tauri icons) 



 Adding a system-tray menu and keeping the zebrad process running when the Zebra Launcher window is closed. 



 Enabling Tauri’s built-in updater so users are notified when updates are available and so that it’s as easy as possible to download and install those updates. 



 Buttons for starting and stopping zebrad. 



 Bundling external binaries for Prometheus and Grafana, and embedding the Grafana dashboard in the Zebra Launcher UI. 
 



<p></p>



<p>There are other ideas for features that could require more effort and which could be prioritized based on community feedback:</p>



 
 Community page for keeping up with the latest updates across ZCash Discord servers, the Community Forum, and the Zebra Github repository, or to inform us about bugs and development opportunities. 



 Validated form for updating Zebra’s configuration 



 A dashboard page and search bar 



 Progress bars based on Prometheus metrics. 



 Embedded desktop wallet in the Zebra Launcher UI such as Zingo-PC. 
 



<p>We want to provide a delightful user-experience for our community, which is what motivated us to work on this project, and we’re excited about the opportunities for making it better.</p>



<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra-app/releases/tag/v0.0.0-alpha.1">try it out by downloading and running the installer for your operating system</a> and let us know what you think! We would also welcome any improvements to the project in the form of issues, discussions, or PRs on the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra-app">zebra-launcher Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>It was really fun for me to participate in the last Zebra Hackathon Sprint, a 2-week period to be creative, explore new ideas and build some proof of concept projects.&nbsp;This time I worked on <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/openapi.html">an OpenAPI specification for Zebra RPC methods</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Zebra OpenAPI Specification 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In order to provide a documentation resource for Zebra RPC methods, an openapi.yaml specification was added to Zebra,<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/openapi.yaml"> located at the root of the project</a>. This file can be pasted into <a href="https://editor.swagger.io/">Swagger Editor</a> to automatically render documentation for Zebra’s RPC methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
Zebra API in Swagger
 &nbsp; 
<p>If you have a zebrad node running at http://localhost:8232 you will be able to send commands to the blockchain and retrieve data. Otherwise, you can still view the documentation for the methods in the Swagger interface. More information can be found at the<a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/openapi.html"> Zebra OpenAPI book page</a>. The OpenAPI proof of concept pull request is available<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/8342"> here</a>.</p>
<p>If there is interest, this documentation could be hosted somewhere similar to <a href="https://zcash.github.io/rpc/">https://zcash.github.io/rpc/</a>, and be kept up to date with changes and additions to Zebra’s RPC interface. In the meantime, please try it out and let us know what you think!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Credit is a widely used term, which could essentially be summarised as “more capital so you can do whatever you want”. In DeFi, there are numerous ways of getting exposure to an asset in a leveraged manner: from looping to perpetuals and margin trading, the possibilities are endless (especially when you also account for synthetic versions).

Due to the new <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855">EIP-3855</a>, it is possible to use the new instruction PUSH0, which pushes the constant value 0 onto the stack. Please note this is used by Solidity compiler from version 0.8.20.&nbsp;  There are important changes in the deployment phase introduced by <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860">EIP-3860</a>.&nbsp;  The introduction of a maximum size limit for smart contract initcode.  The introduction of a charge of 2 gas for every 32-byte chunk of initcode.    <p><br>List features from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0</p><p>Updated to the 0.11.0 SDK version</p>  The 1.3.0 version has been updated to the 0.11.0 SDK version. See the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sidechains-SDK/blob/dev/doc/release/0.11.0.md">SDK release notes</a> for a detailed explanation.  <p>Forger reward address</p>  It is now possible to set up in the configuration the reward address that will be inserted in blocks produced by the forger. See SDK release notes for more details.  &nbsp;If using docker, you can just configure the env property SCNODE_FORGER_REWARD_ADDRESS: the config file will be automatically generated accordingly.  <p>Custom log4j file support in docker</p>  If using docker, it is now possible to configure the env property SCNODE_LOG4J_CUSTOM_CONFIG to use a completely custom log4j configuration file. See ‘Advanced logging customization’ section at this link <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/main/doc/howto/customlog.md">https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/main/doc/howto/customlog.md</a> for further info.  <p>Pause forging</p>  Please be aware that starting from this version EON block production may temporarily pause if the mainchain block production slows down: EON forgers will automatically stop to produce new blocks if in the latest 99 EON Blocks no reference to mainchain blocks is present.  <p>EIP-3651 Support</p>  <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651">EIP-3651</a>: Warm COINBASE: with this EIP, the forger address will be loaded at the beginning of a transaction in order to save some gas for the methods that use it.  <p><br>For more information, follow the official <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/">EON Documentation</a> guide.

<p>We’ve gathered insights from our team of web3 experts who are eager to share their most valuable tips with you. Whether you’re just considering using blockchain or already knee-deep in the technology, our experts have got you covered. With our wealth of experience and learnings along the way, our web3 experts are here to offer you valuable insights and guidance.</p>



<p>Top web3 expert tips for web3 projects:</p>



 
 Decrease time to market 



 Ask the community to avoid mistakes 



 Address compliance at an early stage 



 Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 
 



<p></p>



 Expert Tip #1: Decrease time to market 



<p>In the fast-paced web3 world, time is everything. New applications pop up daily, not to mention the numerous new players that enter the space.</p>



<p>By decreasing the time to market, you can launch your product before your competitors. Additionally, it allows you to receive feedback from the (web3) community early on, which can help you refine your product. But remember, this whole web3 space is also new to them. Innovation takes time to sink in. Finally, a faster time-to-market can help you avoid running out of resources before your product even gets to market.</p>



<p>Simplicity is key. By prioritising a smooth and seamless process, and abstracting away as much technical complexity as possible, you create better experiences for your customers and increase your chances of success.</p>







<p></p>



 Expert Tip #2: Ask the community to avoid mistakes 



<p>For a novel and complex technology, it is essential to have a second pair of eyes on all your software. By involving the community and asking for help, you can ensure that your project is built on a solid foundation and has the best chance of success.</p>



<p>Many projects fail because people rush into building something without asking around. Newcomers to the field may not realise the potential challenges they could encounter, many of which may have already been resolved by others. There are public forums for developers and all types of project participants, including technology-focused and business-focused groups.</p>



<p>However, in the web3 space, there remain many solutions that are new and lack proper documentation, making it even more critical to consider what works and what doesn’t work. So, how do you ensure you get the best advice?</p>



<p>Firstly, ensure that you talk to a diverse group of industry players from different budgets and backgrounds. Secondly, clearly understand your project requirements and what you need help with. Clear communication will help your community understand what it is you are trying to achieve and where you might need improvements. Finally, always be respectful and appreciative of people’s time and efforts.</p>



<p></p>



 Expert Tip #3: Address compliance at an early stage 



<p>Before spending a considerable amount on building a minimum viable product (MVP), it is crucial to at least have a quick chat with a seasoned lawyer, to explore potential legal issues. A relatively small investment will help to identify any legal challenges related to your plans. For example, regulatory issues for custodial wallets, property law for tokenisation, intellectual property for NFTs, and GDPR compliance for web3 wallets and public chains. <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy/">Inserting legal know-how at an early stage</a> might save tons of costs and a lot of time. It might prevent you from completely re-developing or spending precious resources on a project doomed from a regulatory perspective. Professional legal involvement will sit well with investors too.</p>



<p>At Zaisan, we understand that the law might look like a scary beast, but that compliance is essential for the success of your blockchain project. It’s too often that this initial, relatively small spending saves the day.</p>



   



 Expert Tip #4: Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 



<p>One common challenge faced by many blockchain projects is the lack of users, particularly those projects that rely on transactional volumes such as wallets, exchanges, and marketplaces. Furthermore, when a project has a tradable token, there is a high chance that it can become volatile, which can make the project unusable. To mitigate these risks, we suggest that you ensure your project is sustainable through budget planning and mitigating volatility risks by hedging.</p>



<p>It’s important to avoid basing your business model solely on the token on which it is running. Instead, use business logic and design the project in a way that it doesn’t have overdependence on the system token. You could mitigate the risk by using stablecoins and a variable pricing model.</p>



<p>Introducing crypto or tokens to a project has its pros and cons. On the one hand, leveraging cryptocurrency or tokens can provide a new level of flexibility and accessibility, enabling streamlined transactions and potentially unlocking new revenue streams. Additionally, it can foster community engagement and loyalty through token incentives and reward systems. However, this approach also comes with its challenges, including regulatory compliance complexities, volatility in token values, and the need for robust security measures to safeguard against cyber threats and fraud. Therefore, careful consideration and strategic planning are essential to navigate the intricacies of integrating crypto or tokens effectively into a project. </p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>As the week draws to a close, we’re excited to share the latest developments and progress with our community. This update covers a range of key advancements in both our ecosystem and product development:</p> Ecosystem updates  Panther integrates Kyber Network to revolutionize private access to DEXs <p>We are thrilled to announce our <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1768211882584797674?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">integration with the Kyber Network</a> to revolutionize private access to DEXs while minimizing slippage. With the integration, Panther users can execute trades through the Kyber Network aggregator, which sources liquidity from multiple DEXs. These trades are wrapped in Panther’s privacy-enhancing technology, ensuring that the details of the transactions remain confidential. </p> Blog: how Panther zAssets enhance user privacy in DeFi <p>Our<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/product-insights-how-panther-zassets-enhance-user-privacy-in-defi/"> latest blog </a>examines how Panther’s multi-chain privacy-preserving protocol intends to offer users access to public ledger liquidity while providing transactional anonymity.&nbsp;</p> Panther’s CTO, Anish Mohammed, joins ZK Demo Day as a judge&nbsp; <p>Our Co-Founder and CTO, Anish Mohammed, recently participated as a judge at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhBL4CPcMrc&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ZK Demo Day</a>, where he shared the stage with notable leaders from Blackrock, top venture capital firms, Web3 protocols, and other industry leaders. In addition, Anish was also recently invited as a guest on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwhBWdn3R5M&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Epicenter Podcast</a>. The podcast focused on discussing on-chain privacy, the vision and progress of Panther Protocol, and our milestones ahead.</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update <p>We’re glad to share that we’ve debuted on<a href="https://airdrops.io/panther-protocol/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Airdrops.io</a> to promote Panther testnet rewards and welcome more participants to Panther community. The testnet currently has over 1500 participants, and we’ve distributed over 500,000 $ZKP as rewards.</p><p>The team is planning to launch a Zealy-based incentivized ambassador program next week to further improve community participation and promote Panther.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our testnet rewards pot is 2 million $ZKP — have you signed up for our test dApp yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testing group and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a third party Relayer service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract. The team is currently performing integration testing with the second Relayer. Overall, the team is pleased with how well the end-to-end Relayer integration process is working. The team is still working on Stage 5 in parallel with other stages and expects to release it next week for community testing.</p><p>As you might be aware, Oshiya (previously known as Miner) optimizes gas usage by processing batches of newly created UTXOs and updating a Zero-Knowledge proof in a Merkle tree, which introduces a slight delay in batch creation. This process takes place in what’s called the Bus Tree, likened to the communal efficiency of a bus ride.</p><p>For users seeking immediate UTXO updates in the Merkle tree, we offer the Taxi Tree option, which promises faster processing, similar to taking a taxi. Last week, our team successfully deployed the Taxi Tree contract on the Mumbai testnet. The user interface has been updated to allow users to choose between Regular Processing (using the Bus) and Fast Processing (using a Taxi). In Stage 6, users will also be able to compare the network costs associated with these two processing options.</p><p>In addition, we have developed an exchange contract to facilitate the payment of Relayers in native tokens. This contract enables the conversion of $ZKP to $Matic via UniswapV3 on the Polygon network, streamlining transactions and enhancing our ecosystem’s functionality.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. The FeeMaster contract has been upgraded and is currently being reviewed. We anticipate that the Fee Master review will be complete this week and ready for deployment.&nbsp;</p><p>Smart Contracts for Stage 6 is completed with final rounds of internal testing ongoing. The next two weeks will be utilized to get the dApp development close to completion and launch stage 6 for community testing by the end of the month however, we will know precise dates after a week.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>As technology progresses, infrastructure should be commoditised, especially in Web3, in order to avoid the creation of bottlenecks and gatekeepers. Blockchains are naturally oblivious to off-chain data, so they need oracles to fetch data. However, given their past technical limitations, oracles have failed to provide a decentralised and permissionless framework for data query. SEDA seeks to change this by creating an intent-based modular data layer, which brings off-chain data on-chain, in order for it to be available to any party, regardless of who requested it first.</p><p>We were joined by Jasper De Goojier, co-founder of SEDA Protocol, to discuss the oracle landscape and how SEDA aims to decentralise it and make data access permissionless.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jasper’s background  High level overview of SEDA  Oracle use cases  How SEDA Protocol functions  Intent-based data availability  Verifying subjective data &amp; LLM integration  ZKPs &amp; FHE for data privacy  Interoperability &amp; bridging  Roadmap &amp; optimistic oracles  SEDA token migration  Chain abstraction  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jasperflux">Jasper De Goojier on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/sedaprotocol">SEDA Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

        <p>This ZenIP proposes lowering the thresholds required for:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) formally submitting both technical and non-technical improvement proposals; and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) achieving a quorum of votes for both technical and non-technical improvement proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes would increase accessibility for community members to put forth proposals and would bring quorum requirements in line with the broader web3 industry standards. Please note that these proposed changes apply to both Zen improvement proposals (ZenIPs) and EON improvement proposals (EONIPs).</p>
<p>ZenIP 42401 aims to make it easier for community members to participate in governance by lowering the $ZEN threshold required for posting a non-technical ZenIP/ EONIP for community vote, as well as lowering the quorum threshold for a vote to be considered valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current thresholds for both ZenIPs and EONIPs are as follows:</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 200,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 10% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 
<p>This ZenIP proposes the following changes to the thresholds:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 200,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating (vs. 10% currently) 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 25,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 100,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 3% of circulating supply participating (vs. 5% currently) 
 
 
 
<p>Again, if ZenIP 42401 passes, these changes will apply to both ZenIPs and EONIPs. There are also no changes proposed to the majority requirements for either proposal type (i.e., 67% of votes in favor for technical proposals, simple majority in favor for non-technical proposals).</p>
 ZenIP Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are public proposals for the Horizen community to approve or decline. We encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> on ZenIP 42401 and share your thoughts on the proposal. We also encourage you to read the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42401-updating-proposal-and-quorum-thresholds/440">ZenIP 42401: Updating Proposal and Quorum Thresholds</a> post on Discourse to get a complete understanding of this proposal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42401 will start on Tuesday, March 12th, 2024 at 12pm EST and end on Friday, March 15th, 2024 at 12pm EST.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen DAO voting is done on the Horizen EON chain, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. The snapshot is taken once voting begins.</p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see the vote instructions detailed tutorial, please have a look to the dedicated blogpost. Below we cover an overview of how to vote.&nbsp;</p>
 How to vote – Instructions 
<p>Your vote will be weighted regarding the tokens you hold, either on the Horizen mainchain (the historic one) or Horizen EON (the EVM chain).</p>
<p>If you already linked your mainchain address for a previous vote, you won’t have to connect it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Connect your wallet and verify if it’s properly linked here.</a></p>
<p>The vote happens on Snapshot and is done through MetaMask and therefore via the Horizen EON network.</p>
<p>Before going through the tutorial, we assume that the Horizen EON network is properly configured on your MetaMask wallet. If not, <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">please follow this guide</a>.</p>
 A/ You already voted and linked you mainchain address 
<p>Then it’s very simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still encourage you to verify if your mainchain address is properly linked on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance app</a>.</p>
<p>If it’s not linked, follow the tutorial just below.</p>
<p>If it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
 B/ You have to link your mainchain address 
<p>1/ First, make sure to have some ZEN on Horizen EON, you will need some gas tokens in order to interact with the EVM chain, link your address, and vote.</p>
<p>2/ Now it’s time to link your mainchain address(es). Any ZEN on Arizen, Sphere By Horizen, ZEN wallet, Swing wallet, or multi-sig wallets, Ledger, ZEN on exchanges are usable. Here, we will focus on Sphere By Horizen. If you need assistance for non Sphere By Horizen wallets linking, please have a look to this <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/how-to-link-the-mainchain-address-to-the-horizen-eon-address/174">post on the Horizen forum</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get a more <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">detailed tutorial with a screenshot in the Governance doc</a>, but here are the steps:</p>
 
 Make sure Horizen EON is configured on MetaMask and to have some ZEN on there thanks to the steps stated above. 
 Open the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance</a> page. 
 Click Connect Wallet. The EON wallet (MetaMask) appears in the top-right corner. Once connected, the EON address field is automatically filled with the connected EON address.
 
 Note: If the EON wallet (MetaMask) was previously connected to the Horizen Governance app, then it is automatically connected. 
 
 
 Open Sphere By Horizen and navigate to the mainchain wallet address you want to link to the EON address. Click the Information icon to view your address. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, click Link Mainchain Address.&nbsp; 
 The Link Address pop-up appears. Paste the Sphere wallet address in the Mainchain Address field. 
 Copy your EON address. 
 In Sphere, go to the Addresses pane. Click the compose icon (hand holding pencil). 
 The Sign message with address pop-up appears. Paste the EON address in the message field and click on Create signature. The mainchain signature appears below the message field. Then click on COPY TO CLIPBOARD. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, paste the signature in the Mainchain Signature field. 
 Click Link. The Pending pop-up appears stating that the transaction is being submitted. 
 The MetaMask Notification appears. Read the information details. Click Confirm. 
 The Linked Address appears showing that the EON Address and Mainchain Address are linked 
 You can repeat the process for other addresses. 
 
<p>Now that it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We also have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To do that:</p>
 
 Download and create an address on Sphere By Horizen if you don’t have any. You will also have to send some ZEN to this address; 
 Open the address you want to use, select the option to send ZEN; 
 Check the “Sidechain transaction” button to make appear the list of Horizen sidechains 
 Select “Horizen EON”; 
 Enter YOUR MetaMask address in the “Send to” field; 
 Enter the amount you want to send, knowing that 0.1ZEN will be largely enough; 
 Then click on “confirm”; 
 Some minutes after, you should see the ZEN on your MetaMask wallet, so let’s go for the next step; 
 
<p></p>
<p>2/ Now it’s time to link your mainchain addresses. Any ZEN on Arizen, Sphere By Horizen, ZEN wallet, Swing wallet, or multi-sig wallets, Ledger, ZEN on exchanges are usable.

If you need assistance for non Sphere By Horizen wallets linking, please have a look to this <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/how-to-link-the-mainchain-address-to-the-horizen-eon-address/174">post on the Horizen forum</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get a more <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">detailed tutorial with a screenshot in the Governance doc</a>, but here are the steps:</p>
 
 Make sure Horizen EON is configured on MetaMask and to have some ZEN on there thanks to the steps stated above. 
 Open the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance</a> page. 
 Click Connect Wallet. The EON wallet (MetaMask) appears in the top-right corner. Once connected, the EON address field is automatically filled with the connected EON address.
 
 Note: If the EON wallet (MetaMask) was previously connected to the Horizen Governance app, then it is automatically connected. 
 
 
 Open Sphere By Horizen and navigate to the mainchain wallet address you want to link to the EON address. Click the Information icon to view your address, then Copy it. 
 
<p></p>
 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, click Link Mainchain Address. 
 The Link Address pop-up appears. Paste the Sphere wallet address in the Mainchain Address field. 
 Copy the EON address from the connected wallet to the Horizen Governance app. 
 In Sphere, go to the Addresses pane. Click the compose icon (hand holding pencil). 
 
<p></p>
 
 The Sign message with address pop-up appears. Paste the EON address in the message field and click on Create signature. The mainchain signature appears below the message field. Then click on COPY TO CLIPBOARD. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Click COPY TO CLIPBOARD. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, paste the signature in the Mainchain Signature field. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Click Link. The Pending pop-up appears stating that the transaction is being submitted. 
 The MetaMask Notification appears. Read the information details. Click Confirm. 
 The Linked Address appears showing that the EON Address and Mainchain Address are linked 
 You can repeat the process for other addresses. 
 
<p>Now that it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We also have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the adoption of blockchain-based payment surges, the need for on-chain privacy is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-files-for-privacy-etf-with-sec-zcash-part-of-offering.htm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=Crypto-focused%20asset%20manager%20Grayscale,be%20an%20industry-first%20fund">capturing the spotlight</a>. Privacy is particularly important for institutional users and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs). And, the problem is that any public, pseudonymous blockchain reveals transaction details.&nbsp;</p><p>From wallet addresses, to gas fees, to transaction value, and the tokens traded; transaction data is public. This enables transaction linkage, which exposes a huge data exhaust that may ultimately result in wallet:identity mapping. Simply attempting to make a trade can trigger MEV front-running; even price discovery can be followed. Neither privacy nor confidentiality are a feature of public ledgers.</p><p>Let’s examine how Panther’s multi-chain privacy-preserving protocol intends to offer users access to public ledger liquidity while providing transactional anonymity.&nbsp;</p> A vision for regulatory-compliant, on-chain privacy <p>Panther Protocol breaks the links between the wallet initiating the trade and the trade itself, i.e. it enhances transaction privacy: specifically, it preserves identity, the assets traded, and value transferred. This privacy is granted by Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pools</a>. Shielded Pools, known in TradFi as dark pools, obscure the trade initiator whose privacy must be preserved from peer traders and external liquidity sources.&nbsp;</p><p>The Shielded Pool acts like a walled garden: only invited users and assets may enter. Assets are deposited in the Panther Vault, part of the Panther Smart Contract, in exchange for a zAsset, or Zero-Knowledge Asset. It’s the zAsset that masks the detail of the user’s trades from observation.</p> What is a zAsset? <p>A zAsset represents a digital asset that users may trade with anonymity within a Panther Shielded Pool. The technology underpinning the zAsset enables trades to be settled privately on a public ledger.</p><p>In essence, the zAsset, is a "mirror" asset that is printed when a digital asset is <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/depositing-transferring-and-withdrawing?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">deposited </a>in the Panther contract. It’s subsequently spent when that asset is withdrawn. Therefore, the zAsset:asset always exists in a strict 1:1 ratio. Users can send, swap, receive, and pay with zAssets within a Shielded Pool.&nbsp;</p> How does a zAsset enhance trading privacy? <p>A zAsset utilizes Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. ZK proofs are cryptographic protocols that enable the prover to demonstrate to the verifier that something is true without revealing the underlying data required to form that proof. For example, you could prove that you are over 18 without providing the birth certificate or ID used to generate that proof, nor indeed your actual age.&nbsp;</p><p>zAssets represent their underlying asset in the form of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). It’s these UTXOs that users trade within a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a>. To store UTXO data on-chain, the Protocol uses ZK-SNARK (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) proofs. This allows a user’s on-chain state to be stored privately and to ensure private state changes, i.e. the UTXO data that represents the asset on-chain is condensed and encrypted. This means that asset balances and balance changes are not publicly available should a Panther account address become known to an observer.&nbsp;</p><p>To the observing world, the only available data that results from a trade is that a UTXO was committed to the smart contract. Only the owner of the UTXO can decrypt the proof and ascertain the value and token that the UTXO represents.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that UTXOs are not all created equal adds further support to the privacy set. The number of UTXOs created as a result of trades does not map to the number of tokens that UTXO represents. Some UTXOs may not even represent an asset, they may prove a zero balance, or null data, allowing the activity level of the protocol itself to also be shielded.&nbsp;</p> Deepening privacy <p>Panther Protocol offers two privacy layers; one is optional, and the other is a feature of the protocol. The zAsset is the protocol’s core feature, and the Panther Relayer is a protocol service provider that adds an additional privacy-enhancing mechanism.</p><p>Panther Relayers provide an additional privacy layer by breaking the link between the initiator of the transaction and the transaction itself. These ecosystem operators charge a fee for:</p>  signing the transactions with their public key  paying the gas fees  relaying bundles of transactions to the Shielded Pool contract&nbsp;  <p>Relayers, therefore, enhance privacy, since observers are unable to pinpoint the actual address that initiated the transaction because the Relayer signs the blockchain transaction with their key.</p> A brighter, more private, public-ledger future <p>Relaying alone goes a long way to confounding transaction linking by disbursing the data exhaust when compared to a peer-to-peer or peer-to-AMM transaction. Combined with zAsset trading, we believe this suite of solutions offers the most robust, and yet compliant, trading privacy mechanism created to date.&nbsp;</p><p>As the global economy migrates to a digital native medium that operates on public ledgers, the utility of on-chain protocols will largely hinge on how effectively they implement features that confer privacy where and when it is needed. We believe that Panther Protocol’s privacy-enhancing technology solves the public ledger privacy problem. Panther Protocol has developed a mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol provides dedicated, customizable space, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a Panther Zone</a>, to empower institutions to trade in Shielded Pools with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the needs of compliant privacy-enabled DeFi in mind, Panther Zones deliver a chain-agnostic, fully decentralized, suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone for privacy-enhanced trading?

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>February was a busy month for Panther Protocol, with the launch of testnet Stage 4 supporting internal transfers and withdrawals, alongside Stage 1 technical enhancements for improved performance and the parallel development of Stages 5 &amp; 6 of the dApp. February also saw the Panther tester community grow to 900+ testers.&nbsp;</p><p>This update covers the ecosystem’s growth, product development progress, and a peek at what’s planned for March:</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 4 is live — supporting internal transfers and withdrawals <p>Testnet <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-4-is-now-live-supporting-internal-transfers-and-withdrawals/">Stage 4</a> was released in February, supporting internal transfers and withdrawals. Stage 4 allows users to send zAssets from one zAccount to another. The release of Stage 4 marks a significant step towards the protocol’s mainnet release.</p> Blog: Let’s end the taboo of on-chain privacy <p>Our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lets-end-the-taboo-of-on-chain-privacy/">latest blog</a> explores the need for a balanced approach to privacy and transparency in Web3. It stresses the importance of private transactions on the public ledgers. By comparing traditional finance’s privacy and DeFi’s transparency, we argue for a middle ground that supports global finance and compliance. Panther Protocol offers solutions to achieve this balance, aiming for a future where privacy and regulatory demands work together.</p> AMA with Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar <p>On February 8, we hosted an engaging AMA with Saif Akhtar, our Head of Product, and Joris Koopman, our Head of Community. Dive into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ-NfX_4ldY&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">the session’s recording</a> to gain comprehensive insights into the latest updates on our testnet, including the testing process, reward systems, and what we’re planning for future releases.</p> Panther testnet video guide for account creation <p>You asked – we delivered! We’ve created a video guide to help you easily create your Panther testnet account and start earning $ZKP rewards.

Here’s an overview of the enhancements made:</p><p>Panther gas management: Users can now easily transfer funds between zAssets and their Panther Gas account. This functionality is accessible by clicking the Panther Gas icon located in the top right corner of the screen (header).</p><p>UTXO consolidation for deposit: Consolidates a user’s balance into a single UTXO during deposit transactions, allowing users to utilize their entire balance in a single transaction, eliminating the need for additional MASP transactions to consolidate smaller UTXOs.</p><p>Detailed error messages: Provides users with informative error messages, improving understanding of transaction failures.</p><p>Real-time Data Synchronization: Updates to balances and vouchers are now visible in real-time, enhancing user interaction with the product.</p><p> Optimized wallet engine startup: Reduced startup time by optimizing the cold start phase.</p><p>Improved cold start for wallet engine: The ‘Create Block’ function from zAccount is incorporated into the product, allowing for scanning to start from a specific block to avoid unnecessary decryption of UTXOs created before the creation block.</p><p>Global transaction support: Allows transactions to continue in the background, even if the user navigates away, improving transaction continuity.</p><p>Visit <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Docs</a> to access the enhanced version of Panther testnet dApp</p> Plans for March&nbsp; <p>The team is working on the development of Stages 5 and 6 of the testnet in parallel and expects to release it in March.&nbsp;</p> Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a third-party Relayer service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract. The team is currently working on the integration of the Relayer into the dApp.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of testnet includes fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. The team is currently working on the fee management smart contract development. We expect to release Stage 6 for public testing in mid-March. You can learn more about Stage 6 functionalities <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/weekly-update-panther-protocol-feb-16/">here</a>.</p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs.

<p>Blockchains are, by default, public ledgers containing every transaction recorded by the network. While this ensures transparency, it also violates users’ privacy once an address is linked to an entity. Apart from creating additional risk for self-custody, institutions are also limited by what they can publicly share on a blockchain. As a result, there is great demand and utility for on-chain, compliant privacy, which still requires KYC (&amp; KYT), but protects them through cryptographic constructs. Zero knowledge proofs attest computational integrity, allowing for transactions to be bundled together and their correctness verified, without revealing each individual interaction.</p><p>We were joined by Anish Mohammed, co-founder &amp; CTO of Panther Protocol, to discuss the importance of compliant privacy for on-chain transactions, powered by zero knowledge technology.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Anish’s background  Panther’s value proposition  UX &amp; on-chain privacy  Panther’s multi-asset shielded pool architecture  KYC &amp; KYT  Shielded zones and transactions  Zone administrator  Address mapping  Roadmap &amp; Panther mainnet  Target audience &amp; adoption  Fee model &amp; tokenomics  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed">Anish Mohammed on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther">Panther Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Chris Perkins has a fascinating background as a marine who was shot at in Iraq, was at Lehman bros when it all came crashing down, was a Citigroup trying to pick up the piece of the financial crisis where he first ran across Gary Gensler, and now he’s in crypto. We talk about all that, but that’s not even the main event.</p> <p>The Main Event is Ether the asset and a new reference rate he’s building on top of it. This sounds in the weeds but it’s actually actually key to unlocking trillions in new financial products. You might call this new rate the Libor for ETH.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🏹 USE PODCAST24 FOR 10% OFF <a href="https://bankless.cc/Citizen2024">https://bankless.cc/Citizen2024</a>&nbsp;  ------ 🎧 Listen On Your Favorite Podcast Player:&nbsp; <a href="https://bankless.cc/Podcast">https://bankless.cc/Podcast</a>&nbsp;  ------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE <a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; ⁠&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>🔗CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/toku">https://bankless.cc/toku</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>🛞MANTLE | MODULAR LAYER 2 NETWORK <a href="https://bankless.cc/Mantle">https://bankless.cc/Mantle</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>💸 CRYPTO TAX CALCULATOR | USE CODE BANK30 <a href="https://bankless.cc/CTC">https://bankless.cc/CTC</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚖️ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM <a href="https://%E2%81%A0https//bankless.cc/Arbitrum">⁠https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a></p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | Swap Smarter <a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS 00:00:00 Start 00:11:33 Intro to Chris 00:13:17 From Banks To Crypto 00:16:27 Hostility Towards Crypto 00:19:16 National Security 00:25:23 Takes on Regulation 00:31:12 TradFi Response To Crypto 00:33:58 ETH ETF 00:37:24 Libor for ETH? 00:42:43 Libor Recap 00:45:35 How Was Libor Corrupted? 00:53:21 ETH Reference Rate 01:04:13 Risk Free Rate 01:10:08 Real vs Nominal Returns 01:21:51 DeFi Applications 01:26:01 Market Size 01:33:17 Going Forward</p> <p>------ RESOURCES</p> <p>CESR home page: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr">https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr</a>&nbsp;  CESR methodology document: &nbsp;<a href="https://coinfund.io/cesr/">https://coinfund.io/cesr/</a>&nbsp;  CESR Tearsheet: <a href="https://downloads.coindesk.com/cd3/CDI/CESR+Fact+Sheet.pdf">https://downloads.coindesk.com/cd3/CDI/CESR+Fact+Sheet.pdf</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>More Reading: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/26/how-staking-rates-can-drive-the-crypto-economy-forward/"> https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/26/how-staking-rates-can-drive-the-crypto-economy-forward/</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/27/five-reasons-why-the-world-needs-a-standardized-ethereum-staking-rate/"> https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/27/five-reasons-why-the-world-needs-a-standardized-ethereum-staking-rate/</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7957405/new-hope-for-crypto-derivatives-as-markets-urged-to-hail-cesr"> https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7957405/new-hope-for-crypto-derivatives-as-markets-urged-to-hail-cesr</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Today, Brave is excited to announce the release of Leo—Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser—on all Android devices. Android users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages, translate pages, create content, and more from both the browser address bar and within the webpage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since launching on desktop three months ago, Brave Leo has seen significant global adoption. With the chat interface built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way. Leo can help users answer questions, navigate different tasks, and accomplish more each day. And the experience has only gotten better—and the answers more accurate and timely—with the addition of new integrations and <a>new models like Mixtral</a>.</p>
<p>Now, that same great Leo experience is available for users with Android phones and tablets. Brave Android users can seamlessly interact with AI without leaving the security of the browser, and maximize productivity no matter where they are.</p>

 What can Leo do? 
<p>Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages you’re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:</p>
 
 Create real-time summaries of webpages or videos 
 Answer questions about content 
 Generate new long form written content 
 Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them 
 Create transcriptions of video or audio content 
 Write code 
 
<p>So what can you do with Leo on mobile? Summarize that long webpage you meant to read at the office, but never got around to. Get help hunting for a product mentioned on that page and compare it to others. Plan a recipe for tonight’s dinner. And get smart travel tips to escape the daily grind.</p>
<p>With Leo on Android, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, there’s no login or signup required—you just open your browser and chat. Privately.</p>
<p>

    
    


    



      
      
    


    
    


    



      
      
    


    
    


    



      
      
    


    
    


    



      
      
    </p>

 Mixtral as the default LLM brings higher quality answers 
<p>Brave Leo gives access to several high-quality large-language models (LLMs), ensuring better, more relevant answers to even niche questions, and fewer of the hallucinations that plague other AI experiences.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Leo includes access to Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B. Mixtral—the default LLM—can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. It can even generate code.</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, <a>we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM</a> for Leo on desktop, and we’ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for Android as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.</p>

 Leo Premium&nbsp; 
<p>The Brave Leo experience is free to all users. For those who’d like access to higher rate limits, however, Leo is also available as a Premium experience.

 Smart AI, still private by default 
<p>As with all of Brave’s other features, privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. These specific privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as <a>IP address</a>), and no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models. If you select a model from Anthropic and submit Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo (they access their Premium account if they wish to use Leo across multiple devices however).&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 What’s next for Leo, and how to get started 
<p>Brave Leo for Android is now available to all Brave Android users who’ve updated to version 1.63. Note that it will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today.  Brave Leo for iOS devices will be available in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on page chat experience, Android users can tap “⋮” and then tap Leo to get started.</p>

<p>With the latest update of Brave on desktop (1.63), Brave Wallet users can now create Native SegWit Bitcoin accounts, which offer lower transaction fees and better error detection compared to other Bitcoin account types. Brave Wallet is now also fully equipped to send and receive from all types of Bitcoin addresses, including Legacy, Nested SegWit, Native SegWit, and Taproot, ensuring compatibility with third-party wallets.</p>
<p>After nearly 15 years, Bitcoin has stood the test of time and proven itself as a resilient asset class. There’s growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin following the approval of several Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.— and Bitcoin use cases are expanding beyond peer-to-peer payments and serving as a store-of-value with a new wave of innovation fueled by NFTs and DeFi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our aim with Brave Wallet is to offer the most secure and privacy-considerate software wallet for everyday use. As the Bitcoin ecosystem expands with new apps and services, Brave Wallet will be there to put security and privacy first, to help keep users’ assets safe.”</p>
<p>– James Mudgett, VP Web3 Products at Brave</p>

<p>How to get started with Bitcoin in Brave Wallet</p>
 
 Open Brave Wallet on Mac, Windows, or Linux 
 Click the expanded … menu in the top right of the panel 
 Select Create account 
 Select Bitcoin 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>More UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) chains and features on the horizon</p>
<p>Last year we announced our partnership with <a>Zcash and Filecoin Foundation</a> to bring better privacy to the Web. In the coming months, we’ll be delivering on a major component of the partnership in Brave Wallet with shielded Zcash transactions. Later this year, we’ll add support for more Bitcoin account types, which will allow users to store BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals in Brave Wallet—and make all of these features available across all desktop and mobile versions of Brave.</p>
<p>About Brave Wallet</p>
<p>Brave Wallet enables Brave users to store, swap, and manage their crypto assets across multiple blockchains from a single wallet. Unlike most crypto wallets, Brave Wallet is browser-native, meaning it doesn’t require any additional downloads or extensions, helping reduce security risks and improve convenience across the ever-expanding landscape of Web3.</p>
<p>To get started with Brave Wallet, <a>download Brave</a> and click the wallet icon in the top right corner of your browser.</p>

<p>Confidential-DPproof uses Zero Knowledge Proofs for verifiable privacy protection, and garners Spotlight award at prestigious ICLR 2024 conference</p>
<p>by Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Privacy Researcher at Brave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary. Machine learning models trained on clients’ data without any guarantees of privacy can leak sensitive information about clients. For example, in the application of machine learning to advertising, we ideally want to learn the general patterns (“showing scientific advertisements to clients visiting scientifically related contents”), however parameters of a trained machine learning model might encode specific facts about the interest of an individual client (“Ali visited <a>https://brave.com/research/</a> on 26 Feb 2024.”). Unfortunately, some institutions may not adhere to their claim of training machine learning models with client privacy</p>
 
 Intentionally: not considering client privacy while training the models, or considering inadequate privacy safeguards to achieve better model utility; or&nbsp; 
 Accidentally: hard-to-detect bugs occurred in the implementation of privacy requirements of learning algorithms. 
 
<p>We introduce verifiable private training (Confidential-DPproof – Confidential proof of differentially private training) which enhances training with a certificate of privacy while not revealing any information about the data and model.</p>
<p><a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a> is accepted at the 12th International Conference on Learning Representations <a href="https://iclr.cc/">ICLR2024</a> as a spotlight (top 5%) paper. Confidential-DPproof will be presented at the conference between May 7th and 11th in Vienna, Austria. <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a> is available in an open-source implementation, and can be used by institutions to offer verifiable privacy protection to clients in machine learning based products.</p>

 Why should we care about client’s privacy when training machine learning models on their data? 
<p>Machine learning models that are trained without a privacy-preserving algorithm can memorize sensitive information about their training set. Publishing the parameters, or even just the outputs, of machine learning models can consequently risk the privacy of the clients who contributed to their training process. For example,&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05820.pdf">Membership inference attacks</a>: exploit access to a model’s outputs to infer the presence (or absence) of a particular data point in its training set. 
 <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=oVn5GLyONY">Data reconstruction attacks</a>: reconstruct the original training data points through an analysis of the model’s parameters.&nbsp; 
 

 How can we protect client’s privacy? 
<p>The framework of <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/tcc2006/38760266/38760266.pdf">Differential Privacy</a> is the gold standard for formalizing privacy guarantees. When training machine learning models, a Differential Privacy training algorithm provides guarantees for individuals by ensuring that data contributed by each individual client has a bounded influence on the final model in a mathematically precise manner. Therefore, absence or presence of a client will not result in a significantly different model.</p>
<p>Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent is the canonical approach to training machine learning models with guarantees of Differential Privacy. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent imposes two main modifications to vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent to provide differential privacy guarantees: 1) clipping per-example gradients to a fixed norm to bound the algorithm’s sensitivity to each individual client’s data (assuming each client only contributes one data point to the training); 2) adding calibrated noise to gradients before they are applied to update the model to ensure indistinguishability across updates. Training machine learning models with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent mitigates all attacks against the privacy of training data that fall within the threat model of differential privacy, including membership inference and training data reconstruction.</p>

 Why should we care about verifiable privacy? 
<p>Implementing Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent training algorithms can be challenging and hard-to-detect errors can easily occur as a result of uncommon and complex modification to the underlying training optimizer. Therefore, institutions may not adhere to their claims of training machine learning models with differential privacy guarantees intentionally (e.g., if they are trying to evade privacy regulations to maximize utility) or accidentally (e.g., if there are hard-to-detect bugs in the implementation of their private algorithm). For example, see Apple’s ambiguity around not releasing the exact privacy budget of a deployed Differential Privacy mechanism and/or other relevant details: <a href="https://www.cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs380/fall2019/Papers/privacylossappleproducts.pdf">Privacy Loss in Apple’s Implementation of Differential Privacy on MacOS 10.12</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important for companies or other institutions that use DP-SGD to demonstrate that they train models within the privacy constraints expressed by clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Confidential-DPproof framework 
<p>We designed a framework, called <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a>, that allows institutions to directly and proactively prove to any interested party–users or customers, regulators or governments–, through the execution of a Zero Knowledge Proof protocol, that their machine learning models are trained in a privacy-preserving manner (i.e., protecting the privacy of individuals who provided their data for the training).</p>


    
    

    


    




 How does Confidential-DPproof work? 
<p>In our work, we propose a zero-knowledge proof protocol to proactively generate a certificate of privacy during the training process while preserving the confidentiality of all information including training data and model parameters.&nbsp; Zero-knowledge proof allows a party to prove statements about their private data without revealing it. Therefore, the prover’s dataset or model is not revealed to external parties.</p>
<p>Parties. Consider a setting with two parties, a prover and an auditor:</p>
 
 The prover is an institution that wants to train a model on a sensitive dataset for different purposes such as providing machine learning based services. 
 The auditor is an external entity (e.g., a user or an auditor) that aims to verify the privacy guarantees of the prover’s model. 
 
<p>Desiderata.</p>
 
 Completeness. The auditor must infer the exact privacy guarantee and provide a public certificate of such guarantee. 
 Soundness. The auditor must be able to catch malicious provers who do not adhere to their claims of training machine learning models with privacy guarantees, either intentionally or accidentally. 
 Zero Knowledge. The training data and model parameters computed during training must stay confidential as institutions are not willing/allowed to share their models and data with external parties due to privacy regulations and intellectual property concerns. 
 
<p>Confidential-DPproof framework works as follows:</p>
 
 Prover publicly announces the privacy guarantees that it is planning to provide; 
 Prover and auditor agree on the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent training algorithm and specific values for its hyperparameters. 
 Prover and auditor run our newly-proposed zero-knowledge protocol. 
 Prover obtains a certificate for the claimed privacy guarantee. 
 

 How is the performance of Confidential-DPproof? 
<p>Since we design Confidential-DPproof to enable institutions to prove the differential privacy guarantees of their model to an auditor while being able to protect the confidentiality of their data and model, our experiments consider the following questions:</p>
 
 What are the best trade-offs between utility and certified privacy guarantees that Confidential-DPproof can achieve given i)&nbsp; the respective interests of the institution (in terms of utility); ii)&nbsp; the respective interests of auditor (in terms of privacy); and iii) constraints imposed by Zero-Knowledge proof regarding the complexity of models? 
 What is the cost (in terms of running time) of verifying the training run while ensuring confidentiality? 
 
<p>

    
    

    


    



ConfidentialDPproof trains machine learning models that achieve high test accuracy with certified privacy guarantees in practical running time!</p>

 Want to improve Confidential-DPproof? 
<p>Confidential-DPproof provides many benefits to institutions and their users; however, there is still room for improvement. For example, one could further extend Confidential-DPproof to prove that no adversarial data manipulation, such as sharing information across data points, was performed prior to data commitment.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>Another week has flown by in the dynamic world of Panther – now it’s time to share our latest updates and progress with the Panther community! This week’s rundown highlights several key developments and testing from the past week.</p> Ecosystem updates  Blog  - let’s end the taboo of on-chain privacy <p>Our<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lets-end-the-taboo-of-on-chain-privacy/"> latest blog </a>covers why Web3 needs to engage in a more nuanced conversation about the integral roles privacy and transparency play in financial exchange, maintaining fair and free markets, and enabling institutions to conduct daily operations.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Current testnet users: 900+  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 2 million $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Enhancement Stage-1 <p>As we continue to strive for parallel development efforts, a 2-week technical enhancement stage is in progress to implement various fixes from previous stages. This week, we made several enhancements across different components of the protocol, including the Wallet Engine, to boost productivity. This included optimizing its cold start, resolving issues with data passing to the dApp, enabling silent initialization post zAccount activation, and addressing a set of Stage 4 issues. One of the key features to be released as a part of this enhancement stage is the transfer of zZKP from Panther Gas account to regular zAsset and vice-versa.</p><p>The team has further implemented error code mappings focused on enhancing user experience by providing detailed explanations for transaction failures. We are expecting to release stage 1 of enhancements for public testing in the week of February 26.</p> Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a third party Relayer service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract. The team is currently performing integration testing with the second Relayer. Overall, the end-to-end Relayer integration process is working.

Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>The monolithic blockchain era appears to be sunsetting. Among the first to contribute to this paradigm shift was Cosmos, which introduced the idea of specialized sovereign blockchains (appchains), made possible by the Cosmos SDK. Nowadays, the modular thesis employs external data availability and even execution solutions, which enables the creation of countless new chains. Each new blockchains comes with its own ‘specs’, and centralised RPC and node providers have to adapt to each chain’s setting. However, the saying ‘Jack of all trades, master of none’ applies in this scenario too - we have often witnessed RPC failures during high demand periods. Lava Network aims to provide a competitive marketplace for RPC and node providers, which would compete based on their performance and user feedback.</p><p>We were joined by Gil and Yair to discuss Lava Network’s RPC decentralisation in the modular, multi-chain landscape.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  High-level overview of Lava Network  What problem Lava Network solves  Decentralised marketplace for RPC providers  Quality of centralised vs. decentralised RPC providers  Gateways  Lava Network participants  Specs &amp; APIs  Quality of service &amp; provider optimizer  How services are priced  Relayers  Modularity &amp; chain abstraction  Magma &amp; Lava mainnet  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/yaircleper">Yair Cleper on LinkedIn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/xgilxgil">Gil Binder on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/lavanetxyz">Lava Network on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>As transparent Central Bank Digital Currency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/euro-backed-stablecoin-eurm-trials-spain?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">(CBDC) pilots</a> continue to gain traction, on-chain privacy has exploded into one of the polarizing issues in the Web3 industry. However, as is the nature of polarizing extremes, neither absolute transparency nor absolute privacy will serve users' real-world needs.</p><p>In fact, the privacy vs. compliance issue has existed and has already largely been solved for, across states and time. Existing systems based in the physical domain tend to operate on the principle of default privacy. As such, state-approved mechanisms are implemented to mitigate against fraud and other dishonest practices. These introduce and enforce transparency, such as mandatory financial reporting and audit requirements. Furthermore, additional privacy protections are extended to individuals and private enterprises such that their financial reporting isn’t exposed.</p><p>In contrast, those blockchain-based, public-ledger systems that underpin DeFi operate on default transparency. This means public ledgers require additional mechanisms that preserve privacy. Then, as per their physical domain equivalents, discoverability features must be implemented to prevent money laundering, tax evasion, and other forms of malicious activity from eluding the state.</p><p>The issue, therefore, is really about Web3 accepting that while DeFi does “solve money”, it must also solve for a balance between privacy and compliance, because money will always be in the domain of the state’s law enforcement (even when the state no longer prints it).</p> Going beyond early teething pains <p>Most Web3 advocates believe that blockchain ecosystems have the potential to provide the best conditions to operate an integrated global economy that is prosperous, liquid, resilient, and fair. However, institutions are never going to agree to operate in a fully transparent environment. Compliant on-chain privacy is the catalyst required to push decentralized financial players to penetrate the mass market.</p><p>To achieve this, the Web3 community must shake off the tendency to polarize DeFi privacy projects as teetering between terrorist financier and a tyrannical surveillance facilitator. While the nascent public ledger privacy sector has been met with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-strong-defense-trial?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">litigation</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/monero-drops-multi-month-lows-binance-delisting?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">critical delistings</a> — it becomes clear that now is the time for a mature solution set that respects the financial privacy rights of institutions and individual users, while providing the compliance features of its physical-domain cousins.</p><p>Now is the time to get serious about adoption. And, to achieve widespread adoption, Web3 needs to engage in a more nuanced conversation about the integral roles privacy and transparency play in facilitating the fundamental process of exchange, maintaining fair and free markets, and enabling institutions to conduct daily operations. In short, these issues are a matter of existential importance to the future of decentralized systems.</p> On-chain privacy, a problem solved <p>Panther Protocol has developed the mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>With Panther, institutional players have access to a suite of DeFi tools to manage dedicated trading spaces, called Zones, to trade digital assets in Shielded Pools — revolutionizing private trades with public, on-chain settlement.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Zones</a> are highly customizable, as are their disclosure mechanisms. The Panther suite empowers institutions to leverage privacy-protocol trades with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the operational efficiencies of institutions in mind, Panther simplifies portfolio and asset management with a suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol recognizes that the path to adoption isn’t about the mechanics of privacy, transparency, or discoverability, per se; it’s about providing meaningful abstraction to the end user. Panther’s Privacy Protocol is doing for the on-chain domain what the Microsoft Office suite did for the personal computer — delivering abstractions that make it usable. However, unlike Microsoft, Panther presents a Web3-native protocol based on chain-agnostic, decentralized principles.</p><p>Here at Panther, we believe that those who understand institutional operations and pain points intimately and who apply the technical know-how to develop versatile on-chain systems with refined privacy functions will be the major winners in Web3’s next major wave: the institutional onboarding process. We intend to spearhead that revolution.</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone? Reach out to us at contact@pantherprotocol.io.</p>

<p>Today we’re announcing the highly requested and long-awaited rollout of self-custody BAT payouts for Brave Rewards. An initial group of invitees—and soon Brave users around the world—will be able to receive BAT earned from Brave Rewards to a self-custody wallet address on the Solana blockchain.</p>

 Invite only to start 
<p>Rewards on Solana is launching as an invite-only feature, starting with a limited group of early participants. Brave will send out invitations via a notification in the Brave Rewards panel. This invitation will unlock the ability for users to connect a self-custody Solana address and start receiving BAT on-chain. To find out if you’re eligible, keep an eye on Brave Rewards in your Brave browser.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Invitees will receive a notification in the Rewards panel and new tab page</p>
<p>To connect a Solana address to Brave Rewards, you’ll use a Solana wallet to verify that you own the address. You can do this with Brave’s very own integrated wallet, <a>Brave Wallet</a>, or with a third-party browser extension like Phantom.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Solana address connected to Brave Rewards</p>
<p>Once connected, monthly BAT rewards will be deposited directly on-chain to your Solana address in Wormhole-bridged <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">SPL-BAT</a>. That means you’ll be able to receive earned BAT without a custodial account (though the option to receive BAT rewards via a custodian will remain available).</p>

 Only possible on Solana 
<p>We chose Solana as the ideal network for the launch of on-chain Brave Rewards given its high transaction speed and low fees, which help reduce the costs associated with distributing BAT earnings to hundreds of thousands of users. For example, a single transaction on Solana costs on average $0.002 USD, while a single transaction on Ethereum, or on its most popular layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum, costs on average <a href="https://l2fees.info/">$1.00 and $0.10 respectively</a>.</p>
<p>This new way of distributing BAT removes many of the barriers everyday people face when onboarding to Web3. There are no withdrawal fees or limits, since the Solana wallet is entirely owned and managed by the user. Users can earn and receive BAT directly on-chain, and use it on-chain however they like. For example, here are some great ways BAT can be used on Solana:</p>
 
 Contribute directly to your favorite <a>Brave creators with on-chain contributions</a> (details below) 
 Exchange between hundreds of tokens through the swap feature in <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/13397025065357-What-are-Brave-Swaps-">Brave Wallet</a> 
 Buy a .SOL domain from <a href="https://www.bonfida.org/">Bonfida</a> 
 Earn trading fees by depositing SPL-BAT to <a href="https://www.orca.so/">Orca</a> liquidity pools 
 Mint and buy <a>NFTs</a> with SPL-BAT 
 

 Support your favorite creators on-chain 
<p>We also <a>recently announced a new on-chain contributions feature</a> as a more Web3-native way for users to support their favorite creators, including with the SPL-BAT they earn. Supporting self custody for users and creators is an important step toward a more decentralized Brave Rewards and Brave Creators experience. Together, they further our mission of providing users with greater control over how they browse, search, and transact on the Web.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on our blog, social accounts, and <a href="https://community.brave.com/">Brave Community</a> forums for the latest news from Brave, and announcements about new rounds of Solana on-chain invites.</p>

<p>Last September, we <a>released a roadmap</a> of innovations for <a>Leo</a>, Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce we’ve completed another piece of the roadmap: Leo can now interact with PDFs and Google Drive files. By seamlessly integrating with these popular productivity apps and document types, Leo enables users to save time and accomplish more at school and work, while preserving user privacy.</p>

 How we built document support 
<p>Brave’s built-in AI assistant Leo has recently gained new capabilities for understanding how to help users while using web-based tools and workflows. Specifically:</p>
 
 
<p>By using the accessibility tree in a PDF’s metadata, Leo can understand the underlying semantic structure of PDF documents.</p>
 
 
<p>By leveraging a technique called Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on canvas-rendered apps, Leo can use an image of a page to extract text in Google Docs and Google Sheets.</p>
 
 
<p>In both cases, Leo can offer insights and suggestions for users working with many different productivity applications, whether at school or at work.</p>

 Use cases for Leo’s document integrations 
<p>With this novel use of the accessibility tree, OCR, and other techniques, Leo can help with several important use cases. These include:</p>
 
 
<p>PDFs: Leo can extract topics and data deep within PDF documents. This can help with understanding research papers, preparing analysis from reports, finding details in a technical specification document, and more.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Docs: When you’re editing a Google Doc, Leo can propose relevant terms or writing styles, or even review the document as a whole.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Sheets: Leo can analyze tables and data in a Google Sheet, and even suggest formulas.</p>
 
 
<p>Slack workspaces: Leo can highlight key discussion points from a thread in a Slack workspace, extracting the thread’s essential points while saving you the time of reading the entire thread history.</p>
 
 
<p>YouTube: Leo can produce video transcripts from classes, industry events, and influencer videos. These transcripts can then be summarized for useful details mentioned in the video, and allow the user to ask Leo follow-up questions about the video or the transcript.</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo—and its document integrations—is no different. This is particularly relevant as work and school documents may contain sensitive information:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Just as Leo utilizes these techniques to preserve your privacy as you chat, it offers the same protections when Leo is helping you analyze documents and other files.&nbsp;</p>

 How to use Leo for PDFs and Google Drive files 
<p>Leo’s support for PDFs, Google Docs, and Google Sheets is available now for all Brave desktop users on version 1.63 or higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To try it out, simply open a PDF, Google Doc, or Google Sheet in a tab in the Brave browser. Then click the  in the sidebar, and start asking Leo questions about the file.</p>
<p>Don’t have Leo in the sidebar yet? Just click Settings, then click Leo, and toggle on the Show Leo icon in the sidebar option.</p>

 What’s next for Leo and document / file support? 
<p>Leo will soon support other documents and file types. For example, Leo will integrate with GitHub, allowing code reviewers to summarize the purpose and impact of pull requests by analyzing code changes without line-by-line inspection. Keep an eye out for announcements about GitHub support, and for even more document and file integrations.</p>
<p>From the beginning, we saw Leo as far more than an AI chatbot (though it can handle real-time, contextual chats with ease). Rather, we saw Leo as a true smart assistant that could help you engage with the applications you use every day, to help you learn, work, and plan more efficiently. By surfacing insights from within PDFs, suggesting text for Google Docs, writing formulas for Google Sheets, summarizing YouTube videos, analyzing code in GitHub (and more), Leo saves you time and makes you more efficient and productive.</p>

<p>Greetings community,</p><p>It is our honor to announce the two year anniversary of the Shade Protocol governance &amp; utility token: SHD.

This is because despite vesting progression &amp; completion for various categories (private raise, grants, dev fund, etc.) many entities have chosen to not claim their earned SHD — thus not directly impacting circulating supply (yet). Another key disclaimer is that of the 1.8M SHD dev fund, none of the dev fund SHD is staked / nor active in any capacity so as to not impact staking yield or governance proposals.</p> Protocol Liquidity Matching <p>Another distribution component to note is Protocol Liquidity Match (PLM) — a novel mechanism whereby Shade Protocol loans out tokens in collaboration with other protocols to bootstrap liquidity. This model is favorable as it does not involve an OTC and does not involve any emissions. However, this deal structure was invented prior to full blown decentralized governance; the core contributors are not comfortable categorizing PLM as “LP” without a community vote. As of right now PLM is handled and accounted for from the dev fund until a formal ratification of categorization via the community pool. The following are the 11 protocols that have been partnered with on liquidity deals (accounting for 40%+ worth of ShadeSwap’s volume) for both PLM &amp; OTC liquidity deals:</p>  Kujira  Manta  Andromeda  FINA  Persistence  Levana  Archway  Composable  White Whale  Sienna  Stride   Onwards To Governance <a href="https://forum.scrt.network/t/dao-dao-x-secret-network-proposal/7119">https://forum.scrt.network/t/dao-dao-x-secret-network-proposal/7119</a><p>With the passing of <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/secret/proposals/280">prop 280</a> Shade Protocol has helped spearhead and coordinate the cross deployment of DAO DAO which will be usable as open source code by various protocols on Secret Network.

<p>As the global need for environmentally conscious energy intensifies, tokenisation emerges as a groundbreaking strategy to democratise energy ownership. Amidst the growing consensus on the need for a shift to renewable resources, the challenge of accessibility and affordability persists. By leveraging blockchain technology to fractionalise ownership of renewable energy assets, tokenisation offers an inclusive pathway for individuals and communities to invest in and benefit from sustainable energy sources. This innovative approach not only aims to lower the barriers to entry in the renewable energy market but also foster a more distributed and participatory energy landscape.</p>



<p></p>



 Democratising energy: The role of tokenisation in ownership 



<p>The shift towards sustainable energy is a global priority, underscored by initiatives like the Paris Agreement, especially within Europe. This movement faces the challenge of perceived high costs and barriers to entry in the renewable energy sector. However, recent commercialisation of energy storage technologies shows significant <a href="https://www.irena.org/Energy-Transition/Technology/Energy-storage-costs">cost reductions</a> in wind, solar power, and grid stability over the past few years. This cost reduction has widened access to renewable energy, allowing a broader spectrum of individuals to benefit from these technologies.</p>



<p></p>



 How tokenisation democratises energy ownership&nbsp; 



<p>Tokenisation plays a pivotal role in further democratising energy ownership. For individuals without direct access to physical assets, such as a roof for solar panels, tokenisation offers a novel solution. Through crypto anchors and property rights encapsulated within tokens, individuals can own a share of an energy asset. This approach not only allows for the ownership of the physical asset but also enables individuals to own carbon credits, kilowatt hours, and even data rights associated with the energy asset.</p>



<p>One such initiative is <a href="https://www.sunified.com/">Sunified</a> –&nbsp; a solar technology company creating critical infrastructure to facilitate yield farming on solar infrastructure. Yield farming is the process of staking or lending cryptocurrency assets within a DeFi protocol’s liquidity pool to receive rewards, often in the form of the protocol’s governance tokens. Liquidity providers are then compensated with an annual percentage yield (APY) in real-time for their contributions as a result. The purpose behind yield farming is to promote the platform’s utilisation and compensate the community for adding liquidity, crucial for the ecosystem’s vitality and growth. Sunified’s initiative also includes storage infrastructure integration into electric vehicles (EVs) and other parts of the energy ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As energy grids undergo a gradual transformation over the next decade, tokenisation offers immense opportunities to introduce new business and ownership models through blockchain and sound crypto infrastructure architectures. This transition presents a unique chance to reconstruct the energy ecosystem, making sustainable energy ownership more accessible and flexible for a wider audience.</p>



<p></p>



 Fractional ownership of solar power&nbsp; 



<p>Fractional ownership in the context of solar power introduces an innovative approach to investing in renewable energy. This concept allows individuals to collectively invest in solar projects, such as solar parks or community solar gardens, through a blend of equity and debt financing. The essence of fractional ownership lies in the tokenisation of solar infrastructure, breaking down the investment into manageable units—whether in the form of €100 blocks or based on the capacity, such as 100 Watt blocks of a solar panel.</p>



<p>A group of experts would initially determine how to capitalise on a solar project, deciding on the mix of equity and debt to make the project investment-ready. This capital structure can then be tokenised, offering participation rights to investors. Tokenisation carves up the asset into fractional pieces, making it possible for a wider audience to invest in solar energy projects.</p>



<p>It is crucial to differentiate between owning a part of the solar park itself and having rights to the energy produced by it. While you might not fractionalise the energy output directly, fractionalising the means of production — i.e., the solar panels and infrastructure — offers a tangible way to invest in solar energy. Fractional ownership and tokenisation democratises access to renewable energy investments, enabling more people to contribute to and benefit from sustainable energy solutions.</p>



<p></p>



 How should a real-world asset, such as energy, be put on the blockchain?&nbsp; 



<p>Placing a real-world asset like energy onto a blockchain involves a multifaceted approach that bridges the physical and digital worlds. With a particular focus on renewable energy sources like solar power, the process starts by establishing a tangible connection or “hook” between the physical asset and its digital representation on the blockchain. This involves integrating a sensor directly into the asset during the manufacturing process, such as embedding it within a solar panel at the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) factory. This sensor plays a crucial role in anchoring the asset across three realms: the physical world, the digital world, and the crypto realm.</p>



<p>The sensor enables tracking of the solar panel’s lifecycle from its inception, including its initial performance and the carbon footprint incurred throughout its supply chain journey. By activating the panel in the field, it is possible to account for its entire lifecycle, including production, deployment, and operational carbon emissions. This comprehensive approach ensures that the asset is not only represented accurately on the blockchain but also that its environmental impact is meticulously accounted for.</p>



<p>This method transcends traditional reliance on third-party verification or trust anchors, reducing the need for intermediaries. Instead, it offers a direct and trustworthy linkage between the real-world asset and its blockchain counterpart. This direct connection is essential for leveraging blockchain’s capabilities to support decentralised and distributed energy systems, which are increasingly becoming bidirectional.&nbsp; Unlike the traditional centralised energy distribution model, where power flows from a central hub to consumers, modern energy grids are evolving to support energy flow in both directions. This shift necessitates new measurement infrastructure to accommodate and accurately represent these changes on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Navigating challenges in energy tokenisation 



<p>The journey of tokenising energy assets is fraught with multifaceted challenges, significantly influenced by regulatory uncertainties, security concerns, data privacy issues, market volatility, and a general lack of understanding and readiness within the industry. A pivotal aspect of navigating these waters involves identifying the nature of energy tokens for regulators—be it as utility, payment, or governance tokens—or even advocating for a multi-use token that transcends traditional categorisations.</p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Hurdles 



<p>Discourse within the digital asset community highlights a need for regulatory frameworks around energy tokens that must be clearly defined. This confusion necessitates a rigorous educational effort towards regulators, to clarify the distinctions and functionalities of various token types, including utility, energy, asset, and governance tokens. Without clear regulatory guidance, projects are compelled to seek jurisdictions with more favourable legal frameworks. The UK is a regulatory example of a more defined ecosystem for property rights, energy governance, and tokenisation of real-world assets. The only other option would be to work within regulatory sandboxes and project-specific frameworks to advance tokenisation initiatives without overstepping uncertain legal boundaries.</p>



<p>Moreover, the push towards standardising practices across different regulatory environments presents another layer of complexity. The UK has made significant strides in establishing clear guidelines through bodies like The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Other jurisdictions are still in the budding stages of adapting their regulations to accommodate the novel demands of tokenised energy systems. In addition to regulatory hurdles, the practicalities of offering energy tokens without categorising them as equity to facilitate easier trading, and the fundraising challenges for scaling projects across multiple locations, are critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Communication 



<p>The ability to articulate the concept and clear implications of tokenising energy resources, such as solar panels, is crucial for market acceptance and regulatory compliance. This task extends beyond mere product explanation; it encompasses clear dialogue with lawmakers, consumer protection bodies, and entities concerned with data privacy. Simplifying complex technological underpinnings for a diverse audience, from regulators to the layperson at the bus stop, is essential. Failure to do so risks future operational nightmares, underscoring the importance of both education and transparency in the tokenisation ecosystem. Simplification without sacrificing essential information ensures that investors, users, and stakeholders, who will journey with the initiative for years to come, fully comprehend its value and operation, making the technology’s intricate background less daunting and more accessible.</p>



<p></p>



 Where to begin: energy tokenisation 



<p>Embarking on the journey of energy tokenisation requires a foundational understanding of the token’s purpose, its intended holders, and the value it offers. Before diving into the legal and technical specifics of token types, it is essential to address these fundamental questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach does not necessitate a one-size-fits-all solution. For instance, investors interested in direct engagement with energy projects can opt for utility tokens, whereas those looking for a more traditional investment route might consider security tokens tied to assets like solar parks. This flexibility allows projects to cater to diverse investor preferences, enhancing accessibility and interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlighting the significance of inclusivity and accountability in energy trading, an initiative such as the <a href="https://www.amelandenergie.nl/">Amelander Energy Cooperative</a> demonstrates the potential for democratising energy markets. Such a project demonstrates the possibility for transparent, traceable systems that ensure accountability across all levels of interaction—from investors to consumers, and from producers to the overarching financial ecosystem. Achieving this level of integration and transparency is a meticulous process to harmonise understanding and communication across various stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Tokenisation within the energy sector signifies a significant stride toward democratising access to renewable resources and fostering sustainable practices. By bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms, tokenisation introduces a new paradigm where renewable energy assets, like solar power, become attainable and manageable for a wider audience. This process not only democratises access to sustainable energy solutions but also addresses the pressing need for energy independence, resilience, and environmental preservation. As we navigate the complexities of regulatory landscapes and technological challenges, the ultimate goal remains clear: to create an energy ecosystem that is inclusive, transparent, and aligned with the principles of environmental sustainability. Through collaborative efforts, innovative approaches, and community engagement, tokenisation has the potential to reshape our energy future, making sustainable living a reality for all.</p>

<p>Prolonged range bound markets are a hallmark of bearmarkets and they usually end up chopping inexperienced or over leveraged traders. Customised structured products offer a solution for market participants that want to limit their downside, but also the upside, by introducing knock-outs at certain levels or triggers. Such custom options, usually with lower probabilistic chances of occurring, naturally come at a discount. This allows traders to hedge their risk, while also betting on certain outcomes or market scenarios.</p><p>We were joined by Zhiming Yang, co-founder of Orbit Markets, to discuss crypto derivatives and how TradFi expertise applies to customising structured products for crypto markets.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Zhiming’s background in investment banking  FX derivative products  Exotic options  Crypto structured products  Custom solutions for crypto miners  Hedging Uniswap V3 impermanent loss  Options based on prediction markets  Managing counterparty risk  Protocolising structured products  Differences between TradFi and DeFi  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhiming-yang-800103b/">Zhiming Yang on LinkedIn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Orbit_Markets">Orbit Markets on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://www.orbitmarkets.io/">Orbit Markets website</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>Another week has flown by in the dynamic world of Panther – now it’s time to share our latest updates and progress with the Panther community! This week’s rundown highlights a series of key developments and testing from the past week.</p> Ecosystem updates  AMA with Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar <p>On February 8, we hosted an AMA session featuring Panther Protocol’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar, and Head of Community, Joris Koopman.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ-NfX_4ldY&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Watch the recording</a> for full insights into our latest testnet updates, testing processes, reward systems, and upcoming testnet releases.</p> Panther testnet video guide for account creation <p>You asked – we delivered! Panther has received numerous requests to provide support materials dedicated to the account creation process. For a step-by-step video guide detailing how to make your very own testnet Panther account, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw3LhZKvM_U&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">check out our tutorial video</a>. Once you have your account set up, the video will also show you how to get started earning $ZKP rewards. All you need is a MetaMask wallet and 10 minutes!&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Current testnet users: 800+  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 1.5M $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a 3rd party Bundler service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.</p><p>Users will be able to submit transactions via Bundlers and pay gas fees in $ZKP instead of $Matic (on Mumbai testnet but similarly on Polygon) from the Panther Gas account that holds $zZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>Integration testing is underway, with two end-to-end Bundler providers operating successfully. Changes on the dApp side are expected to reach completion as we utilize resources from other stages of development taking place in parallel.</p> Enhancement Stage - 1 developments <p>As we continue to strive for parallel development efforts, a 2-week technical enhancement stage was slated to implement various fixes from previous stages along with a feature for Gas Management. This key feature allows users to move their $zZKP inside MASP from the regular balance to the Panther Account Gas balance and vice versa. Gas Management plays a significant role enabling users to top up their Gas balance and make sure they have sufficient $zZKP to pay for various transaction costs.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of testnet is a complex stage and includes overall fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. Stage 6 allows users to test:</p>  Fee deductions from the Panther Gas account and payment to 3rd parties such as Compliance providers and Bundler service providers.  Protocol fee deductions in a transacted token currently set to be charged on Withdraw.  Basic disclosures that allow Panther users to provide adequate transaction reporting to outside parties issuing requests that can be satisfied by independent on-chain verification.  &nbsp;A zAccount renewal function (after the expiry date). This feature functions in a similar manner to KYC renewals.  <p>Additional smart contract and testing changes are in progress, and will require one more week to complete. Following the completion of these changes, development on the dApp will begin.&nbsp;</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

        <p>Horizen Labs has submitted a ZenIP Discussion topic on Discourse, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP: 42400 – Modernizing Horizen Technology via a Modular Proof Verification Layer</a>.</p>
<p>Note that ZenIP 42400 focuses on the modular proof verification layer. If this proposal passes, Horizen Labs will roll out subsequent phases to the Horizen community for discussion and debate as the “New Horizen” initiative progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenIP 42400 is focused solely on the establishment of a Modular Proof Verification Layer, i.e., a blockchain dedicated to verifying proofs with the ability to support any settlement layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we dive into what this means for the Horizen Ecosystem, let’s review a few points that have been raised by the Community regarding this proposal:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Name of the Initiative: The term “New Horizen” is currently a placeholder for the system and its individual component blockchains. The designation is being used to conceptually describe the initiative until an official name is determined. 
 EON Integration: A key aspect of the development strategy is the integration of EON into the new Proof Verification Chain. The Horizen Labs teams are actively involved in exploring viable pathways for this migration, ensuring that EON remains an integral part of the Horizen ecosystem after the implementation of the blockchains that comprise the “New Horizen” initiative. 
 $ZEN Tokenomics: Currently, there are no plans to modify $ZEN’s tokenomics, and any such change would be subject to community discussion and DAO approval.&nbsp; 
 Market and User Research: The Horizen Labs team used comprehensive market and user research, aiming to design a user-friendly system capable of widespread adoption.&nbsp; 
 
 Why should the community be excited about this “New Horizen” proposal? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative will modernize the Horizen tech stack to better align with the broader web3 industry while building on the legacy of the Horizen Mainchain and Zendoo. This will “future-proof” the Horizen network and unlock market value to the Horizen ecosystem. New Horizen is based on current web3 market needs and addresses a problem that affects most modular web3 protocols: volatile and expensive proof verification costs for L2s (ZK-Rollups in particular).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs’ proposed “Proof Verification Chain” aims to substantially reduce rising security costs for L2s.</p>
<p>A dedicated Proof Verification Chain would not only make running a ZK-Rollup more economical, but also align with the anticipated shift towards these technologies becoming the dominant scaling solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, collaboration in the Web3 space is becoming increasingly important, New Horizen aims to foster this collaboration across ecosystems and expand the reach of the Horizen ecosystem. The Horizen Labs team is working to ensure that the Proof Verification Chain described above is being designed to accommodate a variety of proof types and settlement layers. By developing a solution that is versatile enough to be compatible with multiple development frameworks, proving systems, and settlement layers, this positions Horizen as a hub of collaborative innovation. Potentially reaching new audiences beyond our current community, embracing and leading the change towards a more interconnected and cooperative blockchain environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How Will this Work? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative is set to deliver multiple components that address the market’s current and future needs across several phases. The Proof Verification Chain (Phase 1) will focus on verifying proofs originating from other blockchains, such as rollups / appchains or applications. Initially, the focus will be on ZK-SNARK proofs, in particular zk-snarks produced by ZK-Rollups, but the plan is to expand its capabilities to accommodate a wide range of proof types in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof verification layer aims to improve the existing process of proving state validity for ZK-Rollups and other proof-generating applications, offering a more efficient, scalable solution to handle these operations, which will reduce the costs of blockchain networks.</p>
<p></p>
 Next Steps – Where Do We Go From Here?&nbsp; 
 ZenIP Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Horizen has always believed our community comes first, we encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> around ZenIP 42400 and voice your thoughts. We highly encourage you to read the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP: 42400 – Modernizing Horizen Technology via a Modular Proof Verification Layer</a> post on Discourse to get a complete understanding of what this means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42400 started on Thursday, February 15th, 2024 at 12pm EST and ended on Sunday, February 18th, 2024 at 12pm EST. The Horizen DAO voting is done on Horizen EON, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. At the same time that the voting began, the snapshot was taken. Users can head to Snapshot here to review the result of the vote, which passed with 99.99% of votes “for”: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0x3f846aac0e0640d4286f0cc83c26c3710146a47af2ed670e4ef962d82f0d46c0">https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0x3f846aac0e0640d4286f0cc83c26c3710146a47af2ed670e4ef962d82f0d46c0</a></p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Vote – Instructions 
 
 Go to the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen DAO Governance page</a> on the Horizen EON web app to get started. 
 Connect your web3 wallet (ex. MetaMask). <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">Please follow this guide if you need help</a>. 
 Link your Horizen mainchain $ZEN address to Horizen EON. In order to vote with your mainchain $ZEN, you need to have $ZEN on a <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere</a> mainchain address and link that address to your MetaMask Horizen EON chain address. You only need to link your <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere wallet</a> once. You can use the same wallet for future voting rounds.&nbsp;
 
 Please see <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">this guide for step-by-step instructions </a>on linking Horizen Mainchain and Horizen EON $ZEN Addresses to aggregate your voting power.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Make sure you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask address for the gas fee. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFsjT069v7E">this tutorial</a> to learn how to transfer ZEN from Horizen mainchain to your Horizen EON address on MetaMask 
 Once your mainchain ZEN address is connected to Horizen EON, and you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask for gas fee, it’s time to vote using Snapshot! 
 Join the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Horizen Foundation space</a> on Snapshot if you haven’t done so, to receive notifications about future ZenIP voting.&nbsp;
