This functionality is accessible by clicking the Panther Gas icon located in the top right corner of the screen (header).</p><p>UTXO consolidation for deposit: Consolidates a user’s balance into a single UTXO during deposit transactions, allowing users to utilize their entire balance in a single transaction, eliminating the need for additional MASP transactions to consolidate smaller UTXOs.</p><p>Detailed error messages: Provides users with informative error messages, improving understanding of transaction failures.</p><p>Real-time Data Synchronization: Updates to balances and vouchers are now visible in real-time, enhancing user interaction with the product.</p><p> Optimized wallet engine startup: Reduced startup time by optimizing the cold start phase.</p><p>Improved cold start for wallet engine: The ‘Create Block’ function from zAccount is incorporated into the product, allowing for scanning to start from a specific block to avoid unnecessary decryption of UTXOs created before the creation block.</p><p>Global transaction support: Allows transactions to continue in the background, even if the user navigates away, improving transaction continuity.</p><p>Visit <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Docs</a> to access the enhanced version of Panther testnet dApp</p> Plans for March&nbsp; <p>The team is working on the development of Stages 5 and 6 of the testnet in parallel and expects to release it in March.&nbsp;</p> Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a third-party Relayer service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract. The team is currently working on the integration of the Relayer into the dApp.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of testnet includes fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. The team is currently working on the fee management smart contract development. We expect to release Stage 6 for public testing in mid-March.

Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

<p>Blockchains are, by default, public ledgers containing every transaction recorded by the network. While this ensures transparency, it also violates users’ privacy once an address is linked to an entity. Apart from creating additional risk for self-custody, institutions are also limited by what they can publicly share on a blockchain. As a result, there is great demand and utility for on-chain, compliant privacy, which still requires KYC (&amp; KYT), but protects them through cryptographic constructs.

<p>This content first appeared in the February 2024 Fintech newsletter. If you’d like more commentary and analysis about news and trends from the a16z Fintech team, you can subscribe&nbsp;<a href="https://info.a16z.com/Subscription-Center.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The amount of innovation we’re about to see in tax is unparalleled in recent history,” says Jamil Khan, the Chief Strategy and Small Business Officer for tax giant H&amp;R Block. “But we know that with something like tax, having a trusted human checking, monitoring, making sure things are right, is key. Since we already have the human talent, we’re also now investing in the technology.”</p>
<p>Since joining H&amp;R Block five years ago, Khan has been focused on helping the company grow not only its leadership in the field of assisted tax prep, but also its small business and financial products segments. In today’s environment, that can only mean one thing: investing in AI.</p>
<p>We recently asked Khan how H&amp;R Block is using AI, as well as what advice he would give founders looking to build in this space.</p>
<p>How is H&amp;R Block using generative AI?</p>
<p>Last year, we partnered with Microsoft to build and launch a GenAI tax assistant. Our model is trained on 70 years worth of tax data and insights, and helps answer users’ questions as they file their taxes, so they can maximize their refunds and minimize their tax liability. But this is just a first step. Beyond tax, we are also working on ways AI can augment key corporate functions like customer support and marketing.</p>
<p>What’s the biggest challenge facing H&amp;R Block today?</p>
<p>Like many other companies, our biggest challenge is prioritization and figuring out where to focus our resources. We have so many opportunities to grow the company — the trick [to being successful] is having the discipline to focus on what really matters. I’d also add that as advice to early stage founders – figure out where you can have the biggest impact and focus your resources on that one area, versus being pulled in too many directions.</p>
<p>What other advice do you have for early stage founders building in tax and accounting?</p>
<p>Based on all the internal consumer research we’ve done, people are willing to try out AI for things like tax, accounting, and legal services, but they are still nervous about relying solely on machines given how new everything is. These are very important things to get right, because the consequences of a mis-filed return could be significant. This is people’s money! My advice would be to focus on how technology could enhance and augment human activity — how it could collaborate with humans to make the customer experience better. Also, think about how to help bigger companies like H&amp;R Block do our job better… and get in touch if you can help!</p>

<p>Since its launch, the <a href="https://a16z.com/txo/">Talent x Opportunity Initiative (TxO)</a> has been more than a funding vehicle; it’s been a launchpad for culturally inspired innovation and a community of support for under-networked founders. Like the startups in our portfolio, TxO is constantly evolving to ensure we’re meeting the needs of our founders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While funding is just a small part of the value we aim to provide our founders, we’re thrilled to share today that we’re dialing up our investment in the Spring 2024 and subsequent cohorts to $175,000 per team, up from $100,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that said, we are proud to announce TxO’s Spring 2024 cohort. This latest group of founders is boldly tackling big challenges ranging from upleveling key career skills to addressing loneliness through easy connectivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please join us in welcoming the newest TxO founders:&nbsp;</p>
 Vanessa Karel (Greether) 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessa-karel">Vanessa Karel</a> was born in Los Angeles, California, but spent her formative years in Mexico. She returned to the U.S. for college and earned a degree in advertising and photography, which led to her starting a production agency that worked with companies like Intercontinental Hotels, AT&amp;T, and The North Face. As an avid traveler, Vanessa identified a gap in safety for solo female travelers, especially after a challenging experience in Morocco during the pandemic. This realization led to <a href="https://www.greether.com/">Greether</a>, a platform that ensures safety and provides income opportunities for female travelers worldwide.</p>
 Luis Caballero and Sung Choi (Muse) 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-cab/">Luis Caballero</a>, born in Oklahoma City, acquired a diverse set of self-taught skills at an early age, including music production, website development, and social media growth. He leveraged these skills to fund his computer science studies at the University of Oklahoma, where he would eventually meet his cofounder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sungeun-choi-a643a1296/">Sung Choi</a>. Originally from South Korea, Sung moved to the U.S. in second grade and always had a passion for programming and making products, which persisted into his college years and led to the decision to collaborate with Luis. Together, they founded <a href="https://www.musesessions.co/">Muse</a>, a collaboration platform for music creators designed to simplify the process of producing, recording, and sharing ideas in real time.</p>
 Andrew Florial, Cameron Farzaneh and Jeechieu Ta (Outing) 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewflorial/">Andrew Florial</a> was born in Haiti and grew up in Florida. An award-winning science project sparked his entrepreneurial spirit in his early teens, leading him to study Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in college. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeechieuta/">Jeechieu Ta</a>, a first-generation Asian-American, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cfarzaneh/">Cameron Farzaneh</a>, a fellow first-generation American of Iranian descent, also pursued Computer Science at university. Like Andrew, they took engineering stints at large organizations but ultimately aspired to launch their own products. The trio eventually joined forces to found <a href="https://www.joinouting.com/">Outing</a>, a social marketplace where users can discover, book, and plan group outings.</p>
 Samerial Johns (Pug.ai) 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sammiex/">Samerial Johns</a>, a Maryland native, is the daughter of refugees who fled war-torn Liberia. Once in the U.S., her parents turned to entrepreneurship out of necessity, fueling Sammie’s desire to forge her own path. During college, she leveraged free online resources to acquire new, in-demand skills, eventually securing full-time positions at large technology companies. This experience inspired her to create <a href="https://www.pug.ai/">Pug.ai</a>, a career management software that utilizes AI tools and digital humans to assist individuals in upskilling and landing career opportunities.</p>
 Joel Horsford (RadEmploy) 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-horsford-ba-rt-r-85295483/">Joel Horsford</a>, a native New Yorker, has over ten years of expertise in radiology. His career began in advertising, but the 2008 recession prompted him to shift to radiology. Dedicated to enhancing communication within the medical imaging field, Joel initiated virtual fireside chats during the pandemic to foster connections among imaging professionals. He also realized there was a recurring staffing challenge within the radiology sector. This insight inspired him to found <a href="https://www.rademploy.com/">RadEmploy</a>, a digital platform to bridge the gap between medical imaging professionals and job opportunities.</p>
 Mical Jeanlys-White (WealthMore) 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mical-jeanlys-white-9126366/">Mical Jeanlys-White</a>, a first-generation American from Brooklyn, was inspired early by her grandmother—a diligent saver whom traditional financial institutions overlooked because of her background as a non-English speaking Haitian immigrant widow. This experience sparked Mical’s understanding of the importance of financial planning and saving, leading to her over two-decade career in financial services at institutions like JPMorgan Chase, American Express, and Accenture. Driven to bridge the wealth divide, she founded <a href="https://www.wealthmore.net/">WealthMore</a> to make expert financial advisors affordable for all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.6.0. This release exposes the shielded scanning functionality through an initial version of a gRPC server. You can find the documentation outlining how to interact with this gRPC interface in the <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan-grpc-server.html">Zebra Book</a>. Please note that due to this new gRPC server, building Zebra now depends on <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf">protoc</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this release we have also been making improvements to simplify the Docker images that we share. We now provide a number of new docker-compose files to make it easier to run, test and develop on Zcash using Zebra. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/main/docker/docker-compose.test.yml">docker-compose.test</a> enables anyone developing on Zebra to easily run CI locally, using a similar approach to what is run through GitHub Actions. We also want to make it easy for users to use Zebra and Lightwalletd without the risk of losing their cached states, so we are now providing <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/main/docker/docker-compose.lwd.yml">docker-compose.lwd</a> to run zebrad with lightwalletd.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that founders have been on a whipsaw over the past several years. Pivoting from growth at all costs in 2020 and 2021 to efficiency in 2022 and 2023 meant slashing budgets, shelving new projects, doing RIFs, and picking fights with your cloud provider over your bills. That’s hard work, and founders should be commended for doing it.</p>
<p>But now, the market is stabilizing and companies’ optimization1&nbsp;cycles2 are coming to a close.3 Efficiency alone doesn’t build a generation-defining company—it’s table stakes. So this raises the question: what now? What should founders aim for in 2024?</p>
<p>This is the year for growth-stage companies to become Great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Great company brings the most innovative products to the market and continuously evolves them to meet changing demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Great company has a strong, defensible business model that can win market share from incumbents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Great company uses a tough market as an opportunity to break away from the pack and outrun its competitors.</p>
<p>A Great company has the potential to be a $5B+ public company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the best way to become Great is to refocus on generating fast growth.</p>
<p>How does Greatness actually show up in your financials? Below, we analyzed data from 77 US-based or -centric companies founded after 2000 that have a $5B+ market cap and highlighted what it takes to be Great by the numbers—and why growth is especially important on that journey.4</p>
  Growth 
<p>Of the companies whose data we reviewed, we found that 33% grew at a 50%+ compound annual growth rate (CAGR), and 84% of them grew at over 30%.5&nbsp;It doesn’t matter how much you grew over the last couple years—they were tough!—but if you’re operating at north of $100M revenue and want to be Great, these are the growth rates you need to be shooting for.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Median-revenue-ramp-after-by-growth-segment-after-surpassing-100M-revenue-2-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
  Efficiency 
<p>Efficiency data over the past 20 years is spotty, but one trend is clear: if you’re &gt;$100M of revenue, your operating leverage—or the growth of your operating expenses—should be lower than the growth of your revenue going forward (barring anything like massive product bets). The important thing here is the trend: is your operating leverage moving in the right direction quarter over quarter?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, though, the market will expect you to be above the rule of 40 at the time of, or within 12 months of, <a href="https://a16z.com/are-you-ready-to-be-a-public-company/">going public</a>.&nbsp;</p>
  Valuation 
<p>The truly Great, highly valued companies all have excellent growth and margins. But to illustrate why growth is more important, we pulled together 2 charts illustrating the valuations of the top 50 new-age—or, founded post–2000—tech companies by market cap: one that measured valuations as a function of free cash flow margin and one that measured valuations as a function of growth.6</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Valuation-and-FCF-margin-for-top-50-new-age-tech-companies-by-market-cap-2-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Taking a look at efficiency, there’s no meaningful difference in the median free cash flow margin between the top-trading companies—or the companies trading over 20x—and the remainder of the companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Valuation-and-growth-for-top-50-new-age-tech-companies-by-market-cap-2-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
<p>But when we take a look at growth, it’s clear that the companies trading over 20x are also the companies that grow the fastest: at 21% NTM growth instead of the median 12%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, why is growth more valuable? This isn’t rocket science, but sometimes high growth over many years can be hard to grok. Here’s the simple math. If you’re growing 30% over the next 5 years instead of 20%, you’re going to be 1.5x bigger on a forward gross profit basis, and you’ll be trading at 15x forward gross profit vs 10x. That’s a 2.2x difference in valuation today.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Impact-of-growth-rates-on-valuation-2-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
<p>That’s why some of Greatest companies trade so much higher than the median. For instance, Crowdstrike—who’s projecting 30% growth next year—is trading at 25x, while Fortinet—who’s projecting 8% growth—is trading at 11x.7&nbsp;(Please note that this isn’t investment advice from me or a16z!)</p>
 What’s next 
<p>Here’s the best part. When I started my career in growth investing, there were 3 Great public companies: Meta, Workday, and Tripadvisor. Today, there are almost 80, and that’s because founders have built amazing products on the back of platform shifts in tech—like mobile and cloud—that allowed them to deliver innovative products to many more people, much more quickly. AI is going to turbocharge this expansion, and I expect there will be 200–300+ of these companies over the next 5–10 years. By the numbers, the above is what I think it takes to be one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting back into the growth mindset is definitely a shift from the last 2 years. But think about it this way: the work you did to get efficient in 2022 and 2023 was the hard part of building a business. Consider 2024 an opportunity to recommit to why you got into this game in the first place—to build amazing new products, outrun the competition, and reach users across the globe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words: 2024 is the year to be Great.</p>

This sounds in the weeds but it’s actually actually key to unlocking trillions in new financial products.

<p>There is no culture, country, nor period of human history where creative expression hasn’t been central. It’s an intrinsic “something” that has long defined humans as humans, and (rightly or wrongly …) somehow different from all other forms of life. And yet, despite its foundational nature inside all of us, being a “creative” is often also reduced to describing someone with innate skill or studied mastery in creative disciplines such as music, painting, or sculpting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all of us either have the time or acumen to engage deeply in creative work. This despite often engaging in tasks, whether personal or professional, where an artistic touch would help immensely. Each of the many documents, presentations, missives, notes, and posts we do in the course of our days would likely be more effective — and certainly more enjoyable to receive — if they were aesthetically interesting.</p>
<p>Fortunately, generative image models are bringing creativity to the “rest of us.” The distance between imagination and realization has never been closer. Of course, there is no replacement for human imagination and creativity, but tools that help pull it out from our heads and onto the screen are finally here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Generative image models have been around for a while and have seen tremendous adoption. However, while the results feel like modern day alchemy, we’re still in the very early days of the technology, and it has its challenges. For example, image generation often is slow and clunky to control, resolution can be poor, and it’s been incredibly difficult to add correct text to the images.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The release of the latest <a href="https://ideogram.ai/">Ideogram.ai</a> model (1.0) is a massive step forward for image models. It is developed by the same team who created Google’s Imagen and Imagen video models — Mohammad, Jonathan, William, and Chitwan are among the pioneers of diffusion models — and they’ve created a consumer-grade user experience combined with state-of-the-art model research.</p>
<p>Ideogram’s latest model largely solves the typography problem. It’s incredibly fast and versatile, and the pictures it generates range from high-definition anime to abstract art to photorealistic images.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The improved typography support is hard to overstate. Not only does it allow a direct addition to the image, but the text is blended into the image with perfect composition and matching style, making the expression much more pronounced.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After viewing images with naturally embedded text, it’s hard to see the hodgepodge of text, shapes, and clip art from traditional business slides in the same light.</p>

 
     
         
                                             
                                        
                 
                                 
                                        
                 
                                     
     
    
     
        <a></a>
        <a></a>
     
 
<p>Ideogram’s product approach is to enable the users through iteration and fine-grained control. This is evident in the capability to remix an image with tweaks, the ability to upload an image as a seed, or even guide rough sections with an editing tool.</p>
<p>With the unveiling of 1.0, they introduced “Magic Prompt”, a prompting assistant that will take any prompt and turn it into a far richer, more detailed one. If prompts are the brushes of the GenAI age, Prompt Magic acts as an enhancer, automatically broadening and enriching their semantic depth. This feature is designed to unlock another level of inspiration, empowering users to explore new horizons of creativity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another big step in the model is the realism and details of the images. For generated images to become mainstream, photorealism is required in every domain — from professional design to immersive experiences. When each pixel is rendered with lifelike accuracy, it opens up new possibilities in digital content that engages, inspires, and astonishes millions.</p>

 
     
         
                                             
                                        
                 
                                 
                                        
                 
                                 
                                        
                 
                                     
     
    
     
        <a></a>
        <a></a>
     
 
<p>The range of expressiveness in Ideogram’s new model is stunning. So whether you’re creating a meme, making a presentation, designing a logo, or simply want your imagination to be realized, you can find inspirations on Ideogram’s public feed or immerse yourself in the <a href="https://discord.gg/ideogram">Discord community</a>.</p>
<p>We have been investors in Ideogram since their seed round, and are very excited to lead their Series A as they continue to push the boundaries of generative model research. They’re innovating on an intuitive product that acts as a printer of imagination to millions of users.</p>
<p>It’s common to wonder what life was like before the photograph; the total lack of record for anything. Going forward, people will wonder the same for our imaginations. How could we have lived without being able to take a snapshot of what was in our mind — to realize it, share it, and keep it. What an amazing time to be alive!</p>

Last year saw thousands of people join Nym community channels across the world and more than 40 new squads created — led by an emerging collective of&nbsp;Nymjas.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/memperkenalkan-liga-pasukan-nym-fajar-nymja-cb1f84d11411">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymportugues/apresentando-nym-squad-league-aurora-do-nymja-37888c110c4c">Português</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/n87c20b78d22b">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%B5%D0%BC-nym-squad-league-%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82-nymja-52c8b5bf34b1">Русский</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/kar%C5%9F%C4%B1n%C4%B1zda-nym-squad-league-nymjan%C4%B1n-do%C4%9Fu%C5%9Fu-09579ebacda7">Türkçe</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8Dnym%E6%88%98%E9%98%9F%E8%81%94%E7%9B%9F-nymja%E7%9A%84%E9%BB%8E%E6%98%8E-ef7350750531">中文</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squad-league-dawn-of-the-nymja-268b7c4b4b6a">Español</a></p><p>Now is when the community becomes stronger, more decentralised and more independent. Now is the time of&nbsp;Nymjas.</p><p>Welcome to the Nym Squad League, Season 0: Dawn of the&nbsp;Nymja!</p> What is Nym Squad&nbsp;League? <p>Once initiated into the way of the Nymja one does not exist in solitude; Nymjas unite in a seasonal gathering, a vibrant pulse of the Nym Squad&nbsp;League.</p><p>The Nym Squad League gathers Nymjas and their squads into seasonal missions to propel the success of the overall mission: to enable privacy for all of humanity.</p><p>This is not a conventional competition, but a collaborative exhibition of skill, artful dedication and innovation, where Nymjas compare notes, exchange strategies, and celebrate the collective progress made in fortifying the digital bastions of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Here’s how it&nbsp;works:</p>  At the beginning of each Season, a set of Missions are announced that align with the goals of Nym for that quarter. The first season is for Nymja and Shinobi&nbsp;only.  People who have been active in the Nym community can already <a href="https://app.deform.cc/form/556b3376-e34a-4006-b2b3-86f2b03a3fdc/">register as a Nymster! </a>Starting with Season 1 (April 2024), Nymsters will get to compete for a dedicated prize pool by acing challenges, completing quests and achievements, contributing to seasonal objectives, and&nbsp;more.  If they prove their skills, Nymsters will be invited to become a Nymja, giving them the ability to complete Missions and access to rolling contracts, for example running community channels.  Outstanding Nymjas might be invited to join the innermost circle: the Shinobi. These are Nym community experts, more knowledgeable at times than even the core team. Shinobi run programmes and have priority access to the Nym Innovation Fund.  At the end of each Season, the Squad Wealth Fund distributes rewards to community members who have excelled at the Missions.   Dawn of the Nymja:&nbsp;Missions <p>Season 0: Dawn of the Nymjas has already begun, with Nymja and Shinobi having received their first missions via their Dojos&nbsp;already.</p><p>This season is dedicated to sharpening the tools of the core team and community to meet the demand for the upcoming <a href="https://nymvpn.com/">NymVPN</a>. From Brazil to Ukraine and beyond, Nymjas across the world are busy testing the NymVPN, providing feedback and getting their own operations ready ahead of the NymVPN alpha&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Next season will open the doors to n00bs and Nymsters alike, for rolling bounties and ways to learn about and contribute to global&nbsp;privacy.</p> Sounds great! How do I&nbsp;start? <p>In the world of anonymity, the crowd is your friend, especially when the crowd is united by a collective mission that requires the strength of a united force. The first thing you need to do is join the Nym channels:</p>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> (think of it as the town square with no&nbsp;privacy)  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a> (this is the Nym HQ with stronger&nbsp;privacy)  <a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> (the Nym bulletin&nbsp;board)  <p>Global Telegram channels:</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p><p>Once you have joined one of the Nym communities, here’s how you can progress and become a core contributor:</p><p>Nymster: constructive, entertaining and helpful activity in community channels, min 50 NYM token staked or bonded. If you meet these requirements, <a href="https://app.deform.cc/form/556b3376-e34a-4006-b2b3-86f2b03a3fdc/">register&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Nymja: you need to be recommended by two existing Nymjas or core team and have submitted outstanding proof-of-work in your Nymster missions.</p><p>Shinobi: by Nym Core Team invitation only.</p><p>Nym Squad League is beyond a competition. It symbolises a community of individuals bound by a common cause — the relentless pursuit of privacy in the digital age. As they engage in these virtual missions, the Nymjas weave a tapestry of collaboration and commitment, demonstrating that privacy loves&nbsp;company.</p><p>Friends, welcome to the Nym Squad&nbsp;League…</p> Hold up, what is the Squad Wealth&nbsp;Fund? <p>The Squad Wealth Fund is a pot of NYM tokens that will grow and shrink with the performance and usage of Nym. The mechanics are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Every quarter, a new <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-delegation-programme-is-now-open-c371c74610c5">Nym Node Delegations Program</a> begins, with official delegations going to high-performing nodes in key regions. This is to ensure good coverage and that new operators have a chance to get into the ‘active set’ of the mixnet, start mixing traffic and providing privacy.  At the end of the quarter, staking rewards are redeemed and put into the Squad Wealth Fund to support the Nym Squad League missions that have been completed that&nbsp;season.  Nym nodes in the delegation program are regularly assessed for performance, stake saturation and uptime. Completed (fully saturated) and underperforming nodes are removed on a rolling basis, refilled with queued high-quality Nym&nbsp;nodes.  <p>The first round of delegations were made in January, with rewards being redeemed at the end of March to reward Nymjas and Shinobi missions.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squad-league-dawn-of-the-nymja-268b7c4b4b6a">Introducing Nym Squad League — Dawn of the Nymja</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today, Brave is excited to announce the release of Leo—Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser—on all Android devices. Android users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages, translate pages, create content, and more from both the browser address bar and within the webpage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since launching on desktop three months ago, Brave Leo has seen significant global adoption. With the chat interface built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way. Leo can help users answer questions, navigate different tasks, and accomplish more each day. And the experience has only gotten better—and the answers more accurate and timely—with the addition of new integrations and <a>new models like Mixtral</a>.</p>
<p>Now, that same great Leo experience is available for users with Android phones and tablets. Brave Android users can seamlessly interact with AI without leaving the security of the browser, and maximize productivity no matter where they are.</p>

 What can Leo do? 
<p>Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages you’re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:</p>
 
 Create real-time summaries of webpages or videos 
 Answer questions about content 
 Generate new long form written content 
 Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them 
 Create transcriptions of video or audio content 
 Write code 
 
<p>So what can you do with Leo on mobile? Summarize that long webpage you meant to read at the office, but never got around to. Get help hunting for a product mentioned on that page and compare it to others. Plan a recipe for tonight’s dinner. And get smart travel tips to escape the daily grind.</p>
<p>With Leo on Android, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, there’s no login or signup required—you just open your browser and chat. Privately.</p>

 Mixtral as the default LLM brings higher quality answers 
<p>Brave Leo gives access to several high-quality large-language models (LLMs), ensuring better, more relevant answers to even niche questions, and fewer of the hallucinations that plague other AI experiences.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Leo includes access to Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B. Mixtral—the default LLM—can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. It can even generate code.</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, <a>we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM</a> for Leo on desktop, and we’ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for Android as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.</p>

 Leo Premium&nbsp; 
<p>The Brave Leo experience is free to all users. For those who’d like access to higher rate limits, however, Leo is also available as a Premium experience. Users can subscribe to Leo Premium for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$14.99/month</a>, and one subscription covers up to 5 different devices across Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows. Users log into their Brave account from their other devices with that subscription.</p>

 Smart AI, still private by default 
<p>As with all of Brave’s other features, privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. These specific privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as <a>IP address</a>), and no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models. If you select a model from Anthropic and submit Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo (they access their Premium account if they wish to use Leo across multiple devices however).&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 What’s next for Leo, and how to get started 
<p>Brave Leo for Android is now available to all Brave Android users who’ve updated to version 1.63. Note that it will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today.  Brave Leo for iOS devices will be available in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on page chat experience, Android users can tap “⋮” and then tap Leo to get started.</p>
<p>To learn more about Brave Leo, check out our main product <a>main product page</a>, or see Leo’s product <a>roadmap</a>.</p>

It has a market capitalization of approximately $27 billion (equivalent to around 4 trillion yen) with over $24 billion in circulation according to its <a href="https://www.circle.com/hubfs/USDCAttestationReports/2023/2023%20USDC_Examination%20Report%20December%202023.pdf">December 2023 reserve attestation report</a>. USDC reserves are managed separately from Circle's business operating funds for the benefit of USDC holders, and are deposited with major financial institutions. Additionally, USDC has powered over $12 trillion in cumulative on-chain transactions, and is used daily as a digitally-native store of value, unit of measure and payment innovation.<br><br>Coincheck's initiative to incorporate USDC as part of its products and services is subject to obtaining registration of an Electronic Payment Instrument Services under the Payment Services Act.<br><br>Since its launch in 2014, Coincheck attracted over 1.91 million verified users as of end January 2024. As the leading crypto asset trading service in Japan2, Coincheck aims to leverage its design philosophy as well as its user-friendly UI and UX to foster adoption of USDC in Japan.<br><br>This collaboration represents a significant stride in Coincheck’s efforts to enhance its product offerings, and maintain high standards in UI and UX design.&nbsp;<br><br>“Our collaboration with Coincheck is foundational in bringing the stability and reliability of USDC to the Japanese market,” said Jeremy Allaire, CEO and co-founder of Circle. “We are excited to work with Coincheck to pave the way for a new era in digital finance in Japan.”<br><br>“We are very excited to bring USDC, the global standard of stable tokens, to Japan and work together with Jeremy and the Circle team to develop further the Japanese crypto markets as well as the blockchain ecosystem.” said Oki Matsumoto, Managing Director &amp; Chairman of Coincheck, Inc. / Representative Executive Officer &amp; Chairman of Monex Group, Inc. <br><br>“We are excited to announce the collaboration with Circle to expand the usage of USDC in Japan,” said Satoshi Hasuo, Representative Director and President at Coincheck, Inc. “Stablecoins are becoming increasingly popular among domestic crypto asset users and are expected to be used as a means of payment for transactions involving buying and selling crypto assets and NFTs. Taking a step towards handling USDC, which is a stablecoin backed by high-quality US dollar-denominated reserve assets and compliant with regulations in various countries, holds significant meaning for our company as well as our users.”<br><br><br>1 Certain stablecoins are qualified as electronic payment instruments in Japan and are allowed to be issued and circulated following the revised Payment Services Act that came into effect on June 1, 2023. Once an electronic payment instrument service provider is authorized to handle USDC in Japan under the Payment Services Act, USDC will be qualified as an electronic payment instrument.<br><br>2 Coincheck has been #1 in Japan for the number of crypto asset trading app downloads for five consecutive years (Period: January 2019 to December 2023, Data support: <a href="https://www.apptweak.com/">App Tweak</a>).</p>

<p>With the latest update of Brave on desktop (1.63), Brave Wallet users can now create Native SegWit Bitcoin accounts, which offer lower transaction fees and better error detection compared to other Bitcoin account types. Brave Wallet is now also fully equipped to send and receive from all types of Bitcoin addresses, including Legacy, Nested SegWit, Native SegWit, and Taproot, ensuring compatibility with third-party wallets.</p>
<p>After nearly 15 years, Bitcoin has stood the test of time and proven itself as a resilient asset class. There’s growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin following the approval of several Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.— and Bitcoin use cases are expanding beyond peer-to-peer payments and serving as a store-of-value with a new wave of innovation fueled by NFTs and DeFi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our aim with Brave Wallet is to offer the most secure and privacy-considerate software wallet for everyday use. As the Bitcoin ecosystem expands with new apps and services, Brave Wallet will be there to put security and privacy first, to help keep users’ assets safe.”</p>
<p>– James Mudgett, VP Web3 Products at Brave</p>

<p>How to get started with Bitcoin in Brave Wallet</p>
 
 Open Brave Wallet on Mac, Windows, or Linux 
 Click the expanded … menu in the top right of the panel 
 Select Create account 
 Select Bitcoin 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>More UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) chains and features on the horizon</p>
<p>Last year we announced our partnership with <a>Zcash and Filecoin Foundation</a> to bring better privacy to the Web. In the coming months, we’ll be delivering on a major component of the partnership in Brave Wallet with shielded Zcash transactions. Later this year, we’ll add support for more Bitcoin account types, which will allow users to store BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals in Brave Wallet—and make all of these features available across all desktop and mobile versions of Brave.</p>
<p>About Brave Wallet</p>
<p>Brave Wallet enables Brave users to store, swap, and manage their crypto assets across multiple blockchains from a single wallet. Unlike most crypto wallets, Brave Wallet is browser-native, meaning it doesn’t require any additional downloads or extensions, helping reduce security risks and improve convenience across the ever-expanding landscape of Web3.</p>
<p>To get started with Brave Wallet, <a>download Brave</a> and click the wallet icon in the top right corner of your browser.</p>

      Delivering Instacart’s Next Chapter         
	By Davy Rothbart	 



Published February 26, 2024
        From fishing village to Silicon Valley, Instacart CEO Fidji Simo is tackling the grocery shopping ecosystem.      



 
<p>Fidji Simo sat in a San Francisco hotel room, poring over details for the coming day. As CEO of tech upstart Instacart, the next morning—September 19, 2023—would be a landmark day. Simo was leading the company’s IPO, a historic moment that would be held at Instacart’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Nasdaq staff had flown in from New York City to oversee the event, and Simo’s own parents had made the journey from France. Though Simo was known for her equanimity, she was electric with anticipation.</p>



<p>Her husband, Remy Miralles, encouraged her to try to get some sleep. Miralles had been by Simo’s side throughout her journey: from a high schooler in France with big dreams to an MBA student in the United States; from helping scale Facebook, the world’s biggest social media network, to taking the helm as CEO at Instacart, where she led the company through a dramatic period of transition as she prepared it to go public. “Promise me one thing,” Miralles said. “Tomorrow, you’ll be pulled in a million directions. You’ll be focused on what comes next. Please, savor the moment.”</p>



<p>Simo knew he was right. It would be a mistake to breeze past this momentous occasion with her gaze set solely on the future. As the winds off the Bay whistled outside, Simo settled in to wait for the new day to begin.</p>



 



<p>Sète, population 44,576 (about the size of San Luis Obispo), is a bucolic fishing town in the south of France, on the Mediterranean Sea. For generations, Simo’s family, Sicilian by heritage, had worked in the fishing industry. Her grandfather, Rocco, was the captain of a fishing vessel; her father, Jacques, rose through the ranks to captain his own boat. They worked long, hard days, sometimes as long as 18 hours, heading out to sea at 2 in the morning and returning at 8 in the evening with a fresh haul of bass, sole, hake, monkfish, sardines and anchovies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Simo’s grandmother, Viviane, was a fishmonger who sold what her husband caught at a tiny shop in the center of town. Simo took pride in her family’s hard work and their crucial, if perhaps underappreciated, role in supplying food for the village and beyond. But she knew she would never follow in their footsteps. As a kid, though it thrilled her to join her dad at sea, she always got seasick, a malady she never outgrew. Simo preferred being on land and cherished her time in the city gardens with her sketchbook in hand, filling a blank page with drawings inspired by Gaudí and the Surrealists, or in her mother’s boutique, admiring her entrepreneurial spirit and the kind, authentic way she interacted with customers. Over time, Simo developed an interest in business and dreamed of one day launching one of her own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One night, the radio Simo’s grandfather kept on the dining room table crackled to life—an emergency transmission. A fishing boat was in rough seas, in desperate trouble. While her father and other fishermen scrambled into boats to aid the rescue mission, Simo stayed by her grandfather’s side, listening as the captains worked together to organize the rescue, riveted by their composure under pressure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memory has always stuck with Simo—a demonstration of the power of leadership and community in a moment of crisis. As boat captains, Simo’s dad and grandfather often spoke of their responsibilities, not only in keeping their crews safe but making sure each person on board felt valued. They were the kinds of leaders who wouldn’t assign a task they weren’t willing to do themselves, never too regal to scrub decks or disentangle nets. “The crew comes before you, always,” Simo says, summarizing the ethos her dad and grandfather modeled. For her, this approach has been a lifelong priority. The world of tech may seem vastly distant from life aboard a fishing boat on the Mediterranean Sea, but for Simo, her childhood yielded lasting lessons.</p>



 



<p>After high school, when Simo left her hometown to go to business school at HEC Paris, Miralles went with her. The two had met as teenagers and formed a friendship that would evolve into a lifelong partnership. As she closed in on her master’s degree, Simo elected to take courses at UCLA, fulfilling a long-held dream of moving to the U.S. that she’d nurtured through an obsession with the Southern California TV drama “The O.C.” Again, Miralles joined her. Their decision to move overseas, far from their home and close-knit families, wasn’t made lightly. But Simo, like her parents and grandparents before her, had always been one to rush toward a challenge, not run away. What’s more, she had Miralles’ support, a confidence that would give her the courage to make bold decisions time and again in her career. And she was intrigued by what she viewed as a U.S. appetite for entrepreneurial risk-taking—in business and in developing new technologies.</p>



<p>On the flight to Los Angeles, she blasted the theme song to “The O.C.,” “California” by Phantom Planet, through her headphones: “California, here we come!” She knew the future would come with challenges, but sitting back in her seat, she relished the joy of it beginning.</p>



 



<p>After UCLA, Simo spent four years on eBay’s strategy team before moving to Facebook in 2011. The company had already seen explosive growth but continued to expand its scope. As VP of video, games and monetization, Simo tackled challenges with relish, defying skeptics at every turn. Few believed Facebook could monetize mobile, but Simo cracked the problem by introducing a robust advertising network to the Facebook App, which proved to be a turning point for the company. When there were doubts as to whether the company could compete with YouTube given its eight-year head start on video, Simo and her team built Facebook Live and Facebook Watch, pioneering new approaches to video streaming and generating massive engagement.</p>



<p>In time, Simo developed a powerful sponsor in CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Working alongside him at “the school of Zuck,” as she calls it, Simo learned crucial lessons about balancing long-term strategy and vision with a commitment to short-term execution. “A lot of great operators can do the day-to-day, nitty-gritty work, but don’t have vision,” Simo says. “And a lot of people have great vision, but can’t execute for the life of them. Mark has both. And that really shaped me.”</p>



<p>Zuckerberg’s faith in Simo was apparent when he gave her the reins to the flagship Facebook App, where she would manage a staff of 6,000. As Simo dug excitedly into the new challenge, however, she suddenly began dealing with a constellation of frightening physical symptoms: dizziness, nausea and frequent fainting spells. She was eventually diagnosed with a neuroimmune condition called postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which is not life-threatening but can be debilitating.</p>



<p>Determined to rise to the occasion of leading the Facebook App, Simo refused to let the diagnosis hold her back. Instead, she found creative ways of managing her symptoms in the workplace, like bringing a reclining chair into the boardroom to ensure her blood pressure didn’t drop during long meetings. Facebook rallied around her during this time—an outpouring of community support that echoed what she’d experienced as a child in Sète’s fishing scene.</p>



<p>Despite Simo’s successes and close relationships at Facebook, as a creative soul, she yearned to one day be a CEO herself. She viewed the CEO position as the ultimate canvas to shape a business following her own instincts and imagination. She was fascinated with the idea of solving a company’s most critical puzzles. In 2021, when she was approached by a major tech company in need of new ideas and fresh vision on its board, her ears perked up.</p>
 







 
<p>Instacart was founded in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, Max Mullen and Brandon Leonardo. After an initial rejection, it famously secured a spot in Y Combinator when the founders ordered a six-pack of beer that was delivered to the partners. Michael Moritz, formerly a partner at Sequoia, led its investment in the company soon after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following nearly a decade of steady growth, Instacart became essential during the pandemic as shopping went digital, and its sales surged. But as quarantine waned and people returned to shopping in person, Instacart’s growth declined. The company recognized it needed to redefine itself in a post-COVID world. Founder-CEO Mehta was the first to identify Simo for the board, noting that her scaled operating experience and product expertise would be valuable as the company navigated the path forward.</p>



<p>While maintaining her role at Facebook, Simo joined Instacart’s board in January 2021 as the company was strategizing on how to expand its ambitions. “Instacart’s mission of helping people access food resonated deeply with me,” she says. “Growing up in a family who for generations harvested food from the sea and brought it ashore, it was this ancestral, deeply cultural connection.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Instacart’s mission of helping people access food resonated deeply with me,”</p>
Fidji Simo</blockquote>



<p>Later that summer, Instacart and Mehta began pursuing a successor for his role to lead the company into its next chapter—someone with a vision for Instacart’s future and experience running an organization at the scale the company hoped to achieve. Moritz, impressed with Simo’s board contributions, began championing her for the role. Recognizing her CEO potential and ambition, he wryly commented to Simo that she would grow old waiting for the chance at Facebook. “Michael had the wisdom of having seen so many people navigate this career moment,” Simo says. “He told me, ‘If one of your goals is to be a CEO, to make a difference and see what you can do when you can drive your own vision, Instacart is your canvas.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the position’s appeal, Simo knew it came with pressure and risk. “At the time, Instacart’s gross transaction volume was declining by double digits,” Simo remembers. While Instacart’s success—and her own as its CEO—wasn’t guaranteed, Simo was drawn to the challenge of steering the company’s evolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a series of visits from Moritz at her home to discuss the role’s challenges and potential—and bond over her husband’s recipe for madeleines—she was about ready to accept. When she asked Miralles his opinion, he encouraged her to listen to her instincts for where she would find joy. “That’s where you’ll do your best work,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2021, Simo became CEO of Instacart, a seismic industry move that made headlines around the world. Now, the hard work could finally begin.</p>



 



<p>Simo was aware of the whispers in Silicon Valley that Instacart would never be profitable. As newly minted CEO, she was determined to prove skeptics wrong, as she had throughout her career.</p>



<p>Early in her new role as CEO, Simo observed a tension between Instacart and its retail partners, the grocery stores where Instacart shoppers shopped. To the retailers, Simo says, it wasn’t clear if Instacart was a friend or a “frenemy.” She recognized that Instacart was reliant on its retailers for success and sought to strengthen these relationships in a way that was symbiotic. If Instacart could help retailers thrive, she intuited, the company would also prosper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To achieve this, Simo revamped Instacart’s company values and instituted a new leadership ethos known as Grow the Pie to help grocers improve their own processes—both in-store and online—via new technologies. Instacart partnered with over 100 grocery chains like Sprouts and Publix to build smooth, sleek, white-label websites that are individually branded but powered by Instacart. Now, whether a customer orders groceries through Instacart or a grocer’s site, both parties benefit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Simo’s superpowers is innovating new products, and a major appeal of the CEO role was getting to push product visions forward. As part of its omnichannel strategy, Simo made the decision to acquire Caper AI, a startup offering AI-powered grocery carts. When an in-store customer places an item in a Caper Cart, the cart is able to scan it and add the price to a running tally. The screen serves as a payment terminal, so when a customer is done shopping, they can avoid the line and head for the parking lot. The cart is also outfitted with a screen where brands can suggest recipes and advertise products, a significant revenue opportunity for both Instacart and the stores.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“These changes have allowed Instacart to reach beyond its roots as a service fulfillment company into managing the full grocery shopping ecosystem.”</p>
Fidji Simo</blockquote>



<p>Once retailers were confident that their goals were aligned with Instacart’s, they found other ways to more deeply integrate, adding new online offerings that enabled customers to access every aisle of the store—including alcohol, produce and packaged goods—and to pay via a variety of payment methods, including EBT SNAP. “These changes have allowed Instacart to reach beyond its roots as a service fulfillment company into managing the full grocery shopping ecosystem, while partner stores also benefit,” Simo says. “It’s been absolutely thrilling to see.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo recognized the critical role played not just by partner stores, but by Instacart’s shoppers. To understand their motivations and challenges, Simo tried her hand at being a shopper herself. The experiment was humbling. Finding parking at a San Francisco grocery store called Gus’s was in itself a daunting feat. Then, managing a customer’s particular dietary preferences presented another challenge. As Simo roamed the aisles trying to locate a specific brand of kombucha (a product that this fish-and-potatoes girl had never tried), a store manager came to her aid and helped her complete the order. “I got a sense for how resourceful the shoppers are and how difficult a job it can be,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo began holding regular one-on-one meetings with shoppers, too. She notes that Instacart’s shoppers vary demographically from other gig economy workers: about two-thirds are women and approximately half are parents. Simo says the shoppers provided “a tapestry of reasons” why they were drawn to Instacart, though for most of them the flexible hours—and locations—were key. One shopper had a severely disabled daughter and was able to clock in for short stretches when someone else was available to offer support at home. Another woman had always dreamed of traveling to all 50 states. Working for Instacart allowed her to have a job on hand wherever she traveled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo made it her mission for Instacart to introduce new technologies that would increase shopper efficiency and boost their pay. Instacart began alerting shoppers to peak earnings days; prompted customers to increase tips when they rated a shopper five stars; created batch orders so that a shopper could grab items for multiple customers on a single trip to the grocery store; and built in-app way-finding technologies that allow shoppers to navigate aisles and collect items in a more efficient pattern. These efforts have largely succeeded; Shopper salaries, on a per-hour basis, have consistently notched up. “I’m proud that shoppers are now making more than they did in the past,” Simo says.</p>

<p>Simo was chosen to lead Instacart because investors believed she could grow the company and reimagine it, but also because they felt she could ready the company to go public. In late 2021, however, the tech industry was hit by a market collapse and subsequent IPO drought. Given this difficult climate, a less ambitious person might have shelved the prospect of going public altogether. But Simo was keenly aware of the hundreds of Instacart employees who had worked tirelessly for years, for whom an IPO could be life-changing, allowing them a cash liquidity she felt they’d clearly earned. Simo promised her employees that when the market grew receptive, Instacart would be one of the first companies to go public. To do so, however, Simo “quickly realized that we needed to show the world that this was an industry that was profitable.”</p>



<p>Ravi Gupta, a former CFO and COO at Instacart who became a partner at Sequoia in 2019, became a trusted advisor to Simo as she quickly got up to speed on where Instacart had been and put a strategy in place for the future. Recalling their conversations, Gupta says, “She’s built to be a CEO. She wants the ball. She wants the responsibility that comes with leadership.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“She’s built to be a CEO. She wants the ball. She wants the responsibility that comes with leadership.”</p>

<p>For two years, Simo worked with her team to pivot the company toward profitability. Product innovations—from batching orders to shopper way-finding—improved the margin on each order, and its revenue from advertising has grown significantly. Instacart now boasts more than 5,500 ad partners, including PepsiCo, General Mills and Unilever. It has introduced new ad formats such as shoppable display ads, and because Instacart (and its associated white-label sites) is a closed-loop platform, the company is able to serve up unique insights to partners about how their ads are driving sales. Instacart reported that ad campaigns drive an average 15% incremental sales lift—an almost unheard-of number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the market downturn, Simo had observed other companies try to hang onto their former valuations, concerned about the optics of a lowered figure. “They buried their heads in the sand and pretended nothing had changed,” she says. “I took a different approach. I faced reality straight-up, and I’m like, ‘Okay, yep, the markets have changed. We are not worth the same. That’s totally okay. Let’s embrace this new reality and grant stock for employees at a fair valuation.’ We’re focused on doing what’s right, not the thing that looks good.’”</p>



<p>By the summer of 2023, Instacart had hit five consecutive quarters of profitability. As the markets continued to warm, Simo kept her promise to her team, setting an IPO date for September, with an opening price of $30 per share. With more than $2 billion in cash reserves, Simo says Instacart’s IPO was less about raising money (and, in fact, was non-dilutive) than making sure that the company’s more than 3,000 employees would finally realize the fruits of their labor.</p>



<p>Usually, when a company goes public and hits the Nasdaq exchange, a few lead executives show up in New York City to ring the bell and celebrate. But Simo knew the company’s success was a result of the employees who had contributed throughout the years, and she wanted all of them to have the chance to participate in the festivities. So she asked Nasdaq officials to come to San Francisco.</p>



<p>The night before the IPO, her husband’s suggestion to be present resonated deeply. The next morning, as the company gathered in the employee cafeteria, now decked out with its CART ticker symbol, Simo circulated among employees, the executive team, the founders and their families, and felt her emotions rise. She and her husband had also invited their 8-year-old daughter Willow to join the occasion, as well as Simo’s parents and grandmother Viviane—the former fishmonger—who’d arrived from her hometown of Sète. “I started seeing the scene through their eyes,” Simo says. “I hadn’t made a big deal out of it, and I don’t think they really knew what to expect. But when I saw the tears in their eyes, it flipped a switch in me.” In particular, Simo was moved by the sight of her dad, Jacques—the hardened fishing captain who could pull a hook out of his hand without flinching—now radiant, bursting with pride and tearing up.</p>



<p>Cameras rolled, broadcasting the ceremony around the world, as Simo stood on stage with Instacart’s executive team and rang the bell, marking Instacart’s emergence as a publicly traded company. For 90 seconds, she clapped along with her colleagues, sharing the joy, accomplishment and pride of the moment. “And then right after the cameras turned off,” she says, “I was just a sobbing mess.”</p>



<p>Through her tears, Simo picked up a microphone and made an impromptu toast, shining a light on Instacart’s co-founders and talented workforce. “I had this immense feeling of gratitude,” Simo says, “because I realized how much of a privilege it was to lead a team like this, and work toward a mission that can make a difference in the world.” Simo says what gives her the most joy in business is finding the magic in others and celebrating it. To have the chance to big-up her hard-working team in front of their colleagues—and even their own families—swept her with another wave of happy tears. Finally, Simo welcomed her daughter, Willow, to join her on the podium, and as a chorus of flashbulbs popped, they both grinned—dreaming of the future, but fully present in the moment.</p>



 



<p>The art studio in Simo’s home, dubbed the flower room, is a space dedicated to her personal projects: paintings, sculptures and collages. Simo takes flowers by the dozens, hangs them up to dry and then uses their distinctive natural dyes as a material in her art. Simo’s health condition makes intensive exercise a no-go, so when she wants to tune out work stress, the flower room is her sanctuary. One recent Saturday afternoon, she huddled with Willow in the flower room, sculpting magic wands out of sticks and flowers. Together, they pretended to imbue each wand with special powers: levitating objects, stopping time.</p>



<p>Though Simo’s free time is limited, she squeezes every drop out of it, cherishing moments with her daughter and the occasional dinner out with Miralles. She also, bogglingly, has found the bandwidth to create the Metrodora Institute, which opened in April 2023 in Salt Lake City. Metrodora, named after a fifth-century female Greek physician, welcomes those living with diseases that many doctors fail to diagnose and often do not know how to treat. The center offers clinical care and conducts scientific research with the goal of developing cures for complex chronic conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Challenges can spur creation,” Simo says. It’s a motto she reiterates to her team at Instacart as the company continues to work to expand its scope and prove its durability in what remains a challenging environment for many public tech companies. One of the initiatives to broaden Instacart’s horizons relates to Simo’s interest in health care and biotech. “Eighty-five percent of health care costs come from treating chronic diseases, like diabetes and hypertension, that can be caused or made worse by diets that lack key nutrients,” Simo says. “It became obvious to me that a company like Instacart, which exists at the intersection of people’s relationship with food, has a role to play in health care.” Simo conceived of Instacart Health, a program that allows doctors to prescribe food as easily as they prescribe medication. Simo imagines a future where a doctor not only recommends that a patient eat healthier, but prescribes specific meals, and by the time that patient arrives home, the ingredients for the meal are waiting on their doorstep, delivered by an Instacart shopper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for now, here on a Saturday afternoon with her daughter, Simo’s job is to sculpt another magic wand and pass her special powers down to her own child. “I want her to see that everything is possible,” Simo says. “That’s the biggest gift that my parents gave me.” Though Simo’s family had no advanced degrees, Simo says their message to her never wavered: If you work hard and put your mind to something, you can accomplish anything. Now, Simo reflects on Instacart’s IPO, and her special moment on stage with her daughter. “I think that was when everything landed for her,” Simo says. “Like, ‘Okay, wow, this is a big moment. And Mom is right! We can do big things.’”</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation engineering team has been working on an implementation library for <a href="https://zfnd.org/frost/">FROST</a> (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures) for Zcash. To support this we have built <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">demos</a>, which are NOT to be used in a production environment nor with any secrets. The purpose of these demos are to:</p>



 
 Identify gaps in our documentation 



 Provide usage examples for developer facing documentation 



 Provide reference implementations for developers wanting to use FROST in a “real world” scenario 
 



 



<p></p>



 THREE DEMOS 



<p>We have three demos in this project covering each of the corresponding roles, which are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Trusted Dealer: a third party or participant who is trusted to:
 
 Generate good randomness 



 Keep secret values confidential 



 Delete secret values after distributing key shares to each participant 
 
 



 Participant: a recipient of a key share 



 Coordinator: a third party or participant who is responsible for:
 
 Determining which participants will take part in generating a signature 



 Coordinating FROST signature rounds 



 Aggregating signature shares generated by each participant 



 Publishing the resulting signature 
 
 
 



 



<p>Note: We also have <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost-zcash-demo/tree/main/dkg">a demo</a> which covers Distributed Key Generation (DKG), where there is no trusted dealer role and participants generate key shares among themselves.</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>We invite you to&nbsp; test the demos for yourself by following <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">our tutorial</a>, which was showcased during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvzESdDtczo&amp;list=PL40dyJ0UYTLII7oQRQmNOFf0d2iKT35tL&amp;index=37">our presentation at ZCon4</a>. The demos allow you to choose one of two journeys—either with a trusted dealer or DKG for key generation. This tutorial describes the trusted dealer journey.</p>



 



 HOW WE BUILT THEM 



<p>The method for building these demos included:</p>



 
 Reading the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf">FROST paper</a> 



 Reading the <a href="https://cfrg.github.io/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost-15/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost.html">FROST draft</a> 



 Reading documentation in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-core">FROST crate</a> 



 Reading documentation in library while building the demos 



 Referring to the draft paper to match the documentation 
 



<p>When building a protocol library from a paper, names are likely to change and you need to document the code well; it’s not uncommon to find mismatches. We tried to build the demo from the perspective of someone who had not seen FROST before, and so we went through all the documentation without any assumptions. We also started publishing releases more often so the demos could be updated as we found different API changes we needed to make. This encouraged us to properly document throughout the process.</p>



 



 NEW FUNCTIONALITY 



<p>We realized that we hadn’t created a way for the trusted dealer to accept an existing key rather than allowing the application to generate one for you. Originally we weren’t able to specify an existing secret because generate_trusted_dealer() generated a secret for you. We compared this functionality to that specified in the draft paper and&nbsp; it was discovered this was missing; so we added split_secret() to handle this functionality and trusted_dealer_keygen()would generate one instead.</p>



<p>We also took this opportunity to add serde support to our FROST library. Serde is a library that helps encoding structures into multiple formats such as JSON or XML. We’d had a request to implement serde in our FROST library and decided that the demos created a good opportunity to get this done, since they require copying and pasting structures between terminals. It was pretty straightforward and it meant we could copy structures encoded as a single line JSON object between our terminals, instead of having to copy and paste each field of each structure.</p>



<p>Working on these demos has enabled us to make the library more robust and easier to use for implementers. We’d love to know if you agree!</p>



<p>We hope that this will help anyone understand how frost works and what you can do with it. Please do let us know if you’ve found this useful by reaching out to us on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/676527656170160146/997122644048613427">ZF Discord FROST channel</a>.</p>

<p>Confidential-DPproof uses Zero Knowledge Proofs for verifiable privacy protection, and garners Spotlight award at prestigious ICLR 2024 conference</p>
<p>by Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Privacy Researcher at Brave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary. Machine learning models trained on clients’ data without any guarantees of privacy can leak sensitive information about clients. For example, in the application of machine learning to advertising, we ideally want to learn the general patterns (“showing scientific advertisements to clients visiting scientifically related contents”), however parameters of a trained machine learning model might encode specific facts about the interest of an individual client (“Ali visited <a>https://brave.com/research/</a> on 26 Feb 2024.”). Unfortunately, some institutions may not adhere to their claim of training machine learning models with client privacy</p>
 
 Intentionally: not considering client privacy while training the models, or considering inadequate privacy safeguards to achieve better model utility; or&nbsp; 
 Accidentally: hard-to-detect bugs occurred in the implementation of privacy requirements of learning algorithms. 
 
<p>We introduce verifiable private training (Confidential-DPproof – Confidential proof of differentially private training) which enhances training with a certificate of privacy while not revealing any information about the data and model.</p>
<p><a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a> is accepted at the 12th International Conference on Learning Representations <a href="https://iclr.cc/">ICLR2024</a> as a spotlight (top 5%) paper. Confidential-DPproof will be presented at the conference between May 7th and 11th in Vienna, Austria. <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a> is available in an open-source implementation, and can be used by institutions to offer verifiable privacy protection to clients in machine learning based products.</p>

 Why should we care about client’s privacy when training machine learning models on their data? 
<p>Machine learning models that are trained without a privacy-preserving algorithm can memorize sensitive information about their training set. Publishing the parameters, or even just the outputs, of machine learning models can consequently risk the privacy of the clients who contributed to their training process. For example,&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05820.pdf">Membership inference attacks</a>: exploit access to a model’s outputs to infer the presence (or absence) of a particular data point in its training set. 
 <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=oVn5GLyONY">Data reconstruction attacks</a>: reconstruct the original training data points through an analysis of the model’s parameters.&nbsp; 
 

 How can we protect client’s privacy? 
<p>The framework of <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/tcc2006/38760266/38760266.pdf">Differential Privacy</a> is the gold standard for formalizing privacy guarantees. When training machine learning models, a Differential Privacy training algorithm provides guarantees for individuals by ensuring that data contributed by each individual client has a bounded influence on the final model in a mathematically precise manner. Therefore, absence or presence of a client will not result in a significantly different model.</p>
<p>Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent is the canonical approach to training machine learning models with guarantees of Differential Privacy. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent imposes two main modifications to vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent to provide differential privacy guarantees: 1) clipping per-example gradients to a fixed norm to bound the algorithm’s sensitivity to each individual client’s data (assuming each client only contributes one data point to the training); 2) adding calibrated noise to gradients before they are applied to update the model to ensure indistinguishability across updates. Training machine learning models with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent mitigates all attacks against the privacy of training data that fall within the threat model of differential privacy, including membership inference and training data reconstruction.</p>

 Why should we care about verifiable privacy? 
<p>Implementing Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent training algorithms can be challenging and hard-to-detect errors can easily occur as a result of uncommon and complex modification to the underlying training optimizer. Therefore, institutions may not adhere to their claims of training machine learning models with differential privacy guarantees intentionally (e.g., if they are trying to evade privacy regulations to maximize utility) or accidentally (e.g., if there are hard-to-detect bugs in the implementation of their private algorithm). For example, see Apple’s ambiguity around not releasing the exact privacy budget of a deployed Differential Privacy mechanism and/or other relevant details: <a href="https://www.cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs380/fall2019/Papers/privacylossappleproducts.pdf">Privacy Loss in Apple’s Implementation of Differential Privacy on MacOS 10.12</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important for companies or other institutions that use DP-SGD to demonstrate that they train models within the privacy constraints expressed by clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Confidential-DPproof framework 
<p>We designed a framework, called <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a>, that allows institutions to directly and proactively prove to any interested party–users or customers, regulators or governments–, through the execution of a Zero Knowledge Proof protocol, that their machine learning models are trained in a privacy-preserving manner (i.e., protecting the privacy of individuals who provided their data for the training).</p>


    
    

    


    




 How does Confidential-DPproof work? 
<p>In our work, we propose a zero-knowledge proof protocol to proactively generate a certificate of privacy during the training process while preserving the confidentiality of all information including training data and model parameters.&nbsp; Zero-knowledge proof allows a party to prove statements about their private data without revealing it. Therefore, the prover’s dataset or model is not revealed to external parties.</p>
<p>Parties. Consider a setting with two parties, a prover and an auditor:</p>
 
 The prover is an institution that wants to train a model on a sensitive dataset for different purposes such as providing machine learning based services. 
 The auditor is an external entity (e.g., a user or an auditor) that aims to verify the privacy guarantees of the prover’s model. 
 
<p>Desiderata.</p>
 
 Completeness. The auditor must infer the exact privacy guarantee and provide a public certificate of such guarantee. 
 Soundness. The auditor must be able to catch malicious provers who do not adhere to their claims of training machine learning models with privacy guarantees, either intentionally or accidentally. 
 Zero Knowledge. The training data and model parameters computed during training must stay confidential as institutions are not willing/allowed to share their models and data with external parties due to privacy regulations and intellectual property concerns. 
 
<p>Confidential-DPproof framework works as follows:</p>
 
 Prover publicly announces the privacy guarantees that it is planning to provide; 
 Prover and auditor agree on the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent training algorithm and specific values for its hyperparameters. 
 Prover and auditor run our newly-proposed zero-knowledge protocol. 
 Prover obtains a certificate for the claimed privacy guarantee. 
 

 How is the performance of Confidential-DPproof? 
<p>Since we design Confidential-DPproof to enable institutions to prove the differential privacy guarantees of their model to an auditor while being able to protect the confidentiality of their data and model, our experiments consider the following questions:</p>
 
 What are the best trade-offs between utility and certified privacy guarantees that Confidential-DPproof can achieve given i)&nbsp; the respective interests of the institution (in terms of utility); ii)&nbsp; the respective interests of auditor (in terms of privacy); and iii) constraints imposed by Zero-Knowledge proof regarding the complexity of models? 
 What is the cost (in terms of running time) of verifying the training run while ensuring confidentiality? 
 
<p>

    
    

    


    



ConfidentialDPproof trains machine learning models that achieve high test accuracy with certified privacy guarantees in practical running time!</p>

 Want to improve Confidential-DPproof? 
<p>Confidential-DPproof provides many benefits to institutions and their users; however, there is still room for improvement. For example, one could further extend Confidential-DPproof to prove that no adversarial data manipulation, such as sharing information across data points, was performed prior to data commitment.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>Another week has flown by in the dynamic world of Panther – now it’s time to share our latest updates and progress with the Panther community! This week’s rundown highlights several key developments and testing from the past week.</p> Ecosystem updates  Blog  - let’s end the taboo of on-chain privacy <p>Our<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lets-end-the-taboo-of-on-chain-privacy/"> latest blog </a>covers why Web3 needs to engage in a more nuanced conversation about the integral roles privacy and transparency play in financial exchange, maintaining fair and free markets, and enabling institutions to conduct daily operations.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Current testnet users: 900+  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 2 million $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Enhancement Stage-1 <p>As we continue to strive for parallel development efforts, a 2-week technical enhancement stage is in progress to implement various fixes from previous stages. This week, we made several enhancements across different components of the protocol, including the Wallet Engine, to boost productivity. This included optimizing its cold start, resolving issues with data passing to the dApp, enabling silent initialization post zAccount activation, and addressing a set of Stage 4 issues. One of the key features to be released as a part of this enhancement stage is the transfer of zZKP from Panther Gas account to regular zAsset and vice-versa.</p><p>The team has further implemented error code mappings focused on enhancing user experience by providing detailed explanations for transaction failures. We are expecting to release stage 1 of enhancements for public testing in the week of February 26.</p> Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a third party Relayer service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract. The team is currently performing integration testing with the second Relayer. Overall, the end-to-end Relayer integration process is working. The team is working on Stage 5 parallel with other stages and is pending the implementation on the dApp side.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of testnet is a complex stage and includes fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal.&nbsp;</p><p>Changes to the smart contract are under development and expected to be completed by next week. The changes for displaying and charging fees from the dApp will require an additional two weeks. We expect to release Stage 6 for public testing in mid-March.&nbsp;</p><p>You can read <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/weekly-update-panther-protocol-feb-16/">last week’s update</a> to learn more about Stage 6 functionalities.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>The monolithic blockchain era appears to be sunsetting. Among the first to contribute to this paradigm shift was Cosmos, which introduced the idea of specialized sovereign blockchains (appchains), made possible by the Cosmos SDK. Nowadays, the modular thesis employs external data availability and even execution solutions, which enables the creation of countless new chains. Each new blockchains comes with its own ‘specs’, and centralised RPC and node providers have to adapt to each chain’s setting. However, the saying ‘Jack of all trades, master of none’ applies in this scenario too - we have often witnessed RPC failures during high demand periods. Lava Network aims to provide a competitive marketplace for RPC and node providers, which would compete based on their performance and user feedback.</p><p>We were joined by Gil and Yair to discuss Lava Network’s RPC decentralisation in the modular, multi-chain landscape.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  High-level overview of Lava Network  What problem Lava Network solves  Decentralised marketplace for RPC providers  Quality of centralised vs. decentralised RPC providers  Gateways  Lava Network participants  Specs &amp; APIs  Quality of service &amp; provider optimizer  How services are priced  Relayers  Modularity &amp; chain abstraction  Magma &amp; Lava mainnet  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/yaircleper">Yair Cleper on LinkedIn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/xgilxgil">Gil Binder on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/lavanetxyz">Lava Network on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>As transparent Central Bank Digital Currency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/euro-backed-stablecoin-eurm-trials-spain?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">(CBDC) pilots</a> continue to gain traction, on-chain privacy has exploded into one of the polarizing issues in the Web3 industry. However, as is the nature of polarizing extremes, neither absolute transparency nor absolute privacy will serve users' real-world needs.</p><p>In fact, the privacy vs. compliance issue has existed and has already largely been solved for, across states and time. Existing systems based in the physical domain tend to operate on the principle of default privacy. As such, state-approved mechanisms are implemented to mitigate against fraud and other dishonest practices. These introduce and enforce transparency, such as mandatory financial reporting and audit requirements. Furthermore, additional privacy protections are extended to individuals and private enterprises such that their financial reporting isn’t exposed.</p><p>In contrast, those blockchain-based, public-ledger systems that underpin DeFi operate on default transparency. This means public ledgers require additional mechanisms that preserve privacy. Then, as per their physical domain equivalents, discoverability features must be implemented to prevent money laundering, tax evasion, and other forms of malicious activity from eluding the state.</p><p>The issue, therefore, is really about Web3 accepting that while DeFi does “solve money”, it must also solve for a balance between privacy and compliance, because money will always be in the domain of the state’s law enforcement (even when the state no longer prints it).</p> Going beyond early teething pains <p>Most Web3 advocates believe that blockchain ecosystems have the potential to provide the best conditions to operate an integrated global economy that is prosperous, liquid, resilient, and fair. However, institutions are never going to agree to operate in a fully transparent environment. Compliant on-chain privacy is the catalyst required to push decentralized financial players to penetrate the mass market.</p><p>To achieve this, the Web3 community must shake off the tendency to polarize DeFi privacy projects as teetering between terrorist financier and a tyrannical surveillance facilitator. While the nascent public ledger privacy sector has been met with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-strong-defense-trial?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">litigation</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/monero-drops-multi-month-lows-binance-delisting?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">critical delistings</a> — it becomes clear that now is the time for a mature solution set that respects the financial privacy rights of institutions and individual users, while providing the compliance features of its physical-domain cousins.</p><p>Now is the time to get serious about adoption. And, to achieve widespread adoption, Web3 needs to engage in a more nuanced conversation about the integral roles privacy and transparency play in facilitating the fundamental process of exchange, maintaining fair and free markets, and enabling institutions to conduct daily operations. In short, these issues are a matter of existential importance to the future of decentralized systems.</p> On-chain privacy, a problem solved <p>Panther Protocol has developed the mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>With Panther, institutional players have access to a suite of DeFi tools to manage dedicated trading spaces, called Zones, to trade digital assets in Shielded Pools — revolutionizing private trades with public, on-chain settlement.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Zones</a> are highly customizable, as are their disclosure mechanisms. The Panther suite empowers institutions to leverage privacy-protocol trades with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the operational efficiencies of institutions in mind, Panther simplifies portfolio and asset management with a suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol recognizes that the path to adoption isn’t about the mechanics of privacy, transparency, or discoverability, per se; it’s about providing meaningful abstraction to the end user. Panther’s Privacy Protocol is doing for the on-chain domain what the Microsoft Office suite did for the personal computer — delivering abstractions that make it usable. However, unlike Microsoft, Panther presents a Web3-native protocol based on chain-agnostic, decentralized principles.</p><p>Here at Panther, we believe that those who understand institutional operations and pain points intimately and who apply the technical know-how to develop versatile on-chain systems with refined privacy functions will be the major winners in Web3’s next major wave: the institutional onboarding process. We intend to spearhead that revolution.</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone? Reach out to us at contact@pantherprotocol.io.</p>

<p>PIVX is thrilled to announce the launch of update v5.6.1, a crucial upgrade required for all users, including exchanges and service providers. It’s imperative that everyone updates their software prior to the implementation of the new Exchange Addresses to ensure seamless operations. With the upcoming activation height set at 4281680, the network will begin to isolate older versions to facilitate a smooth transition.</p><p>For most users, the update does not introduce any significant changes, except for the inability to send Shield Transactions to Exchange Addresses. Updating is straightforward: simply replace your existing pivxd or pivx-qt application with the latest version, or install the update via our provided installer packages.</p><p>For exchanges and service providers, the update introduces a novel feature — the “Exchange Address.” This innovation aims to simplify regulatory compliance and minimize accounting challenges associated with shielded transactions sent to exchanges. By utilizing the new RPC command getnewexchangeaddress, exchanges can generate these specialized addresses, which are identifiable by the “EXM” prefix, standing for Exchange Mainnet. This command also allows for labeling the new address, functioning similarly to existing commands like getnewaddress or getnewstakingaddress.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/releases/tag/v5.6.1">https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/releases/tag/v5.6.1</a></p><p>Additionally, the v5.6.1 update enhances the overall user experience with various quality-of-life improvements to the PIVX Core. These enhancements include upgraded GUI features, the ability to generate proposal addresses directly when creating proposals, CoinControl for selecting inputs for master nodes, the option to lock shield notes, and more. For a comprehensive overview of all the new features and improvements, we encourage you to read the release&nbsp;notes.</p><p>Please note that by block 4281680, the new Exchange Addresses will activate on chain, which should be around Feb 29th at 12:00 PM UTC. We will be sending our upgrade spork around ~48 hours before that, so please be sure to update before that to avoid any potential forking. All MNs will need to be “restarted” (the controller wallet will need to issue a new start message) during this&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>This update is a testament to our commitment to continually enhancing the PIVX platform for all users, exchanges, and service providers</p><p>.<br>Many thanks to Liquid369, PIVX Core Dev for writing this announcement.</p><p>PIVXDevsRock! <br>PIVX&nbsp;Core</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-is-thrilled-to-announce-the-launch-of-pivxs-core-wallet-v5-6-1-894e66a92bf3">PIVX is thrilled to announce the launch of PIVX’s Core Wallet v5.6.1!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

</h3>

  Today we're announcing the highly requested and long-awaited rollout of self-custody BAT payouts for Brave Rewards.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today we’re announcing the highly requested and long-awaited rollout of self-custody BAT payouts for Brave Rewards. An initial group of invitees—and soon Brave users around the world—will be able to receive BAT earned from Brave Rewards to a self-custody wallet address on the Solana blockchain.</p>

 Invite only to start 
<p>Rewards on Solana is launching as an invite-only feature, starting with a limited group of early participants. Brave will send out invitations via a notification in the Brave Rewards panel. This invitation will unlock the ability for users to connect a self-custody Solana address and start receiving BAT on-chain. To find out if you’re eligible, keep an eye on Brave Rewards in your Brave browser.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Invitees will receive a notification in the Rewards panel and new tab page</p>
<p>To connect a Solana address to Brave Rewards, you’ll use a Solana wallet to verify that you own the address. You can do this with Brave’s very own integrated wallet, <a>Brave Wallet</a>, or with a third-party browser extension like Phantom.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Solana address connected to Brave Rewards</p>
<p>Once connected, monthly BAT rewards will be deposited directly on-chain to your Solana address in Wormhole-bridged <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">SPL-BAT</a>. That means you’ll be able to receive earned BAT without a custodial account (though the option to receive BAT rewards via a custodian will remain available).</p>

 Only possible on Solana 
<p>We chose Solana as the ideal network for the launch of on-chain Brave Rewards given its high transaction speed and low fees, which help reduce the costs associated with distributing BAT earnings to hundreds of thousands of users. For example, a single transaction on Solana costs on average $0.002 USD, while a single transaction on Ethereum, or on its most popular layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum, costs on average <a href="https://l2fees.info/">$1.00 and $0.10 respectively</a>.</p>
<p>This new way of distributing BAT removes many of the barriers everyday people face when onboarding to Web3. There are no withdrawal fees or limits, since the Solana wallet is entirely owned and managed by the user. Users can earn and receive BAT directly on-chain, and use it on-chain however they like. For example, here are some great ways BAT can be used on Solana:</p>
 
 Contribute directly to your favorite <a>Brave creators with on-chain contributions</a> (details below) 
 Exchange between hundreds of tokens through the swap feature in <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/13397025065357-What-are-Brave-Swaps-">Brave Wallet</a> 
 Buy a .SOL domain from <a href="https://www.bonfida.org/">Bonfida</a> 
 Earn trading fees by depositing SPL-BAT to <a href="https://www.orca.so/">Orca</a> liquidity pools 
 Mint and buy <a>NFTs</a> with SPL-BAT 
 

 Support your favorite creators on-chain 
<p>We also <a>recently announced a new on-chain contributions feature</a> as a more Web3-native way for users to support their favorite creators, including with the SPL-BAT they earn. Supporting self custody for users and creators is an important step toward a more decentralized Brave Rewards and Brave Creators experience. Together, they further our mission of providing users with greater control over how they browse, search, and transact on the Web.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on our blog, social accounts, and <a href="https://community.brave.com/">Brave Community</a> forums for the latest news from Brave, and announcements about new rounds of Solana on-chain invites.</p>

<p>Last September, we <a>released a roadmap</a> of innovations for <a>Leo</a>, Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce we’ve completed another piece of the roadmap: Leo can now interact with PDFs and Google Drive files. By seamlessly integrating with these popular productivity apps and document types, Leo enables users to save time and accomplish more at school and work, while preserving user privacy.</p>

 How we built document support 
<p>Brave’s built-in AI assistant Leo has recently gained new capabilities for understanding how to help users while using web-based tools and workflows. Specifically:</p>
 
 
<p>By using the accessibility tree in a PDF’s metadata, Leo can understand the underlying semantic structure of PDF documents.</p>
 
 
<p>By leveraging a technique called Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on canvas-rendered apps, Leo can use an image of a page to extract text in Google Docs and Google Sheets.</p>
 
 
<p>In both cases, Leo can offer insights and suggestions for users working with many different productivity applications, whether at school or at work.</p>

 Use cases for Leo’s document integrations 
<p>With this novel use of the accessibility tree, OCR, and other techniques, Leo can help with several important use cases. These include:</p>
 
 
<p>PDFs: Leo can extract topics and data deep within PDF documents. This can help with understanding research papers, preparing analysis from reports, finding details in a technical specification document, and more.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Docs: When you’re editing a Google Doc, Leo can propose relevant terms or writing styles, or even review the document as a whole.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Sheets: Leo can analyze tables and data in a Google Sheet, and even suggest formulas.</p>
 
 
<p>Slack workspaces: Leo can highlight key discussion points from a thread in a Slack workspace, extracting the thread’s essential points while saving you the time of reading the entire thread history.</p>
 
 
<p>YouTube: Leo can produce video transcripts from classes, industry events, and influencer videos. These transcripts can then be summarized for useful details mentioned in the video, and allow the user to ask Leo follow-up questions about the video or the transcript.</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo—and its document integrations—is no different. This is particularly relevant as work and school documents may contain sensitive information:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Just as Leo utilizes these techniques to preserve your privacy as you chat, it offers the same protections when Leo is helping you analyze documents and other files.&nbsp;</p>

 How to use Leo for PDFs and Google Drive files 
<p>Leo’s support for PDFs, Google Docs, and Google Sheets is available now for all Brave desktop users on version 1.63 or higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To try it out, simply open a PDF, Google Doc, or Google Sheet in a tab in the Brave browser. Then click the  in the sidebar, and start asking Leo questions about the file.</p>
<p>Don’t have Leo in the sidebar yet? Just click Settings, then click Leo, and toggle on the Show Leo icon in the sidebar option.</p>

 What’s next for Leo and document / file support? 
<p>Leo will soon support other documents and file types. For example, Leo will integrate with GitHub, allowing code reviewers to summarize the purpose and impact of pull requests by analyzing code changes without line-by-line inspection. Keep an eye out for announcements about GitHub support, and for even more document and file integrations.</p>
<p>From the beginning, we saw Leo as far more than an AI chatbot (though it can handle real-time, contextual chats with ease). Rather, we saw Leo as a true smart assistant that could help you engage with the applications you use every day, to help you learn, work, and plan more efficiently. By surfacing insights from within PDFs, suggesting text for Google Docs, writing formulas for Google Sheets, summarizing YouTube videos, analyzing code in GitHub (and more), Leo saves you time and makes you more efficient and productive.</p>

							<p>On January 3, 2024, Trail of Bits reached out to us to raise <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/02/20/breaking-the-shared-key-in-threshold-signature-schemes/">a denial-of-service vulnerability</a> that affects different implementations of distributed key generation (DKG) protocols. Our FROST implementation was among those impacted.</p><p>This denial-of-service vulnerability introduced the possibility of an attack being carried out as follows:&nbsp;During the DKG run, a malicious participant can generate a random polynomial with a larger number of coefficients than required. In practice, this makes the key shares generated by the protocol have a threshold that is higher than intended. For example, when generating key shares with a threshold of 2, an attacker could silently increase that value to e.g. 3. Thus, two participants would never be able to successfully generate signatures since three or more would be required. Additionally, if the attacker increases the threshold to a number higher than the number of shares, then it would be totally impossible to generate valid signatures. In the Zcash context, this could mean that deposits made into a freshly-generated FROST wallet could become unspendable, leading to loss of funds.</p><p>We do agree that this is a confirmed and important vulnerability, which has been successfully remediated by adding <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/commit/e1fb9bc953a5ea5c22304c0018f56f407163f101">a simple check</a> to make sure the polynomials generated have the correct number of coefficients. This fix is included in the recently published 1.0.0 stable release of our FROST implementation. We are not aware of any production-ready FROST Zcash deployments using our software, so no user funds should be at risk.</p><p>We thank Trail of Bits for identifying the issue, providing a test case showing our crate was vulnerable and coordinating its disclosure.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is excited to announce the first stable release of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-core">frost-core</a>, a reference implementation of Two-Round Threshold Schnorr Signatures with FROST, written in Rust. This implementation has been <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2023/10/23/public-report-zcash-frost-security-assessment/">fully audited</a> and conforms to the latest and final version of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">IRTF draft specification</a>, which we are confident will soon make it as a final Informational RFC.&nbsp;</p>



 



 What FROST does and why it matters 



<p>FROST is a threshold multi-party signature scheme. It allows a key to be split into multiple shares (or even to be created in a distributed fashion without having to create an original unsplit key), and then enables creating a signature by aggregating multiple signature shares created by participants who hold key shares. The threshold means that a minimum number of participants are required to be able to create a signature.</p>



<p>In the context of Zcash, this means that FROST allows creating wallets where transactions have to be authorized by multiple participants. This has multiple benefits: it’s more robust, since if a participant loses a share, it is still possible for the other participants to sign transactions (and they can help to reissue the lost share); and in the same vein, if a participant gets hacked, the attacker won’t be able to solely sign transactions.</p>



<p>With the <a href="http://www.github.com/zcashfoundation/frost">frost</a> Rust library, the Zcash Foundation provides a reference implementation for the informational “Two-Round Schnorr Threshold Signatures with FROST” CFRG (Crypto Forum Research Group) Internet Draft. The CFRG is a general forum for discussing and reviewing uses of cryptographic mechanisms and is part of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), which in turn promotes research of importance to the evolution of the Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology.</p>



<p>This release includes the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/tree/main/frost-rerandomized">frost-rerandomized</a> variant, an adaptation to the FROST threshold signature scheme to make it unlinkable, which is a requirement for its use in the Zcash protocol. The adapted scheme generates signatures that are compatible with spend authorization signatures in the Zcash protocol, for the Sapling and Orchard network upgrades. This makes it possible for Zcash transactions to be authorized by more than one party, while preserving the privacy of individual signers.</p>



 



 Privacy-preserving threshold multi-party signatures for Zcash 



<p>Now that the frost reference implementation is production-ready we look forward to the acceptance of <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/662">ZIP-312: “Shielded Multisignatures using FROST”</a> and its implementation in the Zcash ecosystem. We will continue to work on a set of demos to show how some of the challenges for integration into wallets may be solved, as well as to provide a reference for implementers.</p>



<p>We would like to thank the following current and past ZF team members for their contributions to the FROST reference implementation; without their work and support, we would not have reached this milestone today:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chelsea Komlo, Conrado P. L. Gouvêa,&nbsp; Natalie E., Deirdre Connolly, Pili Guerra, Alfredo Garcia, Teor, Marek Bielik, Henry de Valence, Jane Lusby, Josh Cincinnati, Antonie Hodge, Fungai Matambanadzo.</p>



<p>We would also like to thank all of the numerous external contributors to the spec and code base.</p>

<p>As the global need for environmentally conscious energy intensifies, tokenisation emerges as a groundbreaking strategy to democratise energy ownership. Amidst the growing consensus on the need for a shift to renewable resources, the challenge of accessibility and affordability persists. By leveraging blockchain technology to fractionalise ownership of renewable energy assets, tokenisation offers an inclusive pathway for individuals and communities to invest in and benefit from sustainable energy sources. This innovative approach not only aims to lower the barriers to entry in the renewable energy market but also foster a more distributed and participatory energy landscape.</p>



<p></p>



 Democratising energy: The role of tokenisation in ownership 



<p>The shift towards sustainable energy is a global priority, underscored by initiatives like the Paris Agreement, especially within Europe. This movement faces the challenge of perceived high costs and barriers to entry in the renewable energy sector. However, recent commercialisation of energy storage technologies shows significant <a href="https://www.irena.org/Energy-Transition/Technology/Energy-storage-costs">cost reductions</a> in wind, solar power, and grid stability over the past few years. This cost reduction has widened access to renewable energy, allowing a broader spectrum of individuals to benefit from these technologies.</p>



<p></p>



 How tokenisation democratises energy ownership&nbsp; 



<p>Tokenisation plays a pivotal role in further democratising energy ownership. For individuals without direct access to physical assets, such as a roof for solar panels, tokenisation offers a novel solution. Through crypto anchors and property rights encapsulated within tokens, individuals can own a share of an energy asset. This approach not only allows for the ownership of the physical asset but also enables individuals to own carbon credits, kilowatt hours, and even data rights associated with the energy asset.</p>



<p>One such initiative is <a href="https://www.sunified.com/">Sunified</a> –&nbsp; a solar technology company creating critical infrastructure to facilitate yield farming on solar infrastructure. Yield farming is the process of staking or lending cryptocurrency assets within a DeFi protocol’s liquidity pool to receive rewards, often in the form of the protocol’s governance tokens. Liquidity providers are then compensated with an annual percentage yield (APY) in real-time for their contributions as a result. The purpose behind yield farming is to promote the platform’s utilisation and compensate the community for adding liquidity, crucial for the ecosystem’s vitality and growth. Sunified’s initiative also includes storage infrastructure integration into electric vehicles (EVs) and other parts of the energy ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As energy grids undergo a gradual transformation over the next decade, tokenisation offers immense opportunities to introduce new business and ownership models through blockchain and sound crypto infrastructure architectures. This transition presents a unique chance to reconstruct the energy ecosystem, making sustainable energy ownership more accessible and flexible for a wider audience.</p>



<p></p>



 Fractional ownership of solar power&nbsp; 



<p>Fractional ownership in the context of solar power introduces an innovative approach to investing in renewable energy. This concept allows individuals to collectively invest in solar projects, such as solar parks or community solar gardens, through a blend of equity and debt financing. The essence of fractional ownership lies in the tokenisation of solar infrastructure, breaking down the investment into manageable units—whether in the form of €100 blocks or based on the capacity, such as 100 Watt blocks of a solar panel.</p>



<p>A group of experts would initially determine how to capitalise on a solar project, deciding on the mix of equity and debt to make the project investment-ready. This capital structure can then be tokenised, offering participation rights to investors. Tokenisation carves up the asset into fractional pieces, making it possible for a wider audience to invest in solar energy projects.</p>



<p>It is crucial to differentiate between owning a part of the solar park itself and having rights to the energy produced by it. While you might not fractionalise the energy output directly, fractionalising the means of production — i.e., the solar panels and infrastructure — offers a tangible way to invest in solar energy. Fractional ownership and tokenisation democratises access to renewable energy investments, enabling more people to contribute to and benefit from sustainable energy solutions.</p>



<p></p>



 How should a real-world asset, such as energy, be put on the blockchain?&nbsp; 



<p>Placing a real-world asset like energy onto a blockchain involves a multifaceted approach that bridges the physical and digital worlds. With a particular focus on renewable energy sources like solar power, the process starts by establishing a tangible connection or “hook” between the physical asset and its digital representation on the blockchain. This involves integrating a sensor directly into the asset during the manufacturing process, such as embedding it within a solar panel at the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) factory. This sensor plays a crucial role in anchoring the asset across three realms: the physical world, the digital world, and the crypto realm.</p>



<p>The sensor enables tracking of the solar panel’s lifecycle from its inception, including its initial performance and the carbon footprint incurred throughout its supply chain journey. By activating the panel in the field, it is possible to account for its entire lifecycle, including production, deployment, and operational carbon emissions. This comprehensive approach ensures that the asset is not only represented accurately on the blockchain but also that its environmental impact is meticulously accounted for.</p>



<p>This method transcends traditional reliance on third-party verification or trust anchors, reducing the need for intermediaries. Instead, it offers a direct and trustworthy linkage between the real-world asset and its blockchain counterpart. This direct connection is essential for leveraging blockchain’s capabilities to support decentralised and distributed energy systems, which are increasingly becoming bidirectional.&nbsp; Unlike the traditional centralised energy distribution model, where power flows from a central hub to consumers, modern energy grids are evolving to support energy flow in both directions. This shift necessitates new measurement infrastructure to accommodate and accurately represent these changes on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Navigating challenges in energy tokenisation 



<p>The journey of tokenising energy assets is fraught with multifaceted challenges, significantly influenced by regulatory uncertainties, security concerns, data privacy issues, market volatility, and a general lack of understanding and readiness within the industry. A pivotal aspect of navigating these waters involves identifying the nature of energy tokens for regulators—be it as utility, payment, or governance tokens—or even advocating for a multi-use token that transcends traditional categorisations.</p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Hurdles 



<p>Discourse within the digital asset community highlights a need for regulatory frameworks around energy tokens that must be clearly defined. This confusion necessitates a rigorous educational effort towards regulators, to clarify the distinctions and functionalities of various token types, including utility, energy, asset, and governance tokens. Without clear regulatory guidance, projects are compelled to seek jurisdictions with more favourable legal frameworks. The UK is a regulatory example of a more defined ecosystem for property rights, energy governance, and tokenisation of real-world assets. The only other option would be to work within regulatory sandboxes and project-specific frameworks to advance tokenisation initiatives without overstepping uncertain legal boundaries.</p>



<p>Moreover, the push towards standardising practices across different regulatory environments presents another layer of complexity. The UK has made significant strides in establishing clear guidelines through bodies like The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Other jurisdictions are still in the budding stages of adapting their regulations to accommodate the novel demands of tokenised energy systems. In addition to regulatory hurdles, the practicalities of offering energy tokens without categorising them as equity to facilitate easier trading, and the fundraising challenges for scaling projects across multiple locations, are critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Communication 



<p>The ability to articulate the concept and clear implications of tokenising energy resources, such as solar panels, is crucial for market acceptance and regulatory compliance. This task extends beyond mere product explanation; it encompasses clear dialogue with lawmakers, consumer protection bodies, and entities concerned with data privacy. Simplifying complex technological underpinnings for a diverse audience, from regulators to the layperson at the bus stop, is essential. Failure to do so risks future operational nightmares, underscoring the importance of both education and transparency in the tokenisation ecosystem. Simplification without sacrificing essential information ensures that investors, users, and stakeholders, who will journey with the initiative for years to come, fully comprehend its value and operation, making the technology’s intricate background less daunting and more accessible.</p>



<p></p>



 Where to begin: energy tokenisation 



<p>Embarking on the journey of energy tokenisation requires a foundational understanding of the token’s purpose, its intended holders, and the value it offers. Before diving into the legal and technical specifics of token types, it is essential to address these fundamental questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach does not necessitate a one-size-fits-all solution. For instance, investors interested in direct engagement with energy projects can opt for utility tokens, whereas those looking for a more traditional investment route might consider security tokens tied to assets like solar parks. This flexibility allows projects to cater to diverse investor preferences, enhancing accessibility and interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlighting the significance of inclusivity and accountability in energy trading, an initiative such as the <a href="https://www.amelandenergie.nl/">Amelander Energy Cooperative</a> demonstrates the potential for democratising energy markets. Such a project demonstrates the possibility for transparent, traceable systems that ensure accountability across all levels of interaction—from investors to consumers, and from producers to the overarching financial ecosystem. Achieving this level of integration and transparency is a meticulous process to harmonise understanding and communication across various stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Tokenisation within the energy sector signifies a significant stride toward democratising access to renewable resources and fostering sustainable practices. By bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms, tokenisation introduces a new paradigm where renewable energy assets, like solar power, become attainable and manageable for a wider audience. This process not only democratises access to sustainable energy solutions but also addresses the pressing need for energy independence, resilience, and environmental preservation. As we navigate the complexities of regulatory landscapes and technological challenges, the ultimate goal remains clear: to create an energy ecosystem that is inclusive, transparent, and aligned with the principles of environmental sustainability. Through collaborative efforts, innovative approaches, and community engagement, tokenisation has the potential to reshape our energy future, making sustainable living a reality for all.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>Another week has flown by in the dynamic world of Panther – now it’s time to share our latest updates and progress with the Panther community! This week’s rundown highlights a series of key developments and testing from the past week.</p> Ecosystem updates  AMA with Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar <p>On February 8, we hosted an AMA session featuring Panther Protocol’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar, and Head of Community, Joris Koopman.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ-NfX_4ldY&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Watch the recording</a> for full insights into our latest testnet updates, testing processes, reward systems, and upcoming testnet releases.</p> Panther testnet video guide for account creation <p>You asked – we delivered! Panther has received numerous requests to provide support materials dedicated to the account creation process. For a step-by-step video guide detailing how to make your very own testnet Panther account, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw3LhZKvM_U&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">check out our tutorial video</a>. Once you have your account set up, the video will also show you how to get started earning $ZKP rewards. All you need is a MetaMask wallet and 10 minutes!&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Current testnet users: 800+  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 1.5M $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a 3rd party Bundler service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.</p><p>Users will be able to submit transactions via Bundlers and pay gas fees in $ZKP instead of $Matic (on Mumbai testnet but similarly on Polygon) from the Panther Gas account that holds $zZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>Integration testing is underway, with two end-to-end Bundler providers operating successfully. Changes on the dApp side are expected to reach completion as we utilize resources from other stages of development taking place in parallel.</p> Enhancement Stage - 1 developments <p>As we continue to strive for parallel development efforts, a 2-week technical enhancement stage was slated to implement various fixes from previous stages along with a feature for Gas Management. This key feature allows users to move their $zZKP inside MASP from the regular balance to the Panther Account Gas balance and vice versa. Gas Management plays a significant role enabling users to top up their Gas balance and make sure they have sufficient $zZKP to pay for various transaction costs.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of testnet is a complex stage and includes overall fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. Stage 6 allows users to test:</p>  Fee deductions from the Panther Gas account and payment to 3rd parties such as Compliance providers and Bundler service providers.  Protocol fee deductions in a transacted token currently set to be charged on Withdraw.  Basic disclosures that allow Panther users to provide adequate transaction reporting to outside parties issuing requests that can be satisfied by independent on-chain verification.  &nbsp;A zAccount renewal function (after the expiry date). This feature functions in a similar manner to KYC renewals.  <p>Additional smart contract and testing changes are in progress, and will require one more week to complete. Following the completion of these changes, development on the dApp will begin.&nbsp;</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>We are at the dawn of a new age of applications, with large language models (LLMs) as the enabling technology. But programming an LLM remains more art than science. The instructions that generate robust, reliable performance out of these non-deterministic models remain poorly understood. We are still in a wild west of prompt hacking, eyeballing outputs and a lot of duct tape when it comes to Generative AI.</p>



<p>We have seen this movie play out before. In Software 1.0, frameworks such as React and Next have abstracted, modularized and organized the most common building blocks of software engineering, making it fast and reliable to build and test your next mobile app or website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generative AI, too, deserves a proper programming framework. Developers are craving a common set of best practices and composable building blocks for their LLM applications, to simplify the complex and to avoid reinventing the wheel. <a href="https://langchain.com/">LangChain</a> founders Harrison Chase and Ankush Gola have designed just that: an open-source toolkit for building sophisticated, data-aware applications on top of LLMs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engineering teams use LangChain to accomplish a myriad of tasks: accessing datasets to power retrieval-augmented generation (LangChain boasts over 600 integrations); running “chains,” or collections of calls, to enable more complex applications (some companies run chains with thousands of links or more); giving LLMs access to external tools; and using LLMs as full-fledged “agents” capable of planning and reasoning to accomplish goals.</p>



<p>Zooming out, LangChain is a platform that allows companies to build the scaffolding of their applications’ cognitive architectures. It is paving the way for developers to build much more powerful LLM applications, going beyond simple one-shot queries to the intelligent, interconnected systems in which these reasoning engines truly shine. The more complex LLM operations are what allow for jaw-dropping results, and we at Sequoia believe that LangChain can be a force multiplier on the pace and quality of AI application and agent development.</p>



<p>Harrison was a standout machine learning engineer at our portfolio company Robust Intelligence when he started LangChain as a nights-and-weekends side project, with no plans to build a company. But after he released the first version, it quickly took off. He quickly started working with Ankush, a star colleague from Robust. From the start, they have been humble, responsive, and fast—all key ingredients for keeping up in the quickly evolving world of generative AI. And above all, they are community-first, spearheading a community of more than 2,000 open-source contributors.</p>



<p>Today, more than 50,000 LLM applications have been built using LangChain, with use cases ranging from internal apps to autonomous agents to games to chat automation to security scanners and more. And while the platform is already a mainstay at weekend hackathons, we have also been excited to see many of our portfolio companies moving their LangChain use cases into production. Soon, your delivery order or customer support or gaming experience may be powered by LangChain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there is more to come. To continue the Software 1.0 analogy, developers benefit not just from open-source frameworks like React and Next, but also services such as GitHub, Datadog, Vercel and Heroku to deploy and monitor their applications into production. LangChain’s ambitions are similarly expansive.</p>



<p>The company’s latest “big bet” is <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">LangSmith</a>, a product that helps developers debug, test and monitor their LLM applications. As customers move from prototyping into production, LangSmith is providing the visibility and tooling they need to make their generative AI applications more performant and reliable. Elastic powers their Elastic AI Assistant for security in LangChain and leverages LangSmith for visibility helping them get to production fast. Rakuten relies on LangSmith for rigorous testing and benchmarking so they can make tradeoff decisions about their copilot Rakuten AI for Business, built in LangChain, in a systematic way. And Moody’s relies on LangSmith for automated eval, easy debugging and experimentation so they can quickly iterate and innovate.</p>



<p>Since the announcement of LangSmith’s closed beta in July, 70,000 users have signed up and more than 5,000 companies now use LangSmith every month. We look forward to seeing that list grow with the product now in GA. More recent product launches include LangServe, an easy way to deploy LangChain into production, and LangGraph, a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.</p>



<p>Even all of this is still just a taste of what LangChain has in the pipeline. The team is building in a rich problem space with plenty to explore, and they are guided by a passionate user community with no shortage of important problems for them to solve.</p>



<p>We are thrilled to partner with LangChain and lead their Series A.</p>

  Sequoia Open Source Fellowship: Applications Now Open  <p>Calling all open source developers to pursue your projects with no strings attached.
</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a>	 



Published February 15, 2024
  



 
<p>Last year we introduced the Sequoia Open Source Fellowship with the goal of encouraging the development of open source software and supporting the community of open source developers. More than ever, open source serves as the bedrock and lifeblood of the world’s software, with companies of all sizes utilizing OSS. The entire ecosystem relies on libraries and software packages—often solely maintained by open source developers. While Sequoia has partnered with many companies that found success commercializing OSS, the non-commercial spirit of open source collaboration underpins almost every aspect of modern technology. The fellowship was designed to support this work without any expectation of an equity stake in a commercial project or company.</p>



<p>We started the fellowship as an invite-only program. This year, we are excited to announce that we are opening applications to the public. Starting today, any developer working on an open source project may apply for a fellowship stipend. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open source software is critically important for ensuring that progress continues to come from every corner of the globe and not just from a few companies in Silicon Valley. We see a pressing need for collaboration, for developers to collectively push forward what new technologies are capable of in ways that serve the entire ecosystem and the public good.</p>



<p>To apply, simply complete our brief questionnaire and we’ll be in touch if your project is a good fit. We will primarily be focused on existing open source projects. Fellows will receive a stipend to cover reasonable living expenses for 6 to 12 months. They will continue to own the fruits of their labor—any code written before, during and after the program will remain entirely the fellow’s. Sequoia will not take equity or expect anything in exchange for the sponsorship. We plan to accept 2 to 3 fellows per year.</p>



<p>If you’re building something exciting in open source, we want to hear from you. Applications are now open—see <a href="https://sequoiacap.com/oss">here</a> to apply.</p>

 This integration work will bring network-layer privacy protections to&nbsp;Zcash. <p>We at Nym Technologies are proud to announce we have received a grant from <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>, bringing the metadata privacy protections of the Nym mixnet to the Zcash ecosystem.

Metadata leaks with every single online interaction.</p><p>The mixnet achieves this by splitting data into identically sized encrypted Sphinx packets and dispersing these in three hops to ‘mix nodes’ worldwide at randomized intervals. Next, the mixnet shuffles in dummy ‘cover’ traffic, further complicating tracing. Together these features make tracking metadata patterns impossible even for powerful adversaries with a global view of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Nym and Zcash share the same vision of privacy for everyone. The invention of Zcash by the Electric Coin Company has already made great strides to defend user privacy by bringing zero-knowledge proofs to market, an innovation that many other projects are now building upon. However, like every technology, zero-knowledge proofs remain vulnerable at the transport layer of the internet — a problem acknowledged <a href="http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-extended-20140518.pdf">in the original Zerocash whitepaper</a>.</p><p>Powerful adversaries can analyze traffic patterns such as the stream of TCP/IP packets used to submit transactions, which can then be used to de-anonymize users. ISPs can snoop on traffic patterns to passively record Zcash activity. And the growing crypto surveillance industry can passively spy on peer-to-peer traffic, as well as conduct active&nbsp;attacks.</p><p>Even advanced privacy protections like Zcash’s auto-shielding feature are vulnerable at the network layer. For example: if an adversary obtained a Zcash user’s transaction address, or extracted it from a unified address, they could then send a transaction to the address. Then, they could observe the user’s wallet as it broadcasts the t2z auto-shielding transaction. By repeating this process, the attacker could obtain more granular details such as IP measurements, and track these over&nbsp;time.</p><p>“We at Nym believe people deserve privacy — it is an alienable right to a dignified life free from gross intrusion and interference,” said Harry Halpin, cofounder and CEO at Nym Technologies. “But in the digital realm, intrusion and interference are simply the normal state of affairs. This is unsustainable and needs to change. With this groundbreaking integration, Nym and Zcash are working together to make real privacy online a reality.”</p><p>Josh Swihart, CEO of ECC (Electric Coin Company), said: “I’m extremely pleased to see Nym come to life on the Zcash network. Network-level privacy has been a missing piece since Zcash’s inception. This partnership between these two projects will significantly deepen protections from everyday users wishing to protect their financial privacy. It’s fantastic to see the privacy ecosystem come together.”</p><p>Jason McGee of Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) said: “ZCG is excited to support Nym’s proposal to enhance network-level privacy protections for Zcash. This effort aligns with our core mission to advance the Zcash network, and underscores ZCG’s commitment to addressing challenging issues related to privacy and security. By integrating Nym’s mixnet technology into Zcash’s lightwalletd infrastructure, Nym is laying the foundation for future integrations with Zcash nodes and wallets. Our hope is that this collaboration marks the beginning of a long-term partnership that results in significant improvements in privacy protections for Zcash&nbsp;users.”</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-begins-integration-for-complete-privacy-protection-on-zcash-ecosystem-7452d1ea7141">Nym Begins Integration For Complete Privacy Protection On Zcash Ecosystem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Brave now offers a fully native version for ARM64 Windows. When you newly install Brave on your ARM64 device, then you get an even faster browser. Read on to learn more, or skip to the end to find out how to get the new version.</p>

 What is ARM64, and why is it important? 
<p>ARM64 is a newer type of CPU, developed for speed and efficiency. Every computer has a processor (or “CPU”) that acts a little like a brain. Processors can be made in different architectures that essentially govern at a low level how the CPU works. Typical architectures are the 32-bit x86 architecture and the more recent 64-bit x64 architecture.</p>
<p>You can only run programs on your computer that are compatible with your CPU architecture. For example, you cannot run a program made for x64 on an x86 processor.</p>
<p>Software companies get around this by offering multiple versions of their programs. So you can, for example, download an x86 version of Brave if you are on an x86 CPU, and an x64 version if your computer’s processor has the x64 architecture.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most Windows computers have an x64 CPU. But recently, another architecture has entered the mainstream through products such as Microsoft’s Surface laptops. This architecture is called ARM64 and it offers better power efficiency and performance.</p>

 ARM64 and Brave 
<p>Newer CPU architectures are usually able to run programs with an older architecture. For example, an x64 CPU can run an x86 program. Likewise, ARM64 CPUs can run x64 and x86 programs. But there is a significant performance overhead. In the example of Brave, you could run x64 Brave on an ARM64 computer. But it would be slower than it should be. We therefore spent considerable effort last year to offer an ARM64 version of Brave for Windows.</p>
<p>So what’s necessary to get an ARM64 version of Brave? To create Brave, we write code in programming languages such as C++. The programming language is readable as text by us humans. But CPUs operate in their own machine language. In order for the CPU to be able to run our code, it needs to be translated to machine code with a program called a compiler. We can tell the compiler the architecture of the CPU we want to target. So, mostly, we could take our existing C++ code and tell the compiler to produce machine code for the ARM64 architecture.</p>

 On-demand updates and universal installers 
<p>Given how complex Brave is, there were of course also parts where this process didn’t work quite so seamlessly. The first problem we encountered was the following: When you type <code>brave://settings/help</code> into Brave’s address bar, you get a page that shows Brave’s version. Crucially, this page also checks for a new version of Brave with a little spinning animation. This feature showed an error in x64 Brave on ARM64 Windows. After extensive research, we realized that this is caused by a fundamental limitation in the Windows operating system itself.</p>
<p>To work around the problem, we introduced a universal installer which ensures that our users do not accidentally install x64 Brave on ARM64 Windows. Instead, they always receive a copy of Brave with the correct architecture for their system. What does this look like? When you go to brave.com and download its installer, then you get a 1 MB .exe file. When you run it, it downloads the latest version of Brave for your CPU architecture from our servers. This ensures that you don’t get the error described above.</p>

 DRM protected content and Widevine 
<p>The second main technical hurdle was caused by an optional and downloadable component of the browser called Widevine. Web sites such as Netflix use this component to protect their content. If you do not have the Widevine component installed, then Netflix (and similar sites) may only serve you low-quality videos, if anything at all.</p>
<p>Widevine is proprietary technology and its licensing terms do not allow us to redistribute it. This means that we can’t just create an ARM64 version of Widevine and include it in Brave. But an ARM64 version of the component can be downloaded from public Google servers. So we do the following: The first time you visit a web site that requires Widevine, we ask you if you agree to downloading and installing the component:</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>If you agree, then Brave downloads and installs Widevine from Google’s public servers. While Brave already worked this way for other architectures, it required a lot of extra work for ARM64. If you are interested in the technical details, you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/18695">pull-request #18695</a> on the brave/brave-core repo.</p>

 This sounds great. How do I get ARM64 Brave? 
<p>You need Windows 11 and an ARM64 CPU. To check if your CPU is ARM64, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/check-if-processor-arm64-x64-64bit-windows-11/">How to check if processor is ARM64 or x64 (64-bit) on Windows 11</a> article on pureinfotech.com. If you have an ARM64 CPU, but installed Brave before December of last year, then you need to first uninstall this old copy of Brave to get the newer ARM64 build. When the uninstaller prompts you for confirmation, be sure not to select the check box that says “Also delete your browsing data?”. Once you’ve uninstalled the x64 build of Brave from your ARM64 CPU, go to brave.com, click on the Download button and follow the instructions. When you then type <code>brave://version</code> in Brave’s address bar, you should see “arm64” mentioned on the page.</p>

 Summary 
<p>More and more new Windows computers have ARM64 CPUs. In order for Brave to be as fast as possible, it needs to be optimized for this architecture. We completed this technical work last year. There were some technical challenges on the way, but we were able to overcome them. You can now install ARM64 Brave on Windows 11 by visiting <a>brave.com</a>!</p>

		<p>Horizen Labs has submitted a ZenIP Discussion topic on Discourse, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP: 42400 – Modernizing Horizen Technology via a Modular Proof Verification Layer</a>.</p>
<p>Note that ZenIP 42400 focuses on the modular proof verification layer. If this proposal passes, Horizen Labs will roll out subsequent phases to the Horizen community for discussion and debate as the “New Horizen” initiative progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenIP 42400 is focused solely on the establishment of a Modular Proof Verification Layer, i.e., a blockchain dedicated to verifying proofs with the ability to support any settlement layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we dive into what this means for the Horizen Ecosystem, let’s review a few points that have been raised by the Community regarding this proposal:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Name of the Initiative: The term “New Horizen” is currently a placeholder for the system and its individual component blockchains. The designation is being used to conceptually describe the initiative until an official name is determined. 
 EON Integration: A key aspect of the development strategy is the integration of EON into the new Proof Verification Chain. The Horizen Labs teams are actively involved in exploring viable pathways for this migration, ensuring that EON remains an integral part of the Horizen ecosystem after the implementation of the blockchains that comprise the “New Horizen” initiative. 
 $ZEN Tokenomics: Currently, there are no plans to modify $ZEN’s tokenomics, and any such change would be subject to community discussion and DAO approval.&nbsp; 
 Market and User Research: The Horizen Labs team used comprehensive market and user research, aiming to design a user-friendly system capable of widespread adoption.&nbsp; 
 
 Why should the community be excited about this “New Horizen” proposal? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative will modernize the Horizen tech stack to better align with the broader web3 industry while building on the legacy of the Horizen Mainchain and Zendoo. This will “future-proof” the Horizen network and unlock market value to the Horizen ecosystem. New Horizen is based on current web3 market needs and addresses a problem that affects most modular web3 protocols: volatile and expensive proof verification costs for L2s (ZK-Rollups in particular).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs’ proposed “Proof Verification Chain” aims to substantially reduce rising security costs for L2s.</p>
<p>A dedicated Proof Verification Chain would not only make running a ZK-Rollup more economical, but also align with the anticipated shift towards these technologies becoming the dominant scaling solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, collaboration in the Web3 space is becoming increasingly important, New Horizen aims to foster this collaboration across ecosystems and expand the reach of the Horizen ecosystem. The Horizen Labs team is working to ensure that the Proof Verification Chain described above is being designed to accommodate a variety of proof types and settlement layers. By developing a solution that is versatile enough to be compatible with multiple development frameworks, proving systems, and settlement layers, this positions Horizen as a hub of collaborative innovation. Potentially reaching new audiences beyond our current community, embracing and leading the change towards a more interconnected and cooperative blockchain environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How Will this Work? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative is set to deliver multiple components that address the market’s current and future needs across several phases. The Proof Verification Chain (Phase 1) will focus on verifying proofs originating from other blockchains, such as rollups / appchains or applications. Initially, the focus will be on ZK-SNARK proofs, in particular zk-snarks produced by ZK-Rollups, but the plan is to expand its capabilities to accommodate a wide range of proof types in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof verification layer aims to improve the existing process of proving state validity for ZK-Rollups and other proof-generating applications, offering a more efficient, scalable solution to handle these operations, which will reduce the costs of blockchain networks.</p>
<p></p>

The Horizen DAO voting is done on Horizen EON, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. At the same time that the voting began, the snapshot was taken. Users can head to Snapshot here to review the result of the vote, which passed with 99.99% of votes “for”: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0x3f846aac0e0640d4286f0cc83c26c3710146a47af2ed670e4ef962d82f0d46c0">https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0x3f846aac0e0640d4286f0cc83c26c3710146a47af2ed670e4ef962d82f0d46c0</a></p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Vote – Instructions 
 
 Go to the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen DAO Governance page</a> on the Horizen EON web app to get started. 
 Connect your web3 wallet (ex. MetaMask). <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">Please follow this guide if you need help</a>. 
 Link your Horizen mainchain $ZEN address to Horizen EON. In order to vote with your mainchain $ZEN, you need to have $ZEN on a <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere</a> mainchain address and link that address to your MetaMask Horizen EON chain address. You only need to link your <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere wallet</a> once. You can use the same wallet for future voting rounds.&nbsp;
 
 Please see <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">this guide for step-by-step instructions </a>on linking Horizen Mainchain and Horizen EON $ZEN Addresses to aggregate your voting power.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Make sure you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask address for the gas fee. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFsjT069v7E">this tutorial</a> to learn how to transfer ZEN from Horizen mainchain to your Horizen EON address on MetaMask 
 Once your mainchain ZEN address is connected to Horizen EON, and you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask for gas fee, it’s time to vote using Snapshot! 
 Join the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Horizen Foundation space</a> on Snapshot if you haven’t done so, to receive notifications about future ZenIP voting.&nbsp;

		<p><a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a> was originally designed and built by the Horizen Ecosystem team as a POC (proof-of-concept) sidechain, called Tokenchain, to test the scalability and durability of the Horizen network. TokenMint was a live proof of concept that permitted the team to build Horizen EON, and now that Horizen EON is successfully running, the time to deprecate TokenMint is now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the deprecation, all TokenMint users will need to remove their $ZEN from the sidechain before the deprecation date to avoid loss of funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
 
 Wednesday, February 21st, 2024 – TokenMint Testnet will be Deprecated 
 Wednesday, March 6th, 2024 – TokenMint Mainnet will be Deprecated 
 
<p>To move $ZEN off of TokenMint, users can simply send their ZEN from their Cobalt Wallet to a Horizen mainchain address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning: ZEN can only be sent to Horizen Mainchain Sphere addresses from Cobalt. Sending ZEN to another Horizen Mainnet address outside of Sphere could lead to a loss of funds.</p>
<p>Please open a ticket on our <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Discord server</a> with any questions or concerns during the deprecation period and please be sure to REMOVE your ZEN from TokenMint BEFORE March 6th, 2024, as the funds will be permanently lost after that date.</p>
<p>How to Send ZEN to the Horizen Mainchain from Cobalt Wallet</p>
 
 Open your Cobalt Wallet and make sure you are connected to the TokenMint chain.&nbsp; 
 In the Assets and Activity page, click the ZEN row. The page now allows you to send ZEN. It displays the current amount available. 
 Click the up arrow to send a transaction. 
 In the Send to field, enter the desired address you want to send the ZEN to. This field will display an error, if you enter an invalid address. 
 In the Amount field, enter the amount of the ZEN you want to send. 
 In the password field, enter your password to complete the transaction. 
 Click Submit. The Sent flag appears indicating that the transaction is successful. 
 Click Back to display the transaction activity. The Send page appears. If the transaction is pending, a notification will appear stating that the last pending transaction for this address has not been confirmed. Note that it can take up to 72 hours for the transaction to show on the destination wallet, even if the transaction is confirmed on the TokenMint explorer.

The <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/follow-the-packet-spoiler-you-cant-9c14380335c7">mixnet encrypts your traffic</a> in novel onion encryption, then routes it via an entry gateway, three mix nodes and an exit gateway. This makes it near impossible for anyone to link sender and receiver, ensuring advanced privacy against even government-level adversaries. It is the optimal solution for sensitive use cases like crypto transactions, messaging, and secure email, that are not timing sensitive. It protects metadata, IP addresses and patterns of communication from traffic analysis and end-to-end correlation.</p><p>Read more about the <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym&nbsp;mixnet</a>.</p>  The 2-hop Nym dVPN&nbsp;mode  <p>The 2-hop dVPN mode is optimised for speed.

Most VPNs don’t provide privacy at all. Instead they just shift who knows your IP address and has access to your habits from the server you are communicating with, to the VPN provider. In fact, many free VPNs take advantage of this fact and sell your browsing habits for profit. The Nym dVPN is decentralised so there can be no centralised logging of your online&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Read more on the difference between <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/decentralized-vpns-vs-traditional-vpns-all-the-differences">traditional and decentralised VPNs</a>.</p> NymVPN: upcoming&nbsp;features <p>Upcoming features include split tunnelling so you can preset which of your apps should run through the low latency 2-hop mode, and which require full privacy protections of the 5-hop mixnet&nbsp;mode.</p><p>There will also be a killswitch to prevent data leakage, and censorship resistance to ensure anyone can access the internet from anywhere, even in regions with strict restrictions.</p><p>Sign up to the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN waitlist</a>.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>It’s time to review what Team Panther was up to in January and our plans for February. In this month’s update, we cover ecosystem updates, team expansion, product highlights, and a glimpse of next month’s plans; here’s everything you should know:</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 3 is now live with a new design, enhanced security, and added features <p>Testnet Stage 3 was released in January, bringing a new design, enhanced security, and added features. Stage 3 enables users to use the newly allowlisted test Matic and test $ZKPs in Panther’s Shielded Pool.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-3-is-now-live-with-a-new-design-enhanced-security-and-added-features">Stage 3 of our testnet</a>.</p> LBank lists Zero-Knowledge DeFi pioneer Panther Protocol’s $ZKP&nbsp; <p>We are excited to share that Panther Protocol’s $ZKP is now listed on LBank, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. This listing follows $ZKP’s listing on BitMart in December 2023. These listings are part of our focus on cementing strategic partnerships and a strong exchange presence before Panther Protocol’s V1 launch.</p><p>More about the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lbank-to-list-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">LBank listing</a>.</p> AMA recap: Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, discusses $ZKP listing on BitMart and the future of privacy in DeFi <p>Following the recent listing of $ZKP on BitMart, Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, introduced Panther Protocol to BitMart’s community. Catch a summary of the conversation in our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ama-recap-panthers-ceo-oliver-gale-discusses-zkp-listing-on-bitmart-and-the-future-of-privacy-in-defi/">latest blog</a>.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Number of current testnet users: 634  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 1.5M $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share?<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Learn more and sign up</a> to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Panther’s Co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale on CryptoCoinShow <p>&nbsp;Our co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, was recently on the @CryptoCoinShow discussing Panther’s strategic direction and the future of privacy-preserving tech in DeFi. Watch the complete episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM65JyReAj0&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.</p> Panther hires Harrie Bickle to improve product documentation <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harriebickle/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Harrie Bickle</a> has joined the Panther team as a Senior Technical Writer. Harrie brings over a decade’s experience in Documentation and Product Marketing and has been in the blockchain space since 2018. Her range spans writing and editing articles, whitepapers, yellow papers, developer portals, and API documentation.</p><p>We are delighted to welcome Harrie and look forward to seeing our documentation reach a new level, thanks to her expertise gained while editing for Starkware in the Zero-Knowledge space and building out developer portals for Qredo’s crypto trading API and Neon EVM’s Solana settlement layer solution.</p> Product updates  Stage 4 developments <p>The dApp development for Stage 4 is complete, and we expect to launch it in the first week of Feb. Stage 4 of testnet allows users to send zAssets inside the pool from one zAccount to another. Stage 4 is a feature-filled release as it is being shipped with an interesting, related feature originally from Stage 6: Withdrawals.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the Stage 4 dApp, users can also undertake UTXO selection.&nbsp;</p> Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 development is underway in parallel, thanks to the team’s efforts over the last two months. The team is currently working on integrating bundle services into the dApp. Stage 5 includes using a third-party Bundler service and the ability to submit gasless transactions using an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.&nbsp;</p> Oshiya update <p>We’ve updated the code for our Panther miner, Oshiya. The latest version of Oshiya comes with an enhanced miner setting: FORCE_UTXO_SIMULATION. This parameter gives control over whether the miner should consistently add a simulated UTXO, regardless of the presence of any pending queues. When set to ‘false’, a simulated UTXO will only be added if a pending queue exists. We recommend running the updated version of the Oshiya code.&nbsp;</p> Plans for February&nbsp; <p>Following the launch of Stage 4, the team will concentrate on enabling the dApp to support users to select a transaction for the Bundler service and perform end-to-end testing of this feature.&nbsp;</p><p>In parallel, the core team will focus on Stage 6, with its revised scope offering a cohesive Fee and Rewards mechanism. In this stage, users will pay all the fees (mimicking a production experience) and receive ‘subsidies’ from the DAO for certain fees, such as for compliance checks, among others. These subsidies are part of the bootstrapping and will be limited to the initial period of the protocol launch. We wish to understand our users’ views on the fee structures and invite the community to engage with the DAO to discuss the subsidies that should be applied during mainnet launch.</p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation (ZF) is excited to share our vision for the next two Zcon conferences: ZconV (virtual) in May 2024 and Zcon6 (in-person) tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2025. Get ready for impactful presentations and outcomes at ZconV, under the inspiring theme “Zcash Unified!”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 ZconV 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>ZconV will be a virtual conference, happening online in early May 2024. It will be a celebration showcasing how the diversity of&nbsp; individuals, organizations, and projects within the Zcash ecosystem contributes to its success and innovative spirit. Our goal is to open doors for inclusive and widespread participation from our global community, while maintaining our commitment to fiscal responsibility amidst the uncertainties surrounding the Dev Fund and market conditions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Using the popular Whova web and mobile app, which received rave reviews during our last conference, ZconV will offer an interactive and dynamic platform for real-time Q&amp;A, discussion boards, polls, chat, and video conferencing. Keep an eye on the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/zconv/">ZconV webpage</a>&nbsp;for continuous updates and ways to engage in these enriching discussions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Zcon6 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As for Zcon6 we plan to bring the Zcash Community together for an in-person event in Mexico City in early 2025. This gathering will focus on strategic planning and commitment to long-term projects, empowered by a clear understanding of available resources. The timing in Q1 2025 not only offers cost-effectiveness but also a warm and inviting atmosphere during the colder months in many parts of the world, adding an extra layer of appeal for attendees. Stay tuned for more details on Zcon6, including the exciting reasons behind choosing Mexico City, coming your way by the end of Q3 2024.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Join us for these two landmark events as we continue to propel Zcash into a bright and unified future!</p>

          About Panther Protocol <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

		<p>On February 7th, 2024, at approximately 12:00pm UTC, ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via hard fork at block #1502800. As previous communications have stated, after this hard fork it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then.&nbsp;</p><p>Failure to remove shielded ZEN from shielded addresses prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your shielded ZEN. It’s important to note that transparent ZEN is not affected by the hard fork, just shielded ZEN.&nbsp;</p><p>This move came with the successfully passed <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">ZenIP 42207</a> earlier this year, which enabled the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain. This change built upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">ZenIP 42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features. As a result, it will no longer be possible to conduct a private transaction on Horizen or access private addresses as of February 7, 2024.</p><p>This is a complete removal of all private payment features from Horizen, effective Feb 7, 2024. There will be no private payment capabilities in Horizen as of this change. Regular public payments, just like Bitcoin, will continue to be supported by Horizen. Horizen will not be a privacy cryptocurrency anymore when this takes effect on Feb 7, 2024.</p><p>Again, we strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses transfer their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 7th, 2024. After February 7th, 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p><p>There is a guide on the Horizen Blog on how to De-Shield ZEN on Sphere Wallet, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool. Please reference the guide here: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/">https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/</a></p><p>The Horizen Ecosystem Team remains readily available to answer any questions around this, please open up a ticket, or reach out to us on our Discord: <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">https://horizen.io/invite/discord</a></p>

  Partnering with Oasis Security: The Stars Align  <p>At Sequoia, we look for strong teams going after growing markets. In Danny Brickman and Amit Zimerman, and non-human identity security, that’s exactly what we found.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a>	 



Published January 31, 2024
  



Bogomil, Danny and Amit hiking Twin Peaks in San Francisco.



 
<p>When we first met Danny Brickman in the summer of 2021, we identified him as a young star in the Israeli entrepreneurial ecosystem and someone we should watch. At the time, he was still ideating and had not started a company. But we recognized in him the same passion and drive we’d seen in the founders of Sequoia portfolio companies Wiz and Cyera (who, like Danny, are graduates of the elite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program">Talpiot program</a>).</p>



<p>At the same time, we at Sequoia were developing a thesis that identity was the largest remaining opportunity in security. Why? In part because when we asked CISOs to name their top three priorities, identity security was the most frequent theme. In the lingo of security pros, identity is the new perimeter, with the majority of security attacks today occurring via a malicious actor stealing a user’s identity. It is more important than ever to tighten that perimeter, and to have solid answers to questions like who should have access to what—and who is actually accessing what. Which team members need to use which apps and resources? What kind of access should they have? Are their current privileges too broad?</p>



<p>Most of us are very familiar with the process of securing how humans access systems. We may even get annoyed by the constant reminders to choose stronger passwords—but we know how costly it can be to have our private identity stolen or to allow an attacker into our corporate systems. What comes as a surprise to many, though, is that only a very small fraction of access requests in a company today actually come from humans. In the age of distributed systems, microservices, APIs, automation and AI agents, the overwhelming majority of these requests are from systems and machines—with their own identities, just like ours—accessing other systems and machines.</p>



<p>These non-human identities now outpace human ones by a factor of at least 10, and in some companies 50 or 100—an abundance of riches for an attacker to go after! But even more important, some of these non-human identities like service accounts and secrets (API keys, tokens and certificates) have much broader privileges than most human users; they may be able to not only access an application but also modify its settings or even delete it entirely! And in the hands of bad actors, such identities can wreak yet more havoc—from deleting an entire AWS environment to exfiltrating a lot of data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As critical as non-human identities have become, however, the processes and tools for securing them and managing their lifecycle are still emerging—and that can leave teams vulnerable to ticking time bombs, just waiting to explode. One security leader told us about a key generated with permission to read all of the company’s email, with no constraints—which was then emailed to an external contractor who used it to write software on their personal device. Another security admin found a Slack app designed for Christmas greetings that also had full read access to all conversations. Then there was the small recruiting product with root access to all Gmail.</p>



<p>As we at Sequoia explored the challenges and opportunities in the identity security space, we wrote an internal white paper detailing the need we saw, and were considering incubating a company in the domain. But Danny and co-founder Amit Zimerman were recognizing the same opportunity—and they decided to tackle it themselves.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.oasis.security/">Oasis Security</a> takes a holistic approach to securing non-human identities, solving for the specific issues that make managing their lifecycle so different from managing human identities. This includes not only the scale, but the rate of change. Human identities change at the rate of employees joining and leaving the team—or changing their passwords. Non-human identities, on the other hand, can be ephemeral, including short-lived tokens and certificates that expire in seconds. Oasis Security’s platform also accounts for the “blast radius” of non-human identities, which are more likely to interfere with entire systems than with individual users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sequoia team is thrilled that the stars aligned for us to support this important work and lead Oasis Security’s Series A, and we are proud to be in business with Danny, Amit and their team as they work to build a generational company. In the face of the huge and growing challenge of securing non-human identity, they are leading the charge toward a solution—and we will all be safer for it.</p>

<p>January 31, 2024, San Francisco, California— Today Brave Software announced the launch of Brave Ads Manager, a new platform to buy, manage, and report on privacy-preserving ad campaigns in the Brave ecosystem. The platform had been in limited <a>beta</a> since last spring and is now offering open <a href="https://ads.brave.com/">registration</a> to customers worldwide.</p>
<p>The Brave browser has grown to an audience of over 65 million monthly users while Brave Ads, which was <a>introduced in 2019</a>, has successfully run 9,000+ campaigns for 1,500+ advertisers in 200 countries. Throughout 2023, Brave Ads also expanded with the help of early adopters to ad placements on <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a>, the fastest growing search engine since Bing. Brave’s recent clients include Ford, Intuit, Norton, Swarovski, and Wayfair.</p>

 Reaching the next generation of early adopters 
<p><a>Brave users</a> are lead users and are passionate about their role in the future of the Web. As early adopters of emerging technologies like Web3 and AI, they value independence, quality content, and privacy above all when browsing. This makes them engaged but not easily reachable through conventional channels.</p>
<p>Brave Ads reconnects users with advertisers and enables direct relationships where users and brands meet on their own terms. Users set preferences for privacy-respecting ads, choosing when, where and how often to engage. Advertisers signal care for customers by respecting these choices, building goodwill and trust. No trackers or cookies are ever used. Ultimately, both parties benefit from Brave’s model of transparency and control over online experiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With over 65 million users and growing, Brave can’t be ignored by brands who want to reach the people at the frontier of the Web. What Brave users do, buy, and talk about today, the rest of the world will be doing, buying, and talking about in years to come.”</p>
<p>Luke Mulks, VP Business Operations</p>
</blockquote>

 The easiest way to advertise with privacy in mind 
<p>Customers can navigate a familiar and streamlined campaign creation process to create their Brave Ads campaigns in minutes. Once a campaign is submitted for review, customers can expect launch within 48 hours. Throughout the campaign, customers will have access to a dashboard to view campaign performance through a range of basic and advanced tools, all designed for practical use in the cookieless Web.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Brave Ads Manager campaign creation</p>

 Unique browser-based ad placements 
<p>Brave Ads Manager customers have the option to buy Notification and Newsfeed ad placements, two of four available ad types found throughout the Brave <a>browser</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/notification/">Notification ads</a> were the first—and remain the most popular—ad unit to launch with Brave Ads in the browser. For acquisition-based campaign objectives, advertisers can leverage Mindset Ad Targeting, Brave’s unique ad-matching technology that delivers precision, interest-based targeting at the browser level without risks or harm to privacy.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/news/">Newsfeed ads</a> are native image and text placements integrated seamlessly within Brave News, a free and customizable RSS and news aggregator available in the Brave browser via a new tab page. Ads in Brave News are always 100% SOV (share of voice)—two ads will never display in the feed at the same time.</p>

<p>About Brave Ads</p>
<p><a>Brave Ads launched in 2019</a> with the goal of reforming an increasingly user-hostile Web, made worse by ever-invasive tracking from innumerable ad-technology firms competing to capture as much data—people’s data—as possible. Brave Ads are cookieless, don’t track or identify users, and offer choice in how brands engage with them as they browse and search the Web.</p>

<p>Happy 8th Birthday, PIVX!</p><p>It’s time to celebrate another incredible year of achievements and growth. Over the past year, PIVX has reached new heights, expanding its use cases, increasing rewards, gaining listings on various exchanges, and engaging with its vibrant community.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at the highlights of this remarkable year for&nbsp;PIVX:</p><p>Rewards Increase: <br>The most significant highlight was the rewards increase. With the mandatory PIVX v5.5.0 update in January 2023, payments to the treasury, staking rewards, and Masternode rewards all received a significant boost. Treasury payments surged by an order of magnitude to 10 PIV per block, staking payments doubled to 4 PIV per block, and Masternode payments also doubled to 6 PIV per block. These increases have incentivized more participation and further strengthened the PIVX&nbsp;network!</p><p>Use Case Expansion: <br>PIVX expanded its use cases throughout the year. PIVCards, Coinsbee, and <a href="https://www.travala.com/">Travala.com</a> embraced $PIVX as a payment option. Users can now purchase gift cards from all over the world with PIV on<a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/"> mypivxwallet.org, PIVCards</a>, <a href="https://shopping.io/">Shopping.io</a> as well as <a href="https://www.coinsbee.com/">Coinsbee</a> offers a platform where $PIVX can be used to purchase various gift&nbsp;cards.</p><p>Listing Growth: <br>PIVX experienced significant listing growth, providing more opportunities for PIVX enthusiasts. New listings included <a href="https://whitebit.com/">Whitebit</a>, <a href="https://changeangel.io/">Changeangel</a>, <a href="https://houdiniswap.com/">Houdini Swap</a>, <a href="https://cointopay.com/">Cointopay</a>, <a href="https://swapuz.com/">Swapuz</a>, <a href="https://easybit.com/">Easybit, </a><a href="https://www.coinex.com/">CoinEx</a>, <a href="https://dex-trade.com/">Dex-Trade</a>, Securus Wallet, <a href="https://www.biconomy.com/">Biconomy,</a> Coinstore, <a href="https://nonkyc.io/">NonKYC</a>, <a href="https://changenow.io/">ChangeNOW </a>widget added to PIVX.org, <a href="https://tradeogre.com/markets">TradeOgre</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/breaking-news-9615d5416f6c">P2P payments on Binance,</a> <a href="https://www.lbank.com/">LBank</a>, <a href="https://arcticwallet.io/">Arctic Wallet</a>, <a href="https://finchpay.io/">FinchPay</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xt.com/en">Xt.com</a>.</p><p>Enhanced Trading Options: <br>PIVX gained enhanced trading options with various exchanges. In addition to the PIVX/USDT Binance trading pair, some other exchanges introduced BTC as well as USDT options, allowing for more convenient and accessible trading options for the PIVX community.</p><p>Community Engagement: <br>PIVX actively engaged with its community through various activities. These included YouTube shorts, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), the SuperBlock Report (PIVXLabs), PIVXcommunity contests, and the Privacy Roundtable, a collaborative group consisting of PIVX, BasicSwapDEX, Particl, and Firo. The Privacy Roundtable, hosts monthly Twitter spaces where trending privacy topics are discussed and other privacy projects are introduced. These initiatives are fostering a more vibrant and engaged community.</p><p>As we celebrate PIVX’s 8th birthday, we can proudly reflect on these achievements over the past year. The rewards increase, expanded use cases, listing growth, enhanced trading options, and community engagement have all contributed to the growth and success of&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>On this special day, let us say that growth is not a destination, but an ongoing journey. As we celebrate PIVX’s achievements, we recognize that it is through the relentless pursuit of knowledge, the embrace of new opportunities, and the adaptability to changing circumstances that PIVX continues to evolve and expand. Let us come together as a community committed to learning and adapting, keeping PIVX at the forefront of innovation and progress in the pursuit of privacy and financial sovereignty</p><p>Happy 8th birthday, PIVX!

With this grant, StarShell will allow users to route wallet RPC requests through the Nym mixnet, bringing metadata protection and robust privacy guarantees to end users. The wallet will include real-time metrics and visualizations based on mixnet activity. A new API will allow web applications to route all chain-directed traffic through the mixnet via the&nbsp;wallet.</p> <a href="https://www.nodies.app/">Nodies DLB</a> <p>Grant amount: $30,000USD</p><p>Nodies DLB is a managed infrastructure provider for centralized and decentralized remote procedure call (RPC) nodes, which enable communication between applications and blockchain networks. Nodies DLB gives its clients access to thousands of decentralized nodes while maintaining best-in-class security and performance standards. However, there is currently a scarcity of decentralized privacy-preserving RPC solutions. Nodies DLB proposes integrating its software with the Nym mixnet to bring end-to-end privacy protections to its assets including advanced metadata protection.</p> Pastenym by <a href="https://notrustverify.ch/">No Trust&nbsp;Verify</a> <p>Grant amount: $3,000USD</p><p>Pastenym is a text-sharing service proposed by long-time Nym community contributors and node operators,<a href="https://notrustverify.ch/"> No Trust Verify</a>. In the manner of Pastebin, Pastenym is an online text-drop but with added privacy protections for its users via the mixnet, encrypting their data as well as their metadata when text is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Congratulations again to these successful teams!</p><p>The <a href="https://nymtech.notion.site/nymtech/Nym-Innovation-Fund-7a1d2581a55b417bb44083fb29e12a0f">Nym Innovation Fund remains open for submissions</a>.</p><p>As these projects mature over the next quarter, we will introduce them to the venture funds that have pledged to support the Nym Innovation Fund. In addition, we’re hoping to onboard existing mature projects with their own plans for growth using Nym that can attract venture capital funding. Proposals with a business plan, a unique market proposition, and that are mature enough for seed investment will receive priority.</p><p>In addition to opening a pipeline to respected VCs, Nym will mentor successful teams to further refine their proposals.</p><p>With the VPN market alone projected to be <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/report/vpn">worth $151bn by 2030</a>, there’s enormous market potential for an entire ecosystem that actually respects people’s right to privacy&nbsp;online.</p><p>People are fed up with the surveillance capitalism model of web 2.0. So if you’ve got a winning idea, submit <a href="https://nymtech.notion.site/nymtech/Nym-Innovation-Fund-7a1d2581a55b417bb44083fb29e12a0f">your pitch deck to the Innovation Fund and have Nym help you bring it to&nbsp;life</a>.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-announces-first-round-of-grants-from-nym-innovation-fund-c7811a095fb7">Nym announces first round of grants from Nym Innovation Fund</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>To our winner, Sam Richter, congratulations on this well-deserved $2,500 cash prize you can use toward tuition, books, or anything else college requires. When informed of his big win, Sam said: “I plan to put the money towards my college tuition as I pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science at Iowa State University.” In addition to the cash prize, Sam’s photo will be seen by Brave’s 60+ million worldwide users as a featured background on the Brave browser’s new tab page throughout 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam took the picture when he and his family hiked on a trail in the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area in Nevada. His photo not only shows a remarkable moment in nature, but also his technique and creative eye.</p>
<p>At Brave, we believe in building a human-first Web, and empowering anyone to participate in that Web by creating user-generated content. The Brave new tab page is another surface where people can show their creative selves.</p>
<p>For those who submitted but did not win: Thank you! And, stay tuned—there may be more opportunities and exciting events in the near future.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for being a part of the Brave community.</p>

Decentralization enables strong privacy properties making it near-impossible to trace your traffic through the internet. But NymVPN is not just a dVPN, it also features mixnet technology: a novel feature ensuring unlinkability and strong privacy protections of not just the content of your messages but also your metadata.</p>The Nym mixnet in action via NymVPN’s 5-hop mixnet&nbsp;mode<p>Mixnets are a unique privacy technology that have only now, after years of research, become available to ordinary people. By shuffling your traffic through a stratified network of nodes and shuffling the order of packets, your patterns of communication vanish and become untraceable to unwanted observers. NymVPN is the first user-friendly application built on the Nym network. As plug-and-play privacy-as-a-service infrastructure across the transport layer of the internet, the mixnet will in time be folded into browsers, search engines, and blockchains across the Web3 ecosystem. <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Read more about mixnets&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Combining the best of both worlds, NymVPN has two distinct modes in one simple application:</p><p>The NymVPN 2-hop dVPN&nbsp;mode:</p>  Optimized for&nbsp;speed;  Customisable entry and exit nodes for geo-blocking resistance;  IP address obfuscation for everyday browsing, streaming, or&nbsp;gaming;  Multi-hop by default, going far beyond the privacy standards of most&nbsp;VPNs.  <p>And</p><p>The NymVPN 5-hop mixnet&nbsp;mode:</p>  Optimized for&nbsp;privacy;  Complete privacy against even government-level adversaries for sensitive use cases like crypto transactions and secure email that are not timing sensitive;  No more metadata leakage of timing and volume of&nbsp;packets;  Traffic analysis resistance via packet shuffling and dummy traffic in inner-three mix&nbsp;nodes.  <p>Nym is trustless, permissionless, and totally transparent. Unlike traditional VPNs where you have to trust that the provider isn’t spying on your communications, Nym’s full stack is decentralized and open source with gateways and mix nodes dispersed all around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>As <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nyms-2024-new-year-resolutions-aeb6d1123c00">Nym CEO and cofounder Harry Halpin said in his new year note</a>, if 2023 was about readying the Nym network for usage, 2024 is the year everyone everywhere will be able to enjoy truly private access to the internet.</p><p><a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">Sign up to the NymVPN waitlist&nbsp;now.</a></p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1gqxvQAMpeqJB?s=20">Catch Marc Debizet, Head of Product at Nym for a live Ask Me Anything on Twitter spaces, 30 January at 14:30-UTC.</a>   Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-alpha-is-ready-for-private-launch-in-february-f268a9388e62">NymVPN alpha is ready for private launch in February</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.5.2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This latest version is a hotfix release, to temporarily remove the experimental&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature introduced in the preceding 1.5.1 release. Following the 1.5.1 release on GitHub, we identified difficulties in publishing the&nbsp;zebra-chain&nbsp;crate to <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, to resolve this challenge, which involves an unpublished dependency, we had to temporarily remove the internal miner support introduced in version 1.5.1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 1.5.1 release includes a utility for reading results from the zebra blockchain scanner, thus finalizing a minimum viable product for scanning the Zcash blockchain with a viewing key. It also added an experimental&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature, temporarily removed with the 1.5.2 hotfix release, which can mine blocks within&nbsp;zebrad. This feature is only supported on testnet as you need to use a more efficient GPU or ASIC for mainnet mining.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We plan to reinstate the&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature once our PRs are merged and released into the&nbsp;equihash dependency. You can track development progress on this issue <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/8183">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of this release we have also improved our documentation with details on how to use the new blockchain scanning feature as well as making it easier to find documentation for all our crates in <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can see a full copy of the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.5.1">v1.5.1 Release Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.5.2">v1.5.2 Release Notes</a> on github.</p>

 Zcash Viewing Keys 



<p>When a Zcash user creates a shielded transaction, they encrypt it to the recipient’s address. Being able to access the data hidden behind the encryption is a necessary condition for the recipient to spend the funds, but it’s not sufficient since the recipient also needs to prove ownership of the spending key corresponding to the address. To decrypt the shielded transaction, the recipient uses a so-called viewing key, which they derive from their spending key. A viewing key allows decryption of the shielded data but reveals nothing about the spending key, effectively allowing “viewing” of shielded transactions but not spending of them.</p>



 Blockchain Scanning with Zebra 



<p>All Zcash users use their viewing keys to learn about what transactions belong to them. They try to decrypt each transaction in the blockchain to see if they can unlock the shielded data. We refer to this process as scanning or trial decryption. Light clients can perform the scanning locally so that the public server they communicate with doesn’t learn anything about their transactions. However, some users operate their own infrastructure. These are typically enterprise users, such as exchanges, which are best served using a scanning service closely linked to their full node.</p>



<p>At Zcon4, the Electric Coin Company and Zcash Foundation agreed to move the Zcash ecosystem to Zebra. To be able to do so, Zebra needs to support wallets capable of replacing the wallet in zcashd. As a first step toward this goal, we decided to extend Zebra with a blockchain scanner that accepts viewing keys and performs the trial decryption of shielded transactions. The scanner then stores the results in persistent storage. This functionality should allow for an efficient implementation of wallets relying on Zebra.</p>



 Implementation Details 



<p>The current scanner is a new crate in the Zebra repository, in the form of a minimum viable product. It relies on the librustzcash library to perform the scanning, and supports only Sapling. It reads all blocks through Zebra’s internal state service and stores the TXIDs, referring to transactions that contain notes decryptable by the provided viewing keys. The storage is a separate instance of RocksDB that Zebra also uses for storing the state.</p>



<p>The current version of the scanner is documented for users in our <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan.html">Zebra book</a>. If you want to give it a try, you can use <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/tree/main/zebra-utils#scanning-results-reader">this tool</a> to read the scanning results. If you submit the scanning <a href="https://zecpages.com/boardinfo">key from ZECpages</a>, it will print all posts from the board to standard output. The next step for the scanner is to implement a gRPC frontend, exposing the scanner’s capabilities to Zebra users.</p>

 New C/C++ bindings open the door for deeper Bitcoin, Zcash, Firo integrations and&nbsp;more. <p>The Nym mixnet is a powerful plug-and-play privacy infrastructure that protects any kind of communication in transit. Not only does the mixnet protect your data, but by shuffling traffic it protects metadata too, making your internet habits invisible. In order for the mixnet to be really plug and play, though, it needs to be able to communicate outside of its native Rust code&nbsp;base.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/pembaruan-nym-rust-sdk-25dc81aa15ff">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-nym-rust-sdk-bc2464efb07b">Русский</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/n1adb4103b630">日本</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nym-rust-sdk-g%C3%BCncellemesi-0bfadbb15841">Türkçe</a></p><p>Now, any projects written in C++ will be able to more easily integrate with the Nym mixnet thanks to a new interface available in the Nym Rust SDK: <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp">C/C++ bindings</a>. And there are a lot of projects that have C/C++ components, from the Bitcoin source code to libbitcoin, Zcash, Firo, some components of the Signal messaging app and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Developers: please try out these bindings! You can find a reference implementation example <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp/src/main.cpp">here</a> for how C/C++ devs could interact with the SDK. Try to connect your application with the mixnet and see what you can do. If you have any questions or feedback, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">please do reach out on Matrix/Element</a>.</p><p>For the rest of you, what do these bindings mean? Let’s take a closer&nbsp;look.</p> Why does Nym need C/C++ bindings? <p>The backend of the Nym stack is written in Rust. Rust is a great language and has been adopted by projects across the crypto, security, and privacy space because of its design — to be a flexible and fast low-level systems language, which aims to remove an entire class of memory-related issues that other languages fall foul&nbsp;of.</p><p>However, when you’re making a generic network layer for the rest of the internet, relying on a relatively new language can create issues — after all, Rust’s first stable release was in 2015. Projects use a lot of other languages, and not all of these are interoperable.</p><p>In an ideal world, one would be able to write everything in Rust and cross-compile it to be able to use it anywhere. (See the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/Motivation.html#how">Motivation section</a> of the UniFFI documentation for a bit more on&nbsp;this.)</p><p>Unfortunately this glorious future has not yet come to pass. So instead the team has to rely on writing Foreign Function Interface (FFI) code; this essentially creates a translation mechanism for code in one language to call code in&nbsp;another.</p><p>The Rust compiler cannot and does not understand C++ code. Therefore, the Rust compiler needs to be told about code to use on the C++ side. Language bindings are the glue to make this communication happen.</p><p>One of the nice things about Rust is that it, like many other languages, exposes a C <a href="https://slightknack.github.io/rust-abi-wiki/intro/what_is_an_ABI.html">Application Binary Interface</a> (ABI) — something that defines how to interact with a piece of compiled code. For example, with Nym this might be how to call a function that starts a process of listening out for incoming messages from the mixnet, or how the code deals with managing data in memory such as storing incoming messages and <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/traffic-flow.html#private-replies-using-surbs">replySURBs</a> for your app to use later&nbsp;on.</p><p>Why is this important, and how does one acronym (ABI) relate to the other (FFI)? Like&nbsp;so:</p><blockquote>“The FFI is the user-code interface the language provides to interact with other executables, which may have a different ABI. The FFI forms the transition layer between different ABIs.” — <a href="https://slightknack.github.io/rust-abi-wiki/intro/what_is_an_ABI.html#what's-the-difference-between-an-abi-and-an-api%20fi">From the Rust ABI&nbsp;wiki</a>.</blockquote> Nym Rust SDK&nbsp;update <p><a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp">The first version of some FFI bindings for the Nym Rust SDK</a> were published this&nbsp;week.</p><p>This means applications written in C/C++ can start experimenting with integrating mixnet functionality by interacting with the Nym Rust SDK, using these bindings.</p><p>The development team has covered the initial functions that developers will need for starting to experiment with the mixnet: creating a Nym client and sending and receiving messages. There is also a <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp/src/main.cpp">reference implementation / example</a> of how C/C++ devs might interact with the&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>This is an important step in making the mixnet more accessible to third parties, so previously unsupported developers can use Nym’s Rusk SDK.

<p>With today’s desktop browser update (v1.62), we are excited to announce that we have integrated Mixtral 8x7B as the default large language model (LLM) in <a>Leo</a>, our recently released, privacy-preserving AI browser assistant. <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">Mixtral 8x7B</a> is an open source LLM released by <a href="https://mistral.ai/">Mistral AI</a> this past December, and has already seen broad usage due to its speed and performance. In addition, we’ve made several improvements to the Leo user experience, focusing on clearer onboarding, context controls, input and response formatting, and general UI polish.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Unveiling Mixtral 8x7B 
<p>Mixtral is now the default LLM for all Leo users, for the free version and the Premium version ($15/month). The free version is rate limited, and subscribers to Leo Premium benefit from higher rate limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>Among other benefits, Mixtral can:</p>
 
 Handle larger contexts 
 Interact in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish 
 Generate code 
 
<p>Brave is already using Mixtral for its newly released <a>Code LLM</a> feature for programming-related queries in <a>Brave Search</a>, and the combination of Mixtral’s performance with its open source nature made it a natural fit for integration in Leo, given Brave’s commitment to open models and the open source community.</p>
<p>“Since its release, Brave Leo has been adopted by tens of thousands of free tier users and paid subscribers, and we expect even greater adoption as we expand our availability of LLMs to include Mixtral,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder at Brave. “Our aim is to create novel and convenient use cases in the context of users’ browsing sessions, and to help our users interact with the Web in groundbreaking ways.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are very happy to see Mixtral being used to power CodeLLM in Brave Search, and to now have Mixtral integrated in Brave Leo,” said Arthur Mensch, CEO at Mistral Al. “Making Mixtral available as an open model enables Brave to easily integrate it and to fulfill their users’ growing AI needs.”&nbsp;</p>

 Giving Leo users choice with a variety of LLMs 
<p>Unlike other AI assistants, Brave Leo offers its users the flexibility to choose from different models according to their needs and budget. While we’ve added Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM for both the free and premium versions of Brave Leo, we also offer Claude Instant from Anthropic in the free version (with rate limits) and for Premium. The free and premium versions of Leo also feature the Llama 2 13B model from Meta.</p>
<p>With Mixtral’s integration, Leo users will notice a significant performance improvement in the answer/result quality. Regarding the free Leo version, users will also have the option to revert to the previous Leo experience with Llama 2 and continue their AI experience once they reach the rate limits for Mixtral.</p>

 Privacy always comes first 
<p>Privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. Privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address. 
 Immediate discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers. 
 No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp; 
 Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience. 
 

 Ready to try Brave Leo? 
<p>It’s easy to get started with Brave Leo because it’s built right into the browser, so no extra apps or extensions are required. Leo provides seamless access to AI experiences via the browser address bar, or as a sidebar, chat-like interface positioned beside any webpage. Leo helps users with all sorts of tasks in the context of the page they are on by creating real-time summaries of webpages or videos. Leo can also answer questions about content, generate new content, translate pages, analyze them, and rewrite them. Whether you’re looking for information, trying to solve a problem, writing code, or creating content, Leo is integrated in the browser for enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>To access Leo, Brave desktop users can simply ask a question in the address bar and click  “Ask Leo”, or click  in the Brave Sidebar.</p>
<p>Leo has been available to Brave desktop users since November (<a>version 1.60</a>). Leo will be available on mobile (Android and iOS) soon. Learn more about <a>Brave Leo</a>, or see a <a>roadmap</a> for Leo.</p>

  To kick off 2024, we're thrilled to announce a major update to the desktop version of Brave News, our privacy-preserving, in-browser news feed.

<p>To kick off 2024, we’re thrilled to announce a major update to the desktop version of Brave News, our privacy-preserving, in-browser news feed. The improved Brave News creates an even more seamless experience for catching up on personalized news, by simply scrolling down in a new browser tab. Brave News is free and the update includes a streamlined interface as well as an upgrade to the local personalization algorithms. These changes make Brave News both easier to use and smarter about the stories you see, while maintaining Brave’s privacy promise.</p>
<p>This newly optimized Brave News feed gives users more choice and control over what they see, and options for filtering content by channel or publisher. The improved local feed algorithm helps users discover new and interesting stories and provides suggestions for following channels and publishers they might enjoy. Users can also add RSS feeds, and choose to view content only from their favorite local publishers, blogs, or community sites.</p>
<p>Key updates include:</p>
 
 A For you section that shows stories based on your interests and local browsing history - while never infringing on your privacy 
 An updated top news section and story clusters 
 A filter view for viewing content by channel, source, or RSS feed 
 An easily visible news preview on the new tab page, with the latest news that may be of interest to you 
 

 One place, better control 
<p>In this update, we were hyper-focused on the way news is presented. We redesigned the Brave News space to show more articles and be more conscious about how we display images so you can get more value from a glance. We also added a side navigation panel so you can explore your favorite channels and publishers in a single click.</p>
<p>If you’re just looking for an interesting mix of daily news, then check out the For you and Following feeds. Whether you want an overview of the day’s news, or you’re looking for something specific, Brave News puts you in control of your news experience…all while protecting your privacy.</p>
<p>To find Brave News, just open Brave on your desktop, then open a new tab and scroll down.</p>
<p>

    
    

    




      
      
    
Redesigned Brave News feed page</p>

 Content that’s relevant to you 
<p>Endlessly scrolling through irrelevant news can be a real time waste. That’s why we overhauled how your feed is created and personalized, making it smarter and more attuned to your interests. The improved Brave News now prioritizes showing you content you may actually want to read.</p>
<p>Some new features take the form of new types of cards displayed in the feed. Channel cards, for example, are single-themed deep dives into the channels and topics you care about the most. And for US users, Top stories cards neatly summarize the most important events and developments happening now.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    </p>
<p>Left: Channel card: single-themed deep dives into topics you care about most. Right: Top Stories card: summaries of the most important events and developments happening now.</p>
<p>To make customizing your feed even easier, we added Customize cards to the feed. These cards will recommend new publishers and/or channels you might be interested in, based on your existing preferences and signals.</p>
<p>

    
    

    




      
      
    
Brave News customization cards</p>
<p>The customization menu is also accessible via the settings button at the bottom right, or via the Add button in the new side navigation panel.</p>

 Privacy always comes first 
<p>News aggregators are a common way to consume news. However, the way most popular aggregators work is by collecting and storing your preferences, consumption habits, and other behavioral data to determine what news to show you.</p>
<p>But the news you consume can tell a lot about you, from your political beliefs to fine-grained interests (e.g. a review about a self-help book) and more. For these reasons, we believe that the news you consume should have the same privacy protections as anything else you do online. Unlike others, Brave does not collect or store your data.</p>
<p>From how articles are delivered to how and where personalization happens, Brave News has been designed with privacy in mind. Information about your consumption habits—what channels and publishers you follow, the exact articles you click and read, and more—never leaves your computer. Because a great news experience does not require data collection, Brave’s local personalization mechanisms ensure the news in your feed is relevant, interesting, and private.</p>

<p>Backing open-ended breakthrough research is at the core of BlueYard’s investing philosophy, whether it’s nuclear fusion, programmable stem cells or novel crypto-compute infrastructure. Hackers and researchers remain the essential backbone of the crypto industry. We are proud to have supported the work of research-focused companies like <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>, <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a>, <a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a>, <a href="https://www.tromero.ai/">Tromero</a> and more in solving critical crypto compute and infrastructure challenges, including those that could be key to unlocking adoption and enabling groundbreaking novel use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>This brings us to our core thesis underpinning our crypto investing strategy:</p><blockquote>In the history of technology, economics and organizations — never has there been a technology and incentive system that can autonomously coordinate machines (compute, storage, etc), algorithms, data and capital at such an incredible scale, so quickly — all while providing independent, robust and trustless infrastructure for economic activity and data. Although still early in its development, crypto might be the ultimate solution to the collective action problem. Also, if one believes in a future where the autonomous coordination between compute, data and capital will play an increasing role, crypto networks could be the “under the hood” operating system for large economic networks.</blockquote><p>Due to crypto’s inherent properties (ability to cut out gatekeepers, separation of state and money, internet native assets with open access) — crypto’s potential will unfold both through novel applications and decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Within this context, it is essential that individual researchers and hackers continue to explore open-ended research, despite the current funding and regulatory headwinds in the industry. Individual research is often the nucleus of a future key component of the crypto industry. ​​In that spirit, we are announcing BlueYard DYOR (Do Your Own Research, and pronounced like <a href="https://youtu.be/HPsgY7zCtck?feature=shared&amp;t=41">this</a>) funding program. We’re offering $100k to thoughtful researchers and builders to pursue their curiosities and research in crypto, with an open-ended outcome if their work is contributed to the industry and/or forms the nucleation of a new company or&nbsp;network.</p><p>As the name suggests, we expect the BlueYard DYOR cohort to conduct independent crypto research and/or work on a project. You don’t currently have to have a company, team, or a specific idea of what you want to build or research. Simply a direction of what you want to pursue. We are geography agnostic and excited to work with the best minds wherever they might&nbsp;be.</p><p>You are someone&nbsp;who:</p>  Has a track record of experimenting and building (show us your&nbsp;work!)  Might be sitting on the sidelines waiting for the bear market to blow over (now is the best time to start something new) or don’t have the personal funding to spend more time pursuing your crypto curiosities  Is independent, insatiably curious, and excited to try novel things in&nbsp;crypto  Understands the potential of crypto beyond its speculative value and wants to build for the long&nbsp;term  <p>What you can expect from BlueYard&nbsp;DYOR:</p>  Access to the BlueYard team and its crypto portfolio (and the wider science and compute companies in our broader portfolio) to support you in your&nbsp;work  A cohort of 10 other builders experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in&nbsp;crypto  Help in publishing / releasing and distributing what you have&nbsp;built  Access to crypto and science events alongside meetups within the BlueYard&nbsp;family  Help in setting up an entity through which the DYOR funding will be received via an uncapped&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents">SAFE</a>  <p>You can learn more about our crypto portfolio <a href="http://www.blueyard.com">here</a> and apply for BlueYard DYOR&nbsp;<a href="https://blueyard.typeform.com/to/vvc3f8BC">here</a>.</p>

		  ZEN 5.0.0 is the official Mainnet Release  ZEN 4.1.1 (previous version) is going to deprecate on Mainnet at block #1502084, on February 6th, 2024 at approximately 6:00 AM UTC. Please, update to ZEN 5.0.0 before February 6th, 2024.  ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via Hard Fork at block #1502800, on February 7th, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP-42207</a> to fully remove the shielded pool from Horizen will be implemented with this release:  All transactions involving shielded addresses will no longer be accepted at the consensus level once the hard fork activates  RPC calls z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress have been partially disabled so that it will no longer be possible to submit transactions involving shielded addresses (transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded, and shielded-to-transparent) once the hard fork activates. Transparent-to-transparent transactions will still be accepted and submitted to the network.  Only nodes running on Mainnet have to be updated.      <p>IMPORTANT: 5.0.0.<br>After the previously mentioned Hard Fork, it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then. Directly depositing funds from shielded addresses to exchange wallets is strongly discouraged.<br><br></p><p>See release notes <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/blob/release/5.0.0/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.0.0.md">Here.</a></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a> is developing hardware to speed up zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic scheme that secures much of web3 and is a critical component for scaling Ethereum.</p><p>ZK proofs allow verification that a transaction or smart contract was executed without revealing any of the details. This was first used to support private transactions in protocols like ZCash. The even more promising application is to increase the scalability of protocols such as Ethereum. Layer 2 solutions such as StarkWare execute transactions and smart contracts for users and then post a ZK proof to Ethereum. This significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored on Ethereum and enables transaction volumes similar to traditional payment networks such as&nbsp;Visa.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Inside of every CPU are specialized circuits for speeding up the cryptography used to secure the internet today. At first, Ingonyama might look like a niche business designing specialized hardware for scaling crypto protocols.

<p>Celebrating One Year of PIVX Rewards Increase: A Gateway to Promising Opportunities</p><p>As we commemorate the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://pivx.org/news/pivx-rewards-increase">PIVX’s rewards increase,</a> it is a moment of celebration and reflection on the positive impact this decision has had on the PIVX ecosystem. On January 22, 2023, coinciding with block 3715200, PIVX embraced the version 5.5.0 upgrade, marking a significant milestone in its financial structure. This upgrade brought forth remarkable changes, including increased payments to the treasury, staking and Masternode rewards, setting the stage for further growth, innovation, and community engagement.</p><p>Expanding Opportunities and Strengthening the Network:<br>With the rewards increase, maximum treasury payments soared to 10 PIV per block. This surge in funding allows for greater support for listings, use cases, development, marketing, and essential initiatives within the PIVX community. Simultaneously, staking rewards doubled to 4 PIV per block, providing an incentive for more PIVX holders to actively participate in securing the network. Doubling of Masternode payments to 6 PIV per block further encourages the growth of Masternodes, enabling them to vote on treasury expenditures and contribute to future PIVX applications. These advancements not only strengthen the PIVX network but also open doors to exciting opportunities for growth and development.</p><p>Conclusion:<br>As we celebrate the one-year anniversary of the PIVX rewards increase, we acknowledge the positive impact it has had on the project’s financial structure. The rewards increase is succeeding in enhancing funding, stimulating proposal submissions, expanding use cases, and attracting more listings for <a href="http://PIVX.org">PIVX.</a> It has played a vital role in supporting various initiatives and contributing to the growth and opportunities of the&nbsp;<a href="http://Discord.PIVX.org">project.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/celebrating-one-year-of-pivx-rewards-increase-9c4146cd3e17">Celebrating One Year of PIVX Rewards Increase.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The reasons for this are twofold: enormous operating costs and seamless user experience (e.g. social logins and account recovery), which, until recently, could only be solved through centralisation. Add to this the reluctance to change platforms as users need to re-upload their files, and you get an ossified user base. However, data leaks and hacks are a constant threat to users’ privacy, and indicate the disruptive potential of decentralised file storage and sharing.</p><p>We were joined by Andreas Tsamados &amp; Vijay Krishnavanshi, co-founders of Fileverse, to discuss their decentralised file sharing solution and how they plan to disrupt the Web2 quasi-monopoly.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Returning to the P2P roots of the Internet  Web2 vs. Web3 user experience (UX)  Business models for Web2 data  Decentralising data  Web3 data storage  Costs of data storage  Managing file updates and permissions  Fileverse use cases  The business model of Fileverse  Improving UX  Future roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/miroyato">Andreas Tsamados on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/0x6b8">Vijay Krishnavanshi on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/fileverse">Fileverse on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

		 Introduction <p>The target date for full secure node depreciation is Mar 11, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> was introduced and voted on in November 2023 and the community overwhelmingly voted in favor of deprecating secure nodes and repurposing the coinbase reward that secure nodes were receiving to EON forger nodes.&nbsp; However, secure nodes have not yet been fully deprecated.&nbsp; This blog post outlines the steps remaining, the timeline to full secure node deprecation, additional information on EON forger nodes and a link to instructions on setting up a forger node.</p> Details <p>This date listed above represents the date that the secure node tracking system is shut off, and that changes to both EON and Horizen are implemented (and sufficiently tested) to enable the movement of the coinbase reward from Horizen to EON, and then the subsequent distribution of the coinbase reward to forgers who have forged blocks.</p> Timeline   Jan 25, 2024 – changes to EON implemented  Feb 7, 2024 – next mainchain hardfork  Mar 10, 2024 – last secure node earning period ends  Mar 11, 2024 – last secure node payment performed, secure nodes fully deprecated  Mar 18, 2024 – first coinbase rewards deposited into Horizen EON   What are Horizen EON Forger Nodes and Why are they Important? <p></p><p>In a Proof-of-Stake chain, the nodes are called forger nodes.&nbsp;Forger nodes play a critical role in PoS consensus by creating blocks, validating transactions, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Forger nodes are critical to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus for several reasons:</p>  Block production: They create new blocks in the blockchain, with their chance of being selected often based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold as collateral.  Transaction validation: Forger nodes validate and add transactions to the blockchain, ensuring that only valid transactions are recorded.  Security: They’re financially motivated to act honestly because they’ve staked their own tokens as collateral, risking loss of rewards if they behave maliciously.  Energy efficiency: PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW because it doesn’t require the same amount of computing power.  Sybil attack resistance: The larger the number of honest forger nodes, the harder a sybil attack becomes.  Decentralization: Forging nodes contribute to network decentralization, allowing a wider range of participants to be involved.  <p>Learn more about Horizen EON Forger Nodes and why they are important by <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-are-horizen-eon-forger-nodes-and-why-we-need-them/">reviewing our blog post on the subject.</a>&nbsp;</p> EON Forger Node Instructions <p>For step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run an EON forger node, please visit <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/compose-evm-simplified">our GitHub repository below</a> to learn more. If you intend to run a forger node, please select ‘forger’ when executing the ‘init.sh’ script for the first time. Keep in mind that both the Mainchain node and the Sidechain node will require some time to fully synchronize the entire chains.</p>

Some of you will already know about it. You might even have heard of how this problem can be fixed and have joined the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#NymVPN:nymtech.chat">community working together to fix it</a>. For the rest of you, it’s time you’re also let in on the secret. This is for you: discover exactly what happens to your data and come along for a five-hop ride through the maze of mixnet technology.</p><p>The internet is a wild and wonderful place. An immense, global network of information, gossip and chatter, broken into little packets and routed through networks organised by protocols: TCP/IP, HTTP, UDP, FTP, TLS,&nbsp;DNS…</p><p>Billions of packets are routed through the internet every minute using these common protocols. But here’s the problem: the packets can be traced. It doesn’t matter that the content is encrypted, packets can still be watched to see who is speaking to who, how often, and from where. The standard protocols of the internet leave your patterns of communication fully visible to anyone watching parts of or the whole network. This includes internet service providers, VPN providers, internet exchanges, autonomous systems, BGP routers, even WiFi routers, LAN, and famously, the NSA and other security agencies.</p><p>So what can be done about&nbsp;it?</p><p>The obvious thing would be to immediately throw a cover over the internet to protect these packets. After all, it’s ludicrous that one of the main vehicles of communication for the entire world allows all kinds of people, companies and agencies to watch your communication without your knowledge. This is really not a normal state of affairs. And it’s about time it&nbsp;changes.</p><p>A mixnet is an ‘overlay network’ and provides just such a cover for internet&nbsp;traffic.</p><p>A novel update to the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358549.358563">decades-old concept</a> of mixed networks, the Nym mixnet scrambles traffic patterns to prevent corporate and government surveillance — and is designed for scale, usability, and anonymity.</p><p>Mixnets send your packets through several hops and mix them so that it becomes nearly impossible to trace these patterns of communication from one end to the other. Let’s go on a journey through the five hops of the Nym mixnet to learn more about exactly how that&nbsp;happens.</p><p>Here’s the TL;DR overview of the full&nbsp;journey:</p>  The Nym client (this lives on your device to encrypt your packets before they get sent to the&nbsp;mixnet)  The entry gateway (this is the first hop and entry point to the magical world of&nbsp;mixnets)  The three mix nodes (these perform packet shuffling, scrambling communications)  The exit gateway (where data is sent out from the&nbsp;mixnet)  Hello world! Your packet has now entered the internet with no traceability back to&nbsp;you.   Nym mixnet traffic flow step one: the Nym&nbsp;client <p>The Nym client lives on your device. It takes any outbound traffic before it leaves your device and wraps each packet in layers of encryption. A packet is simply a piece of data that’s built using cryptographic primitives. The Nym mixnet uses a special type of packet called <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/sphinx-tl-dr-the-data-packet-that-can-anonymize-bitcoin-and-the-internet-18d152c6e4dc">Sphinx</a>, which is different from a TCP/IP packet. The way a Sphinx packet is designed is to ensure the confidentiality of your content or communications. Each Sphinx packet looks identical to others, to make them untraceable within the network based on their binary&nbsp;pattern.</p>Diagram of the traffic sent by the Nym WebAssembly Client<p>At the high level, a Sphinx packet is composed of two independent parts, a header and a body/payload part.</p><p>The header encapsulates all routing information needed to route the packet through the mixnet to the recipient. The payload contains the content of the communication, for example our ‘Hello World!’ message that we want to send through the mixnet. Both the header and the payload are independently layer-encrypted, meaning that there is a separate layer of encryption for each hop in the route. This also means that if your client has selected mix nodes A, B, C for your packet P, no other nodes can successfully process your packet P. And for each packet sent through the Nym mixnet, a Sphinx acknowledgment is received by the previous node, so they know it has&nbsp;arrived.</p><p>Sphinx encryption is a novel type of onion encryption, named for the lustrous layers of the root vegetable protecting its tiny core. Onion encryption ensures ‘bitwise-unlinkability’. In short, this means that when your packet traverses a mixnode, it changes its binary appearance. Neither the nodes in the route, nor a global surveillance actor observing the whole network, can link sender to receiver. For example, even if an entry and exit node collude, neither of them can tell whether they processed any common packets because of the changing binary pattern. Traditional TCP or UDP packets do not provide such a property, i.e. they look the same ‘going in’ as they do ‘going&nbsp;out’.</p><p>In addition to unlinkability, Sphinx provides ‘integrity protection’. What this means is that if a malicious node tries to malform a packet, Sphinx detects it and the packet is dropped in the network to prevent the tracing of tainted packets. Moreover, the Sphinx protocol also offers Single-Use-Reply-Blocks as a tool for anonymous replies, so the recipient of a packet can reply to the original sender without the need to learn their network location (i.e.,&nbsp;IP).</p><p>To summarize, the Nym client lives on a user’s device or in an app. The Nym client manages the secure connection with the selected gateway, encrypts your communications and facilitates sending packets through the Nym mixnet. It also does things like storing a user’s private keys and NYM tokens to facilitate bandwidth credentials and more — but that’s for another&nbsp;time!</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step two: the entry&nbsp;gateway <p>A gateway is the entry point to the mixnet. It acts as a proxy between the Nym client and the Nym mixnet and checks that a user has the necessary credentials to use the mixnet — whether they or the app they’re using have paid for fair&nbsp;usage.</p><p>All gateways are operated by the Nym community to ensure complete decentralization of the mixnet system. There are currently <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">70 gateways</a>, which can be viewed on <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/gateways">Nym Explorer</a> along with metrics like routing score and reliability.</p><p>The gateways are necessary for a few&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Gateways check bandwidth credentials to ensure that a particular user has a right to use the Nym mixnet — i.e., that they paid for it. This also limits Denial of Service attacks and free-riding, where people squeeze resources from networks without contributing to&nbsp;them.  Secondly, gateways also act as offline storage for incoming packets — so if a client is offline, the gateway stores this incoming communication until it gets back&nbsp;online.  And third, the gateway is your, well, gateway into the mixnet from the Nym client. This also means that the gateway can potentially see the client’s IP address. But they do not know anything about the destination of the packet, nor its content or metadata.  <p>For super users, <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">it’s possible to run your own gateway</a> if you don’t want to expose the IP to that first&nbsp;hop.</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step three: the three mix&nbsp;nodes <p>Your packet has now been Sphinx encypted by your client and sent to the entry gateway. Now what? This is where the magic ‘mixing’ happens. The entry gateway decrypts one layer of Sphinx to check which mix node to send your packet to first. What is a mix node? An independently run server that someone in the Nym community has created, also called a ‘hop’. All mix nodes are visible on the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/gateways">Nym Explorer</a>.</p><p>This hop depends on a number of factors including geographical proximity and which mix nodes have been selected for the ‘active set’. The active set is simply the amount of nodes that are currently active and mixing traffic: 240 at any given&nbsp;time.</p><p>This ‘active set’ changes every ‘epoch’ — one epoch lasts an hour — and a selection algorithm checks the performance and reputation of nodes. This ensures traffic paths are continuously changing and malicious paths cannot be established by hostile node operators.</p><p>What is a ‘layer’ in the mixnet? Well, the mixnet arranges nodes into something called a ‘stratified topology’, which just means that the nodes are grouped into three layers, with the three hops distributed across these layers. This is to ensure horizontal scalability, efficiency, and anonymity by&nbsp;design.</p><p>When a data packet is routed, a mix node is picked at random from each layer, and a path is composed that has three hops. Take a look at this&nbsp;gif:</p><p>These mechanisms alone vastly improve user anonymity compared to traditional VPNs or even other decentralized privacy-preserving technologies.</p><p>But that’s not all: there are two very important features that make ‘following the packet’ even more difficult. These are timing obfuscation and cover&nbsp;traffic.</p>POV: you’re the NSA trying to track a data packet on the&nbsp;mixnet.<p>Timing obfuscation means that the order of packets are shuffled and reordered by each of the three mix nodes. This makes it near impossible for an observer to correlate an incoming to an outgoing packet. These intervals are practically imperceptible to&nbsp;humans.</p><p>Adding even further anonymity, all real data packets are mixed in with cover traffic. These are empty data packets that are the same size as real data packets. They’re useful for privacy because they create a “crowd” of packets obscuring any traffic patterns in a flurry of fake communication that’s useless to anyone snooping on the&nbsp;network.</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step four: The exit&nbsp;gateway <p>Your packet has now reached the final hop in its journey: the exit gateway. The exit gateway will decrypt the final destination of the packet, working in tandem with a service provider that will connect the packet to whichever ‘clearnet’ website or app you are trying to&nbsp;reach.</p><p>The gateway can see the final destination. However, your data is routed on a per packet basis. This means that even in the event a malicious exit gateway was set up and was picked for the active set, it would only see a tiny portion of your traffic. Furthermore, the gateway does not see any plaintext. Content is still end-to-end encrypted by the original sender and is only decrypted by the receiving client.</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step five: Hello&nbsp;world! <p>Your packet has now reached the rest of the world, passing through the protective cover of the mixnet. The patterns of your traffic have been protected, your data end to end encrypted, and any snoopers will have surely lost your packet by now. But this journey is just for a packet going out. But what about replies? And what if an app wants to fetch information via the&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p>Nym uses something called Single Use Reply Blocks, or SURBs. These allow applications to interact with other applications anonymously via the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Say a client application needs to interact with an online service or a P2P application on another person’s machine. To avoid revealing any gateway or client keys (and defeating the point of anonymity via the mixnet), SURBs allow for anonymous interactions.</p><p>A SURB is a layer-encrypted set of Sphinx headers that detail a reply path that ends in the original application’s address. These are encrypted by the senders’ client so that a receiving service or application can attach its response and send back a Sphinx packet, without knowing who it is replying&nbsp;to.</p><p>In the case of larger anonymous replies like files, the mixnet uses something called ‘MultiSURBs’ — where a bundle of SURBs are created rather than just the one to handle bigger data capacity.</p><p>There is much more to the story, so stick around for next week’s deep-dive into the Nym&nbsp;client.</p><p>The power of the mixnet will soon reach ordinary people: <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> is launching later this&nbsp;year.</p>  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">Sign up</a> to the&nbsp;waitlist  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#NymVPN:nymtech.chat">Get involved as a beta&nbsp;tester!</a>   Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p>Privacy loves&nbsp;company</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p><p>The Nym mixnet is run by a wonderful community of operators all over the world.

<p>Crypto token staking is a rapidly growing multi-billion market, set for further rapid expansion as more Proof of Stake (PoS) becomes the de facto standard model for consensus among crypto networks. This also opens more opportunities for capital vs machine deployment within crypto networks. However, running staking nodes is a difficult task, akin to the challenges and expenses of running a production data center coupled with the complexity of orchestrating bleeding edge software from multiple blockchains in an environment in which security is paramount. These challenges aren’t just faced by institutional capital, but also by retail or exchanges &amp; custodians seeking to provide staking services to their customers.</p><p>That is why <a href="https://www.kiln.fi/">Kiln</a> has built a full-stack “staking as a service” platform, allowing pools of capital to participate in PoS, through a platform that enables investors and builders to manage validators and read-write nodes on multi-cloud infrastructure in a simple, fast and secure way. Kiln allows customers to securely deploy, manage and monitor blockchain validators across several networks in a single space — while users continue to control their private keys. The company runs a SaaS model for its services, dashboard and APIs. Kiln has partnered with Ledger Live, Crypto.com and Coinbase to provide pooled staking services, allowing every ETH holder to access staking with any amount of ETH access to value creation in the digital assets ecosystem. Further, Coinbase Cloud has integrated Kiln’s On-Chain platform into its product offering allowing Coinbase Cloud to bring on-chain partial ETH staking capabilities to their clients, with limited engineering effort needed to integrate. Kiln runs validators on all major PoS blockchains, with over $3.6b of stake under management (up 4.4x y-o-y), running on a multi-cloud, multi-region infrastructure. Kiln also provides a validator-agnostic suite of products for fully automated deployment of validators, reporting and commission management, enabling custodians, wallets and exchanges to streamline staking operations across providers.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>As increasingly large pools of capital are deployed to crypto to meet PoS demand of chains, a company that facilitates and manages capital flows should be able to become a key fabric for the&nbsp;space.</p><p>We are excited to be investing in Kiln for the third time now, most recently joining its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221128005157/en/Kiln-Announces-%E2%82%AC17-Million-in-Funding-to-Expand-Staking-Offering">$17 million funding&nbsp;round</a>.</p>

<p>Following the recent listing of <a href="https://www.bitmart.com/en-US?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP on BitMart</a>, Panther's CEO, Oliver Gale, introduced Panther Protocol to BitMart's community. This post provides a summary of the conversation. Firstly, let's quickly revisit the BitMart:Panther partnership.</p> BitMart:Panther partnership <p>In December 2023, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitmart-lists-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">Panther Protocol's $ZKP was listed on BitMart</a>, a leading cryptocurrency exchange serving a global user base spanning 180 countries.</p><p>This partnership with BitMart and upcoming listings on other trusted exchanges are part of Panther commitment to make <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/token/tokenomics?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP more accessible</a> to the wider Web3 community.&nbsp;</p> Panther's value proposition <p>Oliver Gale, Co-founder and CEO of Panther, presented his vision of how Panther Protocol solves some of the pressing pain points that act as barriers to entry to both retail- and institutional-level investors in DeFi.</p><p>Oliver asserts that, for the decentralized Web to scale and attract more users, it must first overcome several significant challenges that crypto faces. He summarized these as four key issues:</p>  Exposed investment strategies: with the rise of blockchain analytics solutions such as Nansen, institutional investors are increasingly worried about exposed investment strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fragmented liquidity: the inability to leverage liquidity across multiple chains makes it difficult for institutions to buy and sell their preferred crypto without affecting the price.  Lack of transaction security: since June 2020, MEV bots have made at least $1 billion in profit across Ethereum, BSC, and Solana chains by exploiting transaction queues.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Compliance and privacy: existing privacy-focused DeFi products lack features to comply with AML/CTF requirements amid increased regulatory scrutiny.  <p>Oliver explained how Panther's privacy-preserving infrastructure for the decentralized Web, consisting of a shielded pool, cross-chain bridges, and ZK compliance tooling, solves these issues. This means that users can send, swap, and receive shielded assets through Panther while their on-chain privacy is being protected.</p> Panther Protocol: the product suite <p>Oliver gave BitMart's audience a run down on how Zones within Multi-Asset Shielded Pools (MASPs) empower users by providing a unified privacy set for all assets within a given smart contract environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther allows users to trade stablecoins, utility tokens, and NFTs within a single shielded pool, simplifying trading in a privacy-preserving environment. The innovation of Zones represents the first coherent solution to enable institutional access to DeFi, as they enable AML compliance, customization, and enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver expanded on how Panther Protocol’s rich feature set positions Panther as the go-to solution to onboard users to private DeFi in a privacy-preserving manner. Panther’s strong position is, in part, due to its integration with third-party on-chain compliance providers. This enables the protocol to authenticate users — solving for the KYC demands of regulators by offering users a unique set of credentials on completion of verification. This key innovation is that the user data is private thanks to zero-knowledge proofs generated directly within the user's browser. The credential provided allows the user to seamlessly integrate with blockchain-based DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and similar platforms.</p><p>Furthermore, due to the flexibility of its design, Panther users can access the protocol without being bound to a single compliance provider. Similarly, financial institutions can benefit from flexible zero-knowledge compliance tools or fully integrate their existing AML controls.</p> The current status of Panther <p>Oliver shared that Panther is currently deploying testnet versions of Panther Protocol in 9 Stages. Multiple protocol functionalities, such as intra-shielded pool transfers, DeFi swaps, and zTrade, are being tested during these stages. Through zTrade, users can conduct OTC transactions while enjoying unprecedented data privacy-preservation. More on Panther testnet stages <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> BitMark asks: What are you looking forward to? <p>Oliver, as always, enthused about the growing interest in privacy-preserving infrastructures. He feels that, thanks to the recent paper by prominent authors such as Vitalik examining <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Dark Pools</a>, this is a clear signal that the market is ready for such solutions. As he points out, Panther is a pioneer in the space — having been building for over 2 years, and is looking forward to releasing the V1 of the protocol once testnet rollouts are complete.</p> Want to get involved? <p>If you are interested in joining our community of testers, there is still time. Panther is rewarding engaged community members with $ZKP in return for battle-testing the testnet version of the product. Learn how to <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">get started</a> as a community tester.</p> About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

		<p><a href="https://www.horizen.io/wallets/spherebyhorizen/">Sphere by Horizen</a> is a desktop wallet created by the Horizen ecosystem team. It features both lite and full clients, offering wallet functionality that currently supports transparent and soon-to-be deprecated, shielded transactions. Sphere allows funds to be restored using a seed phrase and supports backward and forward transfers between Horizen’s mainchain and sidechains.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Sphere was able to send two different types of transactions: transparent transactions and shielded transactions:</p>
 
 Transparent Transactions: These are similar to Bitcoin transactions. The details of the transaction, including the sender’s and receiver’s addresses and the transaction amount, are visible on the blockchain. This transparency allows anyone to view and verify transactions, contributing to the network’s auditability. 
 Shielded Transactions: In contrast, shielded transactions offer enhanced privacy. They use advanced cryptographic techniques (like zk-SNARKs) to encrypt transaction information. This means the details of the transaction, including who sent or received the funds and the amount, are hidden from public view.&nbsp; 
 
 The Need for De-shielding 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">Horizen has announced that ZEN will be discontinuing support for shielded transactions with the release of Zen v5.0.0.</a> Consequently, Sphere, Horizen’s multifunctional app, will also cease supporting these types of transactions. To ensure the accessibility of their funds, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Who needs to De-shield their ZEN? 
<p>The upcoming changes to ZEN and Sphere necessitate action from all users who possess shielded addresses. If you have any ZEN in a shielded address, it’s crucial to de-shield these funds to avoid any loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine if you need to take any action:</p>
 
 If You’re Using Lite Mode: If you’ve only used the lite mode in Sphere and never switched to full mode, you don’t need to do anything, as shielded addresses are only available in full mode. Your funds are secure and no action is required on your part. 
 If You’re Using Full Mode: In full mode, look through your wallets. If you don’t see any addresses with a small shield icon next to them, you’re all set. No action is needed. 
 
<p>For any address with a shield icon, you should move (de-shield) these funds to a transparent address (one without a shield icon). This is important to ensure your funds remain accessible and secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another check is to look at the prefix of the address. Addresses start differently depending on the network and the type, so this also helps you identify your shielded addresses.</p>
<p>On mainnet:</p>
 
 “zn” for transparent address&nbsp; 
 “zc” for shielded address 
 “zs” (or rarely “zr” or “zt”) for multisig address 
 
<p>On testnet:</p>
 
 “zt” for transparent address&nbsp; 
 “zc” for shielded address 
 “zr” for multisig address 
 
 Step-by-step Guide to De-shielding Your ZEN 
 Prerequisites 
<p>As a reminder, de-shielding to an exchange deposit address is strongly discouraged. Before you begin de-shielding your shielded addresses in Sphere, it’s important to have at least one transparent address where you can transfer your funds. If you don’t already have a transparent address (any address without a shield icon next to its name, or that is not prefixed with “zc”), you’ll need to create one. Here’s how:</p>
 
 Open Sphere, login, and on the sidebar select one of your wallets. 
 Click on the “Add Address” button. 
 Give a name to the new address, and make sure that, if there’s any “Private” checkbox, it remains unchecked. 
 
<p></p>
<p>Once you have a transparent address, you can proceed with the de-shielding process for your shielded addresses.</p>
<p>You can get your new address by hovering over the information icon and clicking on the “copy” button that appears:</p>
<p></p>
 De-shielding Process 
<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to de-shielding your funds in Sphere by Horizen:</p>
 
 Open Sphere, login, and on the sidebar take a look at your wallets.&nbsp; 
 Select the wallet containing a shielded address. If you have multiple wallets with shielded addresses, you’ll need to repeat this process for each one. 
 Within each wallet, follow these steps for every shielded address:
 
 Select the shielded address you want to transfer the funds out of. 
 Click on the “Send” tab. 
 Enter a regular, transparent address that you own, where you wish to receive the funds. 
 Click on the “MAX” button to transfer all the funds from the shielded address. 
 Click the “Confirm” button and wait for the transaction to complete. 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>Once the transaction is successful, you have de-shielded your funds. Repeat this process for every shielded address in your wallets.</p>

<p>In the blockchain world, scalability is not just a technical issue but a crucial factor impacting user experience and the ability to build compelling applications. Traditional blockchains, while groundbreaking, have often been hampered by limited scalability, leading to congested networks, slow transaction times, and high costs. As teams have worked to solve these issues in the Ethereum ecosystem with layer 2 chains, the experience only continues to degrade with bridges, fragmented liquidity and unwieldy lists of networks users must maintain in their wallets. These issues significantly degrade the user experience, deterring widespread adoption.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://massa.net/">Massa</a>, a response to the critical scalability and user experience issues in blockchain technology. Its innovative multithreaded block graph architecture significantly boosts transaction capacity, effectively addressing the major pain points of network congestion and slow processing times. This approach not only enhances the system’s performance but, unlike the leading alternatives solving blockchain performance issues today, also upholds the essential principle of decentralization.</p><p>Massa goes beyond mere transactional efficiency and decentralization. Its autonomous smart contracts represent a leap in blockchain functionality, allowing contracts to operate independently based on predefined conditions. This reduces reliance on external triggers and opens new avenues for decentralized applications. Additionally, Massa’s on-chain web page storage marks a significant stride towards a truly decentralized web, ensuring secure, immutable, and censorship-resistant hosting of web&nbsp;content.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>We believe that Massa’s approach to scalability, without sacrificing decentralization, is pivotal for the next generation of blockchain applications. The platform’s ability to handle high transaction volumes with low fees is not just a technical success; it is a gateway to making blockchain technology accessible and practical for everyday use. Massa’s technology is not just an incremental improvement; it represents a leap forward in the blockchain space. By resolving the longstanding challenges of scalability and user experience, Massa opens the door to widespread adoption of blockchain technology.</p>

		  5.0.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of 5.0.0 to Mainnet later in January 2024.  Pre-release 5.0.0-rc1 will perform a network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1404200, on January 16th, 2024 at approximately 02:00 PM UTC.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP-42207</a> to fully remove the shielded pool from Horizen will be implemented with this release on Testnet:  All transactions involving shielded addresses will no longer be accepted at the consensus level once the hard fork activates.  RPC calls z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress have been partially disabled, so that it will be no longer possible to submit transactions involving shielded addresses (transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded and shielded-to-transparent) once the hard fork activates. Transparent-to-transparent transactions will still be accepted and submitted to the network.      Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated.  IMPORTANT: 5.0.0 will be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pools before then. Directly depositing funds from shielded addresses to exchange wallets is strongly discouraged.<br>  <p>See release notes <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/blob/release/5.0.0-rc1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.0.0-rc1.md">Here!</a></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

		<p>2023 was an incredible year of growth for the Horizen ecosystem! Lots of milestones were reached including:</p>  The mainnet launch of Horizen’s first EVM-compatible sidechain, EON&nbsp;  The launch of the Horizen DAO and pivot from Zen Blockchain Foundation (ZBF)&nbsp;  Passing two major ZenIPs (42204 &amp; 42206)  Onboarding new partners and projects into the Horizen ecosystem  <p>It’s an exciting time for the Horizen ecosystem and the team has hit the ground running in 2024! We will be sharing details on our 2024 proposed roadmap but before we get there, let’s dive into what happened in 2023!</p> 2023 Highlights <p></p> Community Growth <p>Discord</p><p>In 2023, we reached over 20,000 members of our Horizen Discord, a growth of over 5,000 users throughout the year. With the launch of Horizen EON and various growth campaigns on platforms like Galxe and Layer3, we have had new community members learning about the Horizen ecosystem and exploring the new integrations. We look forward to seeing more of this growth in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Discourse</p><p>In 2023 we established the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Horizen DAO Discourse forum</a>, to facilitate active community discussions around the Horizen Ecosystem. In 2023, activity on this platform increased as the broader community discussed ZenIPs, shared tutorials, explored content created by the Horizen Ambassadors, and more!&nbsp;</p><p>We encourage the Horizen community to join Discourse and engage with the rest of the community on the platform!</p> 2023 Highlights – Our Technology <p>In October of 2023, Horizen EON, our EVM-compatible sidechain went live on mainnet, marking a new milestone in the Horizen multi-chain ecosystem!&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the Horizen EON ecosystem has continued to grow, with additional partnerships, integrations, and tools launching on the platform. There has also been a significant influx of TVL and developer activity on Horizen EON.&nbsp;</p><p>The full range of dapps and partner integrations can be found on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/ecosystem">EON Ecosystem</a> page – let’s dive into a few of the major announcements. </p><p></p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-with-interport-finance/">Interport Finance Integration</a></p><p>At the beginning of December 2023, we announced an integration with Interport Finance, which brought cross-chain trading capabilities to Horizen EON! This integration not only boosts the efficiency and security of cross-chain transactions but also signifies a step towards a broader vision of a cohesive digital finance ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can operate fluidly across diverse blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/archon-bridge-is-live-on-horizen-eon/">Archon Bridge</a></p><p>Archon Bridge launched on Horizen EON in Q4 of 2023, bringing a new bridging protocol to the ecosystem. This protocol facilitates the transfer of various cryptocurrencies including ETH, WBTC, WZEN, USDT, USDC, DAI, and LINK, between the Horizen EON network and the Ethereum and Avalanche networks.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-with-layerzero-to-boost-trustless-cross-chain-communications/">LayerZero</a></p><p>Another innovation to enhance cross-chain communications on Horizen EON saw an integration with LayerZero go live, ensuring seamless and direct communication between various blockchains via arbitrary message bridging. This integration offers enhanced interoperability, allowing data, assets, and information to be transferred across blockchains without compromising on efficiency or security. Beyond just messaging, this integration signifies a broader vision of creating a unified digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/spookyswap-is-live-on-horizen-eon/">SpookySwap</a></p><p>Another exciting announcement for Horizen EON came in November 2023, when we announced an integration with SpookySwap! This helped bolster DeFi innovation, bringing a DEX multichain integration and yield farming to EON. USDC is tradable against ZEN and wZEN, with additional pairs being enabled once sufficient liquidity develops.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-ascent-exchange-with-simple-liquidity-opportunities-via-ichi-vault-to-boost-the-defi-ecosystem-on-eon/">Ascent Exchange</a></p><p>The DeFi ecosystem on Horizen EON was boosted with the integration of Ascent Exchange, supported by the automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, enabling simple yield opportunities for EON users. This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Ascent Exchange is the first decentralized exchange with ve(3,3) tokenomics on Horizen EON, marking a major milestone!</p><p><a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/service_providers/eon_native_stablecoin/">Stably/ZUSD</a></p><p>2023 marked the 1st native stablecoin to be launched on Horizen EON, ZUSD, which was made possible by our partnership with Stably! The collateral for ZUSD is held in liquid USD-denominated assets by a designated trustee for the benefit of verified ZUSD token holders. This ensures that each ZUSD token can be minted or redeemed at a 1-to-1 rate with USD or USDC by users who passed Stably’s KYC verification process.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/yuzu-finance-horizen-eon-unlocking-yield-opportunities-in-the-horizen-ecosystem/">Yuzu</a></p><p>Our last major partnership announcement of 2023 welcomed Yuzu Finance onto Horizen EON! This integration unlocked yield opportunities for the Horizen Ecosystem, including borrowing, lending, and yield farming (soon)! Yuzu is a non-custodial decentralized liquidity market protocol that enables users to deposit or borrow crypto assets securely. Depositors provide liquidity on Yuzu, while borrowers can take out overcollateralized or undercollateralized loans.</p> Horizen EON TVL &amp; Metrics <p>As of December 31st, 2023, Horizen EON had $3.08M in TVL (as tracked by <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Horizen%20EON">DefiLlama</a>), highlighting impressive ecosystem growth within the first few months of mainnet launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the mainnet launch of Horizen EON in October 2023, there have been over 900,000 total transactions across over 18,000 wallet addresses. There have also been 950+ contracts in total since Horizen EON went live on mainnet.</p> Launch of the Horizen DAO <p>In 2023 the Horizen ecosystem reached a key milestone in decentralized governance by launching the Horizen DAO! The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horizen DAO further decentralizes decision-making for technical, non-technical, and other substantive improvements to the system. $ZEN holders are the ultimate decision-makers for the future of Horizen and exercise governance over the network’s evolution through participating in the Horizen DAO. All $ZEN holders can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community. To facilitate effective community governance, users will also be able to delegate voting power to individuals they view as effective stewards of the Horizen ecosystem guiding values.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more about this in our <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">blog post</a>, as well as joining the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Horizen DAO Discourse!</a></p> ZenIPs (<a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42204.md">42204</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">42206</a>) <p>Building off of the launch of the Horizen DAO, 2023 saw two very important ZEN Improvement Proposals (ZenIPs) pass with overwhelming community support.&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42204.md">ZenIP 42204</a> – Deprecation of Shielded Pools  <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> – Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards into Horizen EON&nbsp;  <p>Let’s take a closer look at both.&nbsp;</p><p>ZenIP 42204</p><p>This ZEN Improvement Proposal proposed the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, preventing shielded transaction (t addresses to z addresses) support at the consensus level. The goal of ZenIP 42204 was to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risk. Regulatory threats are top of mind, they are not friendly towards privacy coins and that drove a lot of the ambition to propose ZenIP 42204, which passed with overwhelming community support. Additional information can be found <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">here.</a></p><p>ZenIP 42206</p><p>In August of 2023, ZenIP 42206 was proposed, to redirect the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund. This will help drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network. There is a strong need for forger nodes in EON to help enhance the security of the network, and for decentralization, which the current secure node reward can be put to better use by redirecting. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">Learn more here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Horizen Node Network <p></p> Horizen Ambassador Program <p>Throughout 2023, we were very proud to see all of the work accomplished by our amazing Horizen Ambassadors.

We launched EON, our EVM-compatible sidechain, which significantly helped Horizen’s journey into the contemporary Web3 world. That’s especially important because it allows Horizen Labs to leverage its relationships and bring more companies, developers, and brands directly into the Horizen ecosystem. We’ve been hard at work bringing best-in-class partners to EON, from oracles like Pyth and Band to DeFi protocols like Spooky, Yuzu, and Ascent to RPC providers such as Ankr and Tatum. We’ve built a strong relationship with LayerZero as well, which will lead to many exciting things happening within the ecosystem.</p><p>Meanwhile, the mainchain saw the introduction of forward and backward transfers, a technological feat that sometimes gets overlooked but is significant. How many UTXO-based tokens can be used on EVM chains? Beyond Bitcoin and ZEN, not many! We also saw the start of the deprecation of shielded pools and ZEN’s move away from being a privacy token.</p><p>Now, as we enter 2024 we’re gearing up for what should be the most exciting year in Horizen’s history. In the coming weeks and months, we’ll announce a slew of new partners, initiatives, and focus areas relating to the Horizen Ecosystem through a significant expansion and push on DeFi to RWA programs. We’re also working hard on expanding access to ZEN and directly to the EON ecosystem, along with making sure that EON can host a sustainable, consistently growing ecosystem as it moves forward.</p><p>And the vision of a New Horizen is on the docket too. I can’t wait to talk to you all about it and the modular future that Horizen and Horizen Labs will push forward together.”</p> Additional Links:&nbsp;   <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q1-2023-report/">Q1 2023 Report</a>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q2-2023-report/">Q2 2023 Report</a>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q3-2023-report/">Q3 2023 Report</a>

<p>Firstly, thank you to all our testers for your continued support and feedback: we could not do this without you. Testnet Stage 2 is now completed and it provided us with valuable insights resulting in several updates to the codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 3 of our testnet is live. Stage 3 enables users to use the newly allowlisted test Matic and test $ZKPs in Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.</p><p>On depositing $ZKP, users may divide their ZKP deposit holdings to store it as a zAsset ($zZKP) or as zAccount Gas (Gas $zZKP). The Gas $zZKP can be used to pay for Protocol fees, relayers, Oshiya, and any external services that enhance protocol services.</p><p>One of the key compliance requirements on the Panther roadmap is building different disclosure mechanisms. Stage 3 includes basic disclosures, which can be found under the History tab. We expect to improve the information within the History tab in future testnet stages.</p><p>This testnet stage comes with an enhanced circuit to improve KYT/KYC signer fields, overall protocol security through extended zAccount UTXO, and further improvements related to scaling and rewards. Supporting these updates required retrofitting previous stages and end-to-end testing, resulting in Stage 3 being released later than we initially planned. </p><p>For a complete list of Test Stages, visit the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.<br></p> Get started with Stage 3 testing <p><br>To start testing Stage 3, visit the<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Panther Protocol documentation</a> for the updated test link and follow the steps outlined below. Here are a few additional details to consider before you start testing:&nbsp;</p>  Previously created testnet accounts will need to be reactivated for Stage 3. The protocol will treat these as new accounts. To that effect, all prior testing Rewards (ZKP and ZKP equivalent of your PRPs) will be sent to your EOA (externally owned account) used for creating the account.  You can also create a brand new account and complete the KYC process to continue. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#gid=0">Here’s</a> a guide to creating your account.   After activating your zAccount, if you immediately go to the ‘Deposit’ or ‘Voucher’ etc. screen, you may see the action button with the status “Oshiya Processing/Syncing/Mining.” It may take a few minutes for the testnet to complete as it waits for Oshiya to process your account activation. The buttons will be active once that is done.  During the first interaction with the dApp, it downloads the ZK proof information in the background (close to 100MB). While this happens, you may see a status on your action button saying “ZK Proof downloading,” this needs to be completed before any user action can take place.   Onboarding rewards have been increased to 5000 PRPs to reflect that this stage retests the onboarding flow.  <p>Once you’ve created your new testnet account, follow these steps to make a deposit to your account:</p> Step 1: Initiate a deposit <p>Go to the Deposit screen by selecting any of the available options: </p>  Within the zAsset menu item, click on the Deposit button as shown in the screenshot below.  Within the My Public Asset section in the Dashboard, select the token; this takes the user to the Deposit screen.  The Private zAsset section; which also has the option to select and deposit  On zAsset Portfolio, click on the balance card.   Step 2: Select the token type <p>Select the token to deposit if it is not preselected, or adjust your selection via the token selection modal window.</p><p>NOTE: ZKP has its own dedicated deposit flow, which supports splitting a deposit amount between two zZKP subaccounts, zAsset and Gas. The Gas can be used to pay for relayer or verification services in a privacy-preserving way; with no direct interaction with a blockchain.</p> Step 3: Set up the deposit <p>3.1 Enter the amount to deposit.&nbsp;</p><p>3.2 Click the Deposit button and complete the transaction.</p><p>Congratulations, the deposit is complete!</p><p>You may now view the updated balance in your Dashboard, your Private zAssets section, and the adjusted balance of the deposited asset.</p><p>You can view your transaction history under the History tab.&nbsp;</p><p>This screen provides information about different types of transactions you performed within Panther, along with its transaction hash and the date/time of the transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks a significant advancement in the protocol's capabilities and gets us a step closer to our V1 release. As always, let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in Testnet Stage 3!&nbsp;</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs.

      Arvind Jain Pushes into AI-powered Productivity         
	By Zee Zakheim	 



Photography: Kelsey McClellan



Published January 10, 2024
        Glean solved enterprise search. Now it’s unlocking generative AI for the workplace.      



 
<p>Arvind Jain hunched over his desk, sifting through hundreds of employee surveys, searching for the answer to a problem. Rubrik, the cloud security company he had co-founded four years earlier in 2014, was one of the fastest-growing businesses in cloud data management. Since its launch, it had scaled from a handful of employees to almost a thousand. But a problem came to light in 2018: Productivity had stagnated. The company’s output wasn’t growing with its scale.</p>



<p>Jain pored over the results of the survey that had been commissioned, scouring for patterns. Was it talent? Not a chance. Company culture? Not according to the surveys. And then, a troubling insight: Employees reported spending hours of their time trying to find and piece together fragmented bits of information from across the 300 SaaS products Rubrik used in its internal operations—onboarding materials, meeting notes, support tickets, project archives and more. In their quest to find answers, they were stalled and sidetracked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rubrik’s problem, Jain realized, wasn’t Rubrik-specific, but universal: the seemingly impossible task of wrangling digital information from every facet of an enterprise. What if there was something like Google Search, but for the workplace? Jain began researching search engines for enterprises, but none could do what he imagined. “I spoke with other CEOs to see if they had solutions I’d missed,” Jain says. “Their response was, ‘If you find something like that, let us know.’”</p>



<blockquote>

<p>Search engines are notoriously difficult to build—they require crawlers sophisticated enough to index data in a multitude of formats in real time and algorithms smart enough to sort and rank that data with precision for any given search. What Jain was considering developing would be even more complicated, as every search would need to be personalized for every employee based on their degree of access to a company’s data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, this provocation became the springboard for Jain’s next startup: an AI-powered search engine for enterprises called <a href="https://www.glean.com/">Glean</a>. As it happened, Jain was the perfect person for the job.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>In 2003, hundreds of employees unpacked boxes and settled into office space in Mountain View, California. Google had officially signed its new lease in the heart of Silicon Valley, taking over the former Silicon Graphics campus. While the new digs were reflective of Google’s success, the company was also at a crossroads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its launch in 1998, Google had gained a loyal following of users. But as the internet evolved—growing rapidly in size and shifting from rudimentary websites to include pages that were more complicated and nonstandard—Google Search wasn’t able to keep up with the velocity of new data. Meanwhile, alternative search providers were closing in, the most competitive of which was Yahoo. “Google and Yahoo were locked in a battle for the most sophisticated, comprehensive web indices,” says Bill Coughran, a Sequoia partner who was then SVP of engineering at Google.</p>



<p>Coughran gathered the web crawler team and told them they needed a new system design. It would have to be able to respond to diverse and rapidly changing data, and do it at scale. The timeline for the new system? As soon as possible.</p>



<p>Arvind Jain, a recent hire then in his late 20s, was one of the leaders of what became the new effort. Over the next few weeks, Jain and his colleagues spent days analyzing Google’s search engine. Eventually, they approached Coughran with an idea for the new design.<br>“What was interesting about their vision is that it took advantage of the basic primitives Google’s web crawler already had in place and built on top of those,” Coughran says. “The design showed a system that could index not just websites, but dozens of file types from HTML to PDF, including PowerPoint, Flash, PostScript and JavaScript. And, as the web continued to scale, it could operate more and more instances of itself and do more and more work.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“My experience with Arvind, certainly at the time and since, is that he’s meticulous and thoughtful about how he does things.”</p>
Bill Coughran</blockquote>



<p>Some senior executives, however, viewed the proposed framework with skepticism. “They looked at the design and just didn’t believe it would work,” Coughran says. But he was convinced. “My experience with Arvind, certainly at the time and since, is that he’s meticulous and thoughtful about how he does things.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain and his colleagues spent a year building out the system, which launched in the fall of 2004. In November of that year, Coughran published a blog post on the Google website with the headline “Google’s Index Nearly Doubles.” He says, “It could inhale hundreds of gigabytes of traffic at a given time and it could do it quickly, so when you searched something, you weren’t getting stale information. It was a difficult undertaking, but it worked. They pulled it off.”</p>
 







 
<p>The thoughtful meticulousness Coughran observed in Jain grew out of an introspective childhood in Jaipur, a tourist destination in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. “My father always encouraged me to be confident,” Jain says. “To look people in the eye and talk to them, but extroversion wasn’t something that came naturally to me.” Instead, Jain took after his mother, who exuded a quiet confidence and had an ability to defuse conflict with calm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain became fascinated with computers after his older brother introduced a PC—loaded with Pac-Man—to the family home. Jain delighted in the game, but even more so in the idea that coding had real-world applications, for video games or otherwise. Jain decided to pursue computer science in earnest, placing into an advanced high school track and then gaining admission to the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. After graduating, Jain set his sights on the U.S. Following a stint at Microsoft, the allure of Silicon Valley beckoned, and Jain cut his teeth in the startup world at Akamai and Riverbed before joining Google.</p>



 



<p>“I’m not an entrepreneur,” Jain said. It was 2013 and he sat across from Bipul Sinha, an engineer who had an idea for a cloud security company and wanted Jain as its technical co-founder. Jain was taken aback. “I was like, ‘Of all your contacts, why me?’” he says. Sinha explained that, more than anyone else, he believed in Jain to build a product from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the years since arriving at Google and working on Google Search, Jain had left his mark on a series of other projects. He had helped engineer YouTube’s video serving system—which pulled up videos related to a user’s search, but also recommended content based on their browsing history. Jain had also worked on the search functions for Google Maps, which were more technically ambitious by far than Google Search and YouTube. “Maps’ data is the most chaotic,” Coughran says. “You’re dealing with ever-changing, wildly inconsistent data, coming from many disparate sources—public records, land developers, people taking photos, enterprises submitting information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Jain, Maps was rewarding, not just because it challenged him as an engineer, but because of the app’s real-life, societal impact. “Maps changed the way people understood and navigated the world around them,” Jain says. He loved seeing couples on the street pull up Maps to direct them to a restaurant, or a family open the app to walk to a relative’s house. The Maps team was also deep in the weeds documenting places that weren’t previously mapped, including small towns in rural areas of India. “Making these places accessible and seeing the impact of that was just amazing,” Jain says. “It was very meaningful to me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain’s contentment with his work at Google was one reason he wasn’t sure about founding a company with Sinha. The other reason was philosophical. “I always thought that people became entrepreneurs when they encountered a problem that nagged at them and that nobody else wanted to solve or knew how to solve, but them,” Jain says.</p>



<p>Despite these reservations, Sinha was convincing—he would build the business while Jain built the product. He won Jain over, and in 2014, they launched Rubrik. Four years later, Jain would encounter a problem that nagged him. One that nobody else wanted or knew how to solve, but him.</p>

<p>Sitting at his desk in the Rubrik headquarters in 2018, reviewing his employees’ notes on the challenges of finding information within the company, Jain thought to himself, “Data should not be the reason why you fail. It should be the reason you succeed.”</p>



<p>Jain convinced co-founders T.R. Vishwanath, Piyush Prahladka and Tony Gentilcore to tackle the project with him. They built Glean, which officially launched in 2019, to solve what Jain believes to be the most urgent problem in today’s workplace: that it’s often easier to find answers in the vast expanse of the internet than it is within a single organization. “Even when I was at Google, we could never find anything internally,” Jain says. “Anything you wanted externally was available instantly via Google Search, but internally—it was impossible.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Even when I was at Google, we could never find anything internally. Anything you wanted externally was available instantly via Google Search, but internally—it was impossible.”&nbsp;</p>
arvind jain</blockquote>



<p>Even with Google Search, YouTube and Maps’ search engines under his belt, Jain knew building Glean wouldn’t be easy. The difficulty of creating a search engine for an enterprise is that, unlike the information in a general-purpose internet search engine, “company data doesn’t live in readily organized forms,” Jain says. “Information can be fleetingly exchanged over one communication suite, like Slack or Google Chat, but not formalized in another. And it’s not just that data is spread across a range of SaaS tools—each individual has their own level of access to those systems. The CEO has access to different data than someone in research and development who has access to different data than someone in human resources.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain assembled a team of engineers to help him bring Glean to life, many who had worked with him at Google, others who were familiar with his reputation as one of the best search engineers in Silicon Valley. The company described its initial product, launched in 2021, as a “work assistant with intuition,” modeled on a Google-like search engine. It worked by transforming the entirety of a company’s data, in all its various forms, into nodes on a knowledge graph. And it was able to do this in under two hours, meaning it was Google-fast and required minimal onboarding time. Glean then used state-of-the-art natural language processing and deep learning to deliver individualized search results. “AI was always core to our product,” Jain says. “But in the last year, the shift in the capabilities of AI models—it’s changed everything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the spring of 2023, Glean announced it was incorporating generative AI into its product. “If Glean’s user interface started out with a feel similar to Google Search, now it’s more like Google plus ChatGPT,” Jain says. “Glean is no longer just surfacing information, it’s taking that information, consuming it and then performing a task. For example, if an employee were to ask Glean to provide a list of the company’s top 10 customers who are likely to churn, our engine can actually go and hunt through information in your enterprise corpus, figure out what makes it likely for a customer to churn, go to your metrics dashboard, look at whether those metrics are looking bad for certain businesses and actually give that answer back to you.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Glean spent years perfecting the algorithms to get corporate knowledge into algorithms for search and has now arrived in the right place at the right time for generative AI.”</p>
Sonya Huang</blockquote>



<p>The integration of enterprise search capabilities with generative AI has become Glean’s superpower. “CIOs and knowledge workers have been waiting for an enterprise AI product that is workplace-knowledge-aware,” says Sonya Huang, a partner at Sequoia who serves on Glean’s board. “Glean spent years perfecting the algorithms to get corporate knowledge into algorithms for search and has now arrived in the right place at the right time for generative AI.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Jain, the challenge of Glean wasn’t only in developing its product, but in growing into the role of CEO and leading an entire company. Jain rose to the occasion by drawing on the traits of his parents: his father’s confidence and practice of reaching out to others, and his mother’s approach to conflict, which prioritizes listening and never saying “I told you so.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today Glean serves over 200 enterprises, some with hundreds of employees, others with hundreds of thousands, saving them hundreds of hours of work per month and millions of dollars per year. “Similar to how Google Maps changed our navigation of the world, soon, Glean will alter the way we work, period,” Jain says. He envisions that one day, every employee who uses Glean will have a “work double,” essentially a digital assistant who can perform tasks and track every project, every communication and every piece of company knowledge. It’s a world in which employees aren’t impeded by the challenges of locating information, but empowered by data to tackle their next challenge—maybe even the thing that won’t stop nagging them.</p>

<p>What began as an AI company trying to seek solutions in order to pay remote (unbanked) workers, Near AI became, in 2018, Near Protocol. Its sharded design was inspired by modern database architecture and large language model (LLM) training. Near Protocol aimed to solve the scalability trilemma, through a modular approach, combining data availability sharding with stateless validation. By abstracting away archaic blockchain standards, Near basically enabled decentralised full stack development and, in terms of UX, a distributed custodial solution via chain abstraction and account aggregation.</p><p>We were joined by Illia Poloshukhin, co-founder of Near Protocol, to discuss Near’s journey, from AI company to high-throughput L1 blockchain, and how LLM training influenced the modular design choice.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Illia’s background in AI &amp; ML  Scaling large language models (LLMs) and the role of attention  Stochastic Parrot vs. Understanding spectrum  From Near AI to Near Protocol and the role of LLMs  How Near abstracted the blockchain away and enabled decentralised full stack development  Defining ecosystem standards to improve UX  Chain abstraction, account aggregation and interoperability  Chain threshold signature  Near’s intent layer  Near’s modularity, Nightshade sharding &amp; stateless validation  EigenLayer integration  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon">Illia Polosukhin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/NEARProtocol">Near Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

		<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42207-draft/zenip-42207.md">ZenIP 42207 </a>for the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain was submitted on January 4th, 2024, opened for Community voting on January 8th, with voting closing on January 11th, resulting in 99.97% vote share “for”. Here’s what it means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ZenIP proposed the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain, achieving a wide range of various goals. This change builds upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP-42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Complete Disabling of Shielded Transactions: All functionalities related to the shielded transactions (z-addresses) will be completely deactivated, preventing any type of transaction related to the shielded pool. 
 Removal of Related RPC Calls: RPC calls specifically related to shielded transactions, such as z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress, will be deprecated. 
 Migration Path for Users: A migration path with the necessary tools and guides will be provided to users to move their assets out of the shielded pool before the hard fork. Community support and detailed documentation will be available to facilitate this transition. 
 Network Upgrade: The deactivation of the shielded pool will occur through a network upgrade at a specified block height (TBD). Extensive testing, community preparation, and communication will precede this upgrade. 
 Communication and Timeline:&nbsp;Representatives of the Horizen ecosystem will communicate regularly with the community about the timeline, necessary user actions, and available support resources throughout the transition process. 
 
<p>IMPORTANT: ZEN 5.0.0 is expected to be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will not be possible to send any shielded transactions, including transactions to de-shield coins from shielded to transparent addresses.</p>
<p>ZenIP 42207 goes further than the hard fork originally announced with ZEN 4.2.0-rc1, ZEN 5.0.0 will completely remove the shielded pool. We strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 2024. After February 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. &nbsp;Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged. Failure to remove ZEN from shielded pools prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your ZEN.</p>
 Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Horizen has always believed our community comes first, we encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> around ZenIP 42207 and voice your thoughts. We highly encourage you to read the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42207-draft/zenip-42207.md">full ZenIP on GitHub</a> to get a complete understanding of what this means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42207 started on January 8th, 2024, 5pm UTC and ended on January 11th, 2024, 5pm UTC. The Horizen DAO voting is done on Horizen EON, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. At the same time that the voting began, the snapshot was also taken. <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">You can view the results of the vote here on Snapshot.&nbsp;</a></p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Vote – Instructions 
 
 Go to the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen DAO Governance page</a> on the Horizen EON web app to get started. 
 Connect your web3 wallet (ex. MetaMask). <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">Please follow this guide if you need help</a>. 
 Link your Horizen mainchain $ZEN address to Horizen EON. In order to vote with your mainchain $ZEN, you need to have $ZEN on a <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere</a> mainchain address and link that address to your MetaMask Horizen EON chain address. You only need to link your <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere wallet</a> once. You can use the same wallet for future voting rounds.&nbsp;
 
 Please see <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">this guide for step-by-step instructions </a>on linking Horizen Mainchain and Horizen EON $ZEN Addresses to aggregate your voting power.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Make sure you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask address for the gas fee. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFsjT069v7E">this tutorial</a> to learn how to transfer ZEN from Horizen mainchain to your Horizen EON address on MetaMask 
 Once your mainchain ZEN address is connected to Horizen EON, and you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask for gas fee, it’s time to vote using Snapshot! 
 Join the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Horizen Foundation space</a> on Snapshot if you haven’t done so, to receive notifications about future ZenIP voting.&nbsp; 
 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>     
 

 
	     
		 ZenIP 42207 Voting Results 
<p>The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP 42207</a> voting period ended on January 11th, 2024, at 5pm UTC, and passed with 99.97% of votes “for”, with .03% of votes “against.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to thank the community for their engagement on this new ZenIP. The voting participation marks a new step in the progress of the Horizen DAO and we are glad to see that our community is involved in the project’s decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The successfully passed ZenIP 42207 enables the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain, achieving a wide range of various goals. This change builds upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by ZenIP 42204 and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next step is to unshield your ZEN on private addresses. We strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 2024. After February 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>Failure to remove ZEN from shielded pools prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your ZEN.</p>

      AI in 2024: From Big Bang to Primordial Soup         
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 





Published January 3, 2024
        2023 was a frenzied year in AI. 2024 will be a year of exploration and discovery.      



 
<p>Over the Christmas holiday, I had time to reflect on 2023 and the whirlwind year we had in AI. </p>



<p>The “Big Bang” of ChatGPT in late 2022 unleashed a fervor and, ultimately, a feeding frenzy in 2023. Not only was AI the #1 story in Silicon Valley, but it became a hot topic in every corporate boardroom, in the media and even in Washington, DC. AI drove public market stock performance too.</p>



<p>For a technology so nascent and still with low usage, as we covered in <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-act-two/">Generative AI’s Act Two</a>, the feeding frenzy of 2023 had a key weakness. It was an assumption that the hard problems in AI had been solved, and therefore it’s a foregone conclusion that AI will become ubiquitous and powerful.</p>



<p>This fallacy is understandable. It is human nature to avoid ambiguity because humans desire certainty. The idea that AI is the “end of history”—and that we’re within sight of that—appeals to this instinct. This is an easier idea to hold in our minds than the reality we are living in: We are in the primordial soup phase of AI. There is much potential in the air, and yet it is still amorphous. Vision is required to convert it into something real, tangible and, ultimately, impactful.</p>



<p>In Silicon Valley, the frenzy of 2023 was productive in attracting talent to AI. But it was also unproductive in the type of company formation it drove and the psychology it induced. Specifically, it led to implementation-oriented thinking vs. vision-oriented thinking. If you believe that the hard problems have already been solved, it changes the nature of the company that you build. Instead of building deep-benched teams that are eager to face down new, unsolved problems, you build shallower organizations.</p>



<p>As a result, you had themes in AI with five or six new companies being formed, each with one or two great technologists and a very similar objective. One of the biggest challenges for startups in 2023 was convincing talent to join their companies—everyone wanted to start an AI company of their own.</p>



<p>In 2024, we need to look farther out and build companies that are fundamentally architected for the murky reality of AI. When we realize that we are in the primordial soup phase, we begin to think not about how we can win the race, but about how we can invent new things. And we realize that we need to join forces to do that. By focusing on impact, we can assemble teams capable of taking on demanding challenges and surmounting them.</p>



<p>I want to draw an explicit contrast to SaaS. SaaS was an evolution from on-premise, license-based software to cloud. AI is a revolution, where we are building new intelligence for the first time. There is no precedent, so we don’t even know what problems are worth solving. Fundamental innovation is going to be exceptionally important.</p>



<p>The primordial soup phase will give rise to visionary founders. I believe we will see more visionary thinking emerge in 2024. In times of murkiness and uncertainty, vision is required to see through the fog and understand what needs to exist on the other side. Vision is also necessary to attract a team capable of getting there.</p>



<p>We are going to move away from “AI for X” toward customer-centric companies. The goal of solving deep societal problems by building hard technology will reshape the culture of these companies, how they are built and the type of talent they attract. We will see innovation in the company formation process itself—the AI research labs are one expression of that creativity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2024, we will build from the substrate of Transformers, GPUs, RAG, Diffusers, open source and everything else that has been floating around the ecosystem in 2023. From these primitives, we will discover new ideas and new insights about how to build advanced AI systems. We will look back at 2024 and say, this is the year that we began to convert AI’s potential into real solutions.</p>



<p>At a conference in September, I heard Jakub Uszkoreit, one of the inventors of the Transformer, say he thought we had prematurely jumped from the exploration phase of AI to exploitation. 2024 will be a reset year, where those focused on quick and easy exploitation of this technology lose steam, and founders who are driving deep exploration toward value creation will pull ahead.</p>



<p>Here’s to a year of turning this primordial soup into impactful products and companies. And here’s to the daring founders who will build them.</p>



<p>If you are building a visionary company in this primordial soup, I’d love to hear from you. Please reach out at <a href="mailto:dcahn@sequoiacap.com">dcahn@sequoiacap.com</a></p>

<p>For Nym, 2024 will be the year that ordinary people all over the world start using Nym to have private access to the internet to enable freedom of communication. Our resolutions are&nbsp;to:</p>  Get NymVPN working on every operating system to onboard thousands of ordinary users, increasing the traffic through the network, and thus the anonymity of users and the revenues of the Nym community via transaction fees — in short, making the entire Nym project financially sustainable.  Integrate against every major zero-knowledge blockchain that wants to deliver real privacy to their users via our new Rust and Typescript SDKs.  <p>One of the open secrets of the blockchain industry is that there are almost no actual people using blockchain tech for anything except for stablecoin transfers or trading, with many projects living off inflation before collapsing. And so, most blockchains are ghost-towns that don’t have anything resembling real-world usage outside DeFi and NFTs. What makes Nym different?</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8B-nym-%D0%BD%D0%B0-2024-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4-5a812108dc75">Русский</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/resolusi-tahun-baru-2024-nym-d865645eb486">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/nb640cb84badd">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/prop%C3%B3sitos-de-a%C3%B1o-nuevo-de-nym-para-2024-8558fe4f6bd9">Español</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nymin-2024-planlar%C4%B1-9bbeff41e0d5">Türkçe</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/nym%E7%9A%84-2024-%E5%B9%B4%E6%96%B0%E5%B9%B4%E6%84%BF%E6%9C%9B-201661f3ae5c">中文</a></p><p>Nym has one of the few use-cases that actually have a chance at getting massive real-world adoption outside of cryptocurrency: replacing VPNs — which are almost entirely based on false promises — with something that actually works to preserve the security and privacy of end-users. Rather than aim just for a larger share of the tens of thousands of blockchain developers or the millions of cryptocurrency users, we at Nym are serious about our mission to enable privacy for all humanity: we’re aiming at the billion people that use VPNs&nbsp;today.</p><p>As the world continues to descend into geopolitical chaos with wars in Europe and the Middle East — and likely an economic war between the US and China over the next few years — the only guaranteed outcome is that internet surveillance and censorship will increase for everyone. The restrictions that we see now in Iran and China will soon spread to America and Europe under the banner of fighting “misinformation” and “fake news.” As we stated in 2019 in our <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym_litepaper.pdf">litepaper</a>, surveillance is ultimately about mind control. Against this rising tide of repression, Nym is the only solution out there that can give a person protection against global passive adversaries such as nation-state intelligence agencies that can watch an entire internet connection. Unlike traditional VPNs, thanks to blockchain-based decentralization, in 2024 Nym will also focus on validators and gateways so that the network is resistant to being taken out by powerful malicious actors.</p><p>Nym needs an easy way for ordinary people to use it, and that’s why we created NymVPN. In 2023 we launched <a href="https://nymvpn.com/">NymVPN</a> for testing at <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-returns-to-chaos-communications-congress-a2a08194a487">Chaos Computer Congress</a>, the world’s largest hacker conference, the same conference where we launched the first version of the mixnet for testing in 2019! Under the leadership of Marc Debizet, the plan for NymVPN is to make it available on every operating system, including mobile operating systems. In 2024, the focus will be on enabling every one of our hundreds of mix nodes to also serve as a gateway for open internet access, allowing unparalleled access across different jurisdictions for Nym users. The ability to have zero-knowledge proofs to access for privacy-enhanced payment to be turned on for&nbsp;NymVPN.</p><p>The wheel will then start turning: as people start using Nym, with payments being activated and transformed to NYM tokens on the backend, the entire ecosystem will become financially sustainable by receiving real transaction fees, something that only a handful of blockchains have achieved so far. Of course, we don’t know how many people actually want even a truly private communication tool, much less how much they will pay. In 2024, we’ll find out. In order to make privacy a reality in 2024, we will need thousands of NymVPN&nbsp;users.</p><p>And NymVPN isn’t the only way we’ll get users. Thanks to the Nym Innovation Fund and our new Head of Partnerships Ade Molajo, Nym is ready to integrate against any application, and blockchain. Autonomous verifiable anonymous computing is revolutionary technology, and every blockchain that uses zero-knowledge proofs should integrate Nym as an anonymous channel, as otherwise there will be no privacy. We’ve started this year with Liquid, Aztec, Firo, Monero, and are now in discussions with many L2s. In 2024, another goal is privacy by default over every zero-knowledge blockchain.</p> Looking back on&nbsp;2023 <p>Looking back, 2023 was a year of getting Nym ready for usage. While the mixnet was working via a SOCKS5 proxy even back in 2021 before the token launch, it was not easy to integrate against by programmers and required ordinary people to cut and paste obscure looking “localhost” IP addresses in even more obscure windows in their programs like Telegram and Electrum Bitcoin wallets. Led by Mark Sinclair and the new integrations team, the major focus of 2023 was making it possible for developers to integrate against the Nym mixnet by releasing a Rust API and Typescript APIs, including the wonderful mixFetch that makes integrating against Nym as simple as cut-paste for web applications.</p><p>The year closed with <a href="https://nymtech.net/learn/shipyard">Nym Shipyard</a>, a six-week intensive privacy academy training the next generation of Nym operators, builders and community visionaries. The academy enabled the community to get much more organized, forming “squads” that operate mix nodes across the world (especially in LatAm, Russia, Ukraine). Some squads use their rewards to support local hackerspaces and community organizations, others use the rewards to start building apps on the mixnet. This budding, professional operator community is essential for Nym as the industry’s network privacy DePIN. They form the decentralized underpinning for not just NymVPN but any application.</p><p>In 2024, Nym will continue with our general principles:</p>  Nym will put the user first. This includes the user experience of the NymVPN as well as all our users of Nym operator binaries, the Nym SDK and people using the NYM token to bond and delegate.  Nym will be community driven. The Nym global community — across 80 countries! — are increasingly our experts on the mixnet and token economics as it operates in the real world. We resolve to have close collaboration and quarterly town halls to enable rapid iteration and improvements on software and token economics as the NymVPN goes to&nbsp;market.  Nym will continue to leverage the latest technological breakthroughs to enable ordinary people’s privacy. Starting with rolling out zk-nyms for the NymVPN to prevent leakage of data when paying for services. The focus will then shift to enabling censorship resistance and post-quantum cryptography with leading academic experts in the&nbsp;field.  <p>As a team, we’ve transformed from a small startup to over fifty people working full-time on Nym, hundreds of mix nodes, and a global community of thousands across different languages and cultures. As the old world of nation-states and the traditional monetary system teeters on collapse, our mission of enabling privacy is critical for the survival of humanity more than ever. Without privacy, there can be no communication. Without communication, humanity cannot empower our collective intelligence to create a new world. It’s our only way out to escape the soul-crushing despair of war, surveillance, bureaucracy, and&nbsp;poverty.</p><p>Being able to communicate freely is the first step, but it’s simply too hard for people. For too long, truly private communication has been the province of only an aristocracy of technically-adept hackers, and it’s our turn to bring — as we promised at the Web 3.0 conference in 2020 — power to the people. In 2024, Nym is taking privacy out of the underground, opening a tunnel from this world to the next.

 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The results of the ZCG election are as follows: </p>



 
 Jason McGee – 111 votes 



 Michael Harms – 96 votes 



 Amber O’Hearn – 89 votes 



 Roosevelt Gordones – 69 votes 



 Kworks – 45 votes 
 



<p></p>



<p>Congratulations to Jason, Michael and Amber, who are duly reappointed to the ZCG Committee. Thank you also to Roosevelt and Kworks for volunteering to serve the Zcash community. </p>



 ​​Funding ZCG Committee Members’ Stipend 



<p>The poll respondents voted in favour of amending ZIP 1014 to provide a stipend of $115 USD per hour (up to a monthly maximum of $1,725 USD) to be paid in ZEC to ZCG Committee members from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, with 99 votes in favour versus 39 against. </p>



<p>We will therefore draft an appropriate amendment to ZIP 1014. </p>



 Assessing Community Sentiment Regarding the Future of Zcash Ecosystem Funding 



<p>To help obtain more clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem, we put the following question to ZCAP: In principle, would you support the introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>111 respondents voted Yes, and 27 respondents voted No. </p>



<p>We look forward to seeing further discussion and proposals from the community in the coming weeks about what form a new funding mechanism might take. </p>

<p></p>



<p>Through techniques like ZK rollups, multiple transactions are bundled into a single proof, streamlining the verification process. This compact form of verification reduces computational requirements and enhances the network’s overall scalability. By processing larger volumes of transactions more efficiently, zero-knowledge proofs boost blockchain network throughput without compromising security or decentralisation. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic tools that work like magic tricks, allowing one party to prove they know something without revealing the actual details. They maintain confidentiality while confirming specific information and have a key role in web3. This article will explain what they are, how they work, their use cases in web3, and take a deep dive into how zero-knowledge proofs improve blockchain scalability.</p>



<p></p>



 What are zero-knowledge proofs? 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs, often referred to as ZKPs, are a clever way to prove something without revealing any details about it. Imagine being able to show you know a secret password without actually saying what the password is. That’s the magic of ZKPs – they allow one party to confirm they have certain information without giving away the information itself.</p>



<p>In every zero-knowledge proof, there’s a prover and a verifier. The prover wants to show the verifier that they know something without disclosing what it is. They do this by demonstrating knowledge of some facts that only the rightful owner of the information would know. It’s like solving a puzzle without showing the solution.</p>



<p>They can be used for a variety of purposes. Still, their main applications include improving data security, scalability, and privacy in blockchain transactions, safeguarding sensitive information in industries like healthcare and finance, and enabling secure authentication without unnecessary exposure of personal details.</p>



<p></p>



 How zero-knowledge proofs work (in simple terms) 



<p>While relatively simple at the surface, understanding the intricacies of zero-knowledge proofs can be complex. To explain how they work we will use a simple analogy:</p>



<p>A scientist claims to have discovered a complex mathematical proof for a groundbreaking theory. Verifying this proof conventionally requires extensive computational resources and time. Alternatively, using a zero-knowledge proof, the scientist can demonstrate the proof’s validity without divulging the entire process, significantly reducing the time needed for verification while ensuring the credibility of the discovery.</p>



<p>In essence, the zero-knowledge proof is a distilled version of the proof containing only the details necessary to prove its validity. When using zero-knowledge proofs in blockchain for improved scalability and privacy it works in similar ways. To explain how this works, consider the following scenario:<br><br>A validator has verified and put together a block of transactions that produces a certain hash value. To verify this hash (and thus the transactions inside the block), someone could verify this hash by following the exact same energy- and time-consuming process of recreating this block. However, another option would be for the validator to provide a succinct zero-knowledge proof to make it easy to verify the validity of this block without revealing the details. This proof is called a Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument, widely known as a ZK-SNARK.</p>



<p>Similar to the mathematical proof example, the validity of a statement can be verified quickly without revealing the underlying details of the statement.</p>



<p></p>



 Use cases of zero-knowledge proofs in Web3 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs have a variety of use cases within the web3 space, with some of the main ones being:</p>



 
 Enhancing privacy 



 Improving scalability 



 Enabling regulatory compliance 



 Secure authentication&nbsp; 
 



<p>Let’s look at each of these in more detail and how methods using zero-knowledge proofs differ from traditional methods.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can enhance privacy within web3 by concealing transaction details, such as sender addresses, transaction amounts, and contract terms. Unlike traditional blockchain transactions that are transparent and visible to all, zero-knowledge proofs enable confidential transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This heightened level of confidentiality ensures that sensitive data remains protected within decentralised systems. Moreover, zero-knowledge proofs facilitate private interactions, allowing users to engage in transactions and collaborations while maintaining their privacy. This advantage is particularly beneficial in business environments where discretion and confidentiality are paramount.</p>



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs surpass traditional methods by offering a higher level of confidentiality. By concealing transaction details and protecting sensitive data within decentralised systems, zero-knowledge proofs address concerns related to data breaches and unauthorised access. Additionally, their ability to enable private interactions ensures that users can engage securely in web3 environments without compromising their privacy. Another thing that sets them apart from existing privacy solutions is their ability to offer increased privacy with similar levels of security as their non-private counterparts.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for greater scalability 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are increasingly used in layer 2 scaling solutions as well as modern blockchain protocols for their ability to improve blockchain scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They achieve this by optimising data processing and reducing blockchain congestion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared to traditional methods, zero-knowledge proofs offer an optimised approach to data processing, reducing computational overhead and enhancing efficiency. This streamlined verification process improves scalability by enabling the processing of larger transaction volumes without congesting the blockchain network.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for better regulatory compliance 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can be useful in ensuring compliance with data regulations. They provide a more secure way to handle user data while keeping it private. By hiding sensitive bits, zero-knowledge proofs balance showing what’s needed and keeping things secret. This helps decentralised systems follow the rules without giving away personal details. They check data without revealing everything, keeping user info safe from breaches and hacks which happen regularly.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, zero-knowledge proofs are a clever way to aid in sticking to complex privacy rules while still being open. They make sure user data stays safe in decentralised systems, meeting rules and keeping trust and privacy intact in the web3 world.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for secure authentication 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs offer a secure method for verifying identities or approving actions without revealing unnecessary personal information. They function by allowing individuals to prove specific credentials without disclosing the exact details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In scenarios where secure interactions are vital, like proving age without revealing the birthdate or approving a transaction without disclosing account specifics, zero-knowledge proofs enable individuals to authenticate themselves or authorise actions while keeping sensitive information private. Amid B2B collaborations, where confidentiality is paramount, zero-knowledge proofs ensure secure interactions by permitting verifications without unnecessary exposure of private details, establishing trust without compromising confidentiality.</p>



<p>Overall, they serve as a discreet way for parties to validate identities or approve transactions securely. They enable necessary verifications while protecting sensitive information, and ensuring trusted and confidential interactions, particularly vital in B2B environments where secure collaborations rely on maintaining confidentiality.</p>



<p></p>



 Deep dive: Blockchain scalability with ZK Rollups 



<p>Let’s take a deeper dive into one of the most prominent applications of zero-knowledge proofs in web3. Scalability is a challenge as old as blockchain, and with an ever-increasing adoption of blockchain technology, there is also a constant need for increased scalability. ZK Rollups emerged as a potential solution for this challenge.</p>



<p></p>



 How ZK Rollups work 



<p>ZK Rollups function by grouping multiple user transactions off-chain and then submitting these bundled transactions as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Alongside this batched transaction, a succinct proof, derived from zero-knowledge proofs, is added to validate the correctness of these bundled transactions. To be specific, a ZK rollup follows these steps:</p>



 
 Transaction bundling: Initially, numerous individual user transactions occur off-chain, which are grouped or bundled together into a single package. 
 



 
 On-chain submission: This bundled package is then submitted as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Rather than posting each transaction separately on the main chain, ZK Rollups compress these transactions into a single entry. 
 



 
 Accompanying zero-knowledge proof: Alongside this single transaction, a concise proof is included. This proof is derived using zero-knowledge techniques, ensuring that it confirms the validity of all the transactions within the bundle without disclosing the specific details of each individual transaction. 
 



 
 Verification process: On the main chain, validators or smart contracts verify this bundled transaction using the accompanying proof. The proof allows for a swift verification process without unravelling the details of each transaction within the bundle. 
 



 
 Final confirmation: Once verified, the bundled transactions are confirmed on the main chain. The main chain acknowledges the validity of these transactions, thereby updating the blockchain’s state. 
 



<p>This method significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored on the main blockchain. At the same time, it maintains the ability to verify the accuracy and integrity of these transactions. It optimises blockchain scalability by condensing multiple transactions into a single entry and facilitating a more efficient verification process using the accompanying zero-knowledge proof.</p>







<p>To make this even more clear, the above image visualises these steps.</p>



<p></p>



 The benefits of ZK Rollups 



<p>The efficiency of ZK Rollups lies in their ability to maintain security guarantees of the underlying blockchain while vastly improving its scalability. Users benefit from reduced transaction fees and faster transaction finality, making ZK Rollups a promising avenue for scaling Ethereum and other blockchain networks. This technique optimises the blockchain’s capacity to handle a higher volume of transactions, paving the way for broader adoption and enhanced usability of dApps.</p>



<p>As the development and adoption of ZK Rollups continue to evolve, ongoing research and advancements aim to further enhance their efficiency and usability.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>As we bid farewell to 2023, we wanted to provide a year-end update on our progress and what we have been working on behind the scenes.</p><p>For Panther, it’s been a year filled with major tech developments, events, team additions, and preparations for our V1 launch in 2024.</p><p>The Panther Protocol’s tech team has made significant progress and has released three stages of our testnet and we’re on track to release Stage 3 after the internal testing.</p><p>We further participated at various conferences this year, discussing Panther Protocol and zero-knowledge DeFi with the wider Web3 community including at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YwDNusmMBQ&amp;t=483s&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Real Vision</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/EBlockchainCon/status/1679476158138658816?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">European Blockchain Convention</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNiGxeekXyw&amp;t=130s&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Paris DOT</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1716779739783086458?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ETHGlobal Online</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/zk_bankai/status/1729872658765164648?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zkBankai Hacker House</a></p><p>As we celebrate the end of 2023, we look forward to 2024 and our upcoming mainnet launch. The team would like to personally thank you for supporting us on this journey.</p><p>Here’s to an even bigger and better 2024!</p> Communication Updates  Panther DAO Approves PIP-14: A Milestone in Decentralization <p>In May this year, Panther DAO officially approved PIP-14. This proposal formalized the project’s Governance Framework and introduced a DAO Council, marking significant progress in the project's decentralization journey.

PureFi partnership will enable us to meet compliance requirements while preserving decentralization and user anonymity. Read more <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-joins-forces-with-purefi-to-enable-compliance-in-prifi/">here</a>.</p> BitMart Lists Zero-Knowledge DeFi Pioneer Panther Protocol's $ZKP <p>In December this year, BitMart, a leading cryptocurrency exchange operating in over 180 countries, listed Panther Protocol's $ZKP token. This listing is part of our ongoing effort focused on strategic partnerships and exchange listings before our V1 Mainnet launch, aimed at providing improved accessibility, various trading options, and a more efficient, cost-effective transaction experience for our community members and $ZKP holders. Complete announcement <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitmart-lists-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">here</a></p> Panther Community Votes to Extend the Advanced Staking Program <p>Thanks to the successful approval of PIP-19 in November, Advanced Staking V4 is live for the next four months, and $ZKP holders can now stake their tokens again. Learn more about PIP-19 <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/dao-proposals/proposal-19-extend-advanced-staking?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Team Updates  Panther Expands Its Marketing Efforts with New Hires <p>We recently hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manwendramishra/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Manwendra Mishra</a> as a Product Marketing Manager for Panther Protocol. Manwendra brings diversified experience across industries, including as the first marketer for blockchain analytics firm, <a href="https://www.merklescience.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Merkle Science</a>. Before moving to Web3, Manwendra was a marketer at leading cybersecurity firm, <a href="https://www.radware.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Radware</a>(NASDAQ: RDWR).&nbsp;</p><p>Panther plans to further expand its marketing team with two more hires in the coming weeks.</p> R&amp;D Updates  Product Updates <p>In 2023, we made significant product development progress. We started the year with a workshop in Dubai (UAE) to evaluate our progress, examine the market fit of our product, compliance requirements, and institutional perspectives.</p><p>The workshop's goal was to strategically position Panther and our suite of products to align with the anticipated growth and adoption of the DeFi. After the conclusion of the workshop, we recognized that privacy as a feature couldn’t be a differentiator if we can’t enable practical applications of it. And, to achieve this for a DeFi protocol, compliance support is essential. We noted that privacy and compliance should coexist, but it requires more effort and innovation, particularly in leveraging zero-knowledge technology. Additionally, we aimed to enhance the efficiency of our protocol without overwhelming the user experience with an excess of Zero-Knowledge proofs.</p><p>As a result, we revamped our Product Architecture to align with industry needs, incorporating several outcomes from the workshop:&nbsp;</p>  Integrate with third-party compliance providers that can satisfy the new Panther design requirements.  Create a bank account-like on-chain identity ( zAccount) which acts as a link for all transactions users perform. zAccount is further crucial for compliance as it is activated only after a successful KYC completion.&nbsp;  Data Safe mechanism to satisfy AML requirements.&nbsp;  Introduce Zones to allow institutions to become licensed Zone Managers and run a dedicated zone to enable their customers to trade with whitelisted assets and counterparties.&nbsp;  Oshiya (referred to as Panther Miner) for off-chain zero-knowledge proof computation and to reduce the update on every transaction by batching 64 transactions into one. A concept that lets users put their transactions on a “bus queue”.  DeFi adaptors logic to align with the new architecture.  Support interchain communication, scheduled for V2.  <p>After 4-6 months of development, including smart contract development, circuit development, and integrations with PureFi, we began deploying features on the Mumbai test network. This process involved continuous and iterative development of the dApp. We further devised an incentivized testnet plan, organizing the testnet releases into 8 stages.</p><p>Initially, we estimated three weeks of dApp development. However, we encountered internal bugs and external issues during the testing phase, doubling the anticipated duration.</p> Testnet Updates <p>The testnet currently has 400 users and we’ve distributed a total of over 200,000 $ZKP as rewards. The proposed total amount of Testnet rewards is 1.5M $ZKP, with an additional 0.5M $ZKP in reserve to cover any additional rewards, if necessary.</p><p>Have you signed up for our testnet yet?<a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTB8MP6VMtJ2VMERcwLokZ3LLSHZdKn3j32QqLN1FMFRN/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Sign up here</a> to join our community and receive your $ZKP rewards.Here’s a quick recap of our testnet stages.</p><p>Testnet Stage 0</p><p>In July this year, we launched Panther Stage 0. In this Stage, we released the Panther Miner, a specialized miner designed to interact with a blockchain network. This testing stage (and activity in production) is directed towards miners, a key role in the Panther ecosystem, as opposed to DeFi users. Complete announcement <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage0-live/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 1</p><p>After a successful Stage 0, in August this year, we released Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet. In this Stage, testnet users were allowed to test two of Panther’s most anticipated innovations: third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts. Learn more <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 2</p><p>In November, we released the second stage of our testnet. This second phase was designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. More information on Stage 2 <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 3</p><p>Stage 3 development is complete, and internal testing has begun. This third phase will allow users to whitelist test Matic in addition to test ZKPs into Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.</p><p>Further, when it comes to $ZKP, users can now deposit and store $ZKP either as a zAsset ($zZKP) or as a zAccount Gas (Gas $zZKP). At the time of deposit, testnet users will have the flexibility to divide their ZKP deposit amount between the two. The Gas $zZKP can be used to pay protocol fees, relayers, Oshiya, and any external services that enhance protocol services beyond the core.</p><p>Stage 3 is undergoing internal testing at the time of publishing this year-end update and will be released immediately after the tests are completed.</p> V1 Launch Updates <p>We've been working to streamline our development process, make integration testing more efficient, and possibly work on two testnet stages parallelly to ensure we meet the deadline for the V1 release.</p><p>Audits</p><p>The suggested plan is to undergo two sets of audits before the mainnet launch. A pre-audit will be done in January and then a final audit will be done once all stages are released, tested and bugs are resolved. </p><p>V1 Launch and expansion to multiple chains</p><p>V1 is expected to be live after the second Audit. After the successful launch of V1, the plan is to extend V1 to different EVM chains, subject to community voting and approval.&nbsp;</p> Research Initiatives <p>In 2023, we published two research papers in the International Association for Cryptologic Research: (1) A flexible Snark via the monomial basis, and (2) An optimization of the addition gate count in Plonkish circuits.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1255?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">first paper</a> presents a new pairing-based Snark. The principle advantage of which is, in contrast to other Snarks such as Groth16 and Plonk, it allows freedom in the choice of an elliptic curve with the consequential benefit of supporting non-native field arithmetic (a considerable bottle-neck for other Snarks). This research was also presented at the ETH Privacy Conference in Istanbul.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1264?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">second paper</a> proposes a generalization of Plonk’s permutation argument to obtain a protocol on weighted sums which has the benefit of eliminating intermediate gates from high fan-in additions in circuits with Plonkish arithmetization.</p><p>Other research work includes a survey paper (to be completed soon) that focuses on different approaches to Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) clients via snarks.&nbsp;</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that strive to meet regulatory standards and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther’s zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

<p>This year, Nym returns to Europe’s largest and longest-running hacker event, <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">Chaos Communication Congress</a>, where thousands of activists, technologists, cypherpunks and artists will gather in Hamburg to shape the techno-political zeitgeist.</p><p>It was at CCC in 2019 that <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/happy-birthday-bitcoin-hello-world-nym-mixnet-600cc7539190">Nym first launched the workshops</a> to build out its testnet. A great deal has happened since then and now, the core team will be back to sip Club Mate among the crowds and gather vital feedback for the mixnet, before the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> private beta launches in Q1&nbsp;2024.</p>Nym cofounder and CEO Harry Halpin at CCC in&nbsp;2019 At a glance: Nym at CCC&nbsp;2023 <p>If you’re heading to the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/infos/startpage.html">37th CCC</a>, catch Nym at the <a href="http://decentral.community/">Critical Decentralisation Cluster</a><a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/assembly/swiss_cryptoeconomics/"> where you will find the Nym team at the Swiss Cryptoeconomics space</a>. Attendees will be able to try an alpha version of the NymVPN for the very first&nbsp;time.</p><p>Most critically, there will be workshops led by Nym Product Manager Marc Debizet to gather in-depth feedback from some of Europe’s finest hackers around the VPN&nbsp;app.</p><p>Meanwhile Nym DevRel, Serinko, will be running a workshop on setting up high-quality Nym nodes and host open discussions about exit nodes and the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-galaxy-update-has-just-completed-c54beea6c01a">Tor Null</a>&nbsp;policy.</p><p>On the ground you will also find community OG Huxian as well as Nym core team long-timers Jaya Klara Brekke and Alexis&nbsp;Roussel.</p><p><a href="https://pretalx.c3voc.de/37c3-lightningtalks/talk/AUXLKH/">The Nym core team will present at the Lightning Talk stage on 28 December at 16:45 in Hall G</a> as well as participate in assemblies, so keep your eyes peeled in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> WTF is&nbsp;CCC? <p>Staunchly political, the Chaos Communication Congress has always been fighting government overreach and censorship stretching back to the ’80s with the founding of the <a href="https://www.ccc.de/">Chaos Computer Club</a> hacking&nbsp;group.</p><p>The Chaos Computer Club was co-founded by pioneering activist and hacker<a href="https://archive.ph/KajgH"> Wau Holland</a> in 1981 — in what was once a room of Berlin’s<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kommune_1"> Kommune 1</a>, heart of the radical German student movement and later an editorial base for the left-wing newspaper Die Tageszeitung. The group, with foresight, understood that the information sphere was set to change the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Along the way, Chaos Computer Club put its ideas into action, like when it created a DIY modem from toilet pipes — the<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q996548"> Datenklo or ‘dataloo’</a> — in the face of a government telecommunications monopoly that viewed connectivity with suspicion and criminalised plugging computers into phone lines. Members even conducted the first digital bank robbery using an exploit in the early<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/geschichte/btx-hack-1984-angriff-der-ccc-hacker-gegen-die-bundespost-a-1002443.html"> Bildschirmtext (BTX)</a> computer network and were regarded by the press as<a href="https://www.nycresistor.com/2008/07/04/cats-dataloos-and-a-btx-bank-robbery/"> ‘electronic Robin Hoods’</a> (because, of course, they returned the missing Deutsche&nbsp;Marks).</p><p>It was in 1984 that the first <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">Chaos Communication Congress</a> was held in Hamburg. With only 100 attendees at the inaugural event, CCC now attracts over 10,000 participants. It <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xygxn4/chaos-communication-congress-a-very-german-hacking-conference-5886b73a9848b145c38b3f06">retains its fiercely political heart</a>, a moral compass oriented to ethical hacking, and the idea that technology should be transparent and a public good — and spotlights art, beauty, and humanity as much as it does the digital&nbsp;world.</p> Nym at CCC 2023: help build privacy for&nbsp;everyone <p>Perhaps more than most, the philosophical centre of CCC aligns with the Nym mission of decentralisation and privacy for all of humanity.</p><p>And it was for those reasons that the first steps of the Nym mission to build a working mixnet, to free people from government and corporate surveillance, were taken at Chaos Communication Congress in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>A few incredibly busy years later and Nym proudly returns to CCC, to ready the mixnet for mass adoption.</p><p>The core team will hold a CLI demo, workshops and 1:1 meetings, and is proactively seeking feedback from the attendees of Europe’s biggest volunteer-run hacker event to further refine the Nym network as it gears up for&nbsp;launch.</p><p>So if you’re attending CCC, please do drop by the Critical Decentralisation Cluster to meet the team! You will also find friends of Nym from <a href="https://riat.at/">RIAT</a>, <a href="https://dod.ngo/">Department of Decentralisation</a>, <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a>, <a href="https://www.namecoin.org/">Namecoin</a> and more. Find Nym in the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/assembly/swiss_cryptoeconomics/">Swiss Cryptoeconomics</a> assembly along with <a href="https://alephium.org/">Alephium</a>, <a href="https://www.ethswarm.org/foundation">Swarm</a> and Hodling. Come chat with the team and see the NymVPN in action for the very first&nbsp;time.</p><p>And if you’re not attending this year, keep your eyes peeled for videos and other updates from CCC in the new&nbsp;year.</p><p>While you wait, here’s some Nym lore — the launch at CCC in&nbsp;2019:</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-returns-to-chaos-communications-congress-a2a08194a487">Nym returns to Chaos Communication Congress</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		  4.2.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of ZEN 4.2.0 to Mainnet later next January 2024.  Pre-release 4.2.0-rc1 will perform a network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1396500, on January 3rd, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated.  IMPORTANT: 4.2.0 is expected to be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will not be possible anymore to unshield funds from private addresses to normal transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen. Unshielding will still be possible to P2SH (multisignature) addresses, but the process to do so will be more involved.  Because of this, we recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses in Sphere by Horizen before February 2024. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.    <p>Main Features (from 4.1.1 to 4.2.0-rc1):&nbsp;</p>Shielded Pool Deprecation:<br>Unshielding RestrictionsPR <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/pull/624">#624</a> is a follow-up in the gradual path of shielded pool deprecation, it introduces a hard fork requiring the unshielding of private funds to target only script addresses. After the hard fork, unshielding to P2PKH addresses or to P2PK addresses will not be allowed. For this reason, the following RPC commands have been (partially) deprecated: z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress (check inline documentation for additional details).<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

<p>Today, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a12e050e-9f1f-11ee-a9a0-6e1a1ab4deb2/view">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), which will run until December 31st. The purpose of this poll is threefold:&nbsp;</p>



 
 to fill three seats on the Zcash Community Grants committee,&nbsp; 



 to solicit feedback from the community on a proposal to pay a stipend to ZCG committee members, and&nbsp; 



 to assess community sentiment on the question of whether a new funding mechanism should be introduced to replace (or extend) the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>Members of the <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) committee are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel, and serve a one year term. Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year. Last month, <a href="https://zfnd.org/opening-nominations-for-the-zcash-community-grants-committee-december-2023/">we invited candidates</a> to express their interest in serving on the committee.</p>



<p>Five candidates are standing for three seats on the committee. Here is the list of candidates, with links to their candidacy announcements on the Zcash community forum:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/jason-mcgee-for-zcg-december-2023/46154">Jason McGee</a>

 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/kworks-for-zcg-december-2023/46168">Kworks</a> 
 



<p></p>



<p>Last Thursday, the candidates took part in a Community Call, during which they introduced themselves and answered questions from the Zcash community. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/KbIM4yNRxts?si=NhncKMnXzd1j4oDq">a recording of the call on Youtube</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-GbVFA1csIgPbvHOR-1ruOlh7YdA-CHvMtd6R8iSdY">ZCAP members</a> should check their mailbox for instructions on how to vote. In the past, Helios emails have sometimes been flagged as spam, so if you can’t find the instructions please check your Spam folder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good luck to all the candidates, and thank you for volunteering to serve on the ZCG committee!&nbsp;</p>



 ​​Funding ZCG Committee Members’ Stipend 



<p>Since its inception, the Zcash Foundation has provided a stipend to members of the Zcash Community Grants committee. Last month, we shared the news that this stipend would be reduced from its current level of $1,725 USD to $650 USD (paid in ZEC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several community members have expressed concerns that this reduction may have a detrimental impact on the Zcash Community Grants program. ZCG committee member GGuy has proposed that the stipend be maintained at its current level by funding it from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, we are putting the following question to ZCAP: Do you support amending ZIP 1014 to provide a stipend of $115 USD per hour (up to a monthly maximum of $1,725 USD) to be paid in ZEC to ZCG Committee members from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forum discussion of this proposal can be found <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">h</a><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">e</a><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">re</a>.</p>



<p>If ZCAP approves this proposal, we will draft an amendment to <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a> to permit for a stipend to be paid from the Major Grants slice, with the hourly rate and cap to be set or changed by ZCAP poll. Note that the text of the amendment will be finalized by the Zcash Foundation after the results of the ZCAP poll are known, and following consultation with legal counsel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If ZCAP approves the stipend, it is expected that any time for which ZCG Committee members claim the stipend would be in furtherance of the stated purpose of the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and the ZCG Committee, as set forth in ZIP 1014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If approved, the stipend will be subject to the same policies that govern similar payments by ZF, and may be subject to veto if the Foundation judges them to violate U.S. law or the ZF’s reporting requirements and other (current or future) obligations under applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS) regulations.</p>



 Assessing Community Sentiment Regarding the Future of Zcash Ecosystem Funding 



<p>Earlier this year, members of the Zcash community began discussing what should happen after the current Dev Fund sunsets in late 2024. In October, we published a <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-future-of-zcash-ecosystem-development-funding/">blog post</a> explaining how the Zcash Foundation will support the Zcash community in debating and deciding whether or not to institute a new ecosystem funding mechanism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During discussions on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/dev-fund-2024-community-poll-discussion-megathread/44527">Zcash Community Forum</a> and community-organized <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1eaKbrNVmmVKX">Twitter Space discussions</a>, some strong opinions have been expressed both for and against the concept of renewing or replacing the current Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help obtain more clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem, we are initiating an advisory poll of ZCAP on this question: In principle, would you support the introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope that the result of this advisory poll (which will be released alongside the results of the ZCG election in early January) will help move discussion about Zcash ecosystem funding forward, and help community members draft more specific proposals in early 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s my great honor to be asked to lead ECC as CEO.</p>



<p>I want to thank Zooko for everything he’s taught me in the six years that I’ve known him. I have deep respect and admiration for Zooko and his contributions to this industry and to mankind. He is a truly remarkable human. There will only ever be one Zooko.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash is a special project. Its purpose to empower economic freedom is wholesome and good. Its legacy is indelible. The innovation within and the talent behind it are undeniable. That it flourishes is vital. All the earth must have access to private, self-sovereign money if we are to be free.</p>



<p>To realize it, we must begin to move into a new season with a different rhythm. Our focus will be to find product-market fit. That will require a continuous and iterative process of observation, hypotheses development, and testing. We will work with you to invent new things.</p>



<p>This will be a time of wide-eyed discovery, experimentation, and pulling our strengths together to make magic happen. We will be one team, in concert with one another, rapidly ideating and iterating, while working collaboratively with many across the Zcash and crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>My near term priorities are threefold:</p>



 
 Remove friction and barriers, at ECC and within the community, that impede our ability to iterate quickly 



 Focus efforts to exponentially increase Zcash utility through user-focused products and continual feedback 



 Secure ECC financial sustainability so we can deliver more, for longer 
 



<p>In support of these priorities, a few changes will immediately take effect:</p>



 
 We will optimize ECC’s organizational structure to support efficiency and improve the likelihood of our success. 



 Internal processes and policies will change to support increased focus, empowerment, and voice. 
 



<p>While I have been asked by ECC to formally help forge a new path ahead, ECC is only one participant in the Zcash community. Realizing a renewed Zcash requires a chorus of voices, both within ECC and across the Zcash community. I look forward to collaborating with you.</p>



<p>I’d like to thank Zooko and the other Bootstrap (ECC parent) Board members, including Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Michelle Lai, and Zaki Manian, for your leadership, and thoughtfulness. This trust is the honor of my professional life.</p>



<p>I’d also like to thank the many of you across the community who have engaged with me in recent weeks on the future of Zcash — ideating, dreaming, encouraging, and collaborating. You know who you are, and you’re invaluable both to me and this legacy we’re collectively building with Zcash. We all need each other, now more than ever. Let’s go!</p>

<p>We are writing to share some significant news regarding the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and our path ahead. We are opening a new chapter in our story, with a new strategic roadmap, under new leadership.</p>



<p>Since 2015, when ECC (then known as the Zcash Company) was formed, Zooko has been our leader — and one of the most important and revered figures in the crypto and blockchain universe. Under his leadership, ECC launched Zcash in 2016 and since then has contributed groundbreaking technology that underpins Zcash — and a majority of respected crypto projects that exist today.</p>



<p>A few highlights:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In Zcash, ECC delivered the first real-world application of zero-knowledge proofs, a novel method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This is one of the most important contributions to blockchain tech since 2008.&nbsp; 



 The Sapling upgrade for Zcash made mobile-wallet shielded transactions possible for the first time, paving the way for broader adoption of private money. 



 Halo, a cryptographic breakthrough, is a zero-knowledge proving system that enables recursion without a trusted setup in an efficient way. Halo on Zcash made trustless, private digital cash payments on mobile phones possible for the first time.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Now, it’s time to start a new chapter. Josh Swihart, formerly SVP of Growth at ECC, will return to ECC and take over the reins from Zooko as CEO. He will be responsible for all strategic and tactical decisions. Zooko will remain in his role as a director on the board of the Bootstrap Project, the parent company of ECC. And first, he will take some much-deserved time off. Together, we will fully support and enable Josh to lead ECC into a new chapter of service to humanity.</p>



<p>Fulfilling our mission of economic freedom requires not just groundbreaking technology, but also great products that bring joy to the people who use them. So today we’re excited to redouble our focus on the Zcash user, and we feel confident in Josh’s leadership — in finding product-market fit, unlocking new partnerships and collaboration, improving Zcash usability, and increasing adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to a vision for ECC and an optimistic passion for Zcash, Josh has a strong entrepreneurial, technical, and product background. He is committed to fostering broad inclusivity within the Zcash community, and he’ll share more on that with you shortly.</p>



<p>We have challenging but exciting days ahead. We’re here for it. Thank you for standing with us.</p>



<p>Warm regards,</p>



<p>The Bootstrap (ECC parent) Board of Directors: Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Michelle Lai, Zooko Wilcox, and Zaki Manian</p>

<p>We are entering a new frontier in life sciences unparalleled in human history, as emerging technologies are changing the biotech industry along a few vectors including decreasing costs in sequencing, synthesis, etc., the ability to program, simulate and iterate in silico and in vivo and entrepreneurial accessibility. BlueYard’s strategy around biology is based on the premise that humankind’s ability to engineer and understand biology will not only fundamentally transform how we diagnose, treat, and manage disease, but also reinvent how we produce new materials and the food required to support human life and sustain our planet. In recognition of these step-function changes, over the last years, we have backed a dozen companies in the space — ranging from <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/clock-bio-7275d798ba82">cellular reprogramming to combat aging</a> to <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/origin-bio-b3932d07b50b">sustainable material</a>s produced in microbes.</p><p>We believe tomorrow’s industry-defining biology companies will be founded by technologists and scientists who are building the interconnected elements that can become the fabric of our future (see our <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/blueyard-3-74255d983edc">thesis</a>). We are excited about empowering this next generation of founders and have renewed our partnership with <a href="https://nucleate.xyz/">Nucleate</a>, the student-led non-profit organization dedicated to empowering the next generation of biotech leaders, aimed at fostering innovation in science at the earliest&nbsp;stages.</p><p>This year, Nucleate has expanded in Europe by opening core chapters in Germany and Denmark. Via our partnership, Nucleate has committed a pool of up to $2 million to fund the next generation of founders that have made it through the organization’s six-month Activator Program during 2024. The objective is to back 10 to 20 new teams across the European ecosystem as they migrate from the academic lab to a commercial entity and build the new platforms that re-engineer our society’s biology experiences.</p><p>We are also excited to announce the winners of the 2023 Nucleate Venture Prize.

<p>Biology operates at the single-cell level: human tissues are composed of highly heterogeneous cells interacting and regulating each other, and all interactions within the cell reverberate throughout the whole organism. A full understanding of individual cells, including genotype, function and phenotype, could unlock the biology of multiple diseases. However, most high throughput biological experiments are still performed on 96 wells at a time and all single-cell platforms are only able to run very specific assays on a few thousands of cells at a time, while lacking the capability to connect multiple assays or modalities at a&nbsp;time.</p><p><a href="https://www.zafrens.com/">Zafrens</a> is developing a novel platform that expedites drug discovery and overcomes the tradeoff between throughput and depth of analysis. The company’s Z-Screen is a step-change in throughput and resolution of experiments, expanding the conventional 96-well format to 50,000–200,000 wells with imaging and single-cell multi-omic capabilities integrated in every well. Large CRISPR, CAR-T, mRNA libraries, or endogenous molecular heterogeneity, can be mapped to their individual manifestations as cell behavior, cell-cell interactions and secretions. The founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/swamy71/">Swamy Vijayan</a>, is an experienced biotech entrepreneur, having previously built Omiome (a DNA sequencing platform sold to <a href="https://www.pacb.com/">PacBio</a>) and <a href="https://www.plexium.com/">Plexium</a> (small molecules targeting protein degradation with several programs advancing to clinical&nbsp;trials).</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Due to the broad application of its technology — from small molecule discovery to cell and gene therapies — we believe that Zafrens has the potential to become a fabric for developing novel therapeutics. Moreover, with its plans for an internal pipeline of RNA-modulatory small-molecules and HLA-agnostic TCR libraries to common cancer mutations, Zafrens also has the opportunity to accelerate the path to initial drug candidates and thereby play a fundamental role in combating cancer and other diseases.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the Zafrens team on their mission to democratize access to therapeutics, irrespective of modality.

  Partnering with Tacto: Future-Proof Supply Chains  <p>André, Nico, Johannes and their team are building the modern supplier-management solution millions of businesses need.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/luciana-lixandru/">Luciana Lixandru</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/julien-bek/">Julien Bek</a>, and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/cornelius-menke/">Cornelius Menke</a>	 

Published December 11, 2023
  



TACTO CO-FOUNDERS JOHANNES GROLL, NICO BENTENRIEDER AND ANDRÉ PETRY.



 
<p>Sometimes you meet a team and you just know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first learned last year about Tacto co-founders André Petry, Nico Bentenrieder and Johannes Groll and the procurement solution they were building, we already had a keen interest in the category. While businesses have for decades used CRMs (customer relationship management systems) to grow their revenue, where was the SRM (supplier relationship management system)? More attention to the supplier and cost side of the equation was clearly needed, as geopolitical tensions, COVID ripple effects and regulatory changes have created unprecedented supply chain uncertainty and price volatility.</p>



<p>For the world’s largest companies producing physical goods, some supplier relationship tools are available via incumbents. But for millions of mid-sized businesses (SMBs), these options are too cumbersome and too expensive; 90% have no procurement solution at all. Instead, they’re stuck tracking every supplier, certificate and quote manually, in email and Excel. It’s a daunting proposition—especially when you realize that even a company making a seemingly simple product like tape might have hundreds of suppliers and procure tens of thousands of different articles.</p>



<p>Those mid-sized industrial companies are exactly who <a href="https://www.tacto.ai/">Tacto</a> was built to serve, so in late 2022, we reached out to their team to discuss the possibility of a partnership. Unfortunately for us, they’d just finished raising their seed round. But we didn’t want to give up—so we started speaking with customers in the sector, hoping to learn more about the business. What we heard made us even more interested in the product André, Nico, Johannes and their team are building.</p>



<p>Customers told us Tacto had helped them streamline every aspect of the procurement process, from requesting, evaluating and responding to quotes; to tracking suppliers’ regulatory certifications; to analyzing prices and preparing for negotiations. Where their employees once spent hundreds of hours on interviews, questionnaires and data entry, the platform now automatically gathers and standardizes that information—and of course, uses AI to help them make sense of it. Tacto has also dramatically simplified compliance with Germany’s new Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which imposes stricter supplier reporting to every business with at least 1,000 full-time employees. Even better, it’s easy to integrate—no year-long sales cycles or big IT projects—and, thanks to André, Nico and Johannes’s insistence on an elegant, consumer-grade UI, it’s easy to use, as well.</p>



<p>But customers didn’t just sing the praises of Tacto’s product; we also heard amazing things about its team. André, Nico and Johannes have stellar credentials—all three met at the elite Center for Digital Technology and Management in Munich. They started Tacto in early 2020 after seeing the challenges of procurement firsthand, pushed ahead when skeptics in the space told them it wouldn’t work, and now, have stuck with it long enough to prove those skeptics wrong. They are high-energy, thoughtful and relentlessly focused on performance—and, importantly, they have an impressive ability to attract talent. Tacto’s team members deeply understand the problems their customers are facing, and they work quickly to solve them.</p>



<p>After hearing those rave reviews, we knew we had to try again—so we traveled to Munich to meet André face-to-face. We walked out of that first one-hour coffee with a high degree of conviction in Tacto, and a couple of weeks later, flew back to spend the day with the team and offer them a term sheet. Sequoia was far from the only firm vying for Tacto’s attention—but in that high-pressure environment, we saw for ourselves the qualities that make André, Nico and Johannes great leaders. We were thrilled that they chose us to lead their Series A.</p>



<p>Today, the future is bright. Tacto is now serving customers across a wide range of industries, from mechanical engineering to packaging to medical technology, and impressively, they have grown quickly while retaining every one of their happy customers. In the months and years ahead, as supply chain challenges continue and new regulations expand beyond Germany across Europe, André, Nico, Johannes and their team will be there to make life better and easier for even more companies—and we are excited to support them along the way.</p>

<p>The acceleration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology adoption across industries has indicated widespread organisational acceptance of the novel technology. The advent of this new technology has brought more efficient and creative possibilities. However, the use of language models in AI raises concerns about trustworthiness in its training and the output it generates. This leads us to the question: How can we leverage existing technologies to bridge this lack of trust?</p>



<p>This article explores the challenges surrounding trust in AI system inputs and outputs, how blockchain could be the solution to establish trust, and various integration challenges that need to be accounted for.</p>



<p></p>



 Trust challenges of AI systems 



<p>Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, organisations have made enormous strides to implement AI within their technological systems. Enthusiasm for this new technology promising productivity enhancement, has also generated discussions on whether we can trust these systems. Who has been training these AI models? How can we be sure that the information output it generates is reliable and unbiased? </p>



<p></p>



 Transparency of AI language models  



<p>AI systems require a large language model (LLM) to learn and have a basis to create outputs from. However, due to the lack of transparency surrounding what goes into the LLMs, doubts arise on data input authenticity and reliability.</p>



<p>Authenticity: If the origin, quality, and representativeness of the input data are not transparent, it raises concerns about the authenticity and reliability of the model’s understanding.</p>



<p>Reliability: Lack of clarity regarding the source of training data leads to scepticism about the model’s ability to accurately reflect real-world scenarios and diverse perspectives. This creates uncertainty on whether the model’s output can be trusted and used accordingly.</p>



<p>Explainability: There is a lack of self-explanation in AI systems on how a specific outcome is generated when prompted. This poses a significant hurdle to understanding and trusting AI’s outputs. What data did the system pool together to carry out its decision-making process when prompted?</p>



<p></p>



 Ethical standards in AI training 



<p>AI systems often make decisions based on complex algorithms and data that include principles governing the training of AI models. Thus creating the need for a standardised set of ethical guidelines governing the training of AI models.</p>



<p>One primary concern is the ethical framework guiding the selection of data used in training these systems. The opaqueness surrounding the training data raises ethical concerns, particularly related to bias. If the data used to train AI models contain biases, the model may unintentionally perpetuate those biases in its outputs. Without transparency, it becomes challenging to identify and address biases in the training data. Therefore making it difficult to avoid potential negative consequences.</p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. AI output 



<p>Another significant challenge revolves around the ability to distinguish between outputs generated by AI systems and those by human intelligence. Can we reliably identify whether the output presented is a result of human thought or an algorithmic process? </p>



<p>Authentication is particularly crucial in scenarios where information transparency is essential, such as journalism, content creation, or academia. This distinction between human and AI-generated content also carries ethical implications. It prompts discussions on attribution, accountability, and the potential influence these systems might have in shaping public opinion. As AI becomes more integrated into society, different mechanisms are needed to transparently demonstrate the origin of information.</p>



<p></p>



 Output challenges 



<p>When speaking of trust within AI, we must also evaluate the ownership and intellectual property rights of AI-generated output. The challenge lies in determining whether outputs are established through AI’s novel agency or the accumulation of various other sources that warrant intellectual property rights.</p>



<p>The artwork industry can be used to illustrate the debate on whether generative AI should give credit to artists. Since the system draws inspiration from its training model, would the new artwork’s ownership belong to AI? This debate highlights legal and ethical dilemmas, due to a lack of established frameworks that promote fair compensation for contributors. As AI systems evolve, there is a pressing need to redefine traditional notions of ownership. Acknowledgment of the collaborative nature of AI development is needed while safeguarding the rights of those involved in the generative process.</p>



<p></p>



 Role of blockchain in establishing trust 



<p>Based on the trust challenges discussed above, blockchain technology could be the solution as a trust layer for AI. Blockchain’s decentralised design, using transparent and immutable data records, guarantees universal accessibility, enhanced authentication, and verification processes for all users.</p>



<p></p>



 Ensuring transparency in data processes  



<p>One of the fundamental challenges in trusting AI, as discussed, lies in the lack of transparency regarding data input processes. Blockchain can resolve the transparency issue by recording every step of the AI training and data input process. This ensures that the origin and reliability of the data used to train AI models are traceable and verifiable to reflect real-world conditions.</p>



<p>By leveraging blockchain, organisations facilitating AI technology can instil confidence in stakeholders regarding the reliability of its AI-generated outputs. This safeguards against potential misuse and establishes a foundation for accountability in the development and deployment of AI.</p>



<p></p>



 Tracing decision-making processes  



<p>Transparency enabled by blockchain technology can address the inherent explainability challenges associated with AI’s black-box nature. Establishing a transparent trail of the data and model processes integrated enhances the reliability of AI decisions.</p>



<p>The availability of a comprehensible trail can address the lack of confidence and scepticism present in generative AI. Traceability encourages independent evaluation, empowering users to revisit and assess AI’s decision-making steps, thereby contributing to a more accountable and trustworthy AI environment.</p>



<p></p>



 Leveraging immutability to validate data input reliability 



<p>The immutable nature of blockchain technology contributes to providing security to data records and data transactions. Every piece of information entered into the blockchain is time-stamped and linked to previous data blocks, creating an unbroken chain of custody. This not only enhances the accountability of data sources but also enables stakeholders to verify the authenticity of inputs. As a result, users can confidently rely on the integrity of the data feeding into AI algorithms, knowing that any attempt to manipulate or compromise the information would be immediately detectable. On the other hand, blockchain can be used to drive sustainability goals for successful operations in the long run. For further understanding of how blockchain can sustain long-term ESG goals for organisations, refer to this ebook on <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">using blockchain for sustainability.</a></p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. machine contributions 



<p>Distinguishing between outputs generated by human intelligence and those crafted by AI is critical. The widespread use of AI in optimising many of our daily processes is bound to be used in other various domains, such as work-related situations and advisory roles.  This has caused increasing evaluation on whether information distributed is completely human or contains traces of AI contribution. </p>



WorldID is used as a global digital identity to anonymously prove a person’s unique identity.



<p>Thus the use of smart contracts in the blockchain ecosystem provides a mechanism for creating verifiable identities for both human and machine contributors.  OpenAI’s <a href="https://worldcoin.org/world-id">WorldID</a> initiative is an example of how smart contracts can be employed to authenticate the origin of contributions. Its application will enable a clear distinction between human and AI-generated outputs. Their initiative could address future concerns about accountability and ethical considerations in various domains such as authentic journalism and recognition.</p>



<p></p>



 Establishing auditable trails for tracing errors 



<p>In the complex landscape of AI, errors and biases in outputs can have significant consequences for end users. Blockchain-based systems can offer the solution of an auditable trail that records every transaction and interaction within the AI ecosystem. In the event of errors or biases in AI outputs, this auditable trail provides a comprehensive analysis of the training data and its parameters, facilitating the identification and rectification of issues. This auditable trail also serves as a critical tool for post hoc analysis, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of AI algorithms to meet evolving ethical and performance standards.</p>



<p></p>



 Challenges between AI and blockchain integration 



<p>The integration of AI and blockchain technology may provide us with a starting point in establishing trust, however, there are still potential challenges that experts should address when considering this integration.</p>



<p></p>



 Scalability 



<p>One prominent concern is the scale and scope of AI applications. AI systems often work with massive datasets, and to fully integrate them with blockchain, a highly efficient, low-cost network is essential. However, the transactional and resource costs associated with blockchain networks remain a significant hurdle.</p>



<p></p>



 Cost efficiency 



<p>Initial setup costs can involve acquiring the necessary hardware, software, and infrastructure to support both AI algorithms and blockchain networks. Maintenance costs also arise as ongoing updates and improvements are essential to keep both technologies optimised and secure. Transaction costs associated with blockchain networks, such as fees for data storage and processing, can accumulate. Particularly when dealing with large-scale AI applications that require frequent interactions with the blockchain. Lastly, organisations will need to invest in skilled professionals who can navigate the complexities of integrating AI and blockchain, adding to the overall human resource expenses.</p>



<p></p>



 Interoperability 



<p>There are various blockchain platforms available, and achieving interoperability between them poses a challenge since smart contracts and AI applications might need to interact across different blockchain networks. AI models and algorithms may be developed using different frameworks and technologies. Therefore, ensuring a seamless integration with blockchain platforms can be a complicated process. </p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Compliance 



<p>The topic of interoperability across both technologies also highlights regulatory challenges on two fronts. The decentralised and global nature of blockchain introduces uncertainty, as compliance requirements vary across jurisdictions. Simultaneously, the use of AI, particularly in sensitive domains, is subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny with a focus on data privacy, transparency, and accountability. Combining these technologies requires a dual compliance effort of addressing regulations specific to each domain and staying up to date with technical developments, to develop a standardised process for compliance.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The widespread integration of AI technology has prompted critical discussions surrounding transparency, authentication and ethical standards in AI language models. Blockchain, through its transparent and immutable nature, emerges as a promising solution to address these concerns. It offers transparency in data processes, traceability of decision-making, and validation of data input reliability. However, the integration of AI and blockchain presents a set of challenges, such as scalability, interoperability, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. Thus, when leveraging this integration, a balance is needed between innovation, and ethical considerations. AI developers should ensure that the collaborative development of AI is transparent, accountable, and trustworthy for the benefit of its users.</p>

<p>1) Can you tell us a little about yourself?</p><p>I’m what everyone knows as ‘JSKitty’ — the infamous dev cat of Labs (since the SnappySnap days)! Young British dev, a never-ending interest in tech, from crypto to global-finance, game-dev and AI, I’ve pretty much touched every computer-related subject that anyone could think of — and my end interest ended up being with crypto, after I found Bitcoin around early&nbsp;2014.</p><p>Before PIVX, I worked at ZENZO, before ZENZO, I worked on multiple early projects, like the “DeepOnion” privacy coin, or “eXperience Points (XP)” back in the 2017&nbsp;bullrun!</p><p>Before all those, I was a Game Developer, with two published games, and a handful of unpublished ones, mostly solo-built, some with friends, but all of them were built in a home-schooled method, I do not have a single academic grade to my name, and I don’t need&nbsp;one!</p><p>2) When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>In early 2013–2014 I ended up coming across (in a way that is now lost to my memories) a Bitcoin faucet, the ancient “Freebitco.in” site (which is still running today, damn!), at that point, I was just barely a game developer, had zero knowledge (hah) of Bitcoin, crypto, most of programming, and even finance in general — over the years, I collected Bitcoin, I learned about it, got incredibly obsessed over the technology from the newfound of decentralised systems and “programmable money”, I joined the BitcoinTalk forum and engaged, actually got a fairly reputable BitcoinTalk account in those days, back when coins would often do “Banner Campaigns” where BCT users would advertise a coin on their banner, fun times,&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>3) When and why did you get into&nbsp;PIVX?</p><p>This is an interesting one, around late 2017 roughly, I was effectively a serial-tipbot-dev as a kid, a surprising amount of projects used to have my Tipbots, I built them from scratch, they had various community-building features, and I would bounce from project-to-project hooking them up and watching the communities enjoy&nbsp;them.</p><p>In that time, I met Snappy and the original-ish tipbot operator (Buer), in which I poked around for the status of it, and saw that it was effectively dead — so I teamed up with Snappy, who LOVED the idea, and immediately helped me to make the ‘PIVX Tipbot’ a reality — and for those months that it ran, I remember it was a huge success, with a bot-powered Radio and DJ system that members would gather and rock with — Snappy would act as a host — that, that community spirit, is what kept me in PIVX, even if the original idea, was merely to propagate a&nbsp;tipbot.</p><p>4) What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the&nbsp;market?</p><p>It’s teams (Core and Labs), it’s long-lived testament of surviving the harshest markets, it’s unique blend of Bleeding-Edge tech with PoS, in which a dozen “PIVX-firsts” occurred and continue to occur. — PIVX as a technology, and a currency, is an incredible feat, to say the least, one that is underappreciated by the wider&nbsp;market.</p><p>5) Can you tell us about your journey as a developer and engineer that led you to the creation of PIVXLabs; mypivxwallet and PIVCards?</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/PjuCvCHDyp">PIVX Labs,</a> or at least the ‘soul’ and idea of it, was born of Snappy — the Catalyst of PIVX Labs as-of-today was back when me, Snappy, Kyeno and various other developers, some long gone now — decided that PIVX needed more than just a Core Wallet, the problem with 2017–2020 PIVX was that there were a severe barrier to entry, as well as a UX that is not up to the modern standards of&nbsp;‘Web3’.</p><p>Labs came to fruition from the demand of Labs being needed — we knew PIVX needed a lighter, faster, easier wallet that anyone in the world, on any device, with any experience level; could setup and use, without compromising on security. <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MyPIVXWallet</a> was Labs first creation.</p><p>We also knew that PIVX needed more than wallets to thrive as a currency — <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/">PIVCards </a>enabled using PIV in the real-world, easier than any other platform on the market — What will we build next? I’m not sure yet, but it will be another pillar to PIVX’s real-world adoption and usage — That, is why Labs&nbsp;exists.</p><p>6) As a developer, what are some of the technical aspects or challenges you encountered while building mypivxwallet, and how did you overcome&nbsp;them?</p><p>In general, there are three-ish ‘pillars’ of MPW’s architecture to decide&nbsp;upon:</p><p>- Convenience.</p><p>- (De)centralisation and/or&nbsp;Privacy.</p><p>- Security.</p><p>Increase one, and generally, the other two decrease, how do you build something perfect in all three? Truthfully, you can’t, there are trade-offs to be made somewhere, for something.</p><p>My first and foremost priority for MPW has been Security: for example, MPW since even the first day, NEVER allowed saving a wallet to disk without an encryption password — ironically, this is a more secure practice than the Core Wallet, which does not force this measure on first&nbsp;launch.</p><p>But for Privacy? This is tough, MPW uses Blockbook explorers to sync your transaction history, which requires the app to send your Public Keys to said Blockbook to retrieve your balance — this is not fun, but the alternative: chain header sync, would lengthen the synchronisation time of MPW MASSIVELY, which is a huge hit to Convenience.</p><p>Sure, only a gone-rogue Blockbook can actually collect, store, analyse that data — but it is still a possibility, depending on your threat model, that may already be too much data exposure for&nbsp;someone.</p><p>Back to security: many platforms, like Password Managers, will encrypt your password data locally, and then upload your encrypted data to their Cloud storage — this means you can retrieve your data from the internet, or cross-sync things across your devices, which is incredibly convenient: but what if that service gets compromised? It’s a ticking time bomb before your data is decrypted by an attacker, and boom, account gone — MPW could add encrypted cloud-sync for convenience, and to give users the ability to recover their wallet even if their device exploded randomly — sure, but is it worth the&nbsp;risk?</p><p>This is our daily challenge, a balancing act of conflicting design philosophies.</p><p>7) How does mypivxwallet simplify the onboarding process for new users, particularly those who may be unfamiliar with cryptocurrency wallets?<br> <br> <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MPW </a>focuses massively on: “less is more” in a User Experience sense — the default design assumption of MPW is to assume the user is the least knowledgeable in any area of the wallet, as such; complex features are walled off behind “Advanced Mode”, which hides complex things by default — users can create an MPW wallet, jot down their seed on paper, and encrypt their wallet, within just 1–2&nbsp;minutes!</p><p>8) With the recent launch of PIVCards could you share a little about this phenomenal PIVX use&nbsp;case?</p><p>PIVCards was, funnily, a completely random whim-idea I had a few months ago and decided to prototype in a single week of spare time — having gotten the ‘itch’ to do something new outside of MPW, PIVCards was a massive technological and logistical challenge, and I am surprised that such a small team managed to build it as well as we&nbsp;did.</p><p>PIVCards has processed almost 400 orders, worth a total of ~$17,500, since the initial prototyping, and we HUGELY underestimated the volume we’d be handling, so PIVCards had a full two/three weeks of additional polishing by me, to get it scaling better and with less manual input needed — now, although still imperfect, the service runs entirely autonomously, with near zero manual labour required aside from the occasional logistical ‘edge-case’ we&nbsp;hit.</p><p>9) Finally, what advice or encouragement would you give to aspiring developers and entrepreneurs who are looking to make an impact in the cryptocurrency industry?</p><p>Find what excites you, fascinates you, what grabs at you with the grasp a black hole has on the cosmos: and dive in to it, trust the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Why keep what you love, as a mere side-hobby, rather than a way of&nbsp;life?</p><p>Work doesn’t have to be ‘for someone’, nor does it have to be boring, unexciting — break the chains of being a corporate cog, find what you love, master it, and with enough time and energy (and very importantly: networking), you will make a living with it, doing what you&nbsp;love.</p><p>Sending gratitude to JSKitty for taking the time to sit down with me and share some insights into his background and experiences.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/decembers-pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-jskitty-founder-and-developer-of-pivxlabs-487e2cc3ba5f">December’s PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on JSKitty, Founder and Developer of PIVXLabs.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>When it comes to NFTs and blockchain gaming, very few companies can rival with Animoca Brands’ early conviction, investment thesis and time horizon. They understood early on that community building and network effects are the core pillars for a true paradigm shift in gaming.

 TL;DR 



<p>As Electric Coin Co. (ECC) and the Zcash community prepare for public retrospectives of zcashd Network Upgrade 5 (NU5) and what has become known as the sandblasting attack, this blog post details ECC’s motivations, challenges, and accomplishments with regard to each.&nbsp;</p>



 
 The NU5 upgrade was an ambitious undertaking to eliminate the need for trusted setups, increase user confidence, and enhance Zcash’s security and scalability. 



 The implementation of Halo, a cryptographic breakthrough, on Zcash made possible trustless, private, digital-cash transactions for the first time on mobile phones. 



 A malicious attack following the upgrade led to significant wallet performance issues, prompting ECC to enter Emergency Mode. Our response involved multiple technical updates, performance improvements, and the release of new mobile-wallet SDKs. 



 Despite the challenges and delays, ECC succeeded in improving the security and resiliency of Zcash. 
 



 



 



<p><a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86440711631">Public retrospective: Wednesday, Dec. 13 at 22:00 UTC/17:00 EST</a></p>



 



 



 What the FUD? 



<p>ECC’s mission is to empower economic freedom, and most organizations that work on Zcash-related projects, like the Zcash Foundation (ZF) and Zcash Community Grants (ZCG), have similar community-minded objectives for the betterment of humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, since Zcash came into the world in 2016 a stream of misinformation (and some coordinated propaganda) has been circulated on social media, forums, and other community platforms meant to incite FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).</p>



<p>The rumors claimed that Zcash was compromised, or that it was vulnerable to counterfeiting, or that there was a backdoor that would allow third parties to access a user’s transaction information without their consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And unfortunately, until NU5 was released, there was a major obstacle in confronting these attacks: the trusted setup. When Zcash launched, its zero-knowledge proofs required a <a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony">Ceremony</a>, or trusted setup phase, to produce public parameters that allowed users to construct and verify private transactions.</p>



<p>This technique was pioneered by ECC, and it required multiple parties in different locations using complex security measures.</p>



<p>Regardless of the extra-careful planning and execution plus redundant security, Zcash users and observers had to trust the historical fact that the ceremony participants weren’t conspiring to deceive the public. Trusted setups don’t allow for a mathematically verifiable supply, and as long as these complicated procedures were required for major Zcash upgrades, there would always be doubters and detractors. And the doubters would have a point — mathematics is verifiable, but history isn’t. The reputation and integrity of Zcash was being challenged, and in ECC’s view, this was an issue the community couldn’t afford to ignore.</p>



 NU5: A call to action 



<p>In 2019, ECC engineers Sean Bowe, Daira Emma Hopwood, and Jack Grigg had been working on scalability design and experimenting with a solution for efficient recursion when Bowe made a discovery.</p>



<p>“I just stumbled upon a technique to do this zero-knowledge proof construction on completely ordinary elliptic curves,” Bowe said. “And so over the course of maybe 24 hours, it went from, ‘Ooh, that’s really exciting, that’ll be neat if we can do that’ to ‘Holy crap, now that we don’t have trusted setups or anything, it’s all really simple. It was a series of steps that turned from a nice insight into a complete paradigm shift.”</p>



<p>Halo, as it would come to be known, is a zero-knowledge proving system that enables recursion without a trusted setup in an efficient way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bowe’s discovery was a cryptographic breakthrough heralded by the industry, and in 2021 ECC committed to implementing Halo in Zcash.</p>



<p>Halo on Zcash would make trustless, private, digital-cash transactions possible for the first time on mobile phones. It would serve as a catalyst for Zcash user confidence and provide a path to much greater scalability, while making the protocol more attractive, faster, and less expensive for others to build on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the ECC blog:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Halo on Zcash would enable circuit upgrades without the need for trusted setups, making the Zcash shielded protocol more agile for future improvements, such as supporting additional assets like [Zcash Shielded Assets, or ZSAs]. We want to make it easy for other projects and tokens to benefit from Zcash features, such as privacy through encryption. Trusted setup will become a remnant of the past.</p>



<p>In addition, this upgrade would pave the way for shielded Zcash scale through proof aggregation and blockchain succinctness, two scalability improvements. This would improve the user experience by eliminating frustrating synchronization time that plagues all blockchains today, reducing the traditional blockchain bloat, and allowing for non-escalating fees as usage increases. In conversations with large social platforms who expressed interest in native Zcash support, a viable path to scalability was given as a requisite near-term consideration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In January 2021, after more than a year of Halo R&amp;D, ECC concluded that the benefits of Halo on Zcash outweighed other protocol priorities, and we proposed implementing it in NU5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/8qSA29vWWds?si=6hvbieHC23DzuvmX">Zcash Media video</a> about the original Ceremony, its participants (including Edward Snowden), and how Halo makes trusted setups obsolete.</p>



 NU5 objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our NU5 goals from the outset were to (1) make Zcash more secure, (2) give Zcash users confidence by making the supply mathematically verifiable, (3) make future upgrades easier, and (4) enable future upgrades to benefit from recursive proofs for scalability and programmability improvements.</p>



<p>Our original estimate of 6-7 months turned out to be overly optimistic — as new discoveries were made, opportunities were revealed in the process, and technical complexities arose — and in the end the journey took almost a year and a half.</p>



<p>Along the way, we confronted a number of technical challenges. For example, the complexity of including Orchard support in the zcashd embedded wallet was not properly accounted for in the original estimates for the NU5 timeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ECC faced time-consuming engineering hurdles, like building a complicated circuit for Halo-plus-Orchard to make it work on mobile devices. And midstream, we made the decision to implement <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/unified-addresses-in-zcash-explained/">unified addresses</a> (UAs) to enable shielded by default in supporting wallets. The design and build-out of UAs were difficult, and if ECC had been practicing product-driven planning and development at the time (like we are now) we believe we would have identified the need for UAs sooner and their implementation would have been smoother.</p>



<p>In addition to battling technical obstacles like these, plus a few <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-4-5-1/">surprise bugs</a>, ECC spent significant time and resources advocating for and defending our roadmap decisions against criticism for: our rationale (getting rid of trusted setup wasn’t worth the time and effort, ZSAs were more important), our planning (we kicked off the discussion publicly before planning enough -and- we planned too much before starting the work), the decision to license Orchard under the Bootstrap Open Source Licence (BOSL), the decision to implement Unified Addresses (UAs), and our overall approach to network upgrades (our priorities were arbitrary and out of touch).</p>



<p>It’s important to acknowledge that we had significant community support during the process, too. Overall, community sentiment was positive. We received valuable insight and feedback from our <a href="https://electriccoin.co/team/">Scientific Advisory Board</a> and crucial security audits from <a href="https://hackmd.io/@qedit/zcash-nu5-audit">Qedit</a> and <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/11/02/public-report-zcash-nu5-cryptography-review/">NCC group</a>.</p>



 NU5 timeline and accomplishments 



<p>Not including the pre-implementation research and development, NU5 was a 17-month endeavor that delivered novel technology and improved Zcash user experience.&nbsp;</p>

 May 31, 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash/">NU5 activates on mainnet</a>, eliminating trusted setup for the new Orchard pool and launching a new era for Zcash 
 



<p>When Zcash NU5 activated on mainnet May 31, 2022, it was one of the most important milestones for Zcash since the cryptocurrency launched in 2016. As ECC CEO Zooko Wilcox put it, “an historic step forward for human society.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In launching the Orchard shielded payment protocol utilizing Halo, we eliminated the trusted setup to improve Zcash security and sustainability, made the supply mathematically verifiable, improved scalability because future network upgrades won’t require a complicated setup ceremony, paved the way for increased interoperability by providing a system that could unlock private cross-chain proofs at scale, and introduced BOSL which has returned value to the Zcash community (e.g., Filecoin Foundation and Ethereum Foundation grants to Brave and Edge).</p>



<p>It was a massive effort, and after almost a year and a half of building and wrestling with the technical challenges of NU5, the ECC Core team was ready for some rest. But almost right away, Zcash was hit with another issue we couldn’t ignore.</p>



 



 The sandblasting attack 



<p>In June 2022, almost immediately after ECC launched NU5, a serious problem emerged. The Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction size and activity. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented some wallets (Nighthawk, Edge, and Unstoppable) from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. Wallets weren’t syncing and some users weren’t able to access their funds.</p>



<p>This was a problem that ECC, as the primary maintainer of zcashd and supplier of mobile-wallet SDKs, was best-positioned to confront.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: A call to action 



<p>Some parties at ECC did not initially want to make the assumption that this unusual transaction load was the work of a malicious actor. Eventually however, the evidence that it was a malicious actor became overwhelming — and we have reason to believe it may even have been coordinated by the same actor or group of actors who spread Zcash FUD, and that they may have been paid to do so.</p>



<p>But solving that mystery was less important than fixing the problem.&nbsp;</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could regain access to and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world, private digital cash.</p>



<p>As an initial line of defense, we released&nbsp; performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80%. We also began working on performance upgrades to our mobile wallet SDKs.</p>



<p>In August 2022, with lots of work left to solve these wallet performance issues, ECC went into Emergency Mode. This was our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>The wallet performance issues presented a complicated series of challenges to address, and they required developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that would give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. The solution required changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>



<p>Internally, fee changes were debated from the get-go, but for the first few months, the ECC team focused on additional performance improvements and worked to resolve the issue without fee changes. Later, we decided to implement fee changes to throttle the spam attack.</p>



<p>As users became frustrated with their user experience, some community members became vocal and publicly criticized ECC for not being prepared for the attack and slow to respond.</p>



<p>In February 2023, we were notified by blockchain security firm Halborn of <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">vulnerabilities</a> inherited from Bitcoin Core that may have affected more than 280 chains, including Zcash. This was another all-hands-on-deck emergency on top of the wallet performance issues, and as ECC was the only team notified of the vulnerability, we were the only ones who could make the necessary fixes. The coordination of the disclosure and remediation consumed approximately a month of our time.</p>



<p>To make matters worse, ECC as an engineering organization was attempting to do too many things at once: core node maintenance, supporting CEXes like Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini, backports from Bitcoin, mobile SDKs, mobile wallet applications, and future protocol improvements. ECC <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">restructured</a> in May 2023, which further strained resources temporarily.</p>



 Additional challenges 



 
 At the time, ECC internal communication and project management practices weren’t organized for an Emergency Mode situation. This affected our understanding of priorities and workflow across teams. 



 Before the attack, ECC product strategy focused on adoption first, instead of performance and scalability. Users want new features, and working on improving performance slows feature releases. But the attack took Zcash UX to the limits immediately. 



 Technical debt: We had implemented previous network upgrades with only limited performance improvements. 



 ECC vastly underestimated how long it would take to fix outstanding wallet performance issues. 



 Other technical issues arose that caused delays, such as when speed.z.cash bitrotted and then got deleted while ECC was without a devops manager.&nbsp; 



 The ECC Core team had three different managers during Emergency Mode. 



 Emergency Mode slowed development of our planned wallet product, now known as Zashi. However, we were able to leverage the prototype internally to validate and test SDK improvements. 
 



<p>ECC was lucky to have proactive wallet partners — Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable — who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Timeline and accomplishments 



<p>In all, ECC’s sandblasting response and implementation by third-party wallets consumed about 16 months. By November 2023, Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable were working again (better than ever), and we announced an end to Emergency Mode.</p>



 Timeline 



 
 June 2022: Network spamming began; shielded outputs jumped from a monthly average of 42,600 to 21,622,590 in June alone 



 July 2022: Implemented performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80% and began working on performance improvements to our mobile wallet SDKs 



 August 2022: ECC officially entered <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860">Emergency Mode</a>, although we didn’t use that term in public written communications until March 2023; started researching Spend Before Sync 



 September 2022: While working on zcashd and improved mobile sync experience, re-opened research into possible fee change mechanisms (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317">ZIP 317</a>) and syncing efficiencies (<a href="https://hackmd.io/@str4d/dagsync-graph-aware-zcash-wallets">DAGSync</a>/Spend Before Sync) 



 October 2022: Released zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-3-0/">5.3.0</a> with additional performance improvements to reduce concurrent memory utilization during scanning among other memory and performance related optimisations in the zcashd node 



 October 2022: Reaffirmed our immediate objectives regarding syncing issues with our wallet SDKs and <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/29">communicated our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode</a> 



 October 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-thirty-year-vision/">Communicated our intent </a>to have wallet performance issues resolved by the end of February 2023 



 October 2022: Changes to zcashd increased its robustness against the attack 



 November 2022: Identified and fixed the last known bugs that were blocking the first phase of SDK releases, continued progress on Spend Before Sync, and began prepping both zcashd and mobile wallets for ZIP 317; squashed the last known librustzcash bugs that were blocking wallet release and completed Android &amp; iOS SDK integration 



 December 2022: Completed the implementation of zcashd optimizations expected to save memory and to reduce orphan rates for miners 



 February 2023: Released zcashd<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-4-0/"> 5.4.0</a> to introduce a number of performance improvements, an update to correct supply reporting, and a clean up of legacy features and support functionality to improve ongoing maintenance of the codebase 



 March 2023: Published an <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/update-addressing-zcash-wallet-performance-issues/">update and release schedule</a> calling for an end to Emergency Mode by the end of May 



 April 2023: ECC released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-5-0/">5.5.0</a> with the completed transaction-fee-structure change (ZIP 317) and infrastructure improvements that laid the groundwork for 5.6.0. 



 May 2023: (Restructuring at ECC) Pushed the release date for zcashd 5.6.0, lightwalletd, and SDKs to mid-June. As zcashd 5.5.0 began to be adopted by miners on the network, the fee structure changes began to blunt the efficacy of the sandblasting attack, reducing the rate of blockchain growth and wallet scanning load. 



 June 2023: Released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-6-0/">zcashd 5.6.0</a>, introducing the functionality necessary for light wallets to access spendable funds without fully scanning the blockchain; included updates to address issues related to the ZIP-317 implementation and privacy policy features. 



 July 2023: Lightwalletd 0.4.14 was released, which meant the mobile wallet SDK was the only outstanding piece in ECC’s plan to resolve wallet performance issues and exit Emergency Mode. At this point, we had hoped to release the SDKs in mid-July. 



 August 2023: By the end of July, the adoption of zcashd 5.5.0 by the network was complete, and network transaction load had returned to pre-NU5 levels. However, the accumulated chain data to this point still presented a problem for wallet scanning, and so to mitigate this issue ECC announced the pre-release availability of the Spend before Sync capability in our mobile SDKs and made this functionality available to wallet developers for testing. Several bugs and UX issues were discovered. Timeline for the SDK releases was shifted to mid-September. 



 September 2023: New bugs, UX issues, and dependencies arose that pushed the SDKs release date out to the end of September. 



 Sept. 26, 2023: ECC <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/162">released the updated mobile SDK 2.0</a> for both iOS and Android developers. This was the final deliverable for exiting Emergency Mode. 



 Nov. 1, 2023: After a month in production, no related, major wallet issues were reported and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/wallet-performance-issues-resolved-ecc-exiting-emergency-mode/">ECC declared an exit from Emergency Mode</a>. 
 



<p>The culmination of our sandblasting response was that third-party Zcash wallets were working again, and future attackers were further disadvantaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



 



 The work continues 



<p>NU5 and the sandblasting attack consumed nearly three years. But faced with organized adversity, competing emergencies, and community criticism (some of it warranted), ECC did not stray from our commitment to build. With allies along the way, the community overcame unprecedented technical challenges and resource constraints to make Zcash more resilient, reliable, and safe.</p>



<p>We learned a lot, and although we’d love to step back and take a break, we know the work is more important now than ever. We look forward to distilling the lessons from these experiences in the upcoming retrospective, and we’re honored to continue the effort to build for economic freedom and a world-class Zcash user experience.</p>

  Black Holes and the Intelligence Explosion  <p>Extreme scenarios of AI focus on what is logically possible rather than what is physically possible. What does physics have to say about AI risk?</p>   
	By Dan Roberts	 

Published December 7, 2023
  



 
<p>For better or for worse, physicists will try to understand things that are not obviously physics, with physics. As a <a href="https://danintheory.com/">physicist-turned-AI-founder-and-researcher</a>, I liked to imagine black holes as computers. (In some sense, they’re the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound">largest</a> and maybe the <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v9/49">fastest</a> kind.) In this essay, we consider whether some very special computers will become black holes before they become gods.</p>



 Rising machines 



<p>Artificial intelligence has been a part of speculative fiction long before there was a specific genre called science fiction. AI has also been a part of computer science (though not exclusively so) for (almost) as long as there have been computers. In 1956, the Dartmouth Workshop coined the name “artificial intelligence” for the study of machines that think like humans, and set out to solve the task in a <a href="https://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart564props.pdf">single summer</a>.1 &nbsp;That didn’t really work out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">as planned</a>.</p>



<p>One peculiar thing about progress in artificial intelligence is that the science is far outpaced by the technology: AI is still a “black box” that produces magical results such as winning Go moves, poker bluffs, emotional poems, compelling stories and stunning images. It’s easy to read about how to build such a system—though good luck actually doing so without a huge amount of capital and engineering talent—but nobody knows why, for example, a chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT produces this sentence and not that sentence when given a particular prompt.</p>



<p>But if AI is magic, then it can literally do anything … within the realm of logical possibility. Such possibilities include, according to some whose views are becoming <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">increasingly</a> <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">mainstream</a>, eliminating all biological life on earth.</p>



<p>How can we possibly evaluate these claims? If AI is a black box, how do we know what’s possible? <a href="https://kotaku.com/president-joe-biden-mission-impossible-ai-tech-order-1850980643">How do we separate sci-fi trope from scientific truth?</a></p>



 
 <p>No, seriously, in their above-linked proposal, they say, “We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems [of how to make machines think like humans] if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.”</p>   
 



 Simulated in our universe 



<p>To start, I think that AI systems are not black boxes and can be understood in the same way that we understand any other physical system—through physics!</p>



<p>Okaaaay, you say, what does the abstract AI model that implements ChatGPT have to do with, say, the thermodynamics of the gas inside a room?</p>



<p>(It’s really funny and great that you picked that particular comparison to physics, I’d say!2)</p>



<p>To determine the properties of the collective gas in the room—its thermodynamics—from the underlying motion of the ~1025 or so gas molecules—their statistical mechanics—we needed physical intuition and a set of mathematical tools. Together, these let us zoom out of the microscopic perspective—where we keep track of their individual positions and velocities—to derive macroscopic features—like temperature, volume and entropy.</p>



<p>Another type of microscopically complicated system is the deep neural network (DNN) architecture that underlies recent successful AI models. These models are built from taking a simple but programmable mathematical operation—the artificial neuron—arranging them in layers to perform many such operations in parallel—and then stacking many layers in series to get a complicated function that can, if asked, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">write a play</a> proving the infinitude of primes in the style of Shakespeare. In this case, the microscopic description of the DNN is the literal code that the AI programmer writes, specifying how input is transformed to output.</p>



<p>For a language model, the text is broken up into pieces called tokens that loosely correspond to words; each token is mapped into a high-dimensional vector; the sequence of high-dimensional vectors are mixed up, re-weighted and biased in various ways according to the precise numerical values of the model’s parameters that are learned over the course of a training process; and finally, the model determines a probability distribution over all possible next words given the input and can generate a new word by sampling from that distribution. However, that code is the answer to the how question—how is an output computed from this input—but not the why question—why this output and not another for this input?</p>



<p>This description of how a chatbot works is like the following (microscopic) way of thinking about the pressure exerted by a gas: pressure is force per area; each individual gas molecule imparts a force on the wall every time it randomly collides with the wall; so, we can understand pressure by tracking the position and velocity of every gas molecule in the room, track their collisions with the walls, and add up all the forces. Analogously, this answers the how question for the gas—how does pressure arise—but not the why question—why does pressure rise when the temperature increases?</p>



<p>To answer the why questions, what we found—and, to be clear, by we here I mean historical physicists—is that for some types of microscopically complicated systems, simple macro-level descriptions emerge as the number of the elementary components of the system grows very large. (For example, we can derive the ideal gas law and show pressure is proportional to temperature by studying the distribution of velocities of the gas.) Moreover, we historical physicists were then able to find iterative refinements to these simple descriptions to understand how changing the size of these systems changes their behavior.3 (In this way, we can systematically model deviations from the ideal gas law.) It turns out, that as a complicated system with a large number of elementary components, deep neural networks also have precisely the right properties that enable such a physics-inspired approach to help us understand why they work as they do.4</p>



<p>But this is just an analogy to physics. There also is an explicit reason why physics matters for simulating an AI on a supercomputer.</p>



<p>To see why, consider that when we—and by we here I mean <a href="https://x.com/miramurati/status/1726542556203483392?s=20">the people of OpenAI</a>—build ChatGPT, we need a physical object to contain ChatGPT’s parameters—the weights and biases that control the behavior of the artificial neurons in the network and thus define and implement ChatGPT—and make them available to process input prompts. This object is (vestigially) called a graphics processing unit—a GPU—and each GPU has a fixed amount of internal memory for storing the parameters of AI models.</p>



<p>To train and then run frontier AI systems like ChatGPT, you must leverage not one, but many such GPUs, organized together into a kind of supercomputer: groups of eight GPUs are assembled and connected together in a type of box called a GPU node so they can communicate at high speeds, and then GPU nodes are further stacked and connected together in a GPU cluster inside of a room known as a data center.</p>



<p>At the risk of being pedantic, let’s <a href="https://labs.openai.com/s/4VjlheyWjFRHi4yxu06nenOa">imagine</a> that that room—the data center that contains the supercomputer running ChatGPT—also contains the gas whose thermodynamics we were just discussing. As anyone who is old enough to have bought a GPU for its original purpose—gaming—knows, GPUs come with fans because they generate a lot of heat. Needless to say, thermodynamics of the gas inside a data center is very much impacted by running ChatGPT!</p>



<p>In other words, AI systems are physical objects, and AI inference plays out in physical space. As such, all purported superintelligences are ultimately subject to the physical limits of computation. That’s the main point of this essay.</p>



 
 One could say that the proverbial “black box” was originally just a (black) box of gas… 



 In physics, this goes by the name of the renormalization group, which is a kind of physical refinement and extension of the central limit theorem in math/statistics. 



 For some details, check out this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00008">essay,</a> and for a full blueprint of this approach, check out this <a href="https://deeplearningtheory.com/">book.</a>   
 
 







 
 Collapse into a black hole 



<p>To see why this matters, I want you to now take a moment and imagine an AGI with access to unbounded computational resources. To those worried about the risk such systems may pose to humankind, this thought experiment is often tantamount to imagining an all-powerful <a href="https://ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2">god</a> that can do anything. For instance:</p>



 
 It could be an information oracle—the ultimate successor to Google—as it would encapsulate and reason about the sum total of human knowledge.5 



 It could be used to “solve” science and create new technologies that we can hardly imagine. 



 It could escape the confines of your laptop by using the internet to synthesize artificial life.6 



 It could capture you inside the confines of your laptop by simulating you so accurately that you’d have no objective way of knowing whether you’re the physical you or the simulated you… and then torture that simulation to make you do its bidding. Maybe it creates one billion such simulations, making it near certain that the you having subjective conscious experiences is being simulated?7&nbsp; 



 (I’ll patiently wait here while you ask ChatGPT for a continuation.) 
 



<p>Where did this list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark">jump the shark</a> for you? As for me, rather than enumerating the possibilities of god, I started by imagining a black hole.</p>



<p>Lurking at the very extreme of any physical system lie black holes. Try to pack too much stuff—matter or energy—into any fixed volume, and you’ll find yourself a black hole; try to gather a large enough collection of identical objects together, and you’ll also find yourself a black hole. Although it may not be intuitive, this also places a limit on the amount of computation you can put together in any region of space.</p>



<p>To see why, consider what would have to happen if we scaled up our AGI system towards unbounded computation: as our hypothetical AGI becomes larger, we’ll need more and more GPUs to physically run it. This means constructing more and more GPU nodes, and networking them together in increasingly bigger GPU clusters.</p>



<p>So, how big of a GPU supercomputer can we—and by we here I mean literally anyone, whether humanly or artificially intelligent—actually make?</p>



 
 And it would not hallucinate facts or sources when providing responses. 



 Example from Yudkowsky’s recent Time <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">essay,</a> where he suggests that “to visualize a hostile superhuman AI …[v]isualize an entire alien civilization, thinking at millions of times human speeds …allowing an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms or bootstrap straight to postbiological molecular manufacturing.” 



 See e.g. this short <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/c5GHf2kMGhA4Tsj4g/the-ai-in-a-box-boxes-you">post</a> by Stuart Armstrong, or perhaps watch some <a href="https://streamberry.tv/">Streamberry.</a> 
 



 Bounding computation 



<p>Untangling various network cables and contemplating a bound, let’s consider the interplay of economic limitations, technological limitations and, finally, physical limitations.</p>



<p>As anyone working in AI right now knows, procuring GPUs is extremely difficult, so even an order for only a finite number of GPUs will still take an undefined amount of time to materialize. These supply issues are of course not fundamental obstructions to building, but they do point to the heart of economic issues in scaling: how much of the world’s resources can actually be put to training a single AI model?</p>



<p>Estimates for the cost of supercomputers capable of training the current state-of-the-art LLMs are of order $100M. If the next-generation cluster <a href="https://twitter.com/pfau/status/1644741636172251137?s=20">costs $1B</a>, how many more generations remain? Sure, some very big (as in tech) corporations will be able to spend $10B, though beyond that, there are only ~150 companies globally with a market cap above $100B, and today’s biggest company, Apple, has a market cap of (only) ~$3T. Beyond even that, while the U.S. government can command more resources than an Elon Musk—though let us ignore the near-impossible amount of coordination it would take to incorporate frontier AI efforts into a functioning government institution—$100B–$1T is a likely overall U.S. maximum.8 Even so, imagine that we—and by we here I mean literally everyone—band together and devote all economic productivity towards building the biggest computer, there’s still not much room until we surpass the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD">gross world product </a>(which itself just crossed $100T in 2022). Altogether, this points to roughly 2-3 non-government iterations left (e.g., OpenAI can release GPT-6 or 7), or 5 all-in-world iterations left, before the end of economic scaling.</p>



<p>Ignoring the economics for the moment, couldn’t we in principle just keep making our supercomputers faster? Following the current gradient of innovation, we can see this strategy at work both at the level of the GPU—where we’ve been squeezing more and more transistors together on the same chip—and at the level of the cluster—where we’ve been networking together more and more GPUs in increasingly larger data centers.9 However, trends of smaller transistors and larger clusters are powered by breakthroughs in technology—stacks of innovations that enable us to engineer smaller transistors or efficiently power and connect clusters of GPUs—that are increasingly on a collision course with fundamental limits of physics.</p>



<p>While it’s more difficult to do in-context napkin-math as we did two paragraphs ago, we can give some intuition. The driving inspiration for faster GPUs is Moore’s law, one version of which—the empirical observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles roughly every two years—has held since its first observation in 1965.10 Unfortunately, such observations are likely to be discontinued: <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">estimates</a> predict that transistors made of silicon can be shrunk only by an additional factor of four before the hot environment of the GPU will begin to create computational errors.11</p>



<p>Moore’s-over, making bigger clusters is more than simply stacking server racks in bigger and bigger buildings: each node needs to be properly powered and cooled and networked.12 The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/06/what-is-nvidia-nvlink/">interconnections</a> between GPUs are an essential technology of the supercomputer, since each GPU needs to communicate with every other GPU for a supercomputer-sized AI model to function. Note though that as the earthly footprint of any cluster grows, the typical distance between GPUs is growing with the square-root of that footprint (e.g. the typical linear dimension of the data center): thus, regardless of how good interconnect technology becomes, “<a href="https://www.wired.com/1996/08/id/">the speed of light sucks,</a>” and latency is unavoidable in any superbrain.</p>



<p>So at some point (soon) we’ll reach a bound of how transformer-dense a chip can be, and putting more transformer-dense material together in the same room may not help us because the different parts of that material will be increasingly separated in space, making it harder and harder for it to communicate internally. Perhaps we can account for the former limitation by replacing transistors—e.g., move from electronics to photonics—or maybe we can somehow address the latter constraint by inventing better distributed computing algorithms? Now as computational optimists, let’s say we—and by we here I mean … you know what, I suppose that by we here I mean an actual superintelligent AGI—redirected our entire economy to further scaling the AI, converted all of our natural resources—perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence">literally the planet</a>—into GPUs, and remedied the technical limitations above. What then?</p>



<p>Unfortunately there’s still a terminal point to this kind of scaling due to a more fundamental kind of physics: if you put enough GPUs together, eventually something very surprising is going to happen; they’re going to collapse into a black hole!13 &nbsp;The gravitational attraction of each of the GPU servers to one another is outrageously tiny, but, if you stick roughly 1037 of them together, they will eventually matter in a very serious way.14</p>



 
 As a point of comparison, the entire U.S. Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3326875/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-defense-budget">budget</a> for 2024 is (only) $842B. 



 N.B. there are also gradient-free, if you will, <a href="https://lightmatter.co/">innovations</a> to pay attention to. 



 An alternate version of Moore’s law—which observes that every two years the number of transistors doubles at the lowest price per transistor—has already <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">broken down.</a> 



 In technical terms, this is the scale at which <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/106/19/193503/27706/The-fundamental-downscaling-limit-of-field-effect">thermodynamic fluctuations</a> will begin to dominate. 



 Okay here’s some in-footnote napkin-math: a state-of-the-art GPU node (Nvidia’s DGX H100) uses about <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">10 kilowatts</a> of power; ignoring all the other power needs of the data center—e.g., cooling—a cluster of a million such nodes (8,000,000 GPUs)—roughly ~360x larger than the largest <a href="https://inflection.ai/inflection-ai-announces-1-3-billion-of-funding">publicly known</a> AI cluster and a naive sticker price of ~$500B—would require the amount of power needed at peak by all of NYC in the summer. (See, e.g., Table I-3a, Zone J, <a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/2226333/2022-Gold-Book-Final-Public.pdf/cd2fb218-fd1e-8428-7f19-df3e0cf4df3e">here.</a>) Generating and delivering even that lower-bounded amount of power would be extremely nontrivial. 



 More in-footnote napkin-math: one of Nvidia’s <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">DGX H100 servers</a> contains 8 GPUs, has a volume of 0.15 m3, and weighs 130 kg. Meanwhile, the Schwarzschild radius Rs = 2GNM relates the mass of a black hole to its radius, where Rs is the Schwarzschild radius, M is the mass, and GN = 6.67 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 is Newton’s gravitational constant. If you try to pack enough mass into a small enough region with linear dimensions R such that R/M = 2GN, you will form a black hole. For any collection of N objects of constant density, the mass of the collection scales like N, but the radius of the collection scales like N1/3. Thus, R/M ~N−2/3, and you will always eventually form a black hole by increasing the number of objects in your collection.&nbsp; 



 For comparison, GPT-4 was trained on an order of only 104 GPUs. I hope it’s obvious, but not even the biggest AGI <a href="https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets">accelerationist</a> is likely to bet on the actual existence of 1037 GPUs. 
 



 Practically speaking 



<p>1037 GPUs is a lot. So is 1036. (And so is 101, if you’re a startup, and 100 if you’re just a person. GPUs are expensive.) So what?</p>



<p>Is there anything on our list of unbounded-compute god-like AGI powers above that we expect is limited at 1036 GPUs but permitted at 1037 GPUs?</p>



<p>Items (i) and (ii) are the entire point of investing in AI today. It would be a tragedy if they were not possible. LLMs with the right guardrails and retrieval abilities already are information oracles. Given that humans can reason and do science—some of us without even any GPUs(!)—it’s not clear that a scaling bound from physics will limit AI.15</p>



<p>The <a href="https://intelligence.org/ie-faq/">original AI doomer concern</a> is born out of the idea of an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808604180">intelligence explosion</a>: future AGI systems will have a general intelligence that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems…</p>



<p>This idea is sometimes called <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/recursive-self-improvement">recursive self-improvement</a>; it’s really just the basic idea that investments—in this case, in intelligence—compound exponentially.</p>



<p>The point of this discussion is really just to illustrate the point that there’s no such thing as unbounded computation. This cycle will stop. All aspiring AGIs and their companies are first subject to practical constraints on computation—such as raising an enormous amount of capital to build or access a supercomputer—but even if those “prosaic” limitations are overcome, any derived AGI systems are ultimately subject to a variety of fundamental physical constraints.16</p>



<p>So, does a physical limit of computation perspective on AI matter in practice?</p>



 
 If your conception of AI is as new technology—perhaps even the most incredibly transformative technology—then, I think, likely no. 



 If your conception of AI is creating an infinitely powerful god (or maybe summoning a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzb_CSRO-0g">demon)</a>—a technology that may as well be unbounded magic—then, I think, likely yes. 
 



 
 For items (iii) and (iv), I really don’t know. We—you and me(!?)—should do some physics calculations and find out! 



 Not to mention any <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">“artificial” compute bounds</a> that may be put in place. 
 



 Cutting tails 



<p>By discussing a limit and embedding it in physics, I hope to differentiate between AI—the technology—from AI—the religion. Of course, if you are worried about an infinitely-powerful AGI god, then (self-consistent) fiction shapes your thinking about AI: anything permitted by logic raises a valid concern. My point is that that’s far too broad: thoughtful applications of physical constraints can cut off the very long tail of AI risk and restrict us to a more limited set of outcomes.17&nbsp;</p>



<p>Limited, but not any less crucial. For this reason, I think we should focus on the costs and benefits of AI as we would other revolutionary technologies, rather than treating it as something mythical. Demoting AI from god to tech, from religion to science, still leaves us the ability to accelerate both technology and science—right up to the limits imposed by the laws of physics. In other words, the really exciting outcome from our list of (i)-(v) above is the one where we build a toolfor scientific reasoning.</p>



<p>To get there, we’ll need new ideas that go beyond <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361">pure compute scaling</a>. For researchers, for engineers, and for founders, that’s a (scientific) reason to be optimistic.</p>



 
 Just so we are clear, we are not claiming that a superintelligent AI would, as a cartoon villain set on world domination, choose to ignore the laws of physics and hubristically find itself confined in a black hole. On the one hand, this would certainly be very funny and a hilarious failure mode for any AI that aspires to commit malfeasance via item (iii) above. On the other hand, if you attempted item (v), as I did, you might have noticed that nowhere among ChatGPT’s very imaginatively-boring answers does it make this point; the current AI is blissfully unaware that its successors may be limited by physics. On our third hand, at the very least we may assume that some future chatbots may read this essay…

 The integration is supported by an automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, that enables simple yield opportunities on day one for all users on EON. &nbsp; 



<p>The Horizen ecosystem is excited to announce its integration with <a href="https://docs.ascent.exchange/">Ascent Exchange</a> with simple yield opportunities via <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vault</a>. This integration is set to significantly enhance the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> platform’s capabilities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, bringing a new level of innovation and efficiency to the industry.</p>



 A New Chapter in DeFi: Horizen EON Meets Ascent Exchange 



<p>This integration represents a major step forward for the Horizen EON ecosystem. By joining forces with Ascent Exchange, Horizen EON leverages Ascent’s expertise in decentralized exchange operations, propelling our platform to new heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Moreover, this integration underlines a shared vision for a unified and interoperable digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can flourish across various platforms.</p>



<a href="https://ascent.exchange"></a>



<blockquote>
<p></p>



<p>“Our integration with Ascent Exchange is a testament to Horizen EON’s commitment to interoperability and resilience in the blockchain ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent’s expertise, coupled with Horizen’s EVM-compatible platform, marks a significant milestone towards creating a more interconnected and robust DeFi ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent Exchange’s early adoption of the Horizen EON platform is set to redefine the DeFi trading space.”&nbsp;</p>
– Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs.</blockquote>



 Simple Yield Opportunities on Ascent Exchange via ICHI Vaults 



  
<p>Ascent Exchange was launched on day one with the support of an automated liquidity management protocol called <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vaults</a>. </p>



<p>This will enable liquidity providers to earn yield with their favorite tokens on Ascent Exchange. Each ICHI Vault allows a depositor to deposit a single token which will then be used as liquidity in an underlying liquidity pool. The Vault prioritizes deposit token yield while protecting from impermanent loss. ICHI Vaults will be launched for a wide range of assets supported by Ascent Exchange.</p>
 <a href="https://ichi.org/"></a> 



 The Ascent Exchange Impact on Horizen EON 



<p>The integration of Ascent Exchange into the Horizen EON ecosystem is expected to bring numerous benefits. As the first decentralized exchange with ve(3,3) tokenomics on Horizen EON, Ascent Exchange is poised to establish a new benchmark in DeFi trading. This strategic move by Ascent Exchange is anticipated to attract a substantial volume of trading activities and users, thereby reinforcing Horizen EON’s position as a leading platform for developers and DeFi enthusiasts.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“As Ascent Exchange embarks on its journey with Horizen EON. We are positioned at the forefront of decentralized exchanges, leveraging a first-mover advantage that sets the stage for unparalleled innovation. </p>



<p>Horizen EON’s exceptional scalability and efficiency empower us to process an increased volume of transactions swiftly and cost-effectively, revolutionizing our operational capabilities. Fundamental to our ethos, the robust security protocols of Horizen EON ensure an unwaveringly secure and trustworthy environment for our users. Embracing the shared values of decentralization and innovation, we join hands with the vibrant Horizen community, further enriching our community-centric approach. </p>



<p>This pivotal shift not only reflects our evolution but also embodies our commitment to exploring new horizons in decentralized finance, inviting our community to be a part of this exciting journey.”</p>
-Bones, Founding member of Ascent Exchange</blockquote>

  Partnering with Squint: Instructions for the Real World  <p>Devin and his team are bringing cutting-edge AR to the factory floor.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/jess-lee/">Jess Lee</a>	 

Published November 29, 2023
  



Team Squint



 
<p>Every once in a while, technology brings us a magical moment of delight. I remember the first time I used an Apple AirTag. The navigational arrows, haptic feedback and “10 ft away” message created a simple, intuitive way to find my erstwhile keys—and effectively bridged the gap between my mobile device and the real world.&nbsp;</p>



Magic



<p>Squint brings that same Apple-like magic to industrial work. Much in the same way an AirTag can help you find your keys, Squint is a mobile app for the industrial floor—that shows workers step-by-step instructions for how to use machinery.</p>



More magic, on the factory floor



<p>Imagine you’re a worker in a high-stakes industrial setting, navigating a maze of complex equipment on a factory floor. You’ve just been asked to switch production lines because the factory is understaffed, but you’re not familiar with the new machine you need to use. Your options are: a) ask the worker who’s been at the factory for 10 years and knows how to use everything—but they’re super busy, b) read the paper manual—but it’s buried in a binder in the storage room and difficult to find, or c) just wing it—but that could be dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Squint, you have a better option: simply point your mobile device at the equipment to get instant help. Teams can document and record every step of an important procedure, then the app guides workers through it in the real world, augmented with video and all the institutional knowledge they need to do their jobs effectively and safely. You can even use it to check logs, leave notes for the next shift and report maintenance issues. It’s the digital equivalent of the person who’s been at the factory for 10 years, hovering over your shoulder, helping you out.</p>







<p>As America faces an industrial labor shortage, Squint also offers a sorely needed boost in manufacturing productivity and worker retention. Manufacturing is the nation’s fifth largest employment category and growing, as more companies move operations to the U.S. from Asia. However, a quarter of industrial workers are older than 55 and will soon retire, leaving a widening skill gap behind. To bridge it, companies including Colgate-Palmolive, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Michelin, JTEKT, Siemens and Volvo are using Squint to train and retain employees, increase productivity and ensure safety. Colgate-Palmolive, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhGSvkapruc">found</a> procedures were completed 50% faster with Squint—regardless of a worker’s experience level with the equipment. They also saw greater accuracy and reduced training times, and unlocked new insights through Squint’s built-in analytics.</p>



<p>When I first met Squint founder and CEO Devin Bhushan in 2015, he was a 23-year-old software engineer at Yahoo, tasked with writing the Flurry mobile app all by himself. Despite having no prior iOS experience, he did just that—and helped Yahoo’s customers understand their product analytics. He later joined Splunk, where he led the mobile AR team that made data visible for industrial companies. There, he was inundated by requests from customers to see not just their Splunk data, but all their data—and thus Squint was born. Devin’s experience across mobile, AR and product analytics makes him uniquely suited to lead Squint and pioneer this new category of software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia had the privilege of leading Squint’s $3.5M seed round earlier this year, and we got a front-row seat to the team’s incredible pace of progress when Devin and founding PM Dylan Conway joined us for Sequoia <a href="http://arc.sequoiacap.com">Arc</a>, our catalyst for pre-seed and seed-stage companies. Over the last six months, Squint’s tremendous market pull gave us the conviction to lean in and lead the Series A.</p>



Squint Founding PM Dylan Conway and Founder and CEO Devin Bhushan at Sequoia Arc



<p>We’re thrilled to be in business with Devin and his team, and excited for the possibilities they’ll continue to unlock with AR and AI. While today Squint is focused on industrial use cases, we can imagine the app someday becoming the instruction manual for any device or place—from your new coffee maker or camera to your Airbnb stay. This is only the beginning for Squint, and we’re excited to be their partners for the journey ahead.</p>

<p>Phone numbers are pervasive and continue to proliferate as digital identifiers. In many ways, they are a person’s most personal digital identifier. However, the traditional framework doesn’t allow users to have true ownership of their numbers, and hence, their primary digital identities. Given that phone numbers are allocated by centralized entities, securing a number often means disclosing personal information, thereby posing a risk to individual privacy.</p><p>This conventional setup is susceptible to SIM swapping attacks, a rising concern as highlighted by the FBI. In fact, the number of SIM swap fraud cases <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208">increased by 400% year over year since 2020</a>. according to a report by the Federal Trade Commission. Such scenarios have led to numerous high-profile thefts, particularly targeting crypto assets and hijacking prominent social media accounts to mislead followers.</p><p>Moreover, the existing reliance on SMS technology, which debuted over 30 years ago, is outdated and lacks security measures. The architecture remains largely unchanged, without encryption support, thus exposing messages sent via SMS to unauthorized access within a given cellular&nbsp;network.</p><p><a href="https://www.3num.co/">3NUM</a> is poised to revolutionize phone communication systems. They are developing a phone number and messaging system&nbsp;that:</p>  Ensures end-to-end encryption for secure communications.  Provides true user ownership of mobile phone numbers, fortified by public key cryptography.  Preserves privacy, enabling users to join the network without relinquishing any personally identifying information.  Maintains the confidentiality of phone numbers, preventing public disclosure.  Mitigates SIM-swapping threats as it transcends the dependency on SIM cards or centralized, vulnerable services.  Integrates with alternative identifiers like ENS, facilitating user-friendly name addressing as opposed to cumbersome multi-digit numbers.  <p>Mobile communication has become the primary modality for people to stay in touch with each other and with the important events happening around them. The time to upgrade this core infrastructure is long overdue. BlueYard is proud to support the 3NUM team in this important mission.</p>

<p>In essence, a multi-signature structure is a key security feature employed within the blockchain ecosystem to ensure that specific actions require the approval and cooperation of multiple parties before they can be executed. Unlike signatures in the physical world, signatures on a blockchain are performed using digital keys belonging to a certain party.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on a single digital signature, a multi-signature structure mandates that a predefined number of authorised signatures need to happen before a transaction can be executed.</p>



<p>It is important to note that in certain cases a multi-signature structure may also refer to a structure in which an action may require only one signature but has multiple parties that can authorise this action.</p>



 Why multi-signature structures are essential 



<p>But why would anyone use a multi-signature structure in the first place? The answer is simple: security. In a digital ecosystem in which certain actions can not be undone, it is crucial that the integrity and security of these transactions is guaranteed. A multi-signature structure adds an additional security layer to the blockchain ecosystem and addresses some of the security risks of single-signature structures.</p>



 Security risks of single-signature structures 



<p>Single-signature structures, where a single key holder can perform certain actions, are susceptible to various security risks and challenges, such as:</p>



 
 Single point of failure: A single compromised key, whether due to theft, hacking, or human error, can lead to unauthorised access and the loss of digital assets. High-profile hacks and cryptocurrency thefts, such as the infamous Mt. Gox hack in 2014, have often resulted from this single point of failure, putting significant amounts of wealth at risk. 



 Lack of accountability: In a single-signature system, the responsibility and accountability for transactions and decisions rest solely on the key holder. This setup can lead to abuse of power, lack of transparency, and difficulties in tracing fraudulent or unauthorised activities. 



 Loss of keys: The loss of a single private key can result in permanent loss of access to digital assets, which is a common and irreversible issue in the cryptocurrency space. A multi-signature structure can help prevent this while also increasing security. 
 



 Use cases of multi-signature structures 



<p>As is clear from the above, single-signature structures are simple and convenient but can carry significant security risks. Multi-signature structures can address some of these risks in the following ways in various domains:</p>



 
 Secure transactions: Multi-signature structures in wallets, accounts, or smart contracts are used to secure cryptocurrency transactions, requiring the approval of multiple key holders. This approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised or fraudulent transactions. 



 Governance: In corporate environments, multi-signature structures can ensure checks and balances by requiring multiple key holders to approve important actions like financial transactions, board resolutions, or contract agreements. Furthermore, they can be useful for any decentralised multi-party decision-making, such as in DAOs or for blockchain governance. 



 Escrow services: Multi-signature escrow accounts keep financial transactions safe, especially in complex deals. Funds are only released when certain conditions are met. Several key holders must agree, ensuring that the deal terms are followed. This adds an extra layer of security and trust in financial transactions, reducing the chances of disputes and fraud. 



 Custody services: Cryptocurrency custodians and exchanges use multi-signature structures to protect customer assets from threats, including insiders and hackers. With multi-signature wallets, access to assets is controlled by a group of key holders (and often third parties for added security). This makes it tough for a single person to access or manipulate the assets without approval. 



 Legal and compliance: Multi-signature structures are important for legal and compliance processes in the digital world. They ensure that multiple parties must agree on actions like signing contracts or complying with regulations. This reduces legal risks and makes sure these procedures are done correctly. Multi-signature structures promote transparency and security in legal and regulatory matters. 



 Emergency recovery: Multi-signature wallets can act as an emergency recovery mechanism, allowing access to digital assets in case of the loss of one key holder, enhancing the security of digital holdings. 
 



 Why is blockchain needed? 



<p>However, why wouldn’t you use more traditional signature-collection methods? In comparison to traditional methods like multiple Docusign signatures, blockchain offers distinct advantages, particularly in transparency, execution speed, and versatility. Docusign, while efficient for collecting signatures, lacks transparency and doesn’t tie actions directly to signing. It merely signifies approval without immediate execution.</p>



<p>Contrastingly, blockchain’s strength lies in its inherent transparency; each approval is linked to an immediate and irreversible execution of the proposed action. Whether it’s a transaction or a governance proposal, blockchain ensures swift and transparent execution, fostering trust among parties involved. Moreover, Docusign doesn’t provide flexibility in assigning different weights or thresholds for signing. Blockchain, on the other hand, offers versatile permission settings, enabling the establishment of varying levels of authorization. This flexibility extends beyond simple signature collection, making blockchain an invaluable tool for diverse transactional and governance needs within enterprises and across various industries.</p>



 How multi-signature structures work 



<p>Multi-signature structures can be created in multiple ways, such as via account systems, smart contracts, and wallets. While the set-up process for each of these ways can differ, these multi-signature structures all function in a similar way. In order to explain how multi-signature structures work, we will explain multi-signature structures using an account system that can be found on popular blockchains such as <a href="https://eosnetwork.com/">EOS</a>, <a href="https://www.wax.io/">WAX</a>, and <a href="https://xprnetwork.org/">XPR</a>.</p>



 Understanding account systems 



<p>Unlike blockchains like Bitcoin or Ripple which use a single keypair for all transactions, an account system has two different permissions. Permissions can be seen as requirements that need to be fulfilled in order for a transaction to go through. Each permission has certain actions associated with it. A default account has 2 native permissions, namely:</p>



 
 Owner: Shows ownership of the account and is needed to make any changes to the ownership of the account. 



 Active: Used for transferring funds, voting for validators, and making other high-level account changes. 
 



<p>Each permission has one or more key(s) associated with it. Each key associated with a permission has a certain weight, and each permission has a certain weight threshold which needs to be met before a transaction requiring that permission is accepted. This is how an account system works.</p>



 Single-signature structure 



<p>The default structure for these accounts is always a single signature structure. But what does that mean?</p>







<p>As can be seen in the image above, the owner permission has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. The same goes for the active permission which has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. This means that only the (private) key associated with the owner or active permission is required to perform any transaction requiring the owner or active permission, respectively.</p>



<p>In essence, similar to a Bitcoin address, only 1 signature is required to perform any action on this account. This is a single-signature structure.</p>



 Multi-signature structure 



<p>Multi-signature accounts function similarly to default accounts, the main difference between the two is the permissions structure. In a default account all permissions have a threshold of 1 and only have 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it, whereas the permissions in a multi-signature account have a threshold of 2 or higher and have multiple keys or permissions of other accounts with (possibly) varying weights associated with them. This also means that multiple keys or account permissions will have to sign any transaction from the multi-signature account.</p>







<p>An example of a possible permissions structure in a multi-signature account can be seen in the image above. Just like the default account described earlier, this account has both the owner and active permission.</p>



<p>However, the owner permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 3 and has 3 keys associated with it: The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 2, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the owner permission, both John’s active key and either Bob’s or Stacy’s active key would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>The active permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 2 and has 3 keys associated with it. The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 1, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the active permission (any combination) of 2 of the active keys would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>Multi-signature structures like these can be configured in any way, with as many participants as needed, for any goal, ranging from security to governance.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is important to note that in these account systems, or smart contracts, custom permissions can be created for certain actions, such as voting, staking, etc. In order to keep the other permissions separate and secure.</p>

<p>Homo- (Greek prefix meaning ‘same’); -morphic (Greek suffix meaning ‘having a specific shape/form’)<br>Intuitively, one could deduct that homomorphic encryption indicates that the initial data and the encrypted result (cipher) could share the same form. Based on this property, it can be inferred that computation can be performed on the encrypted data, without prior decryption. By decrypting the result, you get the same output as the computation performed on the unencrypted data. While homomorphic encryption can be either additive or multiplicative, fully homomorphic encryption supports both types of operations. Unlike ZKPs, which are proofs of computational integrity, fully homomorphic encryption allows for encrypted data computation, without revealing additional information about the original data. This could provide the missing link for ensuring private transactions on blockchains’ public ledgers.</p><p>We were joined by Rand Hindi, CEO of Zama, to discuss fully homomorphic encryption solutions, how they differ from ZKPs &amp; MPC, and how they can be leveraged to ensure compliant programmable privacy.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Rand’s background and his interest in privacy  Meeting Pascal and founding Zama  Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)  Zero knowledge proofs vs. Multi-party computation vs. Fully homomorphic encryption  Taking fully homomorphic encryption 'mainstream'  Zama’s products  fhEVM  How multi-party computation would secure fhEVM  Multi-key homomorphic encryption &amp; functional encryption  Deploying an FHE rollup  FHE use cases  Privacy  Zama’s business model  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/randhindi">Rand Hindi on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zama_fhe">Zama on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FhenixIO">Fhenix on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  dYdX Foundation: The recently launched dYdX chain features new governance and token economics, that empower stakers and promote validator decentralisation.

 ZenIP 42206 is open for voting. All ZEN holders have until 11/23/2023 00:00 AM UTC (11/22/2023 7:00 PM ET) to cast their vote via <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xc4bc560e7a88348b98ab5c4aa57f847169713cf9280ff164d72302b78d1ae4f2">Snapshot</a>. 
<br>
<p>We’ve noticed that regardless of the voting instructions and documentation that have been provided and positive sentiment towards this proposal, some of the community members may be still experiencing technical difficulties in the voting process. </p>
<p>We have identified four blockers that may be preventing some community members from being able to vote easily. </p>
<p>Here are the solutions for each of these blockers:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 1) Voting from a multi-sig wallet 
<p>If you have ZEN on a multi-sig wallet, you are not able to link it to Horizen EON as this is currently not supported. Multi-sig wallet users can still vote by proving the ownership of their wallet that contains ZEN. Follow these steps:</p>
<br>
 
 You have until the last block before 11/22/2023 08:00 PM UTC (11/22/2023 3:00 PM ET) to send a transaction of 100 zatoshi (0.00001 $ZEN) to this address znmJjX4QyLeZJFawTCP35T7tqfdhNQMNZEJ (Horizen faucet) with the multisignature address you’d like to link. 
 <a href="https://forms.gle/fC24DFkMjPZiZu3dA">Submit this form </a>to claim your multi-sig wallet address before 11/22/2023 09:00PM UTC (11/22/2023 4:00PM ET). 
 Right after that, we will collect, share and apply the allowlist of multi-sig wallets eligible to vote. 
 







 2) Voting from a non-Sphere wallet 



<p>If you have your ZEN in a wallet other than Sphere, such as Arizen or a hard wallet, you can sign a message right from the application/hardware wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your wallet doesn’t support signing custom messages, you can paste your private key at <a href="https://getzen.cash/sign/">https://getzen.cash/sign/</a>, and produce the signature. The procedure is the following:</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your private key making sure you are in a private location.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your EON wallet address, and press on “Sign”.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Copy the signature you have generated.</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a>.</p>



<p>NOTE: Make sure no one can look at your screen, you may expose your private key. Do it at your own risk.</p>



 3) Voting with ZEN staked on a Horizen Node 



<p>If you have ZEN staked on a Horizen node, you can just sign the message with the command:</p>



<p>zen-cli signmessage %ZEN_ADDRESS% “%YOUR_EON_ACCOUNT%”</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a></p>



 4) Voting with ZEN stored on an exchange&nbsp; 



<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to vote using a ZEN balance that is stored on an exchange at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NOTE: miners may experience a discrepancy between the balance available on the explorer and the one available as voting power. That’s because the new Coinbase output is not seen until it’s involved in the first transaction.</p>

<p>As a prelude to the Festival, Elevandi – a not-for-profit organisation set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) – curated and hosted Elevandi Insights, a day of thoughtful roundtable discussions focused on digital finance. AI and Financial Inclusion were both important themes of the day, alongside tokenisation, payments, and digital financial market infrastructure as prevailing discussion topics which set the tone for SFF.</p>
<p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and tokenised money took the centre stage for the Festival’s payments discussions. Several panels mentioned the crucial role of interoperability in the evolution of CBDCs. Speakers also emphasised its broader application in asset tokenisation, which was highlighted from both the public and private sector – find out more from MAS’ recent <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/guardian/interlinking-networks-technical-paper-vfinal.pdf">“Interlinking Networks Technical Whitepaper</a>”.<br><br>Central banks examined the role of CBDCs as drivers of financial inclusion and vehicles to minimise prudential risks once the onset technological risks are overcome. Large financial institutions and private sector representatives highlighted the importance of tokenised money – whether it be in the form of a CBDC or other forms of tokenised money – as the key to settlement as well as the broader scalability of the industry.</p>
<p>Building on these discussions, MAS published the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/project-orchid/orchid-blueprint-final.pdf">Orchid Blueprint</a> outlining the necessary technological infrastructure for future digital currency transactions in Singapore. This blueprint, derived from insights gained during the Project Orchid industry trials, identifies four essential building blocks to support the effective use of digital money in Singapore:</p>
 
 Settlement Ledger: This component is designed to record digital money transfers, featuring native programmability and the atomic settlement of digital tokens. 
 Tokenisation Bridge: Serving as a vital link, this bridge connects existing account-based settlement systems with ledgers that are compatible with tokenised forms of digital money. 
 Programmability Protocol: The blueprint proposes a common protocol, known as Purpose Bound Money (PBM), enabling the specification of conditions for the use of digital money. 
 Name Service: To enhance accessibility and verification, a Name Service is recommended, translating between complex wallet addresses and alternative name identifiers that are readable and meaningful. 
 
<p>The importance of resilient digital Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI) emerged as another theme in these discussions, emphasising its role as a key enabler to the broad adoption and growth of digital assets. The value of open and interoperable networks among global banks and regulators cannot be understated, and the SFF set the scene for another major announcement in this area.</p>
<p>MAS also unveiled a significant expansion of <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiativeshttps:/www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiatives">Project Guardian</a>, which will delve into promising use cases of asset tokenisation on a public blockchain. The most significant aspect is the introduction of new initiative called Global Layer One (GL1), conceived as an open, digital infrastructure fostering cross-border transactions and global liquidity pools. Major institutions such as BNY Mellon, JP Morgan, DBS, and MUFG will participate. This marks a pivotal step toward integration across the entire capital markets value chain, encompassing listing, distribution, trading, settlement, and asset servicing. Key highlights include:</p>
 
 J.P. Morgan and Apollo are collaborating on leveraging digital assets to facilitate more seamless investment and management of discretionary portfolios and alternative assets. The collaboration also involves automated portfolio rebalancing and customization at scale, promising time savings and a reduction in manual processes related to asset servicing. 
 BNY Mellon and OCBC are engaged in a trial for a cross-border FX payment solution, aiming to facilitate secure and interoperable payment solutions across diverse networks. 
 
<p>GDF convened its members its members together on two distinct occasions, both characterised by the same positive atmosphere that resonated with the overall optimistic outlook of SFF.</p>
<p>Our dinner, which we hosted in partnership with Hogan Lovells, focused on the challenges to building digital trust, and facilitating tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs), and the role regulators and policymakers have to play in balancing innovation with safe regulatory frameworks. Ken Coghill from the DFSA and Danny Russell from the Bank of England joined us and shared some opening remarks on behalf of their agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our lunch, which we hosted in partnership with Clifford Chance, brought together technologists and policy experts for a comprehensive discussion on challenges and essential components for institutionalising digital assets, emphasising ongoing technical efforts to enable financial institutions to leverage public blockchain technology. Malcolm Wright, OKX and former VARA regulator, and John Ho, Standard Chartered, opened the lunch with some optimistic remarks about the&nbsp;direction of travel for industry, with a keen focus on the APAC region.</p>
<p>We could not be more grateful for the continued support of our association’s mission to promote best standards of practice for the digital asset ecosystem, and look forward to continuing to bring together and building our community in the APAC region.</p>

<p>Plants have long produced potent human therapeutics and contributed to over 20% of drugs approved since the 1980s, including Morphine and Artemisinin. Although monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs), a promising class of plant-derived compounds with unique pharmacological properties that have already produced drugs such as the chemotherapy vinblastine, could help to revolutionize treatments in mental health and pain management, obtaining sufficient quantities of MIAs for the development of new drugs remains a major challenge due to reliance on natural sources and difficulties scaling chemical synthesis, both of which severely limit the quantities of MIAs that can be produced.</p><p><a href="https://biomia.com/">Biomia</a> has developed a platform for mass-producing plant natural products, particularly MIAs, using engineered yeast. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-krogh-jensen-1a589b6/?originalSubdomain=dk">Michael</a> and <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/jie-zhang">Jie</a>, now Biomia’s CEO and CSO respectively, led the collaborative research effort in partnership with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-keasling-6783754/">Jay Keasling</a>, a well-renowned researcher and entrepreneur in the field of synthetic biology and a Scientific Advisor for Biomia, funded with $10 million by the EU through the <a href="https://www.miami-project.eu/">MIAMI</a> project, a $3 million grant from the Bio-Innovation Institute in Denmark, as well as substantial soft-funding from the Novo Nordisk Foundation.

 The <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen DAO</a> is open for voting, and on 11/20/2023 at 00:00am UTC, the Horizen community can start voting on <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a>, to decide whether or not the Horizen Secure Node rewards should be redirected to Horizen EON forger nodes.&nbsp; 



 About ZenIP 42206 – The First DAO Proposal 



<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> proposes redirecting the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The purpose is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network.</p>



<p>To learn more about ZenIP 42206 and the rationale behind the proposal, please read this blog: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">ZenIP 42206 Explained: Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards Into Horizen EON</a></p>



<p>ZenIP 42206 is the first community proposal to be voted on by the Horizen community via the Horizen DAO. Through the <a href="https://forum.horizen.io">Horizen DAO</a>, every member of the Horizen community can have a say in the project’s direction. Check out <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">our documentation</a> if you want to know more about how the <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">Horizen governance</a> works.</p>



 The ZenIP 42206 Voting Process and Timeline 







<p></p>



<p>The Horizen DAO voting is done on <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a>, an EVM-compatible sidechain on Horizen. The Horizen DAO uses <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a> and <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a> for governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Will the Voting Start?</p>



<p>The voting period for any given proposal will have a specified start and end date and will last 72 hours.&nbsp;</p>



&nbsp;Voting for ZenIP 42206 will start on November 20th,2023 at 00:00AM UTC (November 19th 7:00PM ET), and end on November 23rd, 2023 at 00:00AM UTC (November 22nd, 2023 at 7:00PM ET).&nbsp;



<p></p>



<p>Who is Eligible to Vote?</p>



<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.<br><br>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore, the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>



 How to Vote? 



<p>Before voting, be sure to have read everything about ZenIP 42206 from the following resources:</p>

 Link your Horizen mainchain $ZEN address to Horizen EON. In order to vote with your mainchain $ZEN, you need to have $ZEN on a <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere</a> mainchain address and link that address to your MetaMask Horizen EON chain address. You only need to link your <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere wallet</a> once. You can use the same wallet for future voting rounds.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Please see <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">this guide for step-by-step instructions </a>on linking Horizen Mainchain and Horizen EON $ZEN Addresses to aggregate your voting power.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Make sure you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask address for the gas fee. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFsjT069v7E">this tutorial</a> to learn how to transfer ZEN from Horizen mainchain to your Horizen EON address on MetaMask 



 Once your mainchain ZEN address is connected to Horizen EON, and you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask for gas fee, it’s time to vote using Snapshot! 



 Join the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Horizen Foundation space</a> on Snapshot if you haven’t done so, turn on the notification so you will get the updates&nbsp; 



 Go to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xc4bc560e7a88348b98ab5c4aa57f847169713cf9280ff164d72302b78d1ae4f2">the voting page of ZenIP-42206 EON Forger Subsidy Fund</a> on Snapshot and cast your vote!

<p>Fei-Fei Li, PhD,&nbsp; Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, and Co-Director of Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute, joins Bio + Health founding partner Vijay Pande.</p><p>In this candid conversation, Li unfolds her transformation from a young immigrant to an influential figure in AI. The conversation explores the birth of ImageNet, a pivotal step that bridged the gap between visual intelligence and accessible AI technology.

<p>Leading decentralised perpetual exchange, dYdX V4 recently migrated to Cosmos to build its own sovereign appchain, in order to provide its users a much better trading experience, while continuing to deliver DeFi innovations (e.g. permisionless markets). By having full control over the appchain’s parameters, the dYdX DAOs can shape the future of the protocol, starting from the very bedrock, ensuring proper distribution and incentives for the validator set. From early adopter of L2 zero knowledge proofs (STARKs), to building its own Cosmos appchain, dYdX has proven once again to be a trailblazer for new technologies.</p><p>We were joined by Charles d’Haussy, CEO of dYdX Foundation, to discuss dYdX V4’s recent migration to a Cosmos appchain and what challenges it solves in terms of: order book decentralisation, validator distribution and user experience.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Charles’ background, from Asia to CEO of dYdX  dYdX’s history and V4’s transition to a Cosmos appchain  How perpetual futures work  dYdX supported assets and permissionless markets  DeFi innovations vs. CEX UX  The current state of dYdX V4’s alpha mainnet  dYdX validator dynamics &amp; order book decentralisation  dYdX’s DAOs &amp; governance  Mitigating MEV (feat.

<p>Despite the many alternative flavors of NoSQL databases that have caught the attention of developers over the years, relational databases remain the de facto standard for storing and retrieving digital information. Every technology worker from the back-office IT personnel to the modern Web developer has been trained to use, manage, and query relational databases. SQL, the language used to interact with relational databases, is the lingua franca of data management. Yet, while blockchains can be thought of as decentralized databases, they are not geared for the same storage and query tasks as relational databases, making them too slow, too expensive, and decidedly foreign for the average developer to interact with. This creates a paradoxical and undesirable situation in which developers of decentralized technologies choose the path of least resistance for their data storage needs: traditional, centralized, relational databases.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://tableland.xyz/">Tableland</a>, a multi-chain relational database network that brings SQL to smart contracts. Using this foundation, Tableland is developing Basin — a product for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) projects. With a focus on user-friendly tools and cryptographic data formats, Basin is designed to make data secure and usable for generations to come. Provenance tracking ensures a transparent data lineage, while Filecoin guarantees decentralized data accessibility and permanence. With Basin, Tableland is <a href="https://mirror.xyz/tableland.eth/UJMDvy8vAqekOGpPmspRGzdl2-osjPeGVaIv2Lv4Oh0">solving a critical pain point </a>for DePIN projects by creating a more secure, efficient, and transparent decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Tableland launched their community in Q2 of 2022 with 3000 <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/tableland-rigs">utilitarian NFTs</a> with their metadata stored in relational tables in Tableland itself, showcasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAc0xDyQDZbo-PnGBbv1aBTVMVwd4qncL">tangible use case</a> for the product. The NFTs sold out in under 5 minutes. Since then, they’ve launched on Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and other L2&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>As crypto continues to grow and quickly evolve, developers will lean toward tools and technologies that make them more productive. Tried and true, widely adopted patterns such as relational tables and SQL will continue to play an important foundational role, even as applications become decentralized. With growing momentum behind DePIN projects, Tableland can position itself as a foundational building block for a world where crypto-economic incentives are used to coordinate physical infrastructure. We are excited to be backing the entire Tableland team on their&nbsp;mission.</p>
