<p>Public transaction history in blockchains represents one of their key features which, alongside immutability, aim to provide an alternative to CeFi. However, this transparency comes at a price: privacy. As a result, different solutions have been proposed, that preserve privacy while maintaining all the other benefits of blockchain technology, but there currently isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to this problem. For example, zero knowledge proofs convey the validity of a transaction batch without sharing any other details, but the underlying arithmetic circuits are both complex as well as computational intensive. Umbra proposes a system that relies completely on elliptic curve cryptography, employing multiple private-public key pairs to achieve stealth payments.</p><p>We were joined by Ben DiFrancesco, founder &amp; CEO of ScopeLift, to talk about Umbra's privacy preserving stealth token transfer system and if the need for privacy on blockchains outweighs any implicit UX frictions.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Ben’s background  Umbra's mission  How Umbra works  Non-interactive key distribution  Potential solutions (&amp; trade-offs) for Umbra's computational intensity  Generating private-public key pairs by the Umbra smart contract  User experience (UX) for senders and receivers  Fee structure for deterring griefing attacks  How Umbra works for ERC20 tokens &amp; NFTs  Privacy preserving withdrawals from stealth addresses  Privacy vs. UX friction  Smart wallets &amp; account abstraction  Prioritising privacy  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/BenDiFrancesco">Ben DiFrancesco on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/UmbraCash">Umbra on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ScopeLift">ScopeLift on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst.

 How to privacy enhance your apps and wallets — using NymConnect  Enjoy strong privacy protections via the Nym&nbsp;mixnet <p><a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a> is a one-button end user application that connects wallets and messaging apps to the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>NymConnect privacy-enhances your apps and wallets by protecting not just the content, but also your IP address and your communications patterns. This means nobody can trace who you are communicating with or de-anonymize you!</p><p>This blogpost will take you through the simple steps of how to use NymConnect and to secure the privacy of your applications.</p><p>NOTE: NymConnect is in Beta, and is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity (yet). NymConnect is the first step towards a general purpose Nym&nbsp;VPN.</p><p>Read on or&nbsp;watch:</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>When you connect a wallet or app to <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a> it will wrap your communications in several layers of encryption and send it through a gateway and the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>The <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/">mixnet</a> mixes your traffic with cover traffic and adds micro delays. This makes it impossible for an observer to trace and analyze your communications and it protects your IP&nbsp;address.</p><p>Communication patterns reveal more than people are aware of: your relationships, transaction histories, trading and spending habits, even psychological state of mind and your home address can be tracked&nbsp;down!</p><p>The Nym mixnet — and NymConnect — ensures that when you communicate online, you are speaking to and transacting with the person you intend to. And not some random stranger listening in!</p> Connect me&nbsp;up! <p>Right now, you can use NymConnect on your desktop computer for privacy-enhancing <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> messaging apps as well as <a href="https://electrum.org/#home">Electrum</a>, <a href="https://blockstream.com/green/">Blockstream Green</a> and <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> wallets via <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>. Here is how you do&nbsp;it:</p> Step 1: Download NymConnect <p>First thing is to download the application from the Nym website. NOTE NymConnect is in Beta mode and is only usable on a&nbsp;desktop!</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">Download now</a></p> Step 2: Turn on NymConnect <p>Open the application and click the big button to turn on the app. You will now see something called Socks5 address number and a port number. You will need these&nbsp;shortly…</p> Step 3: Configure your app/&nbsp;wallet   Open the app or wallet you want to privacy-enhance (lets use Telegram as an example&nbsp;here).  <p>2. Go to preferences or settings&gt; Advanced&gt; Connection type</p><p>3. Change your connection type to&nbsp;Socks5</p><p>4. Copy paste the Socks5 address number and your port number from NymConnect to your application</p> Step 3: You are connected! <p>Your app should now be connected to the Nym mixnet and privacy enhanced!</p><p>NOTE: your 3rd party app (Telegram, etc) will continue running through a socks5 proxy unless you deselect that option. So if NymConnect is not running your app traffic will not be coming through… so make sure to start up NymConnect again next time you open your computer!</p> Step 4: Aftercare… <p>The Nym mixnet is a decentralised network of independent operators. This is a fairly new and global community, all working together to provide you with some of the strongest privacy protections the world has&nbsp;seen!</p><p>However, this also means that the mixnet is still maturing — and parts of this global decentralised infrastructure sometimes drops out, cutting your connection. (In technical terms a gateway or mix node might go offline). In that case, NymConnect will notify you stating that “your gateway is having issues”. You can then manually switch gateways.</p><p>Here is how you change gateways…</p>  If NymConnect is on, make sure to click the big button to turn it off&nbsp;first  Go to NymConnect and click on the top left&nbsp;burger  Go to “settings”&gt; “select your gateway” and switch it to manual. And click on “Network Explorer.” This will open a browser window with the explorer.  <p>4. Click on gateways and copy the Identity Key of one of the&nbsp;gateways</p><p>6. Paste the Identity Key of your chosen gateway in NymConnect. You can now go back to the main NymConnect interface and click connect once&nbsp;again.</p><p>If you are having any further issues, join the Nym community support channels!</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a></p> For the super-user — custom service providers! <p>Now some of you might be part of the more technically minded people and are keen to know how to push the limits of NymConnect and expand the realm of the possible.</p><p>NymConnect works with any type of application that can run socks5&nbsp;proxy.</p><p>Most recently, we had the super-users of the Monero community set up a network requester to use NymConnect with Monero&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>To start using Monero wallet over the Nym&nbsp;mixnet</p>  Go to settings and select a service&nbsp;provider  In the drop-down menu, select the last service provider: i1TiuoNp4jp9weffCW7tPnkb4hRTPydRjX8iXFVaYDG.88Z1hruuvbzWpdCE2xYnTbPNrr49j4s7mmUQC5wvRRLZ@3EPuxwGn2WP2HdxybzoDa5QsohYSP76aQQRUJuPMvk23  <blockquote>Want to build a service provider yourself?</blockquote><p>Jump on our channels to meet our developer relations team!</p><p>Dev chats: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a></p> Resources   <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/introduction.html">Nym Docs</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/introduction.html">Nym Developer portal</a>  Tutorial on <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/simple-service-provider.html">how to set up a simple service&nbsp;provider</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/how-to-privacy-enhance-your-apps-and-wallets-using-nymconnect-4fbd9a9a22d9">How to privacy enhance your apps and wallets — using NymConnect!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Sweating the detail s— part&nbsp;2 <p>At <a href="http://privy.io/">Privy</a>, we build simple tools to help you onboard and engage your users in web3. In this series, we break down some of the work it takes to create simple experiences with state of the art tooling in web3. <a href="https://blog.privy.io/sweating-the-details-6250f167638c">See part&nbsp;1</a>.</p><p>Multiplayer journeys make web3 products unique. By leveraging assets that can be used across apps and ecosystems, web3 powers novel experiences that can build on one another, where anyone can openly contribute to a protocol or support its assets, thereby adding to the ecosystem’s value.</p><p>The launch of our <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3-for-users-not-experts-52c692c25bb1">embedded wallets</a> raises some key questions for developers about interoperability:</p>  Can I ensure that my users have access to their assets across apps, even as they use embedded&nbsp;wallets?  If a user creates a wallet in my app, can they use this wallet, or its assets in another app like&nbsp;OpenSea?  <p>These questions apply to all wallets, but are particularly important for embedded wallets. Embedded wallets shift us from a wallet-centric mindset (where the user takes their assets with them using third-party software) to an app-centric mindset (where asset ownership is deeply integrated into the app experience).</p> Why interopability matters <p>Interoperability is the ability for data or assets to be freely moved from one system to another. It is essential to building rich experiences in web3 and helps unlock novel use cases beyond what any single company could&nbsp;build.</p><p>Practically speaking it boils down to two pragmatic concerns:</p>  Assets out — Will assets generated in your app have value elsewhere? Can your user take them to trade/spend/use?  Assets in — Can your app benefit from the assets your user has accumulated elsewhere? Do they need to buy crypto again (for gas, eg) if they have done it&nbsp;before?  <p>Historically, interoperability in web3 has been made possible by consumer crypto wallets. Users bring their own key management software (the wallet) to every app. The wallet acts as a bridge across apps and ecosystems, enabling the user to carry their assets with them, unlocking new value for the ecosystem.</p><p>However, <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3s-coming-of-age-c588af57c94d">wallets can cause quite a bit of friction for newcomers</a> who are not used to the self-custodial UX in&nbsp;web3.</p> Enter embedded&nbsp;wallets <p>Embedded wallets are tightly integrated into a given product — no third party extension or app download required. They give a user all of the benefits of a self-custodial system without requiring them to BYOW (bring your own wallet — download an extension, secure a 12-word mnemonic, etc).</p><p>But how does interoperability figure into this? Wallets must remain usable across apps. If I generate a wallet as part of my journey in app A, I must be able to take my assets to app B and&nbsp;beyond.</p> Embedded wallet interoperability, a story in three&nbsp;parts <p>Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of a user. Alice is new to crypto and may not even know the product she is using runs on decentralized rails. She signs up for MadRealities using her phone number (and gets a Privy embedded wallet), <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mad-realities-genesis-membership-pass">earning a rose</a> (NFT) in the process. Months later, Bob (her crypto-curious friend) tells her this rose is valuable and she should trade it on OpenSea. How can her embedded wallet enable this&nbsp;easily?</p><p>Option 1: Native wallet support across&nbsp;apps.</p><p>In this option, our embedded wallet system is supported across both apps, the asset originator and destination. That is both MadRealities and OpenSea integrate Privy natively so Alice can bring her wallet across both&nbsp;sites.</p><p>In this scenario, we must account for certain considerations:</p>  UX — embedded wallets can reduce user friction by integrating deeply into an app flow, and giving users an option to pre-approve certain transactions, for example. However, massive UX upside here carries real risk of a potential rogue app tricking a user into taking unwanted&nbsp;action.  Privacy — Automatically connecting a wallet across apps when a user logs in reveals a lot of information about the user. The wallet may be tied to sensitive on-chain information, and users must stay in control of whether they link accounts across apps like&nbsp;this.  <p>The prospects of embedded wallet integrations bringing self-custodial asset control across apps is exciting. But obviously it’s unrealistic to expect all apps to support the same wallet infrastructure in the near-term. This cannot be the end of the story. What if the app your user is going to (OpenSea in this instance) doesn’t support your user’s embedded&nbsp;wallet?</p><p>You really have two practical options:</p>  A WalletConnect integration  Provisioning a consumer wallet to go alongside the embedded&nbsp;wallet  <p>Option 2: the WalletConnect integration</p><p>WalletConnect was created in 2018 to make it easier for developers to integrate the long tail of wallets, and ensure users can connect to their app with any wallet. In fact, WalletConnect is an invaluable part of the <a href="https://www.privy.io/features/connectors">connector infrastructure Privy has built</a> for native users. While WalletConnect is fantastic for web3 users, it’s UX is very native to consumer self-custodial wallets and accordingly, some of its flows confuse web3 newcomers.</p><p>Back to Alice…<br>Using WalletConnect, Privy would appear as one of the available wallets in the WalletConnect interface and Alice could simply use this to connect her embedded wallet to any site that supports WalletConnect. But we must keep in mind where Alice is coming from as part of her&nbsp;journey.</p><p>The Newcomer Experience — New to web3, Alice thinks in terms of apps, not wallets. She is thinking about her assets (her MadRealities rose) not in terms of software (what wallet is securing these assets). This implicit change of frame is hard to pull&nbsp;off.</p>  Alice expects to log into OpenSea with her MadRealities account. Instead she sees WalletConnect, but may not know what that&nbsp;is.    From there Alice, if she knows to click it, she will be shown a list of available wallets in the market (or worse: a QR code). This is very intimidating for a newcomer. Now, she must pick Privy, which she may not know about. Expecting to access her MadRealities rose from OpenSea, Alice gets a crash course in the wallet&nbsp;market.  <p>Accordingly, our view of the landscape today is this: rather than let the user learn about wallets on their own, let’s proactively onboard them to a consumer wallet once they are ready.As your user is ready to leave their first app experience and head into the wider world of digital ownership, we want to give them the right tool for the&nbsp;journey.</p> The right tool at the right&nbsp;time <p>By the time Alice is ready to leave MadRealities for OpenSea to sell her NFT, she has a real incentive to deal with the friction of getting a&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Out of the box, <a href="https://docs.privy.io/guide/frontend/embedded/export">Privy supports simple key export</a> so you can easily prompt your user to copy their keys to an external wallet at the appropriate time. From there, they can use their embedded wallet in other apps, as well as continue to use it in your&nbsp;app.</p> The way&nbsp;ahead <p>Our work does not stop here. We are working with a number of wallet providers to develop one-click wallet migrations, enabling users to export their embedded wallet into an external wallet with a single click. Interoperability is a core part of the web3 user experience and we’re excited to see many builders in the space pushing to make assets usable across apps for all&nbsp;users.</p><p>We’re excited to share more on this front&nbsp;soon!</p> Some Lessons   Remember who your user is and how they got to your app. Knowing what they know and what they expect is powerful information. Make use of it to pick the best flows at a given&nbsp;moment.  Size the carrot and the stick. Through their journey through your app, consider your users’ incentives and motivations. By the time a user has a material reason to take assets from your ecosystem elsewhere, they are much more engaged than when they first came into your&nbsp;app.  <p>By supporting both external wallets and internal wallets, Privy is designed for all of your users, newcomers and experts alike, as they evolve through their web3 journey.

  Exploring Autonomous Agents: A Semi-Technical Dive  <p>Agents are all the rage, but their planning capabilities currently outpace their ability to act reliably. How do we make them truly autonomous?</p>   
	By Dan Chen	 



Published May 11, 2023
  







 
<p>Over the past several weeks, autonomous AI agents have taken the world by storm. AutoGPT is one of the fastest growing Github repos in history, rocketing past PyTorch, every major Python web framework, and Python itself (sorry Guido) in number of stars. It’s led to some pretty sweet—albeit cherry-picked— demos and has captured the imagination of Twitter thought leaders and AI doomers alike. In a weird twist of fate, the popularity of agents has probably accelerated AI doomerism more than it has accelerated progress towards the superintelligence doomers fear.</p>



<p>An agent’s primary distinction from LLMs is that they run in a self-directed loop, largely augmented by a lightweight prompting layer and some kind of persistence or memory. The architecture varies from agent to agent, with some focused on task prioritization and others taking a more conversational roleplaying approach. The use cases are far reaching, from personal assistants to automated GTM teams. If you’re looking for an excellent primer and thesis on agents, look no further than my colleague Lauren Reeder’s <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-agents-perspective/">post</a>. And if you’re looking for the cutting edge for this family of agents, there’s LangChain’s recent <a href="https://blog.langchain.dev/plan-and-execute-agents/">post</a> on Plan-and-Execute Agents.</p>



<p>Pretty exciting, but how far are we from this reality? In order to truly understand, I am a strong believer in getting to the nuts and bolts. This means getting your hands dirty with the code. So I sat down for an afternoon and took a quick look at the codebases for some popular agents. Here are some observations.</p>



 Implementation 



<p>The core autonomous agent loops are pretty straightforward. For instance, for AutoGPT, each agent has access to an initial prompt, a set of actions to execute, a history of messages, and a workspace where it can write executable code and files on the fly. An initial prompt might be something like “plan my daughter’s birthday—she really likes unicorns.” The agent then runs on a modified <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf">ReAct</a> loop and is able to critique its own action through a second chat completion call with a <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/1d26f6b69720a561237f4d94d08bd9fae232aebb/autogpt/agent/agent.py#L292">special prompt</a> that roughly boils down to: “review the proposed action and tell me whether it’s good or bad and why.” The agent calls the OpenAI chat completion endpoint with the following context: the original directive describing the goal of the agent (“plan a sweet unicorn-themed party”), some commands that represent procedural code the agent can run, as well as some short-term memory (the historical context of the agent’s prior reasoning and actions, up to the token limit). The text completion is formatted to a <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/ecf2ba12db11ff19bce359b842f810f0e2d09d6a/autogpt/json_utils/llm_response_format_1.json">JSON dict</a> of “thoughts” reasoning through the next action to take as well as the next selected action—potentially through another chat completion call. The agent pauses after each loop and waits for user input, which will be included in future context. The context and history can be persisted in storage: Pinecone, Redis, or more recently, Milvus or Weaviate—but honestly a JSON dump works just fine.</p>



<p>Some immediate observations: Although the demos can be astounding, agent implementations are pretty straightforward under the hood. AutoGPT is in essence a light prompting layer running on a recursive loop with persistent memory and which can write executable code on the fly. LangChain has a partial <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/experimental/autonomous_agents/autogpt">implementation</a> of AutoGPT where they augmented their base agent with the optional human feedback component. It’s important to note: LangChain is a framework that allows for the implementation of various agents, including not just AutoGPT, but also BabyAGI and direct translations of existing research (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf">ReAct</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00445.pdf">MRKL</a> – <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/agents">here</a>). AutoGPT is an agent implementation that has made specific decisions on overall architecture and prompting strategy.</p>



 <code>    def generate_prompt_string(self) -&gt; str:
        """Generate a prompt string.
        Returns:
            str: The generated prompt string.
        """
        formatted_response_format = json.dumps(self.response_format, indent=4)
        prompt_string = (
            f"Constraints:\n{self._generate_numbered_list(self.constraints)}\n\n"

<p>An immediately achievable next step to making these agents useful in practice is expanding their action space: <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/tools">LangChain tools</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins">AutoGPT plugins</a>. These modules define the extended set of commands that an agent can perform. Examples include searching Google or writing some code on the fly. The open source community might expand this finite set of actions with, for instance, Twitter integrations to let the agent read and post tweets, or payments integrations to navigate checkout flows. This is where LangChain and AutoGPT excel: due to recent attention, developers flock to these projects to build plugins. It’s a really interesting moat where, similar to proof-of-work consensus in blockchains, developers are incentivized to build on the most complete plugin ecosystem—the longest chain, so to speak. The hard part is that the set of actions a user can take on the internet is near infinite. To get agents that can do everything humans can do online the long term solution is to have agents reliably write their own procedural code to gracefully handle novel cases, but we need a step function improvement in models before this future is within reach.</p>



LangChain <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/423f497168e3a8982a4cdc4155b15fbfaa089b38/langchain/tools">tools</a>



<p>Currently, agents run like your run-of-the-mill MBA graduate or entry level consultant: they are very good at describing plausible solutions but very poor at executing on them. Put another way, the Act component of ReAct performs poorly in unconstrained environments (ReAct is constrained to a predefined action space), and it is clear that the agent isn’t able to reason at a deeper level about novel situations or problem solve on the fly. A concrete example of this is that agents often hit a wall when the output of an action isn’t what they expect: they try to pull up a tweet, hit a 403: Unauthorized error, and are not quite sure what to do next as they have no notion that calling Twitter might give a different response if the user is not logged in. Practically speaking, the current generation of agents still need quite a bit of human intervention and direction to be effective.</p>



 So what’s next? 



<p>Building a working autonomous agent in an unconstrained environment is an open research problem. We are still far from this reality. That said, models are improving at an accelerating clip. AutoGPT-like agents represent an interesting practical experiment on agents in an unconstrained environment. Through experimentation and iteration on architecture and prompting strategy and enough open source contributions in the action space (plugins), this approach could plausibly start to bridge the gap between AI doomer fantasy and reality. Here is my agent wishlist to try to get us there:<br></p>



 
 A better headless browser. The kinds of agent directives that work best are the ones that involve researching things on the internet. This works well when the agent starts with a <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/1d26f6b69720a561237f4d94d08bd9fae232aebb/autogpt/commands/google_search.py">Google search</a>. It works less well when the agent then visits an arbitrary web page. Not only do agents need to understand and gracefully handle various HTTP errors, but also parse an arbitrarily large webpage and potentially execute Javascript to fully mimic a human user experience. Then, the agent would have to map the perceived UX to a limited context window. This is a very hard problem, but if you have a potential solution, <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/1d26f6b69720a561237f4d94d08bd9fae232aebb/autogpt/commands/web_selenium.py">here</a> <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/423f497168e3a8982a4cdc4155b15fbfaa089b38/langchain/tools/requests">are</a> some places to start. 
 



 
 Better command selection. Currently, chat completion is responsible for command selection (“<a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/3b74d2150e26ec9387e40cf65a75d8a995d8c9f3/autogpt/prompts/prompt.py#L13">determine which command to use…</a>”). This leads to some pretty crazy hallucinations: for instance, the birthday planning agent shown below tries to reference as an argument a file that doesn’t actually exist. There is probably some clever combination of prompting and procedural code that can minimize hallucinations and help guide the agent in the right direction. For instance, you could try cosine similarity between the embedding vectors across more descriptive versions of current commands and the chat completion response. Or you could try to craft the prompt in a way to minimize edge cases or restrict the creativity of completion outputs. It’s unclear what the right solution is, but there is a lot of room for improvement here. As an aside, this a great opportunity to explore <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04761.pdf">toolformers</a> at the model level. 
 



 <code>    {
      ...
      "speak": "Let's start by analyzing any previous conversations or notes we have about the daughter's interests and preferences for her birthday party. This will help us come up with creative and unique ideas for themes, decorations, activities, and entertainment that align with her incentives and preferences. Then we can move on to managing the logistics of the party, including venue selection, guest list management, catering, and budgeting. Finally, we should anticipate and address potential issues or challenges that may arise during the planning and execution of the party to minimize stress and maximize satisfaction."
    },
    "command": {
      "name": "read_file",
      "args": { "filename": "daughter_preferences.txt" }
    }

// Example hallucination (no such file exists!)
</code> 



 
 Optimizations around the action space. While the LangChain agent is parameterized by default (you decide which tools to pass on instantiation), AutoGPT defaults to a set of out of the box <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/tree/master/autogpt/commands">actions</a>. Some of these actions give agents a ton of functionality: they can read, write and execute arbitrary code and files. In the best case, this will make agents truly autonomous and self-improving. However, agents are not yet able to generate code and files in productive ways more reliably than they are to fail or hallucinate in doing so. This leads agents to get stuck more often than it leads to novel and working outcomes. The suggestion here is threefold: 1) do a bit of “hyperparameter optimization” around which subset of actions lead to the best agents—and for LangChain, include this as the default set of tools; 2) allow agents to change the action set on the fly, either automatically once they have hit an edge case and run into a loop (should be easy to detect) or manually on user input; 3) build out guardrails, input validation, and better failure mode handling for existing actions (similar to the suggestion for a better headless browser). Also, for AutoGPT, potentially remove some of the more powerful “out there” commands until the models get better. 
 



 
 A discriminator to rank actions. The recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf">Generative Agents</a> paper described a strategy that ranked observations in memory by some linear combination of “recency,” “importance,” and “relevance.” We could try implementing something like this for both memory context and task selection/action prioritization. The devil is in the details. For instance, the paper suggested a separate prompt to rank importance (“on a scale of 1 to 10…”); however, depending on the use case, “importance” could be better estimated by a numerical model (e.g. likelihood estimator) depending on the objective. There is likely no one size fits all solution, and the best approach is likely to start with a simple prompt and go from there. 
 



<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf">Ranking actions</a> from the Generative Agents paper



 
 More tools and plugins. Over the past two weeks, the number of approved plugins on AutoGPT has ballooned from 2 to almost 20—from Telegram to Wikipedia to crypto. LangChain <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/423f497168e3a8982a4cdc4155b15fbfaa089b38/langchain/tools">tools</a> are just as comprehensive. Each additional working plugin expands an agent’s action space and gets it that much closer to mimicking a human on the internet. 



 Agent-to-agent messaging. As agents are deployed in the wild, they can start communicating with each other in novel ways. These ideas are explored in multi-agent simulation environments, but AutoGPT and other unconstrained agents currently operate in single player mode. Messaging could introduce the possibility of more complex relationships between agents with different directives, such as student-coach or competitive peer-peer. This would require a persistence layer for agents, the ability for agents to query all other agents, and a messaging layer, potentially with a discriminator to rank messages by importance that are received between each iteration of the agent (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/nicktindle">@nicktindle</a> for this observation). 



 Better models. This is a must-have for the frequent gaps in logic the agent exhibits. We don’t quite get there with GPT-4—maybe the next generation of models? In addition, current autonomous agents are slow and expensive. Perhaps it is worth exploring fine-tuning on agent trajectories to make them faster, cheaper and effective for a subset of tasks. Toolformers remain underexplored but promising. 
 



<p>If there is one takeaway from all of this, agents’ reasoning ability is pretty good but their action-taking aspect is still pretty rudimentary. In research, agents largely run in constrained environments with limited abilities to act, like toddlers playing with toy cars in a sandbox. With autonomous commercial agents, we are seeing the first experimental attempts to have agents run in the wild unconstrained. We are giving these toddlers actual cars, so to speak. This is exciting and unprecedented, and would represent a zero-to-one improvement in agents once they work reliably. However, these toddlers don’t know how to drive and are currently crashing into most obstacles that come their way. Do we replace the cars with Tonkas or do we hope that the toddlers grow up? I have made some suggestions on the toy car side in the hopes of making some surprisingly competent toddlers, but if we want truly working autonomous agents, we also need to wait for better models.</p>

What is all that about and why do digital wallets need a&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p>Wallets are one of the core elements of the decentralised web. Not only do they store your tokens, wallets also act as portals! They are access points into different chains and services. In this sense, the tokens being stored in wallets are less a currency as we know it and more like credentials — the means by which users can access, benefit from and participate in different online&nbsp;worlds.</p><p>The shift from cash to digital tokens has opened up many new use-cases, but it has also brought new problems. Whenever something “goes digital” this means it is translated into bits of information. And these bits are ripe for the picking: data and metadata that can be vacuumed from the tubes of the internet, for profiling, targeting and exploitation.</p><p>As more of the services we use and rely on move to tokenised systems (including, in many countries, increasingly large swathes of the public sector), it is vital that we build digital wallet technologies that are private by&nbsp;default.</p> Crypto is secure….isn’t it? <p>Many users of crypto wallets assume that their activities are private. After all, wasn’t the point of Web3 to do things differently from Web 2.0 and make sure people instead of big tech would be in control of online information? There are several key reasons why this is not the case. We’ll look at some of them&nbsp;here…</p><p>Wallet design. Digital wallets are not designed from a privacy-first standpoint. They are designed to fulfil a business case, and by extension to generate revenue. Privacy is a secondary concern, and indeed may be actively detrimental to the business interests of the infrastructure provider.</p><p>There are plenty of examples — in 2022, the <a href="https://decrypt.co/111451/bankrupt-crypto-lender-celsius-reveals-thousands-of-users-transaction-histories-in-court-filing/">Celcius bankruptcy resulted in the publication of the transaction history of half a million of the platform’s users</a>, along with all the information required to de-anonymise them. The publication was demanded by the judge overseeing the Chapter 11 process — a clear demonstration that the only way to collect data safely is to simply not collect it at&nbsp;all.</p><p>The good news is there are several privacy-first wallet solutions. These all come from the open source community. <a href="https://electrum.org/#home">Electrum</a> is the most popular wallet for the privacy-minded, and for good reason — it is beyond the control of any single party, and is not hostage to corporate fortune. And <a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/">Wasabi Wallet</a> runs on the Tor network by default, offering ways to further improve security. But even privacy wallets like Wasabi that use Tor and coin mixers <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/de-mixing-wasabi-coinjoin-transactions-a-deep-dive-into-chainalysis-deanonymizing-claims/">face problems</a> by virtue of public ledgers. Journalist Laura Shin and blockchain surveillance company Chainalysis apparently<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2022/02/22/exclusive-austrian-programmer-and-ex-crypto-ceo-likely-stole-11-billion-of-ether/?sh=7b7d8e367f58"> managed to ‘de-mix’ a Wasabi transaction</a>. Also Electrum cannot guarantee privacy on its own due to a fundamental flaw in the design of the internet: network traffic and its metadata is&nbsp;exposed.</p> It’s the metadata… <p>Even wallets with strong privacy protections are vulnerable at the network layer, the layer where communications traffic criss-crosses the world. This traffic, even when encrypted, leaks metadata and reveals your IP address. Metadata is the information about a message rather than the content: the size of the message, timing, device it was sent from and so on. This metadata reveals patterns that — especially now with AI powered surveillance — reveal in detail what is going on. And this includes all crypto transactions!</p><p>The peer-to-peer transaction broadcasts of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more broadly are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/why-mixnets-are-needed-to-make-bitcoin-private">entirely exposed</a>. And this allows an observer to link for example your Bitcoin public key to your IP address and can even give an approximate location of where you&nbsp;live…</p><p>In order to solve this, the Nym mixnet protects your metadata and IP address. It does this by obfuscating traffic patterns. Packets are encrypted so they look the same and are routed across a large network through three layers of mix nodes, each mixing the packets with others so that they are entirely untraceable.</p><blockquote><a href="https://electrum.org/#home">Electrum</a> and recently the <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/">Monero</a> are already integrated with Nym!

Cash is being thwarted, trust in financial institutions is ebbing away, and in many so-called “developing” countries people have jumped straight from physical money to some form of digital token, bypassing the wildly inefficient structures erected by Western financial institutions. Payment rails, clearing houses, and the wastage associated with them already look antiquated.</p><p>But beneath this supposed surface story of legacy finance fading away, big finance is joining forces with big tech pushing out digital payment systems via cards and smart-phones. This is much bigger than Web3 and this shift from cash comes with major consequences.</p><p>First of all, the shift to digital payment systems means we are headed towards a veritable explosion of sensitive economic data and metadata traversing networks.

<p>Tokenisation and real estate are a match made in heaven. Thus, it is important to understand what goes into tokenising real estate before embarking on your tokenisation journey. In this article, we will discuss how to tokenise real estate, in addition to all the things you need to consider when tokenising real estate, as well as the possible challenges that are out there when it comes to tokenising real estate! Let’s first start with a brief introduction to the process of tokenisation.</p>



 Key takeaways  



 
 Tokenising real estate consists of 3 main steps, namely the pre-tokenisation, tokenisation, and post-tokenisation step. 



 The pre-tokenisation step consists of formalising the value of the asset, verifying ownership, establishing property management and maintenance processes, establishing various legal requirements, and researching regulatory requirements. 



 The tokenisation step consists of selecting the right blockchain, determining the token standard, determining the token structure, setting up the legal framework, selecting the right platform for tokenisation, minting the tokens, and integrating off-chain data. 



 The post-tokenisation step consists of selling the tokens, managing the property, monitoring the regulatory environment, and providing investor updates. 



 The tokenisation of real estate comes with many legal and regulatory considerations and technical challenges. 



 The tokenisation of real estate opens up many new opportunities such as new ways of funding, fractional ownership, unlocking liquidity, new investment avenues, and more. 
 



 Brief intro to the tokenisation process 



<p>Tokenisation is the process of creating a (blockchain-enabled) digital twin of a real world asset. This process has gained significant attention in recent times, as it allows for the fractional ownership and trading of assets that were previously illiquid, such as real estate, art, or even intellectual property. As explained more in-depth in our “<a href="https://zaisan.io/tokenisation-real-world-assets-explained/">tokenisation of real world assets explained</a>” article, the process of tokenisation can be broken down into three main steps: pre-tokenisation, tokenisation, and post-tokenisation.</p>



<p>The pre-tokenisation step involves formalising the value of the asset, verifying ownership, and ensuring the proper processes are in place for maintenance, management, and legal compliance. The tokenisation step involves creating a digital representation of the asset in the form of tokens and ensuring that all relevant information about the asset is accurately represented on the blockchain. Oracles are a common solution to enable the connection between traditional databases and the blockchain. Finally, the post-tokenisation step involves the perpetual management of both the physical asset and the tokens. This includes their distribution and sale through specialised marketplaces or offerings.</p>



<p>Tokenisation has numerous benefits for the real estate industry. Firstly, it allows for fractional ownership, which enables investors to purchase and trade smaller portions of a property. This creates opportunities for smaller investors to enter the market and diversify their portfolios with real estate assets. Tokenisation also provides liquidity to real estate assets, allowing investors to buy and sell their tokens on secondary markets. This means that investors can realise their returns without waiting for the property to be sold. Finally, tokenisation can provide increased transparency and traceability of ownership. Tracking each token on the blockchain reduces the potential for fraud and disputes.</p>



<p>However, it also comes with its own set of challenges, including regulatory compliance, data privacy, and the potential for fraudulent activities. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the risks and benefits associated with tokenising a particular asset before embarking on the process. We will discuss the potential challenges more in-depth later in this article. Let’s first take a more in-depth look at what you need to consider when tokenising real estate.</p>

 What to consider when tokenising real estate  



<p>Tokenising real estate is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various aspects. So before delving into the actual tokenisation process, let’s take a look at the following essential aspects to consider when tokenising real estate:</p>



 
 Regulatory compliance  



 Legal structure  



 Fractionalisation  



 Alternative financing options  



 Liquidity &amp; trading  
 



 Regulatory compliance  



<p>Let’s start with regulatory compliance. One of the key regulatory requirements to consider when tokenising real estate is compliance with securities laws. Most jurisdictions consider the tokenisation of real estate as a security offering and subject it to the same regulatory requirements as traditional securities offerings. This also includes complying with securities laws related to registration, disclosure, and anti-fraud measures.</p>



<p>Additionally, anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations must be carefully considered and complied with when tokenising real estate. This is particularly important when dealing with cross-border transactions, as different countries have different AML regulations and requirements. Ensuring a clear definition of the ownership of the real estate is crucial.  Also, there should be proper legal agreements in place to govern the rights and obligations of all parties involved.</p>



<p>Moreover, it is important to note that the regulatory framework for tokenisation of real estate is still developing. The legal requirements can vary widely depending on the country or region in question. Therefore, one should seek legal advice and guidance to ensure that they meet all legal and regulatory requirements. Additionally, as the regulatory framework develops it is important to monitor any changes to prevent non-compliance with new regulations.</p>



<p>Lastly, while it is a key aspect to consider when tokenising real estate, regulatory complexity can be reduced by offering the tokenised real estate in smaller and more specific regions, as well as by tokenising real estate in jurisdictions which have more clear regulations surrounding tokenising real estate.</p>



 Legal structure  



<p>Another important aspect to consider when tokenising real estate is the legal structure. While the legal structure for tokenising retail and residential buildings is relatively similar, it is necessary to take into account the ownership structure and protection of underlying assets. This entails selecting the appropriate legal entity for holding the real estate. Namely, a limited liability company (LLC) or a real estate investment trust (REIT), defining ownership rights and obligations, as well as setting up appropriate governance structures and auditing measures.</p>



<p>In addition to selecting the right legal entity for holding the real estate, it is also crucial to establish ownership agreements that clearly define the rights and obligations of all parties involved in the tokenisation process. This includes establishing clear rules for how the real estate will be managed, maintained, and potentially sold in the future. It is important to consult with legal and financial experts to ensure that the ownership agreements are comprehensive and cover all necessary aspects of the tokenisation process.</p>



 Fractionalisation 



<p>As mentioned in our previous article about tokenising real world assets, fractionalisation of real estate through tokenisation allows for more flexible ownership structures. This makes it more appealing to a wider range of investors. It also enables investors to purchase smaller portions of an asset, making real estate investments accessible to those who may not have the capital to purchase an entire property.</p>



<p>However, it is important to also consider the potential downside of fractionalisation, as it can lead to the fragmentation of ownership. As more investors become involved in the ownership of the asset, it becomes increasingly difficult to reach consensus on decisions related to the asset. This can result in conflicts between token holders, which can ultimately impact the value of the asset. Therefore, it is crucial to have a clear governance structure in place to manage decision-making and conflict resolution among token holders.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is essential to ensure that the real estate asset being tokenised is properly evaluated and accurately reflected in the tokenised value. This includes conducting a thorough assessment of the property’s physical condition, location, and market value. Accurately evaluating the property can help prevent overvaluation or undervaluation of the asset. Consequently,  which can have negative implications for both the issuer and investors.</p>



 Alternative financing options  



<p>As more investors are able to invest in real estate projects through tokenisation, it can provide alternative financing options for projects that may not have been possible before. Tokenisation can open up access to a broader range of investors. Including those who may not have been able to invest in traditional real estate investments. This can provide more flexibility for project financing. Furthermore, it may lead to increased competition for funding, potentially lowering the cost of capital for real estate projects.</p>



<p>However, it is important to carefully consider the potential impact on the financial structure of the real estate asset. Tokenisation can lead to changes in ownership rights, cash flow distribution, and financing arrangements. It is important to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of tokenisation to ensure that it aligns with the project’s financing goals and objectives. Additionally, it is also important to ensure that token holders have a clear understanding of the financial structure of the asset. This includes any potential risks, limitations, and liabilities associated with token ownership. Proper due diligence and risk assessment should be conducted to ensure that the tokenisation of real estate projects is done in a responsible and effective manner.</p>



 Liquidity &amp; trading  



<p>The final aspect to consider is the liquidity and trading aspect of tokenising real estate. As also discussed in some of the other aspects of tokenising real estate, tokenisation has the potential to increase the liquidity of real estate assets. It allows for the creation of digital assets that can be traded quickly and efficiently. This can be beneficial for investors who are looking for an easy way to exit their investments. However, it is important to consider the potential impact on the trading of the real estate asset. For instance, tokenisation can result in changes to the underlying value of the asset, market demand, and price volatility.</p>



<p>One of the advantages of tokenisation is that it allows for the creation of smoother secondary markets, which can increase liquidity and trading volume. This can also benefit investors who are looking to sell their tokens and exit their investments quickly. However, it is important to ensure that there is adequate market demand for the tokenised asset. The market cannot be too illiquid. Investors should also consider the potential risks associated with market volatility. The value of the tokenised asset can fluctuate rapidly in response to changes in market conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to have a well-defined exit strategy in place that takes into account these potential risks and benefits of tokenisation.</p>







<p>All in all, tokenising real estate requires careful consideration of various aspects such as regulatory compliance, the legal structure, fractionalisation, alternative financing options, and liquidity and trading. By addressing these key considerations, tokenisation can offer significant benefits for both investors and issuers. However, before embarking on a tokenisation project it is crucial to do a thorough assessment of the potential risks and benefits involved.</p>



 How to tokenise real estate 



<p>Now you are aware of the things you need to consider when tokenising real estate. Let’s take a deeper look at the exact steps involved in every stage of tokenising real estate.</p>



 Pre-tokenisation steps for real estate  



 
 Formalising the value of the real estate asset 



 Verifying ownership of the real estate asset 



 Ensuring the right processes are in place for maintenance and management of the property 



 Establishing legal requirements for liquidations, dispute resolutions, and enforcement 



 Review of the regulatory requirements 
 



<p>During the pre-tokenisation step there are various things to do in the real, non-digital, world before the asset can get tokenised. One of these steps is formalising the value of the real estate. This involves assessing the value of the property based on various factors such as location, size, condition, and potential for income or appreciation. Valuation is typically done by a licensed appraiser who provides an appraisal report that outlines the value of the property. Determining the value of the tokens that will be created and sold on the blockchain is crucial at this step.</p>



<p>The verification of ownership is also critical in the pre-tokenisation process for real estate assets. This involves conducting title searches, surveys, and reviewing legal documentation to ensure that the person or entity claiming ownership of the property has a legitimate claim to it. This step helps to avoid disputes over ownership of the asset in the future.</p>



<p>In addition to verifying ownership, it is important to have processes in place for the maintenance and management of the physical property. This includes tasks such as property management, repairs, and maintenance of the property. Establishing a maintenance plan and budget is crucial to ensuring that the physical asset remains in good condition and retains its value over time. Furthermore, in this stage, it is also important to establish how the property can be used.</p>



<p>Another part of this step is establishing the legal requirements for liquidations, dispute resolutions, and rule enforcement. Establishing these is a prerequisite for tokenisation to occur. This includes creating contracts, deeds, and insurance policies that cover the ownership and use of the property. Having these legal requirements in place helps to mitigate risk and provides a framework for addressing any disputes or issues that may arise during or after the tokenisation process.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is important to do a careful analysis of the regulatory requirements before you start the tokenisation process. This analysis should look at the regulatory requirements for tokenising real estate, as well as the regulatory requirements for offering tokenised assets in the specific jurisdiction(s) in which you plan on tokenising the property as well as the specific jurisdiction(s) in which you plan on distributing the tokenised asset.</p>



 Tokenisation steps for real estate  



 
 Selecting the right blockchain for the tokenisation 



 Identify the type of token standard that will be used 



 Determine the token structure 



 Prepare the legal framework for the issuance of the tokens 



 Choose a platform to use for the tokenisation 



 Minting the tokens 



 Ensure all relevant information about the asset is represented on-chain 
 



<p>After all pre-tokenisation steps are completed you can move on to the actual tokenisation. The tokenisation process for real estate starts with selecting a blockchain on which you will tokenise your asset. This part is critical, as it determines the type of token standards, marketplaces, and technical abilities at your disposal. It is important to research these areas and make an informed decision about the blockchain you plan to use for the tokenisation process.</p>



<p>Once you have found a blockchain that matches your needs, you can select the specific token standard that you will use for your token. The token standard determines whether a token is fungible or non-fungible.  Also, what kind of other properties it has, or can have. Generally speaking, a common token standard such as the commonly used ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum can be used for this. But with various purpose-built real estate token standards on the rise on various protocols, it’s worth keeping an eye out for more specific token standards that better suit the needs of tokenised real estate.</p>



<p>Determining the token structure follows the selection of the token standard. This refers to the number of tokens to be issued and their value. This is based on the value of the underlying real estate asset. Then, the legal framework for the issuance of the tokens is prepared, including documentation of ownership and the legal rights associated with the tokens.</p>



<p>The next crucial decision is to choose a suitable platform for the tokenisation process. In order to ensure that the chosen platform aligns with the requirements of the real estate asset being tokenised, one must carefully consider factors such as scalability, security, and cost. And while offering the tokens on a marketplace is typically part of the post-tokenisation process, it is worth noting that certain marketplaces offer an integrated tokenisation solution. These platforms provide the ability to carry out the tokenisation process and mint the tokens directly on their marketplace. This is a more streamlined approach that can make everything more efficient by eliminating the need for separate token minting procedures.</p>



<p>However, if the chosen marketplace or platform does not have built-in token minting capabilities, alternative options are available. In this case, you can either mint the tokens independently or collaborate with a technology partner. Regardless of the decisions in this part of the tokenisation step, it is important to ensure your tokens are ready for sale and/or distribution before the post-tokenisation step.</p>



<p>Lastly, in order to ensure that all relevant information about the asset is accurately represented on the blockchain, including the property’s location, size, ownership, and legal rights associated with the tokens, it is essential to utilise oracles to integrate relevant off-chain data with the blockchain. These oracles collect data from traditional databases and broadcast it to the blockchain. Information that would have to get updated regularly would be any information regarding expenses and (rental) income, maintenance and repairs, etc. Another option for managing this information would be pointing to a regular database from the blockchain. Although, generally speaking, the use of oracles to put this off-chain information on-chain is preferred. It is more transparent and prevents the loss of data in case anything happens with the regular database.</p>



 Post-tokenisation steps for real estate  



 
 Distribute/sell the tokenised assets through specialised marketplaces or offerings 



 Perpetual management of the property and the tokens based on the rules previously set 



 Continuous monitoring of the regulatory environment 



 Providing ongoing investor updates 
 



<p>Once someone creates tokenised real estate assets, the next step is to distribute or sell them through specialised marketplaces or offerings. These marketplaces typically enable buyers to access assets either directly from the seller or through a secondary market. Additionally, these marketplaces can provide investors with an opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate assets, which can be particularly attractive for those who do not have the financial resources to purchase an entire property, or want easier access to foreign real estate.</p>



<p>Once the tokenised real estate asset has been sold/distributed (or is being sold/distributed), the perpetual management of both the physical asset and the tokens is key. This includes managing things such as repairs, insurance, leasing, etc. of the physical property, as well as the ongoing management of information about the token on-chain. The perpetual management of the physical asset may involve hiring a property manager to handle day-to-day operations such as maintenance and leasing. Meanwhile, the management of the tokens may require the ongoing monitoring of the blockchain platform used for the tokenisation to ensure that the tokens continue to function properly and that all relevant information is accurately represented.</p>



<p>In this part of the tokenisation process it is also important to continuously monitor the regulatory environment to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes in laws and regulations could impact the ability to distribute or sell the tokenised assets, as well as the ongoing management of the asset.</p>



<p>Finally, providing ongoing investor updates is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and trust. This could include regular financial reporting, updates on property management activities, and other relevant information. Communication with investors can also help to build relationships and foster a sense of community among token holders.</p>







 The challenges of tokenising real estate  



<p>While there are clear benefits to tokenising real estate, there is also a multitude of challenges that need to be considered in order to prevent issues down the line. These challenges can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Legal complexity  



 Technical challenges  



 Adoption and education  
 



 Legal complexity  



<p>The legal complexity of tokenising real estate is one of the biggest challenges in this field. There are many legal and regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome before a property can be tokenised. In particular, the ownership and transfer of real estate is subject to a variety of laws and regulations that can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Creating a standardised tokenisation process that can be applied globally can be difficult due to this.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the legal framework for tokenisation is still in its infancy. This means that there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the legality of the process in many countries. This can create significant barriers to adoption. Investors and issuers alike may be hesitant to get involved with a technology that is not yet fully understood from a legal perspective.</p>



<p>Another legal challenge associated with tokenising real estate is the issue of cross-border transactions. Securities laws and regulations differ significantly across different jurisdictions, which can create difficulties when selling security tokens across borders. In particular, issuers and investors may need to comply with complex rules around cross-border offerings and sales, which can be a significant barrier to entry for smaller investors.</p>



<p>Additionally, different countries may have different rules around the transfer of real estate, which can further complicate the legal picture. As a result, it is important to carefully consider which jurisdictions to target when offering tokenised real estate.</p>



 Technical challenges  



<p>Tokenising real estate also brings technical challenges. It requires a secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure capable of handling large transactions of high value assets. The blockchain platform must ensure that the tokens can be easily traded, while also providing transparency and security for investors. While most modern blockchains are perfectly capable of these tasks, it is also important that the marketplaces on top of these blockchains have the required capabilities, such as the ability to oversee the perpetual management of the physical property and the tokens, managing the distribution of profits, the opportunity to resolve disputes, and more. While more and more marketplaces and platforms with these capabilities are being developed, it is important to tackle this challenge by monitoring what is out there and bringing technically proficient members or partners on board to assist you with the process in the meantime.</p>



<p>Another technical challenge is the integration of off-chain information with the blockchain. As discussed earlier, tokenising real estate requires the sharing of various off-chain information, including property valuations, surveys, and legal documentation. Either through oracles or other mechanisms, the information must be accurately represented on the blockchain. Ensuring the accuracy of this information is critical to the functioning of the tokens and the transparency of the investment. Moreover, the integration of off-chain information with the blockchain raises additional technical challenges, such as data privacy and security, which also vary per jurisdiction.</p>



 Adoption and education challenges  



<p>Another challenge of tokenising real estate is the need for education and adoption. Tokenisation is a relatively new concept with many investors being unfamiliar with the benefits and risks associated with this type of investment. In this stage, education is crucial to ensure that investors understand the technology, the risks and opportunities involved, as well as the legal and regulatory framework. Moreover, real estate professionals, such as property managers and developers, will also need to be educated about tokenisation and how it can benefit their businesses.</p>



<p>Adoption of tokenisation may also face difficulties due to the conservative nature of the real estate industry. Real estate has traditionally been a relatively stable and conservative investment. Many investors and professionals may be hesitant to adopt new technologies or investment structures. Convincing these individuals and professionals of the benefits of tokenisation, as well as assisting them with actually tokenising their real estate, will require significant effort and time.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, tokenising real estate opens up many new opportunities such as new ways of funding, fractional ownership, unlocking liquidity, new investment avenues, and more. However, it is crucial to carefully consider the complex legal landscape and to address the various considerations in order to ensure a successful tokenisation process.</p>



<p>Working with a <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/tokenisation/">knowledgeable tokenisation partner</a> can prove invaluable in navigating these challenges, providing expert guidance on both the technical and legal aspects of the tokenisation process. All in all, tokenising real estate can be a complex, yet very rewarding process if done correctly.</p>

This enables them to visit websites, use QR codes, and generate zero-knowledge proofs to verify credentials. The same verification capabilities can also be made available to smart contracts.</p><p>Credentials are sent directly from the issuer, using an encrypted connection between the web browser and Verida Wallet, then stored on our self-sovereign data network. This provides secure, encrypted decentralized storage for this highly sensitive information.</p><p>Just like any other wallet, a user’s private keys encrypt and authenticate access for complete ownership over their credentials. An individual can use their private key to securely access their Polygon ID credentials and data on other devices and applications or choose to permanently delete.</p><p>When a user receives a proof request from a Verifier to verify itself against a set of checkpoints or access controls, a zero-knowledge proof is generated locally within Verida wallet and gets submitted to the Verifier in a privacy preserving manner. This integration gets us one step closer to a decentralized world where individuals don’t have to sacrifice their privacy to enjoy personalized online experiences.</p><p>Download the Verida Wallet for iOS or Android at <a href="http://www.verida.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=polygonid">verida.io</a>.</p> About Verida <p>The<a href="http://www.verida.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=polygonid"> Verida Wallet</a> is a self-custody Web mobile wallet.

<p>This is the 25th post in an <a>ongoing, series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave browsers. This post describes work done by Staff Engineer Aleksey Khoroshilov and was written by VP of Privacy Engineering Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>Most Web browsers are finally getting serious about limiting third-party tracking on the Web and—while no browser is as aggressive as Brave—third-party trackers are taking notice of the trend. In response, third-parties are increasingly relying on first-party storage to continue tracking users. Forgetful Browsing is the first in a series of upcoming tools Brave has planned to continue protecting Brave users and address first-party reidentification.</p>
<p>Starting with desktop version 1.53, and Android version 1.54 <a>1</a>, Brave browsers will include a new feature called “Forgetful Browsing,” which allows users to always clear cookies and other storage when the site is closed. Forgetful Browsing can help you:</p>
 
 Be automatically logged out of a site when it’s closed 
 Avoid being rate limited by a site (e.g., “you have X remaining articles to view”) 
 Generally prevent sites from reidentifying you across visits 
 
<p>Forgetful Browsing is similar to, but more powerful and protective than, popular browsing extensions and private browsing modes. It’s another example of Brave offering the most powerful privacy features of any popular browser.</p>

 The Web has the wrong defaults for privacy 
<p>Many privacy problems on the Web have a common root cause: by default, browsers let sites reidentify users indefinitely, but users only benefit from reidentification on a fraction of sites they visit.</p>
<p>In some cases, it’s very useful for a site to remember you (e.g. so you don’t have to log back into your email every day, or so you can easily use a social media account). But such sites are the exception, not the rule. Most often, you won’t benefit from being remembered by every news site you read an article on, or every shopping site you briefly browsed, or every image hosting site that showed you a cute cat picture.</p>
<p>In this way, all Web browsers get the defaults backwards: they assume you want to be identifiable by every site you visit. And this causes both annoyance (e.g. rate limiting or paywalls) and privacy harm (e.g. being profiled by untrustworthy sites). This problem is called “unwanted first-party reidentification.”</p>
<p>The Forgetful Browsing feature—the next step in Brave’s ongoing project to improve how browsers manage first-party storage—addresses the reidentification problem head-on.</p>

 Browsers lack good protections against unwanted first-party reidentification 
<p>Browsers are getting better at protecting users against third-party tracking, but generally do a poor job of protecting against unwanted first-party identification. Brave already provides <a href="https://privacytests.org/">best-in-class protections against third-party tracking</a>; Forgetful Browsing is one of several upcoming features in Brave that will provide similarly robust protections against first-party tracking.</p>
<p>Browsers provide some tools to help users prevent unwanted first-party reidentification, but these tools are clumsy, inconvenient, and scoped either too broadly or too narrowly, all of which invite unwanted–and irreversible–reidentification.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario: Khen has two email accounts, <code>dolphinfan4ever@example.com</code> and <code>serious.guy@example.com</code>, both of which Khen accesses through his Web browser. Khen doesn’t want the email provider to know both accounts are owned by the same person. Unfortunately, Web browsers make this kind of privacy very difficult.</p>
<p>This is because of how browsers manage first-party storage. Browsers prevent sites from reading another site’s cookies (e.g. yahoo.com can’t read your login cookies for outlook.com), but browsers generally don’t restrict how the same site can read cookies across visits (if you visited chicagotribune.com yesterday, the site can re-read the same cookies next time you visit). Even when you tell a site to log you out, it can’t easily clear some kinds of first-party storage <a>2</a>. This gives even well meaning sites the ability to reidentify users across visits. Worse, browsers provide few protections against sites that intentionally aim to re-identify you across logins (as in Khen’s situation in the previous paragraph).</p>
<p>Browsers provide some tools you can use to be certain there are no identifying values persisting across site visits. Unfortunately, these tools are difficult to use and/or require user perfection; in many cases a single error can allow a tracker to permanently, irreversibly link to different accounts together.</p>
 
 
<p>Private browsing modes: Allow users to visit a site with a clean storage area, but require perfection to prevent unwanted first-party reidentification. If Khen (from the previous example) forgets to use a private window just once, and mistakenly logs into his second email account in a normal window, the email provider will be able to link the two email accounts, indefinitely and irreversibly.</p>
 
 
<p>Browser extensions: Can clear first-party storage whenever a user closes a site, but extensions are limited in their ability to clear cached values, or values in nested documents.</p>
 
 
<p>Clear all storage: Most browsers contain a feature like this, which clears first-party storage for all sites when closing the browser. However, this feature is, for most users, very inconvenient, since it will log a user out of all their sites, even those the user trusts and wants to stay authenticated with. The feature also does not provide much help for people who tend to leave their browser open for long periods of time. This feature is a sledgehammer when what’s needed is a scalpel.</p>
 
 
<p>Advanced site controls: Some browsers include this feature, which advanced users can use to manually clear, or otherwise micro-manage first-party storage for sites. These features are useful, but can be (depending on the browser) difficult to discover, need perfect use to prevent identification, or otherwise can be unsuitable for non-advanced users.</p>
 
 

 Forgetful Browsing prevents unwanted first-party reidentification 
<p>Forgetful Browsing, by contrast, allows Brave users to easily prevent unwanted first-party reidentification, in a way that’s convenient and does not require constant vigilance to get right. Using <a>Brave Shields</a>, users can indicate that they want to be forgotten when a site is closed. When this option is set, Brave will clear first-party storage for the site a few seconds after there are no more open tabs for the site. Forgetful Browsing clears both explicitly stored values (e.g. cookies, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">indexedDB</a>) and indirectly stored values (e.g. HTTP cache or DNS cache).</p>
<p>Users can enable Forgetful Browsing in one of two ways.</p>

 Set Forgetful Browsing for a single site 
<p>Users can indicate that a specific site should be forgotten when it’s closed. To do so:</p>
 
 Navigate to the site. 
 Click the shields icon in the URL bar. 
 Click Advanced controls. 
 Click Forget me when I close this site. 
 



    


    



 Set Forgetful Browsing as a global default 
<p>Users can also make Forgetful Browsing the default setting for all sites. To do so:</p>
 
 Visit <code>brave://settings/shields</code> from the Brave browser. 
 Click Forget me when I close a site. 
 



    


    


<p>Note that users can set this as the global default, and then use the steps outlined above (in the “Set Forgetful Browsing for a single site” section of this post) to create exceptions (i.e. to indicate that particular sites should not be forgotten). This allows you to configure Brave to clear storage everytime a site is closed except for your email site, a social media site you log into often, etc.</p>

 Forgetful Browsing applies to entire sites, not domains 
<p>Forgetful Browsing differs from other settings in Brave Shields in its scope. Most settings in Brave Shields are set per domain; Forgetful Browsing, meanwhile, is set per site. For example, you can configure first.site.example to use aggressive fingerprinting protections and second.site.example to use standard fingerprinting protections, but all subdomains on site.example will share the same Forgetful Browsing setting. This is necessary to align the Forgetful Browsing setting with how Brave (and most other browsers) enforce storage boundaries.</p>

 More coming to prevent unwanted first-party reidentification 
<p>Forgetful Browsing is one of several existing ways Brave protects against unwanted first-party reidentification on the Web. Brave’s <a>Unlinkable Bouncing</a> feature automatically clears first-party storage whenever the browser is bounced through known tracking domains. And Brave’s <a>CNAME uncloaking</a> feature allows Brave to block trackers even when they try to look like first-party resources. Brave also limits the lifetime of cookies set in JavaScript to seven days to prevent some forms of first-party tracking.</p>
<p>Forgetful Browsing is the first of several upcoming features related to further managing and improving privacy around first-party storage on the Web. Together, these features will address a range of ways first-party storage can be abused to harm users. We look forward to sharing more about these features in the coming weeks and months.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Brave will incrementally enable Forgetful Browsing for users during the 1.53 and 1.54 release processes. Users who want to test the feature now can visit <code>brave://flags</code> and manually enable the “Enable First Party Storage Cleanup support” flag. Note that Forgetful Browsing is still experimental, and should only be enabled by users who understand the risks of enabling such features.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

 🛠️ Builder resources: *New* talks from our 2023 Crypto Startup School, now available! <p>The next generation of startups isn’t just advancing web3; it’s laying the groundwork for a more open, decentralized internet. But the industry know-how, shifting trends, and emerging tools in the space can be difficult for builders to navigate — whether they’re new to crypto, coming from other domains, or are more seasoned founders. That’s why we started Crypto Startup School in 2020, and recently relaunched it with a new cohort: to connect builders with the resources, expertise, and networks they need. </p><p>Over the past ten weeks (and counting), we’ve covered topics like go-to-market, community, product-market fit, technical &amp; research deep dives, policy, and much more. And now, we’re publicly sharing the curriculum with everyone, starting with 5 videos on: strategies for pricing; the basics of cryptography for blockchains; protocol design; the big picture; and lessons learned in strategy, growth, &amp; operations in the business of open source (with Uniswap Labs). We’ll continue to share 25+ more talks through near-weekly “drops”, so be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@a16zcrypto">subscribe to our channel</a> for updates. <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQ9HCQMu_8ywq3VUso7i_-TOx6RKXQeQ">watch the first batch of talks here</a><br>share: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1654512284335734784">on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7060282013236277251/">on LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x2d7531">on Farcaster</a> </p> 🔗🧩 Deep dive: On data availability sampling  <p>Data availability sampling — which is applicable to advances in computing, networking generally, and especially blockchains — helps ensure that all necessary blockchain data has been made available to nodes without straining the network. It is therefore important for scaling blockchains.</p><p>Data availability sampling also features heavily in “danksharding”, a series of planned upgrades to Ethereum; and also paves the way for more advanced blockchain networks and user applications (including future stateless clients). The next danksharding milestone is EIP-4844, the Ethereum upgrade known as “protodanksharding”, which is planned for later this year. [Both “danksharding” and “protodanksharding” were named to reference Ethereum Foundation researchers, Dankrad Feist and protolambda (now at OP Labs).]</p><p>a16z crypto researcher &amp; cryptographer Valeria Nikolaenko, with Stanford cryptography professor and a16z crypto research advisor Dan Boneh, survey how data availability in danksharding works. They also propose modifications to the underlying technique that may improve data recovery (e.g., requiring not 75% but 25% of shares to recover a block). Finally, both of them explain the concepts (and some of the math) involved in our latest podcast episode, hosted by a16z crypto’s Robert Hackett. </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/an-overview-of-danksharding-and-a-proposal-for-improvement-of-das/">read their piece</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/lera_banda/status/1651665339363520513">share</a><br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/podcast/data-availability-danksharding-web3-with-a16z-podcast/">listen to the discussion</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1654618547321208832">share</a></p><p>related readings:</p>  <p><a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/proto_danksharding_faq">FAQs on danksharding &amp; protodanksharding</a> - Vitalik Buterin</p>  <p><a href="https://grizzly-answer-991.notion.site/Proto-Danksharding-0b148da2c6a54ca5838716b481a5ead3">a technical analysis of protodanksharding</a> - Michael/ grizzly-answer-991<br></p>  <p>see/ hear also:</p>  <p>📖 read about why the major Ethereum upgrade <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/what-the-merge-means/">The Merge</a> (2022) mattered - by Ali Yahya</p>  <p>🎧 listen to “<a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/ethereum-the-merge-pos-security-decentralization-process-community-people">Ethereum, the Merge and beyond</a>” - with Tim Beiko, Tim Roughgarden, Ali Yahya, and Sonal Chokshi</p><p></p>  <p><a href="https://api.a16zcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/a16z-crypto_HMT-crypto-consultation-response-April-2023-.pdf">👑🔓🌐</a></p><p>--Sonal Chokshi, Stephanie Zinn, Tim Sullivan, Robert Hackett / a16z crypto  <br></p><p>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance. For more information: <a href="https://nymtech.net/">https://nymtech.net/</a>.</p> About Monero <p>Monero was launched in April 2014. It was a fair, pre-announced launch of the <a href="https://static.monerooutreach.org/doc/monero-outreach/cryptonote_whitepaper.pdf">CryptoNote</a> reference code. There was no pre-mine or “insta”-mine, and no portion of the block reward goes to development. See the original Bitcointalk thread&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563821.0">here</a>.</p><p>Monero has made several large improvements since launch. Nearly all improvements have provided advances to security or privacy, or they have facilitated use. Monero continues to develop with goals of privacy and security first, ease of use and efficiency second.

A <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/single-sign-on-sdk/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet">decentralized single-sign-on toolkit</a> that optimizes the user experience for new users and seamlessly unlocks access to encrypted data and a multi-chain blockchain wallet.  A fast, encrypted, self-sovereign data testnet, running for 18 months, and recently <a href="https://news.verida.io/the-decentralized-verida-acacia-testnet-is-live-81503c119d9f">decentralised via the Acacia&nbsp;testnet</a>.  <a href="https://news.verida.io/introducing-verida-one-c3d497948c10?source=collection_home---4------5-----------------------">Verida One</a> (private alpha), a decentralized platform for individuals to manage all their identities and personal data in one&nbsp;place.  A <a href="https://news.verida.io/announcing-the-verida-credentials-incubator-the-inspiring-first-projects-coming-to-market-9ad8f1856e6b">credentials incubator program</a>, launched almost twelve months ago, and now helping multiple projects bring their credentials ecosystems to&nbsp;market.  <p>We are now preparing for our mainnet, so it’s time to reward our community members for helping put the Verida testnet through its&nbsp;paces.</p> Bringing the Verida testnet to&nbsp;you <p>The incentivized testnet will rollout over several phases, each with their own campaigns. Our first phase will be focusing on end users, allowing them to install the <a href="http://www.verida.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet&amp;utm_content=install">Verida Wallet</a> and progress through different campaigns designed to battle test the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>In future phases, the team will work closely with storage node operators and application developers to further decentralize the <a href="https://www.verida.network/">Verida network</a> and build a world leading onboarding experience for web3 builders.</p> Why participate in the Verida incentivized testnet? <p>Verida’s mainnet launch is slated for mid 2023. In the leadup, the team plans to accelerate growth to onboard users, application developers and node providers onto the network. Early participants who contribute to the incentivized testnet will be rewarded with Verida’s native protocol token, VDA — redeemable for mainnet tokens upon&nbsp;launch.</p><p>More than 60% of the Verida token supply is dedicated to rewarding ecosystem participants for supporting the network rollout. A portion of this token supply will be set aside for the incentivized testnet.</p> What can you&nbsp;do? <p>As a user during the incentivized testnet, you can explore the many features of the Verida network and applications. You will create decentralized identities, reclaim your personal data stored in centralized platforms and unlock early access to new applications. You will download the <a href="https://www.verida.io/">Verida Wallet</a> and experiment with the decentralized social platform, <a href="https://www.verida.one/">Verida&nbsp;One.</a></p><p>We will provide more details over the coming weeks as each campaign is announced.</p> What is the VDA&nbsp;token? <p>The native token of the Verida network (VDA) creates a data economy enabling secure interactions between accounts to facilitate secure data storage, trusted sharing, fast querying and secure messaging.</p><p>The Verida network is a self-sovereign “user-pays” model, whereby users pay for their own storage needs. In this way, “access to user data” is not the product, rather the product is the “security and protection” of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Storage node operators must stake VDA tokens in order for their nodes to be discoverable on the network and be available for selection by end&nbsp;users.</p><p>The Verida token plays an important role in bootstrapping the network by incentivizing and rewarding users for connecting their identities and data, while rewarding storage node operators for providing storage infrastructure to end&nbsp;users.</p>The Verida Data&nbsp;Economy<p>VDA has a fixed total supply of 1 billion tokens. Creating a native token allows for the design of economic incentives in the Verida network that provides control over the setting of monetary policy and equitable rewards for all network participants.</p> How can you participate? <p>Every individual has personal data to reclaim. Verida’s infrastructure will impact millions of lives. For this reason, we should all have a say. The incentivized testnet is open to everyone and all, interested in privacy-focused data management on&nbsp;web3.</p><p>More information will be posted on our blog in the following weeks as the Verida team prepares to launch the first user campaign. <a href="http://www.verida.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet&amp;utm_content=subscribe">Subscribe to receive updates</a> and <a href="http://discord.verida.io">join our self-sovereign community</a> today.</p><p>This is an opportunity to contribute to a solution expected to change the nature of data on the internet.

     <br>The Horizen dAppy Hour 
<p>Horizen hosted a side event during Consensus, called dAppy Hour, with our partners <a href="https://horizenlabs.io/">Horizen Labs</a>, <a href="https://immunefi.com/">Immunefi</a>, <a href="https://www.zellic.io/">Zellic</a>, and <a href="https://www.auros.global/">Auros</a>, where guests enjoyed food, drinks, and networking! We had live music at the event, featured an interactive photo booth, and it was a great opportunity for Consensus attendees to network and unwind, during a busy event week, welcoming over 300 attendees throughout the evening!</p>     
 

 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 

 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
	 
	    			 
		             
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
                         
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
            	     
	 
		 
	    			 
		             
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
                         
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
            	     
	 
		 
	    			 
		             
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
                         
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
            	     
	 
	
 
         
     <br>Final Thoughts 
<p>Consensus was a great opportunity for the team to catch up with our community, learn more about what the latest in Web3 was, meet our new ecosystem partners, and more. We look forward to seeing everyone again next year. </p>

Centre stage fireside chat between Chelsea Manning (Nym) and Leo Swartz (Fortune) — WebSummit Rio&nbsp;2023<p>Nym was at <a href="https://rio.websummit.com/">WebSummit in Rio</a> this week, one of the world’s largest technology conferences. The team joined other innovators, thought leaders and entrepreneurs from across the world with the aim to ensure privacy remains at the centre of internet industry debates, and to support the rapidly growing Latin American Nym community!</p><p>Nym joined forces with <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a> to ensure privacy was the headline of WebSummit with centre stage appearances by Chelsea Manning and shortly after by the President of Signal messaging app, Meredith Whittacker. The two voices ensured that the AI hype was grounded in the realities of data markets and centralised power, emphasising the need for privacy technologies to ensure our future freedoms!</p> Key highlights from this&nbsp;week   Nym Security Chelsea Manning opened the centre stage in a fireside chat with Forbes crypto reporter Leo Swartz and featured as the main conference highlight of the&nbsp;day.  The Nym Masterclass on Privacy in the Age of AI had a guest appearance by President of Signal foundation, Meredith Whittaker, and was packed way over capacity.  The Nym partnership with Swissnex was strengthened boost growth in Latin America, hosting presentations by Nym COO Alexis Roussel, CSO Jaya Klara Brekke and Head of Growth Daniel&nbsp;Vazquez.  Nym team met with the Rio Secretary for Science and Innovation to propose a Rio privacy crypto-carnival (and she liked it! So stay tuned for a party invitation…)  The Nym community of Rio linked up with the z-cash community to boost privacy interest and ecosystem growth in the&nbsp;region.   Brazil takes on the tech&nbsp;industry <p>Just before WebSummit opened, Brazil shut down Telegram for a few days. The Brazilian Congress is going through an intense debate about a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-lawmakers-vote-controversial-bill-clean-up-social-media-2023-05-02/">new online bill </a>to push for stronger content moderation by technology platforms, after far right groups attacked government buildings and schools earlier in the&nbsp;year.</p> Privacy is the solution, not the&nbsp;problem <p>The new bill and how to address manipulation, radicalisation and violence, without resorting to censorship was a major topic of discussion at the Summit. But there is an approach to these problems that so far has been overlooked: strong privacy protections. Securing strong privacy of communications would protect people from being profiled and targeted with radicalising content streams and misinformation!</p><p>Nym discussed the problem of disinformation with the Secretary of Science and Innovation of Rio de Janeiro, Tatiana Roque, who is also an expert on the topic. In her view, trusted social relationships provide the societal immune system to solve misinformation and disinformation. And she agreed that enabling people to securely communicate with one another without spying and interference is the foundation for building trust in&nbsp;society.</p> Fireside Chat with Chelsea Manning, Nym and Leo Swartz,&nbsp;Fortune <p>Tuesday 2nd of May, 10.30 am centre stage — <a href="https://wsr23-video-ed.s3.amazonaws.com/ST1_1_3_58c28215-cd70-49ea-83cc-3133d64198a7_000008_002255.mp4?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAISIRK44NQMJLRRAA&amp;Signature=YX5VFos72tslSrWQ3iqWd5ks26Y%3D&amp;Expires=1688225188">watch&nbsp;here</a></p><p>How could strong data privacy lead to better AI? Could encryption democratise governance and access to AI? How can cryptography counter deep-fakes and contribute to a better and more secure online experience? Chelsea Manning spoke on MainStage with journalist Leo Schwartz, reporter at Fortune covering the global impact of crypto, regulation, cyber crime, and all things blockchain.</p> Nym Masterclass: Privacy in the age of&nbsp;AI <p>Tuesday 2nd of May, 1pm Main Conference, Masterclass 3</p><p>Unfortunately WebSummit does not record masterclasses, but a longer summary is&nbsp;coming!</p>Chelsea Manning, Jaya Klara Brekke, Meredith Whittaker, Alexis Roussel and Vincent Neumann at the Nym Masterclass on Privacy in the age of AI — WebSummit Rio&nbsp;2023<p>A major highlight of the whole summit was the Nym masterclass on Privacy and AI. The Nym team Jaya Klara Brekke, Alexis Roussel and Chelsea Manning, was joined by President of Signal Foundation, Meredith Whittaker and Vincent Neumann, Program Manager, Innovation &amp; Startups Swissnex (in order of appearance). We had a queue down two floors and the room filled up over capacity!</p><p>AI has been built after over a decade of mass surveillance. In the words of Meredith: it is a “surveillance derivative”. The recent boom is the result of large technology platforms holding near monopoly access to people’s content and behavioural data. But privacy preserving technologies are going through their own revolution. End-to-end encryption is becoming standard and we now have functioning mixnets and advanced cryptographic techniques including homomorphic encryption.</p><p>The key question is whether these technologies can ensure that people and society can have a say over the future development and uses of AI. Privacy preserving technologies afterall place the power to decide over data (when it is created and who can use it) back into the hands of&nbsp;people.</p><p>Jaya introduced the session, providing the current context of AI hype, privacy tech and the risks of “privacy washing” that will likely come this next&nbsp;year.</p><p>Alexis gave an overview of the Nym mixnet, and how metadata can be protected to secure against AI-powered surveillance.</p><p>Chelsea emphasised that regulation is not going to be enough, what is needed is a technological intervention to block data markets and shift the direction of AI development.</p><p>Meredith gave the historical overview of how data-markets and centralised big tech power emerged to monopolise the control over AI, reproducing racist categorisations in society. Important research and publications that were mentioned included the<a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/2023-landscape"> AI Now report</a> by Amba Kak and Dr Sarah Myers West,<a href="https://abebabirhane.com/"> work</a> by Abeba Birhane and<a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/louise-amoore/"> work</a> by Prof Louise&nbsp;Amoore.</p><p>Vincent Neuman of Swissnex rounded off the masterclass highlighting the importance of Latin America as a counterpoint to the surveillance-driven technology industries of the US and China, describing the work and programs of Swissnex in supporting start ups in the&nbsp;region.</p> Press conference with Alexis Roussel and Chelsea&nbsp;Manning <p>The Nym WebSummit press conference on building privacy by design — watch&nbsp;<a href="https://wsr23-video-ed.s3.amazonaws.com/ST2_1_3_PRIORITY_8545eeea-bb6f-421b-8f1f-5fccedf36dff_000000_001447.mp4.mp4?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAISIRK44NQMJLRRAA&amp;Signature=nJSvlCaoipVADTnefaUSIF6xXag%3D&amp;Expires=1688245445">here</a>.</p>Chelsea Manning (Nym) and Alexis Roussel (Nym) press conference — WebSummit Rio&nbsp;2023 The Nym team on the ground in&nbsp;Rio  Nym Latin&nbsp;America   Daniel Vazquez (Head of growth in Latin&nbsp;America)  Joao Phelip (Nym community manager, Portuguese)  With expert assistance on the booth from Paula and&nbsp;Bruno!

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>Just like every month, it’s time for a monthly update. As we start May at full speed, let's take a moment to recap April’s developments!</p> Tech updates  v0.5 updates PIP-13 succeeded!<p>Earlier this month, a series of updates and upgrades for v0.5 was presented by the Panther community. This elaborate proposal aimed to introduce updates to v0.5 needed for v1’s development and launch a new Advanced Staking round.</p><p>Formalizing this proposal, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0825de3b9289d3e04e8f9f3607d1145923f482104fecabc9d02634b3f7d6f521">PIP-13</a> succeeded with an overwhelming majority vote on our Snapshot page. Among other things, this meant that the community decided on:</p>  Prolonging the "Advanced Staking" program, conserving the original staking APR, until Aug 22, 2023  Implementing UI upgrades, effectively elevating v0.5 to Panther Protocol’s v0.5.3.  <p>After the vote, the proposal was successfully executed. With all contracts deployed by Panther community members, this is officially our third decentralized deployment to date!</p> v1 updates  Testing for v1 <p>We keep working on Panther's v1 mechanism to issue rewards, with complex mathematical models running to test this. Work on rewards and fees is now unblocked due to advancements in Shielded Pools' development and the deployment of v0.5.3, a significant step forward.</p><p>General product testing for v1 is also progressing according to plan. This month witnessed the internal release of the first prototype for the full product. Exciting times are near as we polish and prepare to develop it towards Testnet!</p>Get ready for v1! Diving into zSwap and DeFi Adaptors Panther will enable private DEX swaps with zSwap.<p>We also just published an article featuring an <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zswap-and-defi-adaptors-unlocking-private-defi-usage/">in-depth look at zSwap &amp; DeFi Adaptors</a>.</p><p>Discover how this concept will link Panther with leading DeFi dApps like <a href="https://twitter.com/Uniswap?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/QuickswapDEX?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">QuickswapDEX</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve Finance</a>, enabling seamless &amp; private swaps on DEXs. The article also explains how having DeFi Adaptors makes Panther’s privacy stronger.</p> Relayer integration <p>For v1, we are also progressing in the integration of relayers, an essential component of Panther’s privacy.</p><p>Relayers are responsible for forwarding transactions to the blockchain, thus acting as intermediaries between Panther’s privacy layer and the decentralized network. They can do so, for example, by paying for gas in users’ name. By integrating relayers, we aim to significantly increase privacy by obfuscating the origin of transactions, making it more difficult for third parties to trace and link them to specific users.</p><p>Another crucial aspect of our ongoing work is the exploration of gasless transactions. Gas fees are a well-known pain point for users in the blockchain ecosystem, often causing frustration due to their volatility and unpredictability. By evaluating gasless transactions, we hope to provide users with a more convenient and cost-effective way to interact with the Panther Protocol network.</p><p>Lastly, we are in the process of exploring Account Abstraction Paymaster logic. Account abstraction is a cutting-edge technique that aims to simplify the user experience by allowing smart contracts to pay gas fees on behalf of users. The Paymaster logic plays a crucial role in this process, as it is responsible for determining which transactions should be paid for and ensuring the appropriate gas fees are covered.</p> Panther’s PMONK zero-knowledge scheme makes its debut Last weekend, at the ETH Privacy event in Istanbul, Turkey, CTO and Chief Scientist Anish Mohammed presented a paper for PMONK, Panther’s original zk-SNARK scheme.<p>This presentation, which will be soon published on Youtube, represents a significant milestone in the history of our project. There is still quite some way to go before we can tell you more about PMONK’s applications, but right now seemed like a good time to share the excitement!</p> Documentation review, compliance work, and website continue to progress <p>Last but not least, our technical contributors are fact-checking and screening our improved documentation for it to go live.</p><p>Expect the site’s launch soon, as well as a first release of documentation followed by an ongoing process of updates and upgrades.</p><p>Finally, we continue engaging with industry leaders in the Web3 compliance realm to determine the best approach for Panther's solution. Stay tuned!</p> Ecosystem  Community-driven exchange listings Another mission successfully completed by the Panther DAO!<p>This month, our decentralized community reached a notable milestone as $ZKP was listed on <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1643557579900035072?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">MEXC Global</a> in a community-driven operation, enhancing our token’s accessibility in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Following this, Hotbit.io also took the initiative to list $ZKP, so we had two centralized exchange listings this month.</p> ZKPanthers NFT giveaway Cool cats.<p>Another notable event this was the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZKPanthers?src=hashtag_click&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">#ZKPanthers</a> NFT giveaway organized by community merch providers <a href="https://twitter.com/SubvertedN?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Subverted Norms</a>!</p><p>Subverted Norms designed the beautiful artwork, minting only 25 tokens, giving away 15 of them, and listing the rest for sale at OpenSea. They also created some cool products based on this NFTs, which you can see <a href="https://panthermerch.shop/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">on their merch shop</a>!</p><p>Congratulations to all the winners!</p> Media and articles <p>Co-Founder Oliver Gale's latest piece on the potential of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and their use cases for businesses is now live on Forbes. The article discusses the importance of ZKPs in finance, as they enable secure and private transactions while meeting regulatory requirements. The article also highlights how businesses can benefit from ZKPs in terms of enhanced privacy, improved security, regulatory compliance, and greater efficiency.</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/04/19/zero-knowledge-proofs-use-cases-for-businesses/?sh=38db059558b8&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Read it here.</a></p>A read you can’t miss straight from our CEO.<p>Oliver also published two more articles on our blog:</p>  The first one breaks down the potential role of on-chain dark pools as key to attracting traditional institutions and enterprises to DeFi. He explains how these pools can allow for secure, private, and regulatory-compliant transactions that leverage the best side of decentralized finance.<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/on-chain-dark-pools-the-missing-piece-to-bridge-enterprise-capital-to-defi/"> Read it here.</a>  The second one was written in anticipation of Consensus 2023, the largest gathering of crypto, blockchain, and Web3 communities. In it, Oliver highlights the critical industry concerns and insights on integrating traditional finance and DeFi, addressing regulatory compliance, exploring compliant-friendly data protection solutions like Zero-Knowledge technology, and fostering collaboration for a unified financial ecosystem. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/insiders-guide-to-consensus-2023-defi-capital-markets-collision/">Read it here.</a>   Ama with Hotbit <p>Oliver also took part in an AMA hosted by Hotbit to introduce Panther to a broader audience and answer questions about his latest article mentioned above.

At Sequoia, we have a long history of partnering with companies that pioneered the commercialization of open source software, such as MongoDB and Confluent, and the pace of our partnerships with open source companies&nbsp; is also on the rise, including Chainguard, Deno, dbt labs, Infracost and Temporal Technologies in recent years. But we also recognize that open source projects that don’t become businesses are still critical tools for our portfolio companies and the broader community.</p>



<p>Last year, we were fortunate enough to meet Sebastián Ramírez, creator of the wildly popular open source Python framework <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, which is used everywhere from Fortune Global 500 corporations such as BMW, American Express and Roche, to academia, to nonprofits such as NASA and the Red Cross. Sebastián was overflowing with ideas to improve on what he’d built—but because even the most beloved open source projects rarely pay the bills, he was forced to split his time between FastAPI and part-time work.</p>



<p>His situation inspired us to think about how we might support his work and that of other open source creators who give so much to the broader tech ecosystem. Today, we are thrilled to share that Sebastián is the first Sequoia Open Source Fellow.</p>



<p>Each year, we’ll invite a small number of leading open source contributors to this new fellowship program and will provide a stipend to cover their living expenses for 6 to 12 months, so they can dedicate themselves to their open source work full-time. They’ll also become members of the Sequoia community, connecting with and mentoring founders. (Sebastián recently helped us host the closing event for our seed-stage catalyst, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>.) In short, we will support each other. We believe Sequoia can benefit greatly from fellows’ expertise to help us better understand the open source ecosystem, but there are no other strings attached. Our goal is to give Sebastián and builders like him the time and space to innovate, whatever that means for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We recently sat down with Sebastián to talk about FastAPI, his fellowship experience so far, and what’s next.</p>



 



<p>For those who aren’t familiar, what is FastAPI and why did you build it?</p>



<p>Sebastián: FastAPI makes life easier for developers working in applications in the cloud using Python, which is one of the most popular programming languages—it’s often used for machine learning, data science and AI. You can use FastAPI to take advantage of all the features of code editors, like auto completion and inline errors, while getting application best practices by default with simple code, all in one place, so you can be super efficient and still get the best possible quality and performance.</p>



<p>I was working on teams building data and machine learning products, and we kept seeing the same problems and mistakes. I tried every tool I could find, but nothing ticked all the boxes—so eventually, I decided to try to put all the things I liked about other frameworks into one project. I didn’t expect it to work, but it did! I released the first public version of FastAPI on December 24, 2018, two years after the version of Python that enabled FastAPI, and it’s been downloaded more than 800,000 times since. It was even used to <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamin_falk/status/1546947039363305472">share data</a> captured by the James Webb Space Telescope—that was a highlight.</p>



Data captured by the James Webb telescope was shared via FastAPI.



<p>Why did you decide this fellowship was right for you?</p>



<p>Sebastián: Ever since I started FastAPI, I’d been trying to optimize to work more on it and my other open source projects, like Typer and SQLModel. But because they were growing so quickly, it took a lot of time just to maintain them, and even more to improve them. I quit my job and worked part-time, but it still wasn’t enough. So doing open source exclusively was super appealing—not just the hours, but the continuity of those hours. I knew being able to focus deeply would drive a lot more progress.</p>



<p>I was also interested in learning about how businesses are built, because I think for FastAPI, a self-sustaining model will probably make sense at some point. It can help a lot of people and organizations be more efficient, and there’s value in that. But I wanted to focus first on just making it the best tool possible.</p>



<p>What has the experience been like so far?</p>



<p>Amazing. Honestly, I didn’t expect it to be this nice. We had calls before we started, and those were good. It was good on paper. But it’s been just as it was on those calls. We talk about companies and projects, but otherwise, I get to just work like crazy.</p>



<p>One thing that’s really valuable but less obvious is that I can focus on what I know will have the biggest impact, even if it’s invisible to most users—like the underlying building blocks of FastAPI, or even other open source projects it uses. I’ve even been working on improving the way internal code (reference) APIs are documented in Python itself recently, which is the kind of thing it’s usually very difficult to allocate time and resources for. But it will be super valuable, for FastAPI users and everyone else.</p>



<p>What are you most looking forward to—during the rest of your fellowship and beyond?</p>



<p>A bunch of things! The most obvious one is integration for the new version of <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a>, which is <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-pydantic-no-more-steel-seats-for-developers/">now</a> part of the Sequoia community, too. It’s going to mean a big boost in performance for FastAPI and the other tools, plus better support for edge cases. I’m also working on more documentation of FastAPI’s internal code—I have lots of tutorials, but there isn’t a dictionary-like code API reference, which is one of the things people request the most. And I’m making improvements to FastAPI itself, and to Typer, SQLModel, Asyncer, and others, which will simplify building the whole stack in FastAPI applications.</p>



<p>I’m also looking forward to continuing all the relationships I’ve built, including with you two! I was always scared of VCs. The idea of raising capital and building a company wasn’t super intuitive to me. But this has been a mindset shift—seeing that it can actually be good. We’re friends! It feels like, “Okay, this really can work.”</p>



 



<p>Consideration for the Sequoia Open Source Fellowship is by invitation only; we aim to support established creators and enable them to chart the paths of their projects as they continue to grow.

Simultaneously, it no longer executes transactions like a conventional blockchain, instead proving the correctness of transactions that have already been computed.</p><p>In other words, Aztec is a zero-knowledge execution environment, but it’s not a&nbsp;zkEVM.</p><p>Why? Isn’t zkEVM the end-game?</p><p>In Aztec Labs’ search for private smart contract capability, we came to an early conclusion: privacy isn’t EVM compatible.</p><p>The beauty of rollups goes beyond mimicking Ethereum but extending its utility. Aztec is an opportunity to enshrine privacy at the base layer with the benefit of Ethereum’s security guarantees.</p><p>At the time of its invention, Ethereum traded privacy for public consensus. Trustless, private execution enabled by advanced zero knowledge cryptography had yet to be invented. After all, it wasn’t until 2018 that Zac Williamson and Ariel Gabizon published Plonk, the first zkSNARK that was practical for widespread use in blockchain applications.</p><p>But while public account-based blockchain models like Ethereum can’t support native privacy, UTXO-based privacy solutions can’t support the robust ecosystem of applications and tools that have been created for public smart contract platforms.</p><blockquote>That’s why Aztec is&nbsp;both.</blockquote><p>Aztec combines public and private execution into a single zkRollup, providing seamless composability across encrypted and unencrypted transactions. If Ethereum’s innovation was allowing read and write to public state, Aztec’s is the ability to read and write to both public and private&nbsp;state.</p><p>The combination of public and private into a single hybrid roll-up enables confidentiality and auditability:</p>  Private voting for public&nbsp;DAOs  Private sessions of public&nbsp;games  Private trades on public&nbsp;AMM’s  <p>Aztec goes beyond unauditable private transactions, enabling smart contracts that allow for flexible compliance and view permissions.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>Aztec takes the prior work achieved with our Connect architecture and massively extends its scope and functionality.</p><p>Connect leveraged an encrypted UTXO architecture in which value notes represented money.</p><p>In Aztec, we’ve carried on with the same design with one key difference: UTXOs can represent not only “the value of a token”, but any data you&nbsp;like.</p><p>UTXO’s now store entire smart contracts.</p><p>Connect supported just 3 custom-built circuits. Aztec can support arbitrary smart contract logic over both public and private state. That means developers can access the full set of Ethereum use-cases, plus entirely new encryption-enabled applications.</p><p>Where Connect was designed for and limited to DeFi, Aztec is limited only by your imagination.</p> Public-private composability <p>Aztec’s public and private state environments are fully composable–meaning any function can call any other function.</p><p>This leads to completely new blockchain paradigms like private-to-private function calls: smart contracts whose logic is invisible to blockchain observers can call other contracts with invisible logic.</p><p>Aztec is building a true privacy ecosystem–a network of smart contracts that can draw from and write to whichever ledger is most convenient:</p>  a visible, public one to support primitives requiring transparency like AMMs and lending protocols  an invisible private one enabling the creation of private decentralized governance, finance, identity, and&nbsp;gaming.   View permissions and compliance <p>Aztec maintains the same segregation between viewing and spending keys as Connect, while extending viewing key permissions to each contract for fine-grained control on data&nbsp;access.</p><p>Because Aztec allows for permissioning on a contract-by-contract basis, compliance can be implemented flexibly with new blockchain primitives: decentralized identity, third-party verification, and view key&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>Applications no longer have to think about all-or-nothing approaches: Aztec supports the full spectrum of programmably private permissions.</p> Noir: Write Code, not&nbsp;Circuits <p>In order to enable private smart contract computation, Aztec Labs is contributing to core development of Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge.</p><p>Noir is an open-source, generalized zero knowledge circuit writing language compatible with any proving back-end and verifiable on any blockchain with customizable smart contract verifiers.</p><p>Where lower-level zk programming languages like Circom require knowledge of cryptographic concepts, Noir lets you write code, not circuits.</p><p>Zero-knowledge programs can have familiar syntax and abstracted cryptographic safety. An open-source library of crypto primitives means you can rely on a cache of audited crypto code and a community of cryptographers and open-source contributors.</p><p>Noir’s vision is to be the LLVM for zkSNARKs. Just as programming languages compile to an intermediate representation rather than machine language, Noir compiles to an abstract circuit intermediate representation (ACIR), which can then compile to any cryptographic backend.</p><p>Proofs can then be verified on any chain with a Solidity verifier.</p><blockquote>That means devs from Solana to Cosmos can integrate ZK proofs with&nbsp;Noir.</blockquote><p>In addition to its use as a generalizable zk programming language, Noir also serves as the smart contract language for Aztec: it retains traditional smart contract semantics, replete with state variables, functions, and cross-contract composability (even across the public-private barrier!).</p> Scalability <p>Our belief has always been that the largest barrier to blockchain adoption isn’t blockspace–it’s utility. Thankfully, zkSNARKs unlock both flexible encryption and scalability for&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>The recursion enabled by Aztec’s kernel circuits is so powerful that we have achieved a massive scalability improvement over Connect. Aztec will target 100+ TPS and single-digit cent transactions by mainnet launch, approximately 5x more throughput than Ethereum and 50-100x more than&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>We expect Aztec’s primary cost input–posting call data to Layer 1–to drop significantly via the use of blob transactions facilitated by EIP-4844.</p><p>Our long-term roadmap includes custom data availability, state sharding, FHE-enabled state syncing, hardware acceleration, and parallelized execution — all of which will allow us to access another order of magnitude of&nbsp;scale.</p> Next-level Privacy&nbsp;UX <p>Outside of core infrastructure, privacy UX has been a major bottleneck to the adoption of blockchain encryption tools.</p><p>We see the problem as&nbsp;3-fold:</p>  It’s hard to reason about&nbsp;privacy  Inflexible view permissions make compliance difficult or impossible  The wallet experience is confusing and non-standard  <p>Aztec tackles all three issues&nbsp;head-on.</p> Privacy guarantees <p>Our goal with Aztec was to have significantly stronger privacy guarantees than Connect, while making them easier to reason about. Simultaneously, Aztec improves generalizability and reduces cost–meaning better privacy comes with no trade-offs.</p><p>The simple&nbsp;tl;dr?</p><p>Private transactions are private. Full&nbsp;stop.</p><p>With previous-generation privacy solutions, users were concerned with privacy sets. In Aztec, private transaction execution is fully private–not only is the transaction private but the contract being executed is also private. That means private token transfers, private loans, private order book exchanges, and private game state are all totally inscrutable to blockchain observers.</p><p>There is simply no way to leak information other than the raw number of private state updates triggered, nor is it possible to interrogate the origin or nature of those state updates. The only way an observer gains information about the nature of the transaction is if there is a call to a public function.</p><p>Public execution is default anonymous–observers can’t tell who invoked the transaction but can see the results of the transaction publicly.</p><p>While public transactions are still reliant on privacy sets for their guarantees, the composability of Noir contracts means privacy sets are shared across the entire&nbsp;network.</p><p>A stablecoin like Dai will have a privacy set encompassing payments, DeFi, and usage as an in-game currency.</p> Wallet Experience and Account Abstraction <p>To make Aztec accounts as compatible as possible with existing wallets, user spending keys will utilize the same spending keys as Ethereum&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>In addition, native account abstraction will allow users to deploy custom Noir contracts to their account addresses instead of utilizing existing ECDSA signature flows. Aztec account abstraction facilitated by Noir circuits will&nbsp;support:</p>  Smart contract&nbsp;wallets  M of N multisigs  Schnorr Signatures  ECDSA over the 25519 curve (the same signature scheme as Apple’s&nbsp;TouchID)  Social recovery  <p>The future of blockchains is in programmable wallets, not manually signing transactions and granting permissions. Smart contract wallets will be a core feature of Aztec’s architecture, enabling future-proof blockchain UX.</p> Build <p>Are you an independent or protocol dev wondering whether Aztec is right for&nbsp;you?</p><p>Aztec is purely additive to Ethereum. Because it supports both public and private smart contracts, anything that can be built on Ethereum can be built on&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>And while Aztec’s public transactions look broadly similar to Ethereum (since they’re both public state machines), developers will be granted new opportunities unlocked by private&nbsp;compute:</p>  Hiding confidential information  Anonymity  Hiding the terms and conditions of confidential contracts  Hiding which contract has even been&nbsp;executed  Programming in zero-knowledge  <p>Because Aztec’s core execution engine verifies rather than executes compute, private transactions can have arbitrary runtime. Unlike Ethereum, which has a block resource limit of 30 million gas, there is no hard limit to the compute intensity for an Aztec&nbsp;block.</p><p>After all, users run programs and generate proofs on their own devices. That means programs can have arbitrary runtime and still be proved&nbsp;locally.</p><p>Aztec therefore allows for the concept of private micro-rollups: programs that are executed and proven locally and sent onward for verification.</p><blockquote>Entire rollup instances and applications can be run like Layer 3’s on&nbsp;Aztec.</blockquote><p>We’re excited for the new paradigms that are possible when users are empowered to run and prove programs on their own&nbsp;devices.</p> Open Vision, Open&nbsp;Source <p>Aztec’s vision is wildly ambitious. As a result, we are opening Aztec’s codebase, protocol design, and documentation to the broader zk and blockchain communities to&nbsp;discuss.</p><p>We are starting by building in the open at discourse.aztec.network–our new home for protocol-level discussion and debate, and the future home of Aztec’s decentralized governance.</p><blockquote>Join the conversation about Aztec’s specification and roadmap at <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network">discourse.aztec.network</a></blockquote><p>In the spirit of radical openness, Aztec is being built under the open-source and permissive Apache 2.0 License, and Aztec’s repos are updated on a regular basis.

Sequencers then send blocks to a federated network of&nbsp;provers.</p><p>Provers then break up the 16,348 individual transactions that comprise an Aztec block into trees of proofs 14 deep. They then “split up” the work of proving individual transactions, working together to construct the full Merkle tree that makes up a finalized Aztec&nbsp;block.</p><p>Finally, Aztec nodes provide chain data, syncing chain state, answering RPC requests, and propagating transactions.</p><p>Aztec is designed with decentralization and the sustainability of all stakeholders in mind–not just users and applications, but node providers, sequencers, and provers. All components of the stack will use commodity hardware with requirements as low or lower than their Ethereum equivalents.

<p>Aztec’s response to HMT’s consultation for cryptoasset regulation</p> Answering HM Treasury’s Call <p>In February of this year, His Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) published a consultation and call for evidence titled “future financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets”.</p><p>The consultation follows an April 2022 call for a new unified regulatory framework for cryptoassets in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>The primary view expressed by the UK government is that “cryptoassets and the activities underpinning their use should follow the standards expected of other similar financial services activities.”</p> DeFi ≠&nbsp;CeFi <p>We support the need for clear, affirmative, and proportionate regulation as a step toward jurisdictional clarity, and believe the UK’s stance that the prime objective should be on growth and innovation is the correct&nbsp;one.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are two nuanced distinctions within crypto that must be&nbsp;drawn:</p>  Firstly, between centralized or intermediated financial entities and peer-to-peer decentralized financial protocols;  And secondly, between credibly neutral protocols and consumer-facing applications  <p>The government’s core design principle equating “same risk, same outcome” threatens to throw centralized financial entities (CeFi), decentralized financial protocols (DeFi), and decentralized applications (dApps) into the same regulatory bucket.</p> Our Response <p>It’s our belief that the unique non-intermediated nature of DeFi is not only consumer protective but non-analogous to existing forms of financial services. Therefore, applying regulation derived from that applying to traditional financial services may both harm consumers and hinder industry innovation.</p><p>Consumers may be at risk of being misled into believing CeFi custodians are trustless, when in fact some of the biggest failures in the entire crypto-asset industry were in fact due to malfeasance on the part of CeFi entities and custodians.</p><p>In reality, there are vast differences in custody, trust, and permissioning between centralized financial services (CeFi) and decentralized protocols (DeFi), and as a result we recommend that HMT create a bespoke and progressive regulatory regime that is suited to DeFi’s unique benefit to the consumer.</p><p>We seek to clarify some of these nuances in our response to HMT’s consultation, with a specific focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), while underscoring the need for encryption to protect user privacy and security.</p><p>Read our full response&nbsp;here:</p><p>And read HMT’s full consultation here:</p> Join the Conversation <p>Aztec is building at the cutting edge of blockchain privacy and encryption.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today, we’re announcing new features to support the development, adoption, and use of the decentralized Web (dWeb) through Brave, the privacy-first browser used by over 57 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>Brave and Protocol Labs first began collaborating in January 2021, when <a>Brave introduced support for IPFS</a> on desktop versions of the browser, unlocking unique new ways to experience the Web for everyday users. Later that same year, <a>Brave Wallet integrated the Filecoin network</a>, which aims to facilitate how people store, access, and distribute data on the dWeb. Now, we’re unveiling new ways to participate and contribute to the growing dWeb movement with Brave.</p>

 Back up NFTs automatically with IPFS in Brave Wallet 
<p>Brave desktop v1.51 introduces automatic NFT pinning, which backs up the metadata of supported NFTs to the <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)</a>. “Pinning” means to tell IPFS to indefinitely store a file in a specific location so that it’s always available for retrieval. By pinning a file to multiple locations, you effectively spread the risk of data loss over multiple different points, thus improving its long term resiliency.</p>
<p>While many people believe that NFT metadata (such as images and descriptions) is stored entirely on blockchains, that’s generally not true. Instead, most collections store their metadata on IPFS or other decentralized storage solutions. Some even host NFT metadata on Web 2.0 servers, which carry risks of data loss and censorship.</p>
<p>“Brave now enables you to pin NFTs to your local IPFS node in just a few clicks, ensuring their continuous availability within the IPFS network,” said Brian Bondy, co-founder and CTO at Brave.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Even with no knowledge of IPFS, Brave Wallet users can avoid the permanent loss of NFT metadata and gain peace of mind by pinning their NFTs locally in the browser. This ensures users have a copy of the assets and metadata for their NFTs, and can make them available to the broader network. Enabling IPFS in Brave is simple and can be done in a matter of minutes. Once set up, eligible NFTs will automatically be pinned. It’s important to note that this doesn’t mean pinned NFTs gain additional protection from hacking or theft, but rather that the data associated with them is kept online through multiple distributed copies.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Pinning will first be available for Ethereum-based ERC-721 tokens, with plans to expand to more chains and tokenization standards in the future. You can even pin NFTs owned by other wallet addresses, including NFTs you own on a hardware wallet that isn’t connected to Brave Wallet. To do so, simply input the token details manually and Brave Wallet will both display and back up the NFT. This means you can support the health and safety of NFT collections you enjoy, even if you don’t own them.&nbsp;</p>

 Build on Filecoin EVM with Brave Wallet 
<p>Brave has also simplified access to the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) with the addition of Filecoin EVM (FEVM) in Brave Wallet. As a refresher:</p>
 
 
<p>FVM is a runtime that brings smart contracts to Filecoin.</p>
 
 
<p>FEVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) runtime that allows Ethereum and Solidity developers to run their contracts on the FVM with little to no modifications.</p>
 
 
<p>FEVM is making it easier than ever to experience Filecoin’s potential, supercharged by existing (and familiar) Ethereum tooling and infrastructure. Protocol Labs, the team behind Filecoin, expects to see major development in cross-chain contract calls to execute storage processes from other blockchains. They also expect exciting experimentation at the intersections of decentralized finance, social, gaming, and more.</p>
<p>“Putting the compute layer for the largest open storage network in history directly in the browser with Brave wallet unlocks a whole new class of applications on the web which put control directly in end-users hands” said Dietrich Ayala, Browsers &amp; Platforms Lead at Protocol Labs.</p>

      Agents on the Brain         
	By Lauren Reeder, Cornelius Menke, and Stephanie Zhan	 



Published May 1, 2023
        Autonomous agents’ traction is undeniable. On the other hand, it’s unclear how useful these AI applications are today for real tasks. We unpack their potential, and help separate the hype from reality.      



 
<p>The last nine months produced a few discrete waves of AI innovation, each of which expanded our notions of the possible. Last summer came Stable Diffusion and the image generation moment. Then in November, ChatGPT turned our collective attention to LLMs, which has only grown with the launch of GPT-4 and many others. LangChain popularized agents and now we’re seeing the next step on that journey emerge with autonomous agents. AutoGPT surpassed 100k Github stars (more than Go, Kubernetes or Node.js) on April 21, less than a month after launch. BabyAGI has 12k stars and has inspired a <a href="https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi/blob/main/docs/inspired-projects.md">long list of projects</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Autonomous agents can be thought of as language model-powered bots that can break down complex problems and iteratively solve them, taking action on users’ behalf. We can use a simple example to illustrate what is possible with just an LLM, an agent, and with autonomous agents. With just an LLM, we can look up the best restaurants in a given city. With an agent, we can tell it to look up the highest rated restaurant with a table available and book the table for two. With an autonomous agent, we can ask it to find the best restaurant that fits into my schedule and my preferences then book it for me and my best friend. Autonomous agents can do this by breaking down a task into subtasks and using memory between each step to guide the agent’s actions.</p>



<p>Depending on whom you ask, autonomous agents will either prove to be a lasting paradigm shift—with a glimmer of what might be ahead with AGI—or they may just be another moment among many iterative approaches.</p>



<p>It’s easy to see why autonomous agents have captured our collective imaginations. They make it easy to dream of what is possible with small, lightweight apps on top of LLMs. We’ve experimented with spinning up agents ourselves—exploring everything from email digests (that go from scraping Google trends to synthesis and summary) to complex travel itinerary planning and more.</p>



<p>As compelling as these examples may be, autonomous agents leave a lot to be desired in their current state. There is significant room to improve performance, user control and output quality. It is still early days and agents will have to overcome at least three significant hurdles to achieve large scale adoption:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Logical reasoning != good execution: In principle GPT-4 is capable of chain-of-thought reasoning and decomposing tasks into multi-step processes. But in practice, the agent often struggles with executing on their own sub-tasks. They struggle to know when to “take a step back,” leading to getting stuck doing the same task in a loop, or may hallucinate a step and get stuck because there is little external feedback. 



 Compute costs: The architecture of these applications rely on recursive loops, which can lead to many repetitive calls of your LLM. The cost is relatively low per call today with tools like OpenAI’s APIs (but may run into API limits!), but with in-house models, the cost equation may be quite different.&nbsp; 



 Learning: Because the autonomous agents are spun up and not subsequently reused, they do not learn from the prompts or from prior attempts, and don’t learn much from their mistakes. Services that help agents persist are on the horizon, though, which should make managing them easier. 
 



<p>If we can solve some of these challenges, we can imagine a future of “agent to agent” interactions. Specialized agents could be created for common tasks. Instead of spinning up a new agent for every task, you might “outsource” some of the steps and rely on pre-trained agents to fulfill tasks that you pay for per output, and incorporate those outputs as input into your next steps. In other words, your AI could hire or outsource to another AI. “Core” tasks could be covered by different agents, and a new layer of tooling could emerge as the “glue” stitching the entire process together.</p>



<p>What would it take to get there? Current implementations rely on GPT-4 APIs utilized by short-lived agents with limited context windows. To reach their full potential, the next generation will need to be:</p>



 
 Compute aware: minimizing resource usage as an objective function 



 Data aware: finding and connecting to the right model or data source for the task 



 Agent aware: finding, reusing and communicating with ecosystems of agents 



 Safety aware: checking outputs and sandboxing code is the first step, plus more serious controls will be needed to prevent abuse 



 User aware: learning from user behavior and preferences to optimize performance 
 



<p>We think autonomous agents could become an interesting part of the AI application landscape, and the technology is just starting to get good. What will the evolution of agents look like? <a href="mailto:reeder@sequoiacap.com">Tell us</a> what you’re building!</p>

<p>The end of 2022 and beginning of 2023 were marked by centralised institutions failing: from CEXes to CeFi itself, contagion spread quickly in over-leveraged and opaque entities. Amidst this chaos, (crypto)people turned their hopes, once again, to DeFi. However, in lack of traditional enforcing mechanisms, not even battle-tested decentralised lending protocols could find a solution to provide under-collateralised loans, aka credit. Mars Protocol, with its unique hub &amp; outposts architecture, aims to answer this need in the Cosmos ecosystem, by deploying on Osmosis and tapping into its deep liquidity. From manual leverage to credit and yield farming, Mars will feature a wide suite of DeFi products.</p><p>We were joined by Jose Macedo, founder of Delphi Labs, to discuss the history of Delphi Digital, their learnings from incubating projects and the vision behind Mars’ ‘Red Bank’ DeFi products.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jose’s background  Delphi Digital’s history  Incubating projects on Solana and Terra  Learning from Terra  The vision behind Mars Protocol  Mars’ DeFi suite  Different risk parameters and collaterals  Mars’ module architecture (outposts) in the Cosmos ecosystem  How Mars Protocol differs from Osmosis  Mars Protocol roadmap &amp; Mars v.2  Ecosystem accelerator  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ZeMariaMacedo">Jose Macedo on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/delphi_labs">Delphi Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital">Delphi Digital on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/mars_protocol">Mars Protocol on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/astroport_fi">Astroport on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/osmosiszone">Osmosis on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Brian Fabian Crain &amp; Felix Lutsch.

 Levelling up Nym mix nodes across the&nbsp;world <p>Counting 500+ community-operated mix nodes, the Nym mixnet is the largest decentralized mixnet in the world today. The network is maturing: from Nodes.Guru to No Trust Verify, Hermes Stakepool and many others, we are seeing professional mix node operators providing outstanding quality of service. An emerging, broad and active community of stakers pledge their trust in these nodes by delegating NYM tokens to them, making them more likely to mix traffic. This ensures privacy, security, honest behaviour and high quality of service across the entire&nbsp;network.</p><blockquote>See the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym mixnet&nbsp;explorer</a></blockquote><p>It sounds simple: if you want to contribute to the Nym privacy infrastructure and earn mix mining rewards for your efforts, just run a good mix node, get recognized by the community and attract delegations. But what makes a good mix node? And how can one gain recognition in the Nym community and earn the trust of delegators?</p> Welcome to the Nym Delegations Program! <p>The primary motivation for the delegations program is to encourage further decentralisation of the Nym mixnet in terms&nbsp;of</p>  geographical locations  VPS providers  and number of operators.  <p>It is also worth noting that mix node operators in low-income countries often have a proportionally higher cost of setting up infrastructure. This can make running a node prohibitively expensive, especially in the early stages before they get to sufficient stake to start being part of the active set and earning rewards. The Nym Delegations Program aims to bridge this&nbsp;gap.</p><p>If you operate a mix node in an underrepresented part of the world, you can apply for temporary delegations from the Nym treasury to ensure your node gets into the active set more often so you begin earning rewards for providing privacy. Importantly, via mentorship from Nym community OGs, the program also aims to support dedicated node operators like you with best practices and know-how to run outstanding mix nodes and attract community delegations.</p> Key info   How much: 200K NYM tokens for 25 eligible mix&nbsp;nodes  Until when: Delegations apply until node reaches 70% saturation  Deadline to apply: Monday 8th of May&nbsp;2023  <p>**EDIT: due to popular demand, the deadline for submissions is extended by a week to Monday, the 15th of&nbsp;May.**</p> Can I&nbsp;apply? <p>There are five criteria you node has to meet to be eligible for delegations:</p>  You are running a reliable mix node with good quality of&nbsp;service  Your node has below 20% saturation  You do not have other highly saturated mix&nbsp;nodes  Your node is in an underrepresented part of the&nbsp;world  Your node is not running at a major VPS provider such as Hetzner, Google Cloud, Azure, or AWS, or an unreliable one such as&nbsp;Contabo.  <p>Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that becoming a successful mix node operator is an involved process, far beyond just setting up and operating a node. When it comes to the Nym mixnet, community and trust is the name of the game — if you are looking to set-and-forget, this program is not for&nbsp;you.</p><p>On the other hand, if you are eager to contribute to the most robust privacy infrastructure the world has ever seen and to the community operating and securing it, you will enjoy mentorship in doing so from top Nym contributors as part of the delegations program!</p> What do I&nbsp;get?   If selected, the Nym treasury will delegate 200K NYM tokens to your mix node. This will ensure your node gets to mix traffic fairly often, earning you mix mining rewards in the process. The treasury delegation will remain on your node until it reaches 70% saturation organically, through community delegations.  You will receive a special role on the Nym Discord server. You will also get access to a private channel on Element, where you can hang out and work with other delegations program participants, and receive ongoing support and mentorship from distinguished Nym community OGs and node operators.  You will learn the ins and outs of operating a Nym mix node to the highest standards: hardware requirements, monitoring, maintenance, and&nbsp;more.  You will learn about the Nym network, community and ecosystem and how you can establish yourself as a trusted, serious player via contributions.  If you decide to build something or contribute in some way, you can come on the Nym community call as a guest to introduce yourself and your project (this will be decided on an individual basis).   How do I&nbsp;apply? <p>If your node meets the criteria above, simply fill in <a href="https://nymtech.typeform.com/delegations">this</a> application form before Monday, the 8th of&nbsp;May.</p><p>**EDIT: due to popular demand, the deadline for submissions is extended by a week to Monday, the 15th of&nbsp;May.**</p><p>You will need to&nbsp;include:</p>  Mix node&nbsp;ID  Explorer link to your&nbsp;node  Location  Your VPS/server set&nbsp;up  Email/telegram  <p>Note: if selected, you will then be invited to a video interview to meet the team and verify the details of your operations.</p> What happens after the&nbsp;program? <p>This is just the beginning for the Nym Delegations Program. If successful, in future iterations, the scope and scale of the program will be extended. When you no longer need treasury delegations, the community will be counting on you and your new-found knowledge and skills to reach and empower even more people around the world, and to decentralise the Nym mixnet&nbsp;further!</p> Resources   <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/">Download Nym wallet</a> (to bond and delegate to&nbsp;nodes)  <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Browse mixnet explorer</a> (to browse existing mixnodes)  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">Learn about mix&nbsp;mining</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-economics-quarterly-parameter-update-e85b6c929b37">Nym token economics</a>  <p>All program participants must complete KYC; void where prohibited including USA — more information <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/community-resources/rewards-faq.html">here</a>.</p> Languages   <a href="https://medium.com/@nymportugues/apresentando-o-programa-de-delega%C3%A7%C3%B5es-de-nym-b4bcfe9da2a2">Portuguese</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/programa-de-delegaciones-de-nym-fortaleciendo-los-mixnodes-en-todo-el-mundo-bf60a9edded8">Spanish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nym-delegasyon-program%C4%B1-duyurusu-668ec8ef2ae0">Turkish</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%B5%D0%BC-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D1%83-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F-nym-7946c689bb13">Russian</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-delegations-program-c5ecf320ed12">Introducing the Nym Delegations Program</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Release <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.5.0">5.5.0</a> introduces a number of bug fixes and changes to the underlying libraries that support Zcash. Much of this work lays the foundation for the fund availability features coming with the next release. Those features will provide the ability to spend funds before a wallet is fully synchronized. In addition, this release introduces a proportional fee mechanism that may help address future periods of high transaction load on the blockchain. Mobile wallet users sending regular single-recipient transactions will not be affected by this change.</p>



<p>The Zcash protocol continues to be our primary focus at ECC, as we work to exit “Emergency Mode” and deliver a solid and reliable user experience.<br></p>



<p>Summary of Changes</p>



 
 Proportional fee mechanism for the <code>zcashd</code> bundled wallet and mining partners; 



 Foundation work for fund availability/fast balance readiness; 



 Refactor of common code shared in <code>zcashd</code> wallet for <code>z_sendmany</code>, <code>z_shieldcoinbase</code> and <code>z_mergetoaddress</code>; 



 A bugfix enables Orchard transactions to be created and verified on 32-bit platforms. 
 



<p>All node operators, which includes our mining and other ecosystem partners, should upgrade to this latest version as soon as practical.</p>



<p>Additional RPC changes and feature deprecations have been included in this release. For technical details on these changes, including potential impacts of the proportional fee mechanism for node operators, please read the full release notes available at <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/tree/v5.5.0/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.5.0.md">https://github.com/zcash/zcash/tree/v5.5.0/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.5.0.md</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, we added terminal-based progress bars to Zebra. These experimental progress bars show Zebra’s status, including peers, blocks, and transactions.</p>
<p>To display these progress bars, Zebra uses <a href="https://github.com/kdr-aus/how-u-doin#how-u-doin">how-u-doin</a>, a recently published Rust crate for progress bar coordination. how-u-doin uses the <a href="https://docs.rs/indicatif/latest/indicatif/">indicatif</a> terminal display library to actually create the progress bars. We also started tracking some new metrics in Zebra, like the last chain fork height.</p>
<p></p>

			 Fully Synced View 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>When Zebra has synced to the tip, the progress bars show:</p>
 
 how many peers Zebra is connected to 
 how far its has synced the chain 
 the recent chain forks it is tracking 
 how many transactions are in the mempool 
 						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
																														 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>This is an alternative to Zebra’s logs, which show the chain sync progress every minute and log mempool transactions as they arrive.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Initial Sync View 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>When Zebra is doing its initial sync, it shows the number of queued and verified checkpoint blocks. It doesn’t show the mempool because it doesn’t activate until it reaches the chain tip.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
																														 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Try it out for yourself 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>If you want to try Zebra’s progress bars for yourself, compile <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra">a recent checkout of the Zebra git repository</a> with the progress-bar feature:</p>
 git clone https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra.git<br>cd zebra<br>git checkout main<br>cargo run --features progress-bar --bin zebrad<br> 
<p>This will automatically redirect Zebra’s logs to the <a href="https://doc.zebra.zfnd.org/zebrad/components/tracing/struct.Config.html#structfield.log_file">standard log file path</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll need to <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra#building-zebra">install Zebra’s dependencies and build Zebra yourself</a> because this feature hasn’t made it into a release yet. Until we’re happy with the feature, it will be off by default in release builds.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 User feedback 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>These progress bars are just an experiment for now. If they are popular with users, we can make them the default Zebra interface. They’ll look like zcashd’s sync progress bar, but with a bit more detail.</p>
<p>We’d also like to improve the display by:</p>
 
 only showing times and byte rates for verified checkpoints and blocks 
 removing less useful progress bars, or putting them behind an “expert user” config

<p>Future growth and wider adoption of blockchain technology largely hinge on fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. More specifically, the success of web3 depends on these factors. While the development and implementation of sidechains are still relatively new, the technology offers promising results.</p>



<p>Sidechains can become effective ‘testing grounds’ for new applications, as it were. If a dApp or smart contract is found to cause damage for example, the harm is contained to the sidechain, as the main chain remains secure, preventing even greater damage.</p>



<p>But perhaps the biggest positive of sidechains is the sheer opportunity to diversify, create, and provide specific solutions to specific use cases. This alone incentivises the investment of time and resources into exploring this exciting possibility.</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/blockchain-consultancy/">Zaisan</a> can become your guide to explore sidechains and any other aspect of blockchain technology.</p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 Sidechains enable the movement of tokens or other digital assets between the main chain and the sidechain through 2-way peg mechanisms called bridges 



 A sidechain can have its own consensus protocol, token, and security, independent of those same features on the main chain 



 Sidechains can run dApps and take some of the computational workloads off the main (‘parent’) chain 



 Sidechains offer the benefits of scalability, interoperability, and versatility 
 



 The evolution of blockchain protocols 



<p>Blockchain technology was little known outside academic circles before 2008. Scott Stornetta and Stuart Haber first proposed the theory behind what we know today as a decentralised ledger – a blockchain – in the early 1990s. They are credited with inventing a network to store timestamped, unalterable digital records.</p>



<p>Stornetta and Haber were aware that altering digital documents without anyone realising the changes was all too easy. This meant that the integrity and trustworthiness of the data were questionable. To address this problem, they came up with a hashing function used to register the documents, group them into blocks, and link them digitally using the hash values. For all intents and purposes, a blockchain.</p>



<p>But this was back in 1991, a full 17 years before the very word, blockchain, gained notoriety outside niche circles following the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has evolved at pace since. Several consensus protocols have emerged. The Bitcoin network used Proof of Work (PoW). Ethereum, Cardano, and others use the Proof-of-Stake model. Other chains use Delegated Proof of Stake. There are other, less-known protocols. Thus, the point is that blockchain, or decentralised ledger, has evolved and diversified ever since that seminal moment in 2008.</p>



 Challenges 



<p>Decentralised ledgers, while versatile, do face some challenges, often referred to as the blockchain trilemma, a term coined by Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin. The trilemma states that three pillars support a perfect blockchain: security, decentralisation, and scalability. Therefore, successful implementation is only possible for two out of these three elements. Adding a third would always be detrimental to the other two in one way or another.</p>



<p>Discussing the trilemma is beyond the scope of this piece, but awareness of it is important as background information, and to understand why sidechains are a key component in solving it.</p>



 Defining layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain 



<p>In the context of blockchain architecture, people often mention the terms ‘layer 1’ and ‘layer 2’. These essential concepts serve a dual purpose: they explain how a blockchain network is constructed and provide a simple representation of what a blockchain network entails. Let’s explore these concepts a bit deeper. </p>



 Layer 1 



<p>The best way to represent layer 1 is by imagining a multiple-tiered wedding cake, at the bottom of which is a stand. This stand is the layer that supports the rest of the cake. In other words, layer 1 acts as the stand for the cake, providing support for the infrastructure built on top of it.</p>



<p>But there is a problem. The stand is only of a certain size, and cannot be made any bigger. It can only hold a certain amount of cake slices. How to solve this problem?</p>



 Layer 2 



<p>How about adding a second layer (layer 2) on top of the base layer? With a second layer, we have more cake, without having to make the base (layer 1) any bigger. We have scaled the cake, haven’t we? And that second layer is completely independent of the base. It can have a different frosting, different flavour, different decoration, etc.</p>



<p>If we extend this analogy, we can draw a comparison to how a blockchain is organised. The underlying blockchain (the main chain) is layer 1, and the sidechain is layer 2, built on top of the first layer. And this second layer can have its own protocol, consensus mechanism, token, etc., just like the second layer of the cake can be decorated in a completely different fashion from the base.</p>



 Sidechains: a solution to the scalability trilemma 



<p>Remember the <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/assets/images/scalability-trilemma-b28096dc15beb24ad77e960c376bef96.jpg">trilemma</a> we mentioned earlier, and how blockchain scalability is one of its vertices? Sidechains are layer 2 solutions (ie, solutions built on top of layer 1) that address this challenge by enabling the main chain to offload some of its computational capacity. By doing this, the main chain achieves higher throughput.</p>



<p>Sidechains are designed for the specific purpose of scaling the layer 1 chain without compromising its security or stability. By connecting to the main chain through two-way pegs, also known as bridges, assets can be securely transferred back and forth.</p>



Source: <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/assets/images/scalability-trilemma-b28096dc15beb24ad77e960c376bef96.jpg">horizon.io</a>



 Asset transfer mechanism 



<p>While the two-way pegs (think of these as traffic tunnels with one lane going each way) enable the transfer of assets between the main chain and the sidechain, the assets aren’t actually transferred. Instead, the requested assets become ‘locked’ on the sender chain, and a smart contract executes to realise the transaction, assuming that all conditions are met. When the transaction is validated, the assets are unlocked and released on the other end and the smart contract informs the main chain about this event. Bridges, depending on their design and functionality, might also enable swapping one token type for another. For example, it may enable swapping one token type for another.</p>



 Benefits of a sidechain 



<p>The use of sidechains in a blockchain system confers three key advantages: scalability, interoperability, and versatility.</p>



 Scalability 



<p>The addition of sidechains enables faster and cheaper transactions on the main chain.</p>



 Interoperability 



<p>Sidechains allow different blockchains to communicate, interact, and exchange data with each other via smart contracts. Besides, developers can use sidechains to quickly deploy dApps on different blockchains, to test out which one works best. This is usually referred to as cross-chain interoperability.</p>



 Versatility 



<p>Sidechains greatly diversify and augment the main chain’s use cases. Furthermore, developers can implement sidechains to meet the specific needs of industries, purposes, or projects, for example.</p>

<p>Brave Search also announces it will launch its own search API to power other search applications in the near future</p>

 Summary 
<p>Every Web search result seen in Brave Search is now served by our own index. We’ve removed all search API calls to Bing, which previously represented about 7% of query results.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>Since its launch, privacy-preserving Brave Search has been the only global, independent alternative to serve results almost exclusively from its own index. That meant far less reliance on the existing Big Tech options (Bing and Google) than the supposed alternatives—like DuckDuckGo—that are actually powered by these Big Tech APIs.</p>
<p>When Brave Search launched in June 2021, about 13% of the queries required the help of third parties to achieve the desired level of quality across various types of queries. Total independence, however, was a primary goal of Brave, and in less than a year <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/independence">the Brave Search global independence score</a> rose from 87% to 93%.</p>
<p>We were able to achieve these improvements in a few ways:</p>
 
 
<p>The rapid adoption of Brave Search (it’s now averaging about 22 million queries per day) made it the fastest growing search engine since Bing.</p>
 
 
<p>Broad adoption of the Web Discovery Project (which allows users to anonymously contribute browsing data to grow the Brave Search index) meant results had the nuance and completeness needed to compete on both privacy and quality.</p>
 
 
<p>Together, these achievements allowed us to accelerate this milestone of 100% independence.</p>
<p>But there was also another consideration: uncertainty over the future of the Bing API, which grew after the Microsoft and OpenAI partnership. We feared for the continuity of the Bing service, which turned out to be a prescient concern, as Microsoft recently announced an unprecedented increase in its API pricing. This created undue pressure for search engines that rely partly or fully on the Bing Search API. The consequences of their reliance on Bing will play out in the following months when their long term contracts expire.</p>
<p>Thankfully (and unlike other search alternatives), Brave had both an independent index, and a built-in delivery mechanism (the Brave browser) to continue improving the Brave Search index.</p>

 What this means for Brave Search and users 
<p>By default, Brave Search users will now receive 100% of results from the Brave Index, giving users fully independent results. As always, our results will preserve user privacy. And this independence does not come at the expense of quality: Over the past several months, the Search team has drastically improved Brave Search’s ability to answer nuanced, long-tail queries.</p>
<p>For the time being, Brave Search won’t serve image or video results from its own index, as we work to improve quality. We now include an option to redirect image and video searches to Bing or Google, rather than relying on a 3rd-party API. Rest assured that the Search team is working on improving image and video search capabilities. If you are conducting these searches within the Brave browser, the browser’s built-in tracking protection applies, even if you’re viewing results on Bing or Google.</p>
<p>For users who want it, <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/google-fallback">Google Fallback mixing</a> will continue to be an option. Users can continue to support the growth of the index and results quality by opting into the <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-">Web Discovery Project</a>, and <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/feedback">submitting feedback</a> in cases where we should improve. And users can use <a href="https://search.brave.com/goggles/discover">Goggles</a> to re-rank and filter results from the Brave Search index.</p>
<p>This removal of all Bing API calls may have an effect for certain queries, or for some regional or language-specific results, so we encourage users to submit feedback as often as possible. The more people who use Brave Search, the better it becomes, and the more we can advance our vision of a user-first Web.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>How to submit feedback on the search results page.</p>

 Announcing the Brave Search API 
<p>In continuing our mission to offer alternatives to Big Tech, Brave is planning to release the Brave Search API. Through it, developers and companies will be able to build search experiences that compete on quality with Big Tech. Those interested should stay tuned for more details, or contact us at <a>bizdev@brave.com</a>.</p>

 Summary: how can you support Brave Search 
 
 
<p>Tell everyone you know about Brave and Brave Search. The more people use Brave, the better the search index becomes, and the more we can drive privacy and security across the Web.</p>
 
 
<p>If you use the Brave browser, opt in to the <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-">Web Discovery Project</a> to help grow the Brave Search index.

 Nym is at Consensus this&nbsp;week <p>One of the world’s primary crypto conferences, <a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/">Consensus by Coindesk</a> is about to kick off in Austin, Texas. And in the midst of major regulatory crackdowns, the overarching theme this year is a return to first principles of Web3 and delivering real value to people. This has become a bit of a trend, with every bear market repeating a similar message: now is the time to remember why we are doing this in the first place and BUIDL. But the first principles of web3 are about more than idealism and ethics. They are pragmatic principles, arrived at after years of tireless work and experiences developing the earlier iterations of the internet.</p><p>Several founders of Nym found themselves in the Web3 movement after having worked on two generations of decentralised networks: Harry Halpin through his work with W3C and <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-computer-scientist-who-boosts-privacy-with-entropy-20221018/">with inventor of the world wide web, Tim Berners Lee</a>; Claudia Diaz through her work at <a href="https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~cdiaz/">KU Leuven</a> on the core privacy problems of the internet with world renowned cryptologist <a href="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/bart-preneel/">Bart Preneel</a>; Alexis Roussel through the Pirate Party; Dave Hrycyszyn and others in the core team via the under-documented history of federated activist media networks in the late 1990s and 2000s. These decentralised activist networks invented micro blogging, tweeting and self-publishing, which was then picked up by and centralised into the familiar corporate form of today: the social media of Web 2.0 platforms who monetized through surveillance.</p><p>What are the lessons learned from these experiences? Firstly, if you don’t solve the business model, you will end up back with centralised control and value extraction. Secondly, without a sustainable remuneration model, open source software will simply provide free R&amp;D to the big technology corporations. And third, that the <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html">cypherpunks</a> were right: the internet has become a world wide vehicle for mass surveillance and what is needed is strong encryption and mixnets to solve&nbsp;it.</p><p>With the advent of Bitcoin, the pieces were finally coming together to solve a fundamental problem of the internet: that the network traffic is entirely exposed. This is because the internet as we know it today was conceived and built in a trusted academic environment. It is notoriously hard to get high-quality, general purpose privacy infrastructure funded and to ensure that this funding doesn’t tempt a company to spy on its users. What had been missing was the final pieces to ensure sustainable, permissionless, decentralised privacy systems: tokenisation to incentivise contributions, reputation and ensure fair remuneration.</p><p>It is now time to deliver the privacy layer for the open internet to ensure basic freedoms in a trustless environment. The Nym mixnet is therefore from its very inception built, necessarily and pragmatically, on the first principles of Web3, with the primary mission of enabling digital privacy for all humanity.</p><p>The Nym mixnet delivers some of the worlds <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/vpns-tor-i2p-how-does-nym-compare-8576824617b8">strongest network layer privacy</a>, shielding IP addresses and traffic patterns for any blockchain, dApp, wallet or application. The mixnet&nbsp;is:</p>  DECENTRALISED — To enable privacy for everyone.The Nym mixnet is operated by a decentralised community of node operators and stakers. Nym is run by a growing ecosystem of users, developers and researcher partners aligned with the mission to make sure Nym software is running, remains usable and solves real problems.  PERMISSIONLESS — To ensure the availability of privacy. You do not need anyone’s permission to run Nym software. Anyone can make use of the libraries or spin up a Nym node and contribute to providing privacy by running the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.  TRUSTLESS — To ensure privacy by default. The Nym mixnet is trustless, meaning that no parts of the system nor its operators have access to information that might compromise the privacy of users. Nym software enacts a strict principle of data minimisation and has no back&nbsp;doors.  TOKENISED — To prevent operators from selling the customer. Where relevant, Nym software incorporates a token to ensure the economic sustainability of operators so that there is no incentive to ‘sell the customer.  OPEN SOURCE — To validate the quality and security of the software. All Nym software is open source so that it can be audited by anyone. This is essential for enabling open code contribution and peer-validation, ensuring that it is secure and of the highest&nbsp;quality.

<p>New Blog Post written by&nbsp;Shorn.</p> Why PIVX’s Optional Private Transactions are a Game-Changer in Cryptocurrency  Introduction to PIVX and its Optional Private Transactions <p>PIVX, or Private Instant Verified Transaction, is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was launched in 2016. PIVX is built on the Bitcoin codebase and uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. One of the key features that sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies are its optional private transactions, which allow users to choose whether to make their transactions public or&nbsp;private.</p><p>The PIVX team believes that privacy is a fundamental human right, and that privacy is essential for the long-term success of cryptocurrency. In a world where digital privacy is becoming increasingly important, PIVX provides a unique solution that allows users to control their own&nbsp;privacy.</p> The Importance of Privacy in Cryptocurrency <p>Privacy is one of the key characteristics of cryptocurrency that sets it apart from traditional financial systems. Cryptocurrency transactions are pseudonymous, which means that they are not tied to a real-world identity. This provides users with a degree of privacy that is not available in traditional financial systems.</p><p>However, not all cryptocurrencies provide the same level of privacy. Some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are more transparent than others. While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, they are still recorded on a public ledger, which means that anyone can view the transaction history of a particular address.</p><p>This lack of privacy can be problematic for users who want to keep their financial transactions private. For example, someone who wants to make a large purchase without revealing their identity might be hesitant to use a cryptocurrency that does not provide strong privacy features.</p> How SHIELD, PIVX’s zk-SNARKs Technology, Enables Private Transactions <p>PIVX’s Optional Private Transactions are enabled by a technology called SHIELD, which is based on zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge). zk-SNARKs is a privacy-enhancing technology that allows users to prove that they have knowledge of something without revealing what that knowledge is.</p><p>In the case of PIVX, SHIELD allows users to make private transactions by proving that they have the funds to make the transaction without revealing their transaction history or the amount of the transaction. This means that PIVX users can make transactions without revealing their real-world identities, making it much more difficult for anyone to track their financial activity.</p> The Benefits of Using SHIELD for Your Transactions <p>There are several benefits to using SHIELD for your transactions. First and foremost, SHIELD provides users with a high degree of privacy. This means that transactions cannot be traced back to a particular user, which provides a level of financial privacy that is not possible with most cryptocurrencies.</p><p>In addition to privacy, PIVX also provides users with almost instant transactions. This makes PIVX an attractive option for users who want to make fast, low-cost transactions, without sacrificing privacy.</p> Other Cutting-Edge Technologies Used by&nbsp;PIVX <p>In addition to SHIELD, PIVX uses several other cutting-edge technologies to provide users with a secure and private cryptocurrency experience. For example, PIVX uses masternodes to provide additional network security and governance. Masternodes are nodes that provide additional services to the network, such as instant transactions and voting rights in the PIVX ecosystem.</p><p>PIVX also uses a decentralised governance system called the PIVX DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation). The PIVX DAO allows users to propose and vote on changes to the PIVX ecosystem, which helps ensure that the community has a say in the future direction of the&nbsp;project.</p> Comparison of PIVX with Other Privacy-Focused Cryptocurrencies <p>There are several other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies on the market, such as Monero and Zcash. While these cryptocurrencies provide strong privacy features, they do not offer the same level of flexibility as PIVX’s optional private transactions.</p><p>With Monero and Zcash, all transactions are private by default. While this provides a high degree of privacy, it also means that users cannot choose to make their transactions public if they need to. This can be problematic for users who need to prove that they made a particular transaction, such as for tax purposes.</p><p>PIVX’s optional private transactions provide users with the best of both worlds. Users can choose to make their transactions private when they need to, but they can also choose to make their transactions public if they need to prove that they made a particular transaction.</p> How PIVX is Contributing to the Evolution of Cryptocurrency <p>PIVX is one of the leading privacy-focused cryptocurrencies on the market, and its innovative use of SHIELD technology has helped set it apart from other projects. By providing users with a flexible and private cryptocurrency experience, PIVX is contributing to the evolution of cryptocurrency as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>PIVX’s focus on privacy is also helping to raise awareness of the importance of privacy in digital transactions. As more people become aware of the risks associated with digital privacy, they are likely to seek out privacy-focused solutions like&nbsp;PIVX.</p> Future Implications of PIVX’s Optional Private Transactions <p>PIVX’s Optional Private Transactions have the potential to revolutionise the way that we think about privacy in cryptocurrency. As more people become aware of the benefits of PIVX’s privacy features, it is likely that other projects will begin to adopt similar technologies.</p><p>In the future, we may see a shift towards more privacy-focused cryptocurrencies that provide users with greater control over their financial privacy. This could have implications for the broader financial system as well, as privacy becomes an increasingly important consideration for consumers.</p> Conclusion <p>PIVX’s optional private transactions are a game-changer in the world of cryptocurrency. By providing users with a flexible and private cryptocurrency experience, PIVX is helping to raise awareness of the importance of privacy in digital transactions.</p><p>With cutting-edge technologies like SHIELD and a decentralised governance system, PIVX is leading the way in the evolution of cryptocurrency. As more people become aware of the benefits of PIVX’s privacy features, it is likely that we will see a shift towards more privacy-focused cryptocurrencies in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>If you value your digital privacy and want to take control of your financial transactions, PIVX is definitely worth considering.</p><p>Visit <a href="http://Pivx.org/privacy-protocol">Pivx.org/privacy-protocol</a> to learn more about SHIELD, and how to keep your cryptocurrency transactions private.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx-coin/optional-privacy-881bf1bc6112">Optional Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx-coin">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Partnering with Harvey: Putting LLMs to Work  <p>Gabe, Winston and their team are using generative AI to give knowledge workers superpowers. </p>   
	By Pat Grady and Charlie Curnin	 



Published April 26, 2023
  



 
<p>More than a hundred million people have now had The GPT Moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the moment you realize the earth is moving beneath your feet. The tectonic plates of technology are shifting, and your world is changing in a fundamental way. You begin to dream. You imagine the impact this will have on your life. You begin to play. You start small, but quickly you’re pushing the limits of the machine, feeding it more and more context for increasingly sophisticated queries. You begin to work. With superhuman recall and reasoning at your fingertips, you’re more productive than you’ve ever been. You don’t know how you lived without this. Your heart is filled with joy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is when the second moment strikes. The Uh-Oh Moment. This is the moment you get an email from Compliance. Compliance would like to provide you with a copy of the new AI Usage Policy. It turns out you are a repeat offender. You instinctively move to ask ChatGPT if this policy is retroactive, but quickly realize that this may be yet another violation. Your heart rate increases. You are now sweating. How are you going to get your job done without GPT models? How is your company going to compete? Fear and panic overwhelm you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Relax. Gabe and Winston have your back. Long before you had your GPT Moment, they had theirs. And they’ve been thinking about how to help you ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gabe Pereyra and Winston Weinberg are the founders of <a href="https://www.harvey.ai/">Harvey</a>. Harvey unlocks the power of LLMs at work.</p>



<p>Last year, Harvey became the first company built on top of GPT-4, and ever since then they’ve been making it work for work. Need a custom model? They’re on it. Data segregation? They’re on it. Enterprise security and compliance? They’re on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gabe comes from the bleeding edge of AI research. Winston comes from blue-chip securities and antitrust litigation. Together, they understand both the problem (rote cognitive labor) and the solution (large language models). And experience aside, they are forces of nature—not to mention a true delight to work with.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harvey is starting with the legal market, which is <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/global-legal-services-market">$300Bn+</a> in the U.S. alone. Legal work is the ultimate text-in, text-out business—a bull’s-eye for language models—and Harvey has already begun to make an impact. Harvey helps legal teams find leverage in time-consuming tasks like legal research, due diligence and more, allowing them to focus on client relationships and strategic work that truly moves the needle. In February, <a href="https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/news-and-insights/news/ao-announces-exclusive-launch-partnership-with-harvey">Allen &amp; Overy</a> became the first announced enterprise customer. In March, <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-announces-strategic-alliance-with-harvey-positioning-pwcs-legal-business-solutions-at-the-forefront-of-legal-generative-ai.html">PwC</a> announced it was coming on board. More than 15,000 law firms are on the waiting list today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gabe, Winston and their team are running hard to make these early believers successful, and they now have the full force of Sequoia behind them. Today we are thrilled to share that we’ve led Harvey’s Series A.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harvey is the first and best instantiation of a new breed of company: the AI super app. Harvey is in the business of giving people superpowers. First, lawyers. Next, professional services. Eventually, all of knowledge work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at Sequoia are delighted to be in business with Gabe, Winston and the entire team at Harvey. We look forward to helping them unlock the power of LLMs at work and, in doing so, usher in a new era of superhuman productivity.</p>

<p>The imminent convergence of traditional finance and DeFi has created a need to build the foundations to support a shared ecosystem. As the incumbents start to adapt, new technology promises to disrupt the standard models. As the architects of a new financial ecosystem, our responsibility is to build the technical, regulatory, and legal frameworks that support growth and innovation, while safeguarding the true interests of users. This is why, during <a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Consensus 2023,</a> I’m looking forward to participating in the multiple conversations that will arise around this.</p><p>‌‌Here are the main topics that have captured my interest.</p> Setting the Stage for Consensus 2023 <p>Consensus is the world's largest, longest-running and most influential gathering that brings together all sides of crypto, blockchain and Web3 communities. It is often regarded as a prominent event for heavyweight players in the blockchain and crypto industry. If you know where to look, the event agenda itself will reveal critical industry concerns, along with where you might find the most valuable insights.</p><p>‌‌Upon reviewing this year’s, several recurring themes stand out: First and foremost, regulatory compliance is a top concern for everyone. Second, this is predominantly due to an urgency from both the DeFi and TradFi sides to create a clear path for institutions to participate in DeFi.</p><p>‌‌The aftermath of this tumultuous year in crypto will determine who is fully established and prepared to integrate with the blockchain industry. As an example, the panel, "<a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-crypto-is-still-inevitable-65?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Crypto is (Still) Inevitable</a>," by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanselkis?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ryan Selkis</a>, CEO of <a href="https://messari.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Messari</a> –a leading DeFi data analytics firm– will delve into the arguments for and against crypto’s proposed solutions. Messari's research reports and data have provided strong guidance for builders, investors, and stakeholders within Web3, and Selkis' talk will likely offer a data-driven analysis of the evolution of DeFi.</p><p>‌‌Another topic of conversation that will doubtlessly be present everywhere is characterized as “government overreach." The topic is gaining traction as the discontent from the sector against the regulatory angles pursued by governments grows. On that note, former U.S. CFTC Chairman <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/About/Commissioners/JChristopherGiancarlo/index.htm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">J. Christopher Giancarlo</a> (who advocated for a "do no harm" approach to crypto regulation) is set to provide a starting point to discuss the future of money and the value of sovereign and non-sovereign digital currencies.</p> Innovating Compliance and Regulations <p>‌‌One topic I’m particularly interested in Consensus 2023, is the role of compliant-friendly data protection solutions.</p><p>‌‌<a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Consumers still require privacy in their transactions</a>, and privacy is a major trust driver in technology. As privacy-unfriendly CBDC solutions loom in the horizon and the global macroeconomic landscape shifts, Zero-Knowledge technology is naturally emerging as a way to preserve user privacy while retaining compliance, allowing parties to prove the authenticity of information without revealing the information itself.</p><p>‌‌<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/04/19/zero-knowledge-proofs-use-cases-for-businesses/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ZK technology</a> can be leveraged for many other use cases, such as blockchain scalability and (as stated) privacy, but I suspect the most interesting conversations will revolve around its use for compliance. The US and other jurisdictions have already taken note of this potential use case, and the ball is now on the DeFi industry’s court to propose and educate regulators on solutions to adopt it.</p> Consensus 2023 And Institutional Capital <p>As institutions find their way into DeFi, some conversations also will naturally begin to shift towards the approach they should follow once in.</p><p>‌‌The Consensus 2023 panel "<a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-where-does-tradfi-go-from-herea-recalibrating-the-risks-and-opportunities-34?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Where Does TradFi Go From Here? Recalibrating the Risks and Opportunities</a>" will aim to provide insights that can guide institutional investors on how they can ensure their investments in cryptocurrencies align with their risk appetite and investment objectives. Dawn Harflinger, Matt Halstead, and Dan Tapiero will spearhead this talk, alongside moderator Joe Marenda, Global Head of Digital Assets Investing at Cambridge Associates. As experienced investors who have effectively managed and allocated billions of dollars in capital, I'm interested in hearing the perspectives they've gained through navigating the present investment landscape.</p> Collaborating for a Unified Future <p>‌‌As the industry continues to evolve, early adopters who establish strong networks and relationships will find themselves at the forefront of shaping the future of finance. The successful integration of traditional finance and DeFi requires not only a technically secure infrastructure and self-governing identity solutions but also direct engagement and collaboration among all stakeholders and participants.</p><p>‌‌As we navigate through a tumultuous year and the end of a seemingly long crypto winter, we stand at a crossroads. The decisions we make now will pave the way for a much-needed wave of adoption. It is often said that bear markets are the breeding ground for builders, and witnessing the evolution of conferences like Consensus from their early days only reinforces this notion.</p><p>‌‌By fostering open dialogue, embracing innovation, and working together, we can create a unified ecosystem that is both accessible and secure. I look forward to coming together, sharing ideas, and forge the connections necessary to drive the industry forward, ultimately shaping the future of finance for the better.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a chain-agnostic privacy layer that allows users to access DeFi privately and compliantly.

 Part 1: Intentional product design around multi-wallet user experiences <p>At <a href="http://privy.io">Privy</a>, we build simple tools to help you onboard and engage your users in web3. In this series, we break down some of the work it takes to create simple experiences with state of the art tooling in&nbsp;web3.</p><p>We spend a lot of time thinking about the user experience surrounding user activation, and in particular connecting wallets to&nbsp;apps.</p><blockquote>Wallets enable true self-custody, but often at the cost of confusing UX.</blockquote><p>To that end, Privy strives to make wallet flows more intuitive for end users, and easier to manage for developers.</p><p>In this post, we’ll see that there is a lot of state complexity in this domain: users can enter the connection flow from many different states, and the wallet can be disconnected or switched from outside of the app&nbsp;context!</p><p>Let’s dive into a concrete example and see how Privy solves for it carefully. At a high-level, our heuristics are:</p>  Wallets integrations should work, independently of what state the user comes in&nbsp;with.  Wallets integrations should account for state changes within the wallet&nbsp;client.  Wallet integrations should provide UIs to help the user understand what to do to get to a desired state, when necessary.  <p>Today we’re going to zoom into a particularly subtle issue around MetaMask connections in a multi-wallet world, that behaves differently based on the user having zero, one or more accounts connected in MetaMask, and also which is the primary selected&nbsp;one.</p>The privy SDK allows multiple wallets to be linked to one&nbsp;user Down the rabbithole <p>First, let’s define some terms and some context. The Privy Auth SDK allows users to link multiple wallets to their user account. This is a very useful feature that customers love, but it comes with a slew of subtle edge cases we need to handle carefully.</p><p>Why is it so subtle? Like a lot of hard programming problems, it’s due to non-trivial state. Wallets can&nbsp;be:</p>  Connected. The official documentation defines it (<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193">EIP-1193</a>) as follows: “The Provider is said to be “connected” when it can service RPC requests to at least one&nbsp;chain.”  Linked. This means authenticated in the privy SDK. With wallets, it means the user has actually signed a message (using <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361">EIP-4361</a>: SIWE).  Active. This is a concept of the Privy SDK. This is the wallet which the developer wants to use to take an on-chain action (like signing, sending ETH, or performing a transaction).  <p>Likewise, we should distinguish between</p>  Wallet addresses. The actual public address for an account on-chain. For instance 0x1dA4FDf7029bDf8ff11f28141a659f6563940642 or pushix.eth.  Wallet clients. The software provider helping users manage their keys, typically what people mean by “wallet”, for instance MetaMask, Phantom or Coinbase&nbsp;wallet.  <p>In addition to the above SDK state (connected-linked-active), wallet clients can have their own wallet state. Most of them, like shown in MetaMask in the below image, have a “primary” selected wallet at any given&nbsp;time.</p>MetaMask’s “selected” wallet<p>A given wallet address (e.g. pushix.eth) can be provided by different wallet clients — by importing the seed phrase — for example by both MetaMask or Coinbase wallet, each of which has subtle differences! The relationship between clients and addresses is therefore many-to-many. If this is still confusing, go check out <a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@nichochar/blockchain-accounts">this short explanation</a> on wallets and external accounts.</p><p>We can start to see the state complexity appear! Wallets can be linked but not connected, connected but not linked, both, active or not, across different clients,&nbsp;etc…</p> Sweating the&nbsp;details <p>Authentication in a multi-modal world (email, phone, wallets) can be tricky business, but is the only way to build rich and engaging experiences, so it’s worth the pain. Let’s shed some light on this by taking an example user story: let’s imagine we’re building an NFT marketplace app which allows users to link wallets together to display the user’s aggregate NFT gallery, but also allows users to mint or purchase NFTs to one of their connected wallets.</p><p>Session 1</p>  User signs up with address1 with the wallet client&nbsp;MetaMask  User links a phone, to take advantage of Privy’s mobile SMS login flows and log in on their phone later (where they do not have MetaMask installed)  The app encourages the user to link more wallets, for a richer gallery profile -&gt; user links address2 with&nbsp;MetaMask   Session 2   User is on mobile, uses their phone number to login, shows off their gallery to a friend on the go. This experience doesn’t involve their&nbsp;wallet.   Session 3   User is on Desktop again, has used SMS to login again, and wants to perform an on-chain action (purchase a sweet new NFT). This requires a wallet to be not only linked to their account (which is already the case), but also connected to the current&nbsp;app.  The developer was intentional here, and wants to connect a specific wallet: address1, not any wallet (maybe because of some on-chain properties of that wallet: it is on a whitelist which allows it to perform a gated transaction).  They call Privy’s setActiveWallet(address1) function, which ensures that the user will connect that specific address and return an ethers or web3 provider to handle the transaction logic.  <p>OK, now that we have this story in place, let’s look at some nuanced state combinations which can happen, and how Privy handles them with&nbsp;care.</p> Case 1: Target address is connected to the site and selected in the wallet&nbsp;client. <p>The happy path! The user’s metamask is already connected to the site, and is also the selected wallet in metamask, this means that eth_requestAccounts returns this address, and sending transactions through window.ethereum will forward to that&nbsp;one.</p><p>This is the easy case! And this is what happens in a non-multi-wallet world most of the time. This just works, so we’ll keep looking at harder&nbsp;ones.</p> Case 2: Target address is connected to the site, but not selected in the wallet&nbsp;client. <p>The user’s metamask is connected to the site, but with the wrong address. So the developer is calling setActive(address1) but the user has address2 as the “selected” wallet in metamask. In this case, Privy’s SDK will nudge the user to switch the wallet in MetaMask, and MetaMask’s UI is quite helpful and intuitive.</p>MetaMask makes it easy to connect another address if at least one is already connected<p>In this case, since MetaMask’s UI is acceptable, so Privy simply gives the user a helpful hint and they can do the switch on their own. This is surprisingly manageable for people that have multiple MetaMask addresses, probably because they are in the habit of switching them like this&nbsp;already.</p> Case 3: Target address is not connected to the&nbsp;site. <p>The user’s metamask has no addresses connected to the current site. This could happen for a multitude of reasons, first of which is that users can choose to disconnect sites independently, at any time, from MetaMask directly (we love user control, this is a good&nbsp;thing!).</p><p>Unlike in case 2, MetaMask does not do a good job of connecting an address to the site from the extension, if no address is connected. The user has to know about an obscure flow, shown&nbsp;below:</p>This mysterious flow to connect from the MetaMask client directly when no wallet is connected is&nbsp;*hard*<p>In practice, little to no one knows about this flow, meaning users are unable to connect to the&nbsp;site.</p><p>Privy adds a <a href="https://littlebigdetails.com/">little big detail</a> for this case, and only this one, which gives the user the option to open the account picker and select the intended address1 and connect it. See&nbsp;below:</p>This will only show up in this specific&nbsp;case<p>Privy goes further to make sure that the user indeed connects address1 and not another one, and gives the user feedback to help them through if they didn’t. This is to compensate for the lack of more powerful APIs in MetaMask: they don’t give the option to connect address1 directly, but only open the account picker, so the user can choose which account to connect. Sometimes, it is great to give the user the choice, but other times — like in the example above where we seek to specifically connect address because of its on-chain properties — developers want more control. See the flow&nbsp;below</p>What if the user gets it wrong and selects another wallet than the intended one from the developer?Privy to the&nbsp;rescue!<p>This example shows but one, small and rare edge case, that a good connector (like Privy) can optimize and make more usable. There are many more such examples of sweating the details in Privy. Privy’s mission is to make onboarding to web3 easier for all users, meeting them where they are in their web3&nbsp;journey.</p><p>As we saw in this post, there is a lot more nuanced complexity that needs to be handled than meets the eye when it comes to web3 connection &amp; authentication flows.</p><p>To be clear, wallets are a core piece of infrastructure and as such, should be treated with care and built around standards (and great work is being done here by the likes of CASA, Spruce and others). Nonetheless, our users’ lives should be simple, regardless of how they connect to the applications we&nbsp;build.</p><blockquote>It’s easy to only think about the happy path and ignore rarer ones that degrade user experience.</blockquote><p>Privy spends a great deal of time optimizing for these and making them as usable as possible for end users, no matter where they are in their web3 journey. Progressive onboarding means meeting users where they are, and often that means smoothing out the UX of these edge case&nbsp;flows.</p><p>You can play around with this yourself at <a href="https://demo.privy.io">https://demo.privy.io</a></p><p>If you are building an awesome web3 product and want to focus on your business domain, not the long and complex tail of web3 Auth edge cases like this one, Privy is here to help!

<p><a href="https://rkyv.org">Rkyv</a> is a data format and (de)serialization framework for Rust that “implements total zero-copy deserialization, which guarantees that no data is copied during deserialization and no work is done to deserialize data. It achieves this by structuring its encoded representation so that it is the same as the in-memory representation of the source type.” (Source: <a href="https://rkyv.org/zero-copy-deserialization.html#total-zero-copy">rkyv.org</a>)</p>
<p>Zebra and zcashd currently provide JSON-RPC methods that accept/return<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON"> JSON</a>-encoded Zcash consensus-serialized data for historical and compatibility reasons. Where there isn’t a Zcash consensus serialization, RPCs serialize data in internal zcashd formats before it is JSON-encoded. JSON is widely-supported, flexible, and human-readable, but lacks type-checking and is relatively slow to encode/decode.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6313">PR #6313</a>, a “rkyv-serialization” feature was added to Zebra with a new “rkyv_listen_addr” config field for starting a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/datacake-rpc">datacake</a> RPC server that accepts/returns data in the rkyv format.</p>
<p>The datacake RPC methods route to the same RpcImpl and GetBlockTemplateRpcImpl methods provided by Zebra’s JSON-RPC server, except they use the rkyv data format for quicker transformations to and from Zebra’s internal in-memory representation of the source type. Clients calling RPC methods from a Rust environment can import the request/response types paired with message handlers from zebra-rpc and let the Rust compiler check correct usage.</p>
<p>Rkyv <a href="https://github.com/djkoloski/rust_serialization_benchmark">performs very well in benchmarks</a>, (de)serializing over 100x faster than serde_json, and appears to be the most usable, versatile crate for zero-copy deserialization. Validating data with bytecheck can make a big difference, this could be optional if Zebra supports rkyv in the future.</p>
<p>Clients calling RPC methods from a Rust environment can reap the performance benefits from a data format that matches Zebra’s internal in-memory representation of source types. Clients in other languages can also use Zebra’s Rust libraries to deserialize rkyv RPCs.</p>
<p>There are also other excellent frameworks for serializing data (e.g. protobufs, flatbuffers) with better support for other programming languages. Ideally Zebra could expose its RPC methods via multiple encodings and protocols in the future by decoding/encoding request data according to ‘Content-Type’/‘Accept’ headers so clients can call methods from whatever environment they’re already using or which best meet their needs. A GraphQL server that exchanges JSON data may also be nice for making it easier to get started developing with Zebra.</p>
<p>Let us know what data formats and/or protocols you would like to see supported in Zebra on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/809218587167293450/809251029673312267">Discord</a>&nbsp;or on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zebra-rpcs-with-rkyz-data-format/44471">Zcash Community Forum</a>!</p>

<p>San Francisco, California, USA – <a href="http://www.xrsi.org">XR Safety Initiative(XRSI)</a>, a global leader in privacy, safety, and security in immersive and emerging technologies, today announces its strong support for the Kids PRIVACY Act, recently reintroduced by the U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor (FL14). The legislation aims to update the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and implement more robust protections to keep children and teenagers safe online while holding Big Tech companies accountable for their surveillance and targeting of young users.</p>



<p>“Children are spending more time online than ever before, and it’s time that Congress address the evolving online landscape, especially the tracking and data gathering that has vastly outpaced online privacy protections for kids,” said Rep. Castor. “I’m proud to reintroduce my Kids PRIVACY Act, endorsed by parents, safety advocates and pediatricians to update COPPA, protect children online, and hold Big Tech accountable. Parents and families deserve a 21st century privacy law that can contend with a 21st century internet. Companies continue to knowingly target kids, and it is past time they are penalized for violating privacy protections. Let’s come to the table, Democrats and Republicans, to strengthen protections for our youngest neighbors and bring these safeguards into modern day.”</p>



<p>Kavya Pearlman, Founder and CEO of XR Safety Initiative, stated, “In this age of rapid technological advancement, it is crucial to ensure the privacy and safety of our children and teenagers. We commend Rep. Castor for her unwavering commitment to protecting young people in the digital world. The Kids PRIVACY Act is a vital step toward ensuring that the best interests of children and teenagers are at the forefront of service design and that their privacy rights are respected.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The Kids PRIVACY Act expands privacy protections for children and teenagers by:</p>



 
 Banning Companies from Providing Targeted Advertisements to Children and Teenagers: Prohibits companies from targeting children and teenagers based on their personal information and behavior. 



 Best Interests of Children and Teenagers: Requires an operator to make the best interests of children and teenagers a primary design consideration when designing its service. 



 Requiring Opt-In Consent for all Individuals Under 18: Companies must obtain specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent before collecting, retaining, selling, sharing, or using a young consumer or child’s personal information. 



 Creating a Right to Access, Correct, and Delete Personal Information: Companies must provide individuals the opportunity to access, correct, or delete their personal information at any time. 



 Protecting Additional Types of Information: Expands the type of information explicitly covered to include physical characteristics, biometric information, health information, education information, contents of messages and calls, browsing and search history, geolocation information, and latent audio or visual recordings. 



 Requiring User-Friendly Privacy Policies: Companies must make publicly available privacy policies that are clear, easily understood, and written in plain and concise language. 



 Creating a Protected Class of “Teenagers” Ages 13-17: For the first time in statute, the bill provides protection for teenagers 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it. 



 Expands Coverage of Companies: Applies to all sites likely to be accessed by children and teens, not just child-directed services. 



 Limiting Disclosure to Third Parties: The bill prohibits companies from sharing personal information without consent. Furthermore, it creates additional duties companies must comply with before disclosing any personal information with third parties. 



 Requiring Reasonable Data Security Policies, Practices, and Procedures: Requires companies to have a written security policy, point of contact for information security management and processes to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities. 



 Prohibiting Industry Self-Regulation: Repeals dangerous safe harbor provisions that allow for lax enforcement and rubber stamping of potentially unlawful practices. 



 Strengthening FTC Enforcement: Raises the maximum allowable civil penalty per violation by 50 percent and allows the FTC to pursue punitive damages. Also establishes a Youth Privacy and Marketing Division at the FTC. 



 Providing for Parental Enforcement: Parents will be able to bring civil actions to help enforce the bill and any resulting regulations. 



 Banning Forced Arbitration: In a much-needed reversal of current law, companies will no longer be able force their consumers to waive their right to sue.

 Introducing Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) — The Revolutionary Layer 0/1 Protocol Launches its Most Anticipated Mainnet&nbsp;Upgrade  After years of hard work and dedication, on the fifth anniversary, the worldwide Verus community is excited to announce the launch of the highly anticipated mainnet upgrade on May 21. The Public Blockchains as a Service release marks a major milestone for Verus and the entire cryptocurrency industry.  ⏱️ PBaaS activation: block height 2,546,600 (Sunday 21 May&nbsp;2023) <p>Upgrade to this release or a later version v1.0.0-x, before MAY 21, 2023 to stay reliably connected to mainnet. <a href="http://www.verus.io/wallet">Download here</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>Testnet release will allow you to connect to the new testnet, which we see as a core development platform and staging area for the Verus PBaaS network and have no plans to reset in any foreseeable future.</p><p>Read the release notes on GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v1.0.2">CLI</a> 🔗 and <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.2">GUI</a>&nbsp;🔗</p> Turning the Crypto Industry on its&nbsp;Head <p>The wide cryptocurrency industry will see how much better Verus PBaaS is as a solution for true decentralization in cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, on-chain P2P exchange, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, scale, or just about any of the challenges people have on crypto platforms today. In fact, as we prepare for activation of this protocol that enables so many new use cases for crypto, not to mention easy onboarding when entrepreneurs discover how to really leverage VerusIDs, PBaaS is so far beyond what people are experiencing on any crypto platform today that it has been easy to dismiss our community as describing the impossible.</p><p>Once PBaaS is live on mainnet and people can actually use all of this themselves, along with every project, chain and currency on the PBaaS network and EVERY ERC20 or ERC721 on Ethereum or even bridged to Ethereum, the truth of Verus will be self-evident, and those who build on Verus will more easily build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs that do not need business deals, permission, or any centralized infrastructure to connect services and users, enabling everyone to communicate in provable, private, or public ways that always include bidirectional, secure commerce of all&nbsp;kinds.</p> Core Capabilities <p>The core capabilities of this release include (lots to learn to understand it all, but here’s a partial&nbsp;list):</p> Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP) — Layer 0 Multichain and Inter-chain Protocol <p>To our knowledge, the VIP protocol is the only fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology available on any network that is based on cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. From what we’ve been able to learn about LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, Thorchain or others, VIP is different from (though closest in some ways to LayerZero), superior to, and more decentralized than all other cross-chain protocols we have seen. We can of course get into any level of discussion on the topic, but expect more descriptions and educational material to follow, now that the protocol was originally conceived of 5 years ago, and has been developed and tested/hardened for&nbsp;years.</p> VerusID Content Multimaps — Unlimited Provable Data for Every&nbsp;VerusID <p>Of course this upgrade retains all of the groundbreaking capabilities already available with VerusID, including multisig options, separate revocation and recovery authorities for maximum security to prevent theft of identity or funds, and the ability to timelock your ID, enabling you to even thwart attempts to access your funds after someone compromised your secret&nbsp;keys.</p><p>With the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs also gain a powerful new capability that amounts to an unlimited, rent-free indexed database for every VerusID on every blockchain of the PBaaS network. This data can be encrypted or published in the clear and used for any purpose or application, whether social networking, voting, oracles, publishing any information, various forms of provable attestations, ratings, and much, much more. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. We don’t believe anything else even comes close, and with the recent rise of AI, it feels great to have this come together as a core original goal at a very appropriate and important time in&nbsp;history.</p> Permissionless Chain, Token, and Liquidity Basket Currency&nbsp;Launches <p>Whether you are looking to crowdfund an effort in a manner much like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, sell identities to which you expect to add value or that are sub-IDs of a very cool root ID, or launch an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with all of the Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1, Verus is probably the best platform for you. In fact, as we were planning for the next testnet and wanted to have our own version of DAI to use in the bridge, since we want only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge, we used a command to launch a token on the old testnet, exported it and all its supply to Ethereum’s Goerli on the existing bridge, and that will be the DAI proxy/simulant that we will use on the new testnet. It saved us all some time, proving that Verus PBaaS will also be the easiest, most efficient way to launch even an Ethereum ERC20, whether that ERC20 represents a token, DeFi basket, or even another PBaaS blockchain</p><p>Verus enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched&nbsp;it.</p><p>All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus&nbsp;network.</p><p>Verus also enables any ID owner to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners, stakers, and liquidity providers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.</p> Decentralized Ethereum&nbsp;Bridge <p>Shortly after PBaaS activates on mainnet, the Ethereum bridge will launch as a decentralized gateway and 1:1 provably mapped currency called “vETH” on the Verus network, also available to all PBaaS chains. The Ethereum bridge will also include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will have the following functions:</p>  Auto conversion of fees from Verus &lt;-&gt; Ethereum when sending cross chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket  Permissionless ability to register *.vETH IDs, which in addition to the normal sub-ID capability of creating a single token that has control over the ID and can be exported to Ethereum as an automatic ERC721 NFT, can alternately be used to create a “mapped currency”, which can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting it to the vETH bridge. Only Verus root IDs, and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a&nbsp;gateway.  Decentralized, fair bridge launch. The vETH bridge will launch as other currencies, chains, and gateways can launch, including the bridge converter. When the bridge launches, the contracts will have a surplus of Verus that comes from the fees paid to launch the gateway. In the protocol, that surplus is first used to solve the chicken and egg problem of none of one currency on the other chain. The contracts will cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches, the liquidity basket becomes active, and the bridge recognizes that launch. Once that happens, the remainder of ½ the fees (5000 VRSC) that are left over from the launch and did not go to miners and stakers or pay Verus fees for people sending from Ethereum.   The Verus Fee Pool and&nbsp;Rewards <p>Another technology and solution unique to Verus, the Verus Fee Pool technology goes live with PBaaS. What this means is that as people use the cross-chain, DeFi, or purchase/register IDs on the network, the miner or staker will put all fees into the on-chain “fee pool”, and then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This gives everyone incentive to still prioritize transactions based on fees, while preventing validators from gaming the fee system by washing fees-in vs. fees-out or working to reorg/rewind to capture a particularly juicy block reward. Instead, this technology aligns all validator incentives with the health/proper operation of the network and creates a circular on-chain economy that can last well beyond block&nbsp;rewards.</p> To know more about Verus PBaaS capabilities <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-announces-new-multicurrency-multichain-defi-protocols-and-immediate-public-availability-of-f1868f259ce5">read this article</a>&nbsp;🔗  A Historic Move&nbsp;Forward <p>For those who actually understand the challenges actual users have in crypto today, this release represents a historic move forward in public cryptographic networks and credibly and actually neutral infrastructure for society-wide human and AI collaboration and learning. As a community, this version really does realize the vision laid out in the original <a href="https://verus.io/papers/VerusVision.pdf">Verus Vision Paper</a>, and at the same time provides much more than was described there. We are a community of individuals, and it is only because that is what we are that we have all arrived here together. The rest of the world is stuck on their Munchausen’s protocols, trying to figure out how to share the front-running and back-running spoils taken from users, but Verus activation gives them a better path&nbsp;forward.</p><p>As a community, we do not promise, we describe a shared vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases described in the first vision paper together, it is time for each of us to also consider what we might personally want to build or be part of building over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Read the release notes on GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v1.0.2">CLI</a> 🔗 and <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.2">GUI</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>Thanks to the incredible combined efforts of so many people in the community ranging from development, companies and projects joining and their open contributions (<a href="https://www.valu.earth">Valu/Arkeytyp</a>, <a href="https://chips.cash">CHIPS</a>, vDEX, <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert</a>, <a href="https://cragslist.hopto.org">cragslist</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joefromthehills/status/1635769270708649988?s=20">Electricty Supply Board of Ireland</a> and more) to community members supporting users to helping educate others who can contribute as well, we have run these protocols now for years as we’ve improved them, and all of these capabilities will go live on the Verus mainnet May 21, 2023, with the activation expected targeting block 2,546,600.</p> Join the community.

 👉 Trend + tips: Token design, beyond tokenomics <p>Guy Wuollet et al</p><p>“Tokens” are a hot-button topic, capturing mindshare not just for those in crypto but for anyone interested in art, design, economics, gaming, math, psychology, and more. And while tokens have been described as everything from a “<a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef">breakthrough in open network design</a>” to a “<a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?lang=en">new digital primitive (analogous to the website</a>)”, we can generally define tokens as: an internet-native unit of value.&nbsp;Importantly, tokens represent not just monetary value — but also social, reputational, and many other forms of value. </p><p>Tokens can be used to coordinate and organize people beyond a purely economic context. That’s why the term “tokenomics” — token + economics — for describing the study and design of tokens is too limited. We need another term to designate “the study of “ tokens (“tokenology” perhaps?) for how to coordinate people, organizations, and/or computation towards a common goal through the use of cryptography and mechanism design.<br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/beyond-tokenomics-tokenology/">read more</a></p><p>Okay; so if tokens are a powerful new primitive that can be defined in many ways — allowing for a very rich design space — it would be great to have <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_roughgarden/status/1522995114062360576?lang=en">the modern equivalent</a> of (what computer scientists refer to as) “the Dragon Book”! The Dragon Book helped turn the impossibly messy, big computer science problem of the 1950s — that is, of compiler design — into a more well-solved problem that could be tackled in stages, by applying rigorous principles at each stage.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s too early to produce such a definitive text on tokens, but some of early token design principles are already becoming clear. And while effective token models will have design elements unique to their specific objectives, most flawed token designs do share a number of common pitfalls. So here’s a list of instructive tips our team has observed, to help builders avoid the most common failure modes:<br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/designing-tokens-sanity-checks-principles-guidance/">read more</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/guywuolletjr/status/1649546737726398465?s=46&amp;t=m_MyW3EHf_hr6YPWeAdbGA">share on Twitter</a> / <a href="https://warpcast.com/guy/0x71889ahttps://warpcast.com/guy/0x71889a">share on Farcaster</a></p><p>related:</p>  <p>▶️ watch: “<a href="https://youtu.be/GOkxDvq_8zQ">Token Design: Mental models, capabilities, and emerging design spaces</a>” (2022) by Eddy Lazzarin</p>  <p>📖 read: “<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/the-web3-playbook-using-token-incentives-to-bootstrap-new-networks/">The web3 Playbook: Using token incentives to bootstrap new networks</a>” (2021) by Chris Dixon&nbsp;</p>  <p>see also: 📖 “<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/reputation-based-systems/">A novel framework for reputation-based tokens</a>” (2021) by Jad Esber and Scott Kominers, on how reputation systems present an opportunity for platforms to recognize (and thus incentivize) participants’ meaningful contributions, including content creation, moderation, community building, and gameplay. </p> 📐Code + theme: More client diversity through open source <p>Noah Citron et al</p><p>A recurring theme in our (and more importantly, the broader crypto community’s) open source efforts is making sure networks have no single point of failure. This helps makes decentralized networks more robust, more secure, and far more resilient than their centralized counterparts. But in practice, we often see potentially vulnerable points of centralization — whether due to specific aspects (like <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-helios-ethereum-light-client/">centralized remote procedure calls</a>), or a lack of independently developed clients.&nbsp;</p><p>Client diversity, in particular, is critical for <a href="https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1553323168521228289">rollups</a>; client diversity is needed on both the execution and consensus sides, but most of the development so far has been focused on execution clients. That’s why we *just released* <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-magi-a-new-rollup-client-for-optimism/">Magi</a> — a fast OP Stack rollup client written in Rust — which acts as the consensus in the traditional execution/ consensus split of Ethereum by feeding new blocks to the execution client, in order to advance the chain. Magi aims to be an independently developed, drop-in replacement for op-node, adding to the rollup’s client diversity; and encouraging greater safety and liveliness throughout the OP Stack via Rust. </p><p>But it also helps bring more contributors into the ecosystem, simply by broadening the developer base with clients in other languages...&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-magi-a-new-rollup-client-for-optimism/">read more</a><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-magi-a-new-rollup-client-for-optimism/"><br></a><a href="https://github.com/a16z/magi">see code base</a><a href="https://github.com/a16z/magi"><br></a><a href="https://twitter.com/eddylazzarin/status/1648703454813241350?s=20">share on Twitter</a> / <a href="https://warpcast.com/ncitron/0x865a57">share on Farcaster</a></p><p>see also: 🎧 “<a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/programming-languages-smart-contract-programming-evolutions">Programming languages &amp; crypto</a>”, with Sam Blackshear, Noah Citron, Eddy Lazzarin, and Sonal Chokshi (2023).

<p>We often take data storage for granted, but the rise of centralised storing facilities (i.e. AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) hangs over like Damocles’ sword. When it comes to blockchains, full nodes store that network’s complete data history. Even if storage costs are set to decrease as technology evolves, so do blockchains accumulate more data over time. An interesting solution would be to create a decentralised backup for blockchain data and Arweave is a prime candidate for it. There is but a missing link represented by uploading and validating different blockchains’ data. This is where KYVE steps in, offering a decentralised validating solution to verify uploaded blockchain data and even retrieve it from Arweave, on demand. This also extends to off-chain data, opening new possibilities for data availability and scalability.</p><p>We were joined by John Letey, founder and CTO of KYVE Network, to discuss the challenges and use cases of decentralised data storage and how blockchain interoperability could benefit from it.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  John’s background  Why KYVE migrated to a Cosmos app-chain  High-level explanation of KYVE  KYVE’s data pools and data streams  How KYVE connects to Arweave  Validating uploaded blockchain data  How Arweave works  KYVE v.2  How slashing is handled  KYVE use cases  Future roadmap  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/johnletey">John Letey on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/KYVENetwork">KYVE Network on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://www.kyve.network/">KYVE Network</a>  <a href="https://arweave.org/">Arweave</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p></p> Horizen EON brings EVM compatibility to the Horizen ecosystem and offers more opportunities for developers and web3 end users.&nbsp; 



 



 TL;DR 



 
 We are thrilled to announce today the launch of <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> (Ethereum Open Network), our first public proof-of-stake and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible smart contracting sidechain, on permanent public testnet <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/status/gobi">Gobi</a>.&nbsp; 
 Horizen partners with Immunefi to launch Gobi Bug Bounty Program to offer up to $75,000 in bounties 
 Gobi Testnet is supported by a network of products, integrations and tools that ensures the rich capability and user-friendliness for EON developers and end users, starting on day one.  
 Gobi Testnet has many improvements and new features since the previous testnets, it is the final beta stage before the EON mainnet activation later this year. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About Horizen EON and What Makes it Different? 
<p>While Ethereum has been driving broad adoption of DeFi ecosystems and smart contracts, Horizen has been developing its cross-chain protocol and horizontal scaling solution, <a href="https://horizen.io/zendoo">Zendoo</a>, that will allow a wider adoption of blockchain technology with full customization at the protocol level. </p>
<p>With the addition of EON, the first of many smart contracting sidechains on Horizen, Horizen is opening up its ecosystem to more opportunities for efficient development and usage of a wide range of dApps and services than ever before. Solidity developers will be able to deploy custom logic to the blockchain to enable continuous innovation without changing the protocol. </p>
<p>Coupling smart contracts with the custom blockchain nature of Zendoo and an intra-ecosystem secure bridging protocol, Horizen now offers a market-leading solution to drive the industry forward – a permissionless, interoperable, customizable sidechain network.</p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Horizen_EON_how-it-works.jpg"></a> 


 



 
  
  



 
<blockquote>
<p>“The launch of EON opens our doors to the Ethereum developer community and invites them to explore the vast possibilities that Horizen offers. </p>



<p>As we enter the final testnet phase, we’re eager to harness not just the existing Ethereum DeFi infrastructure but also connect it with the dynamic and interconnected Horizen ecosystem. This presents a unique opportunity to receive valuable feedback from both our longstanding users and new members, which will enable us to refine our offerings and create an even more seamless and user-friendly experience for all.”</p>
Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs</blockquote>
 
 



 Horizen Partners with Immunefi to Launch Gobi Bug Bounty Program to Offer Up To $75,000 in Bounties 



<p>Aiming to strengthen the security of the EON platform, accompanied with the Gobi testnet launch of EON, Horizen also partners with Immunefi to launch a bug bounty program of up to $75,000 in bounties for reporting vulnerabilities.</p>



 
  
  



 
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m proud of our team’s hard work building out the tech behind our public EVM. Our focus is on optimizing the advantages of smart contracts within the Horizen ecosystem by providing a smooth development process and user experience through a suite of tools and a range of integrations on EON. </p>



<p>In addition to our team’s efforts, we rely on the wider community to ensure the security of our platform. Therefore, we invite developers to participate in our Gobi bug bounty program to help us improve EON’s security.”</p>
Zain Cheng, CTO of Horizen Labs</blockquote>
 
 



 
  
  



 
<blockquote>
<p>“Immunefi is excited to collaborate with Horizen in launching their bug bounty program. This partnership showcases our shared commitment to security and excellence, empowering us to build a robust and trusted blockchain ecosystem together.” </p>
Mitchell Amador, CEO of Immunefi</blockquote>

 About Gobi Testnet 


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ZBF_Gobi-eon-roadmap.jpg"></a> 


<p>Prior to the launch of Gobi testnet, EON has been run on the invite-only testnet Dune and temporary public testnet Yuma. </p>
<p>Gobi Testnet is a permanent public testing environment for EON, with many improvements and new features added, it is the final beta stage before the EON mainnet activation later this year.&nbsp;</p>


 
 


 
 Non-ceasing sidechains 
 
<p>The Horizen mainchain verifies each sidechain and ensures its integrity.&nbsp; Non-ceasing sidechains makes the verification process more flexible and frictionless without compromising the security of the system.</p>
 
 Key rotation circuit 
 
<p>A SNARK-based security enhancement that gives a higher level of security and will allow for increased decentralization over time.</p>
 
 Secure key management 
 
<p>A security enhancement that gives the ability to sign transactions and certificates using keys that are not stored locally, that are instead in a separate trusted execution environment&nbsp;</p>
 
 Local EON client for building dapps&nbsp; 
 
<p>This can improve the dapp development process by allowing developers to test and iterate dapps more quickly locally before deploying on chain. Instructions is available on <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/docs/develop_and_deploy_smart_contracts/local_build_and_deploy">EON documentation</a></p>
 
 Websocket support 
 
<p>An alternative way of getting data, more suitable for dapps running a local client. Websocket creates a channel between server and client, and is ideal to receive notifications or new blocks as they arrive.</p>
 
 On-demand autoscaling RPC nodes 
 
<p>For improved scalability and user experience. Autoscaling allows the network to automatically increase the nodes as demand increases.</p>

<p>The Nym Rust SDK is now available, meaning devs can more easily integrate with the mixnet! The Nym mixnet puts the most advanced network privacy protections in the hands of developers to extend to their&nbsp;users.</p><p>When you integrate with the mixnet, you are offering your users protection for their IP addresses, as well as ensuring their network traffic is shielded from AI-driven metadata surveillance and large scale traffic analysis. In short, integrate with the mixnet to ensure your apps have default network level privacy, as it should&nbsp;be!</p><p>This is a pre-release, meaning it is not available on crates.io quite yet, but you can still import it from GitHub, so <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/sdk/rust.html">try it&nbsp;out</a>!</p> What is an SDK useful&nbsp;for? <p>The Nym SDKs make it far easier for developers to integrate mixnet functionality into applications by being able to import Nym clients as dependencies, just like any other dependency or a crypto library. What this means in practice is that clients can connect to and communicate with the mixnet as part of the app process, instead of having to run as a separate process alongside it. This makes for both far smoother development and user experiences.</p><p>What does this mean for people wanting to integrate with Nym? It means it’s now easier to integrate Nym mixnet functionality into your development environment. You will be able to build or integrate your web apps (with the already released Typescript SDK) and now also Rust applications. You no longer need to run a client as a separate process on your machine. And the SDKs provide far more intuitive interfaces with which to interact with the mixnet, meaning you can focus on the logic of your own app instead of constructing messages to send through the&nbsp;mixnet.</p> Which SDKs are available for&nbsp;Nym? <p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk/v/1.1.4">TypeScript SDK</a> is available and was announced in a previous <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-sdk-powerful-privacy-served-directly-to-your-browser-15c0919bdfbf">blog post</a>. This SDK allows users to import the Nym Webassembly client into browser-based application frontends, and has been updated and now has an example with parcel as a&nbsp;bundler.</p>  Coming soon: for NodeJS environment so you can use it in server environments as well as persistent identities / key&nbsp;storage.  <p>The <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/sdk/rust.html">Rust SDK</a> (pre-release) allows developers to embed either a Websocket or Socks5 client into applications to communicate with the mixnet. You can find examples&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/sdk/rust.html">here</a>.</p>  Coming soon: Nym Rust SDK tutorial!   Future SDK&nbsp;updates <p>Right now both SDKs allow devs to interact with the mixnet: send and receive messages, and create clients (the Rust SDK allows for persistent client identities / keypairs, the TS SDK will in a subsequent release). But there are many other features that will be supported once these are rolled out across the mixnet! Including the ability to create and use zk-nyms and sign and broadcast Nyx blockchain transactions and&nbsp;queries.</p><blockquote>Bring the power of a global mixnet to your app, dapp or&nbsp;wallet!</blockquote> What apps are already integrated with the Nym&nbsp;mixnet?   <a href="https://github.com/notrustverify/nostr-nym">Nostr over Nym</a> by <a href="https://pnproxy.org/">Pineapple Proxy</a>  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/tree/b13a58f439cab0e87062f0567896d8665d9c12a0/yarn-project/nym-gateway">Aztec connect</a> by&nbsp;<a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec</a>  <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/rust-libp2p-nym">Libp2p over Nym</a> — by <a href="https://chainsafe.io/">Chainsafe</a>  <a href="https://github.com/EdenBlockVC/spook">Ethereum RPC</a> by <a href="https://www.edenblock.com/">EdenBlock</a>  <a href="https://github.com/noot/nym-ethtx">Ethereum broadcaster</a> by&nbsp;noot  <a href="https://github.com/notrustverify/pastenym">Pastenym</a> by No Trust Verify (<a href="https://pastenym.ch/#/">try&nbsp;it</a>!)

<p>In our latest <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-monthly-update-january-2023/">monthly update</a>, we shared the user interface for zSwap, the very first use case for Panther’s DeFi Adaptors… and one of the most important features of Panther’s v1.<br></p><p>zSwap allows users to execute swaps on most liquid DEXs with a high degree of privacy. As such, it is the first piece of Panther’s plan to enable private access to DeFi from multiple fronts.<br></p><p>Let’s take a look at how it all works.<br></p> But first, what are DeFi Adaptors?<br> <p>One key component that will help realize Panther’s vision of private DeFi access is to develop plugins that are specific to existing protocols and connect them to Panther Pools (Panther’s private Multi-Asset Shielded Pools). This overall solution is referred to as DeFi Adaptors.<br></p><p>Each plugin enables zAssets (assets shielded in a Panther Pool) to interact with DeFi protocols by passing relevant values and function types, resulting in a seamless transaction flow while maximizing the benefits of both protocols for the user. Thanks to this system, users gain access to Panther’s zero-knowledge privacy without having to let go of the underlying security of the blockchain networks Panther is deployed on.<br></p><p>Panther’s catalog of DeFi Adaptors will be ever-expanding to interact with a broad range of DeFi dApps and protocols, starting with some of the ecosystem’s most popular applications –DEXs, NFT marketplaces, and lending/borrowing protocols. Each of these different interaction types will have a dedicated Adaptor and, as you will see below, the DeFi Adaptor dedicated to swapping assets through DEXs is called zSwap.</p>Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pools connect to DeFi dApps through custom plugins. The overall solution is what we refer to as “DeFi Adaptors.”<p>Since Panther’s vision is to give users the ability to access DeFi with full privacy, Adaptors play a key role in enabling them to break the on-chain link between their assets and their DeFi activity. Like Panther Pools, DeFi Adaptors will be debuted in Polygon at the release of Panther’s v1. If you want to learn more about zAssets and Panther Pools, please see this article.<br><br></p> How zSwap enables private swaps on popular DEXs <br> zSwap’s user interface.‌ ‌<p>The first use case for DeFi Adaptors, zSwap, is designed to facilitate swap transaction flow towards some of the most widely used protocols in the Polygon DeFi ecosystem –<a href="https://quickswap.exchange/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Quickswap</a>, <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap v3</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve</a>. This functionality is found within the “Swap” tab in Panther’s decentralized application (dApp).<br></p><p>zSwap features a user interface similar to those of the DEXs mentioned above for a familiar user experience. It also allows users to dictate the token IDs for the assets they want to sell/buy from a list of accepted assets (see below), enabling them to choose the specific swap pair they wish to trade. Users can also input the amount of the sell token they wish to trade, and the zSwap function will query an exchange rate based on these inputs and provide users with up-to-date values. This ensures that users can make informed decisions about their trades and optimize their transactions for the best possible outcome.<br></p><p>zSwap’s goal is to cater to a wide range of user types, including retail users, institutions, and market makers. At v1, zSwap will support the interaction with three different platforms, with the ability to highlight the best platform or “route” for users to conduct their swaps, allowing them to swap tokens at the most favorable rates and incur smaller fees.<br></p> Economic optimization of swapping opportunities<br> <p>zSwap uses advanced algorithms to identify the optimal routing path for the trade execution while allowing the user to choose other sub-optimal options if that is their preference. It provides an optimized user experience by automatically defaulting to the platform with the least price impact based on the trade variables that the user is wishing to execute. <br></p><p>Additionally, zSwap displays a calculation of the difference between the best available opportunity and the rest of them in terms of the price impact of each DEX (e.g. a trade could feature a 2% impact in Curve as opposed to a 0.3% on in Uniswap). In the future, zSwap might be expanded to support more DEX integrations to allow further diversity of asset flow and access to deeper liquidity.</p>zSwap screen, featuring the routing functionalities. How zSwap enables user privacy in DeFi <p>The ability for users to swap assets privately serves a double purpose: <br></p>  Allowing users to trade between all whitelisted assets available using the platforms above.  Contributing to the privacy that Pools provide to users holding assets within them. In other words, no one can link assets within the pool to specific users since they have the ability to swap assets and trade with one another within it, even if deposits/withdraws to the Pool itself are viewable by observers.<br><br>  Comparing Panther’s privacy to a typical transparent L1 blockchain when swapping assets.<p>The Panther DAO can propose assets for whitelisting at any time since whitelisting an asset requires a manual configuration. For the protocol’s first release, Panther will roll with the following assets:<br><br>Stablecoins:<br></p>  USDC  USDT  DAI  <p>Other tokens:</p>  wETH  wBTC  MATIC  CRV  LINK  <p>These tokens represent the largest DEX flow on Polygon and, as such, can aid Panther’s goal of bootstrapping its privacy through user activity. Further integrations can then be leveraged as activations on their own and help the protocol’s organic growth by engaging the communities associated with them.</p> User path<br> <p>The following scenario may help you understand how zSwap works in a practical setting.<br></p>  Alice wants to swap her ETH for USDC. As a privacy-conscious user, she already holds her ETH as zETH within Panther Protocol (ETH deposited into a Panther Pool, helping others in the process by increasing the Pool’s size and its mixture of assets). This grants her access to the privacy-preserving functionalities of zSwap. Alice then proceeds to the Swap page on the Panther dApp’s interface.  Alice navigates to the left side of the UI and chooses the selling token and an amount based on her historical deposits (for example, zETH). She then chooses the receivable token (for example, zUSDC.  zSwap automatically calculates the exchange rate between the sellable and receivable asset (e.g. 1750 zUSDC per 1 zETH) according to real-time market data from DEXs.  zSwap will automatically display the best swapping route identified, as well as the details of the swap. Alice can choose to expand the list of DEX routing options to compare the costs of using a different DEX and select it if she decides to do so.  After Alice finds a preferred option among all the DEX options available, she executes the transaction by pressing the Swap button.  Once her transaction successfully goes through, the newly deposited asset (in our example, USDC) is delivered to Alice as a zUSDC. Alice also gets rewarded for conducting a transaction on zSwap through Privacy Reward Points (PRPs), which reward users for increasing the anonymity rate of the Panther ecosystem. Should there be an issue that causes the transaction to fail at any step of the way, Alice’s asset balance would remain unchanged.   About Panther <p>Panther is a chain-agnostic privacy layer that allows users to access DeFi privately and compliantly, maintaining control of their transactional and historical data. Its users can execute transactions and deploy assets across DeFi. Panther’s <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/cryptographic-primitives">zero-knowledge primitives</a> are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p>Users access Panther’s privacy by depositing assets from different chains into <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/multi-asset-shielded-pools">Multi-Assed Shielded Pools</a> (MASPs or simply <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools">Shielded Pools</a>). Shielded Pools exist in different chains, interconnected by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/zbridges">zBridges</a>. Using <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors">DeFi Adaptors</a>, users can also deploy their assets into DeFi dApps/Protocols, or they can transact with and swap them privately within MASPs.Since Panther’s privacy is enabled by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/cryptographic-primitives">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, users can disclose any part or the whole of their transaction history to anyone at will. They can also choose to withdraw their assets from MASPs into stealth addresses. Panther also features <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals">ZK- and non-ZK Reveals</a>.</p>

<p>We’re back with all new editions of this newsletter, beginning with our just-released 2023 <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/series/state-of-crypto/">State of Crypto</a>. </p> 1. Data &amp; pulse checks: On the State of Crypto 2023&nbsp; <p>Daren Matsuoka, Eddy Lazzarin, Robert Hackett and Stephanie Zinn</p><p>It’s easy for a casual observer to overlook rapid progress in the crypto industry, especially given the noise of media headlines and fleeting price movements. But our State of Crypto report 2023 tracks the data, indicators, and signals that matter — revealing a steady cycle of development, product launches, and ongoing innovation. And this year, we also introduced the State of Crypto Index, a tool to track the health of the crypto industry from a technological, rather than financial, perspective. </p><p>The index represents the weighted average monthly growth of 14 industry metrics — also displaying, in a single chart, the rate of “innovation” and “adoption” of web3 — that offers a more nuanced measure for the state of crypto.&nbsp; The tool is also interactive, so anyone can tweak the parameters to form their own data views.</p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/state-of-crypto-report-2023/">see this post for 7 takeaways &amp; 55+ slides</a><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/stateofcrypto/">&nbsp;</a></p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/stateofcrypto/">explore the interactive index &amp; indicators</a></p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/QYgslufMJ4s">watch this video for a slide walk-through &amp; live discussion</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/state-of-crypto-trends-data-index-2023">listen to this new episode</a></p>  <p>…share on <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1645778427402928129">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7051548230962073600/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x5b3f2f">Farcaster</a>.</p> 2. Latest trends: applying zero knowledge to machine learning; minting NFTs in ‘waves’ to better build community <p>Elena Burger; Scott Duke Kominers and 1337 Skulls Sers</p><p>In past editions, we’ve shared a lot about <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/zero-knowledge-canon/">zero knowledge</a>, foundational technologies that hold the keys to blockchain scalability, represent the future of privacy-preserving applications, and more. But zero-knowledge proofs can also be useful in providing checks-and-balances on machine learning models and AI. Recently, there have been notable efforts in putting larger and more complex models on-chain — leveraging the ability of zero-knowledge proofs to succinctly represent and verify programs. <br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/checks-and-balances-machine-learning-and-zero-knowledge-proofs/">read more<br></a><a href="https://twitter.com/VirtualElena/status/1643648433100836864">share</a></p><p>In an NFT project, the mint largely determines who the community is and how they (and the broader market) view the project going forward. Since brands and projects need a secure mechanism that draws participation from the people they initially want, we review a new minting strategy called a “wave mint”, in which members of different NFT communities are invited to mint in a series of waves gradually expanding outwards. The wave mint design leverages people’s on-chain data and reputation to select for holders who are well matched to a project’s culture and goals; drives attention and energy to the project; and avoids common problems with “free” mints, like <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/nft-sales-market-clearing-gas-wars-auction-mechanism-design-for-builders/">gas wars</a> and bots.<br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/a-new-nft-launch-strategy-the-wave-mint/">learn more</a>&nbsp; <br><a href="https://twitter.com/skominers/status/1644044669142069253">share</a>&nbsp;</p> 3. Resources &amp; education: What marketers can learn from (or for) web3… and beyond <p>Amanda Cassatt, Kim Milosevich, and Sonal Chokshi</p><p>Whether you’re a marketer, community manager, or in developer relations — and are already in web3, OR are in traditional marketing simply seeking to learn the latest trends and tactics — this conversation is for you. In it, the author (who, among other things, was the first CMO at ConsenSys, helping bring Ethereum to market) of the <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Web3+Marketing%3A+A+Handbook+for+the+Next+Internet+Revolution-p-9781394171958">new book</a> Web3 Marketing: A Handbook for the Next Internet Revolution shares insights on how to do community marketing; how to manage individual brands/ profiles in open source communities; and how to find one’s audience and feedback for product-market fit.&nbsp;The discussion also covers metrics; hiring and managing marketing talent; and what it means to shift organizational mindsets from top-down, centralized control to decentralized, bottom-up collaboration.<br><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/marketing-comms-community-marketing-devrel-audience-growth-mindsets-tactics">listen here</a><a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/marketing-web3-audience-community-more"><br></a><a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1643987439734898689">share</a></p><p></p><p>If you enjoy reading <a href="https://a16zcrypto.substack.com/">these newsletters</a>, please be sure to forward it to others who are interested in going deeper on the future of the internet.

<p>Another major milestone in the Ethereum ecosystem was achieved yesterday with the Shanghai upgrade, or <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/03/08/goerli-shapella-announcement">Shapella</a>. This upgrade allows validators to withdraw ETH that have been staked (and the rewards earned from staking) from as far back as December 2020 — over $26 billion worth of ETH is potentially becoming&nbsp;liquid.</p><p>Now, the ideal outcome of such an event would be that some of this liquidity would go towards boosting decentralisation by encouraging more people to operate and stake on validators in underrepresented areas. At present, the vast majority of validators are run on AWS and in <a href="https://ethernodes.org/countries">US and&nbsp;Europe</a>.</p><p>Decentralisation is one of the core principles of Web3 and for good reasons: it can ensure censorship resistance and reliability of service globally. But decentralisation is not feasible unless we realise another core principle in Web3, namely privacy. Decentralised infrastructures require a high intensity of coordination between actors. If this takes place in open networks or through trusted third parties, this exposes the infrastructure — and importantly, those who run it — to a range of&nbsp;attacks.</p> Why Ethereum isn’t privacy-preserving <p>The Ethereum ecosystem achieved a monumental transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus algorithms last year. But with the move to POS, new privacy issues became evident and the very core of the blockchain, covered in an earlier <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/congratulations-on-the-merge-now-to-cure-the-hangover-with-a-strong-dose-of-privacy-c4b0c8eb46ea">blogpost</a>.</p><p>In summary, with the move to POS, validators need to coordinate on who creates the next block in the blockchain, which means more traffic between validators. This traffic can be analysed, compromising validator privacy opening the infrastructure up to attacks, from MEV Bots and DDoS attacks to targeted censorship. At this year’s ETHDenver, <a href="https://medium.com/nymtech/ethereum-was-never-designed-with-privacy-in-mind-d45039e5c692">privacy-focused discussions were at the forefront and on the main stage</a>, which signifies that the community strongly recognises the importance of privacy in the ecosystem.</p><p>In February 2023, <a href="https://decrypt.co/119370/ethereum-validators-hit-500000-ahead-scheduled-shanghai-upgrade">Ethereum hit the milestone of 500K validators</a>. This means that the consequences of the lack of validator privacy is only growing. In addition, <a href="https://metamask.io/news/latest/meta-mask-introduces-liquid-staking-in-dapp-for-an-easy-and-convenient-way-to-stake-eth/">Metamask recently launched a new staking functionality</a>, allowing users to stake their ETH using liquid staking protocols. If this leads to more people staking as well as more people running validators, it will exacerbate the privacy issues. And staking and operating from home for instance, could even entail people leaking their home IP addresses. Essentially, this is the same as someone finding out where you live, uncovering your salary slip, and then attaching it to your front door for all to&nbsp;see.</p> Deep privacy integrations for networked public&nbsp;goods <p>The good news is that as an industry we are making huge progress both when it comes to decentralisation and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The industry relies on a set of core public good technologies, and <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> is one of them. The Libp2p module has been nothing less than groundbreaking for decentralised networking. Developed by <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol labs</a>, it is a modular peer-to-peer networking framework that can run on across different network protocols. And this p2p networking framework is used in major blockchain ecosystems from IPFS, to Ethereum and Polkadot.</p><p>This is a huge win for decentralisation, but what about privacy? Libp2p is encrypted which is great, however, the patterns of communication running through the network remain exposed. And this can be almost more revealing than the content itself. This is where a mixnet such as the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym mixnet</a> comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>Nym <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-and-chainsafe-bring-enhanced-privacy-to-over-half-a-million-ethereum-validators-9792cbdedebd">recently partnered</a> with leading blockchain R&amp;D firm <a href="https://chainsafe.io/">Chainsafe</a> to build a <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/rust-libp2p-nym">Nym Libp2p module</a> for the Rust implementation of Libp2p. Clients and networking libraries such as Lighthouse (maintained by Chainsafe) can privacy-enhance traffic by sending it through the mixnet, shielding information that could doxx them from prying machine learning scraping. Solving the privacy problem at the core of major Web3 public goods can have a major impact across several ecosystems and more specifically, resolve the privacy issues for Ethereum validators, preventing the leaking of their IP addresses and metadata.</p><p>All new Ethereum validators should include this Nym integration module as part of their standard “starter&nbsp;pack”!</p> Privacy is your&nbsp;right <p>Everyone has their own reasons for wanting privacy. At the very least, leaking your home address on a blockchain is scary! And allowing people to see your personal ETH balance is unnecessary and making yourself vulnerable to attacks is dangerous.</p><p>A fully decentralised network needs network layer privacy for it to provide the benefits that are envisioned as part of the core principles of Web3. The industry is making progress when it comes to decentralisation and privacy, it is now time to put it into&nbsp;action.</p><p>Links</p>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/">Download Nym&nbsp;wallet</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/nodes/setup-guides.html">Run a mix&nbsp;node</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">Nym staking</a>  <p>Resources</p>  <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Mixnet explorer</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/">Nym docs</a>  <p>Languages</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@M.Quin/nym-libp2p-ethereumun-gizlilik-krizi-kamu-mallar%C4%B1yla-nas%C4%B1l-%C3%A7%C3%B6z%C3%BCl%C3%BCr-6bb2c777a8a2">Turkish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/nym-libp2p-comment-r%C3%A9soudre-la-crise-de-confidentialit%C3%A9-dethereum-avec-des-biens-publics-869f999804be">French</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/nym-libp2p-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%83-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-ethereum-%D1%81-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%89%D1%8C%D1%8E-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85-%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B3-5d939a0fb218">Russian</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-libp2p-how-to-solve-the-ethereum-privacy-crisis-with-public-goods-e2a4972bdf1c">Nym + Libp2p: how to solve the Ethereum privacy crisis with public goods</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have taken the world by storm in recent years. They have already shown to be usable for way more than their initial use cases in art. As a brand, you might be wondering if you should get in on the action and start using NFTs to represent and promote your products or services. Let’s take a look at why your brand should leverage NFTs and how various industries are already leveraging NFTs.</p>



 Why Your Brand Should Leverage NFTs 



<p>From shaking up the art world to tokenising real estate to improving customer loyalty programs. NFTs are widely usable, but most use cases rely on the general benefits of using NFTs. Here are a few reasons why your brand should leverage NFTs:</p>



 
 NFTs provide ownership and authenticity 



 NFTs can drive engagement and loyalty 



 NFTs can increase brand visibility and reach 



 NFTs can generate new revenue streams 
 



 Providing ownership and authenticity 



<p>One of the biggest benefits of NFTs is that they provide a unique, verifiable way for consumers to own and collect digital items. With an NFT, you can prove ownership and authenticity of a digital asset. Regardless of whether it is a piece of art, a virtual collectible, or even a digital product or service. This can be especially appealing to collectors and fans who value the exclusivity and rarity of certain items.</p>



<p>And with recent advances in technology, the thin line between the digital and physical world is also getting increasingly thinner. With <a href="https://beincrypto.com/top-luxury-fashion-brands-double-down-nfts-despite-2022-crypto-fallout/">luxury brands already using NFTs to combat counterfeit products and create digital </a>twins of physical products and liquor producers using <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2022/12/01/nfts-debut-with-interactive-gin-whiskey-and-fine-wine-projects-revolutionizing-the-spirits-industry/?sh=31c7553f7160">NFTs to guarantee the provenance of their products.</a></p>



 Driving engagement and loyalty 



<p>By using NFTs, you can create a sense of exclusivity and community among your most devoted fans and customers. For example, you could offer limited edition NFTs that are only available to a select group of loyal customers or fans. This can help drive engagement and loyalty. People will feel more invested in your brand if they have a unique and exclusive item that represents it.</p>



 Increasing brand visibility and reach 



<p>Using NFTs can also be a great way to increase the visibility and reach of your brand. By creating and promoting NFTs that are related to your products or services, you can tap into the growing community of NFT collectors and enthusiasts and expose your brand to a new audience.</p>



 Generating new revenue streams 



<p>NFTs can also be a useful way to generate new revenue streams for your brand. By selling NFTs related to your products or services, you can create a new avenue for revenue. This can be especially appealing in the digital world, where traditional ownership models can be more challenging.</p>



 The Risks and Pitfalls of Using NFTs 



<p>While everything seems to be in favour of the usage of NFTs, as with everything, there are also some risks and pitfalls that should be considered when using NFTs. The two foremost risks and pitfalls of using NFTs are fraudulent NFTs and the high volatility of NFT values.</p>



 Fraudulent NFTs 



<p>One risk of using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is the potential for fraud or misrepresentation. Since NFTs are often used to represent unique or rare items, it is possible for unscrupulous individuals to create fake or altered NFTs and sell them as genuine. This can result in significant financial losses for buyers who believe they are purchasing a valuable or authentic item.</p>



 High volatility of NFT values 



<p>Another potential pitfall of using NFTs is the volatility of their value. The value of NFTs can fluctuate significantly over time.  The indicated can depend on a variety of factors. Such include market demand, the perceived value of the underlying item, and the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. This means that the value of an NFT may increase or decrease significantly in a short period of time, leading to potential financial losses for holders.</p>



<p>Depending on how your brand uses NFTs, these risks/pitfalls do not have to be significant, though. A platform on which your NFTs could be bought/sold/attained could automatically filter out fake NFTs already, for example. Or if the value of your NFTs is tied to a certain physical asset or service, the value of the corresponding NFT tends to be less volatile. Nevertheless, it is good to be mindful of these risks and pitfalls.</p>



 NFTs in the ‘Real World’ 



<p>Before concluding the article, let’s take a look at some examples of how NFTs are being used in various industries. Examples are the hospitality industry, gaming industry, and politics!</p>



 NFTs in the hospitality industry 



<p>A loyalty program uses NFTs as a way to reward and engage customers. For example, a business could create an NFT that represents a certain level of loyalty, and offer it to customers who reach that level. Customers could then redeem the NFT for rewards, such as discounts, exclusive products, or early access to events. NFTs can also be used as a way to create a sense of community or exclusivity among customers, as they may be able to purchase and trade NFTs with each other.</p>







<p>Customers can also use NFTs as a way to offer unique experiences or rewards. For example, a hotel chain could create an NFT that represents an exclusive VIP package, which includes perks such as private check-in, room upgrades, and access to a special lounge. Customers could purchase the NFT and redeem it for the VIP package during their stay. NFTs could also be used to represent unique experiences. Namely, a private dinner with the chef or a guided tour of the city, which could be bought and sold by travellers. In this way, NFTs can provide a way for hotels and other hospitality businesses to offer highly coveted, one-of-a-kind experiences to customers.</p>



<p>For more information about NFTs in the hospitality industry read our article <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-hotels-customer-loyalty/">here!</a></p>



 NFTs for gaming 



<p>NFTs might be used in a variety of ways within the gaming industry. They can be used to represent in-game items or currency, such as weapons or armour, which can be bought and sold within a game. NFTs are brought into play to grant access to exclusive content, such as special levels or events. Additionally, game developers can use NFTs to create a sense of scarcity around certain in-game items, making them more valuable and sought-after by players.</p>



<p>Additionally, the creation of metaverses could prove to be another new realm of gaming. NFTs can really thrive by providing an easy way to own and trade items/property within the metaverse.</p>



 NFTs for politics 



<p>In the political realm, NFTs can be put to use as a tool for fundraising or campaigning. For example, a political candidate could create an NFT that represents a specific policy stance or campaign promise, and sell it to supporters as a way to fund their campaign. NFTs could also be used to represent digital collectibles related to political events or figures. These could be bought and sold by collectors. Additionally, NFTs could be used as a way to engage supporters and create a sense of community, as supporters could trade and collect NFTs related to the campaign or candidate. More information can be found <a href="https://zaisan.io/nfts-politics/">here.</a></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, NFTs can be a powerful tool for brands looking to increase ownership, authenticity, engagement, reach, and revenue in the digital world. If you’re considering using NFTs as part of your marketing strategy, it’s worth exploring the possibilities and seeing how they might fit into your overall branding and business goals.</p>

<p>San Francisco (USA), April 11th, 2023 – <a href="http://www.xrsi.org">XR Safety Initiative(XRSI)</a>, a 501(c)(3) global non-profit <a href="https://www.standardsportal.org/usa_en/sdo/xrsi.aspx">Standards Developing Organization (SDO)</a> promoting privacy, safety, security, and ethics in immersive and emerging technologies, is pleased to provide an update on its ongoing partnership with The Metaverse Standards Forum. Since joining as a Principal Member last year, XRSI has been working diligently to support the development of interoperability standards while providing privacy, safety, security, and ethics oversight for an open Metaverse.</p>



<p>XRSI’s founder and CEO, Kavya Pearlman, serves as the co-chair for the Forum’s Privacy, Cybersecurity &amp; Identity Exploratory Group, bringing her subject matter expertise and representing XRSI alongside Dr Louis Rosenberg, Chief Scientist at Responsible Metaverse Alliance and XRSI Global Technology Adviser. Their leadership in the group reinforces the need for strong privacy and security measures in the rapidly evolving Metaverse landscape.</p>



<p><a href="https://metaverse-standards.org/">The Metaverse Standards Forum</a>, hosted by the Khronos Group, brings together leading standards organizations and companies for industry-wide cooperation on identifying interoperability standards essential to building the open metaverse. Principal Members include Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Adobe, Google, Unity, HTC, and the World Web Consortium.</p>



<p>The Forum focuses on pragmatic, action-based projects such as implementation prototyping, hackathons, plugfests, and open-source tooling to accelerate the testing and adoption of standards, while also developing consistent terminology and deployment guidelines. This approach enables the Forum to coordinate requirements and resources to foster the creation and evolution of standards within standards organizations working in relevant domains.</p>



<p>Neil Trevett, President of the Khronos Group and chair of Metaverse Standards Forum, expressed his enthusiasm for XRSI’s involvement, stating, “We are truly excited to have Kavya Pearlman and XRSI join and co-chair the Privacy, Cybersecurity &amp; Identity Exploratory Group. Their expertise and commitment to privacy and security will be invaluable in shaping the future of the Metaverse. It’s an honor to work alongside such dedicated and knowledgeable professionals who are passionate about creating a safe and inclusive digital environment for everyone.“</p>



<p>Ensuring safety, privacy, and trust is vital for the successful digital transformation journey of governments, organizations, and individuals alike. In line with its mission, XRSI has recently published a standard definition of the Metaverse to provide a comprehensive understanding and foster collaborative efforts. According to XRSI, the Metaverse is “a network of interconnected virtual worlds with the following key characteristics: Presence, Persistence, Immersion, and Interoperability.” The full definition can be found here: <a href="https://xrsi.org/definition/the-metaverse">https://xrsi.org/definition/the-metaverse</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>XRSI calls on all key stakeholders, including privacy professionals, cybersecurity experts, security organizations, policymakers, technologists, and researchers, to join the Forum and the Privacy, Cybersecurity &amp; Identity (PCI) group to contribute to the development of robust standards for the Metaverse. Open standards enable consistency across multiple Metaverse implementations, and XRSI will contribute its knowledge to the overall Metaverse standards being worked on by The Metaverse Standards Forum and its members.</p>



<p>Let’s join forces to shape the next iteration of the internet. The future of the Metaverse needs every stakeholder to play their part, ensuring a safe, secure, and inclusive digital environment for all. By collaborating and sharing our collective expertise, we can pave the way for a Metaverse that not only revolutionizes the way we interact and connect but also upholds the highest standards of privacy, security, and ethics. Together, we can build a Metaverse that respects user rights, fosters innovation, and creates opportunities for everyone, regardless of their background or location. Join XRSI, the Metaverse Standards Forum, and other forward-thinking organizations in this mission to make the Metaverse a better, safer, and more inclusive space for generations to come.</p>



<p></p>



 How to Join Metaverse Standard Forum:&nbsp; 



<p>Hosted by the Khronos Group, the Forum membership is currently open to for-profit or nonprofit organizations, including companies, standards organizations, industry associations or universities at no charge via <a href="https://metaverse-standards.org/#contact">Metaverse Standards Forum Website</a>.</p>

  Generative AI Is Exploding. These Are The Most Important Trends To Know  <p>This year’s AI 50 list shows the dominance of this transformative type of artificial intelligence, which could reshape work as we know it.</p>   
	By Konstantine Buhler	 



Published April 11, 2023
  



 
<p>When we launched the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/">AI 50</a> almost five years ago, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/09/17/meritech-capital-konstantine-buhler-ai-decoded-evaluating-artificial-intelligence-startups/?sh=7238de797b78">I wrote</a>, “Although artificial general intelligence (AGI)… gets a lot of attention in film, that field is a long way off.” Today, that sci-fi future feels much closer.</p>



<p>The biggest change has been the rise of generative AI, and particularly the use of transformers (a type of neural network) for everything from text and image generation to protein folding and computational chemistry. Generative AI was in the background on last year’s list but in the foreground now.</p>



 The History of Generative AI 



<p>Generative AI, which refers to AI that creates an output on demand, is not new. The famous ELIZA chatbot in the 1960s enabled users to type in questions for a simulated therapist, but the chatbot’s seemingly novel answers were actually based on a rules-based lookup table. A major leap was Google researcher Ian Goodfellow’s generative adversarial networks (GANs) from 2014 that generated plausible low resolution images by pitting two networks against each other in a zero sum game. Over the coming years the blurry faces became more photorealistic but GANs remained difficult to train and scale.</p>



<p>In 2017, another group at Google released the famous Transformers paper, “Attention Is All You Need,” to improve the performance of text translation. In this case, attention refers to mechanisms that provide context based on the position of words in text, which vary from language to language. The researchers observed that the best performing models all have these attention mechanisms, and proposed to do away with other means of gleaning patterns from text in favor of attention.</p>



<p>The eventual implications for both performance and training efficiency turned out to be huge. Instead of processing a string of text word by word, as previous natural language methods had, transformers can analyze an entire string all at once. This allows transformer models to be trained in parallel, making much larger models viable, such as the generative pretrained transformers, the GPTs, that now power ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot and Microsoft’s newly revived Bing. These models were trained on very large collections of human language, and are known as Large Language Models (LLMs).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although transformers are effective for computer vision applications, another method called latent (or stable) diffusion now produces some of the most stunning high-resolution images through products from startups Stability and Midjourney. These diffusion models marry the best elements of GANs and transformers. The smaller size and open source availability of some of these models has made them a fount of innovation for people who want to experiment.</p>
 



<p> </p>







 
 Four trends in this year’s list 



<p>Generative AI Infrastructure: OpenAI made a big splash last year with the launch of ChatGPT and again this year with the launch of GPT-4, but their big bet on scale and a technique called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is only one of many directions LLMs are taking. Anthropic and their chatbot Claude use a different approach called Reinforcement Learning Constitutional AI (RL-CAI). The CAI part encodes a set of human-friendly principles designed to limit abuse and hallucination in the outputs. Meanwhile Inflection, a secretive startup founded by DeepMind’s Mustafa Suleyman and Greylock’s Reid Hoffman, is focusing on consumer applications.</p>



<p>And these are just the high-profile entrants on the closed source side. In the world of open source, Hugging Face has become the go-to platform for developers that want to train their own models or fine-tune existing ones. Along with Stability’s open source offerings, Hugging Face also hosts recent state of the art models like Facebook’s LLaMA and Stanford’s Alpaca.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Predictive Infrastructure: During the Gold Rush many individual prospectors went bust, but the people selling the picks and shovels made out just fine. This is why investors often focus on novel infrastructure companies during technology shifts. AI in its many forms is about prediction, so let’s call this new category predictive infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The largest of these infrastructure companies host the massive amounts of data needed for enterprise AI applications in a format that facilitates all sorts of data pipelines. Databricks has distinguished itself from Snowflake, a notable incumbent in the space, by being specifically designed for the needs of AI/ML data teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because data labeling, cleaning and other processes are so critical to model training, there are now four companies in this bucket on this year’s list: Coactive, Scale, Snorkel and Surge, up from just one last year (Scale). Two other new entrants to the AI 50, MosaicML and Weights &amp; Biases, specifically help AI practitioners train and fine-tune models. Arize and Hugging Face also make it easy to deploy models at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generative AI Applications: Midjourney and Stable Diffusion benefited from their virality on social media, planting generative AI in the center of popular culture. Then ChatGPT captured the world’s attention and became the fastest product to attain 100 million users. While Google played catch up with its Bard chatbot, Neeva became the first generative AI-native search engine.</p>



<p>Since LLMs were primarily designed to generate text, generative writing apps are a fast-growing category. Two of these applications are on this year’s list: Jasper, which uses GPT-4 to help marketing copywriters, and Writer, which has trained its own proprietary model and is focused on enterprise use cases. As language models have become more capable, they are able to handle more complex applications, like legal text. Harvey is using GPT-4 to do associate level legal work at law and other professional services firms, while Ironclad has automated many contract processes for in-house legal teams.</p>



<p>Generative AI is inherently creative, so it’s natural to see a lot of innovation in other creative fields. Runway generates, edits and applies effects to video that met the quality bar for the Oscar-winning team behind Everything Everywhere All at Once. Descript focuses on both podcast and video workflows, using generative AI to make the editing process less laborious. ChatGPT, Bing and Bard are general purpose chatbots, but crafting bespoke chatbots is a nascent creative space powered by Character.AI, founded by one of the authors of the original Transformer paper, Noam Shazeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making Powerpoint decks is as close as many people get to being creative at work, but new generative AI apps like Tome make it easy to design beautiful presentations that bring your ideas to life with only text prompts. Another take on work productivity comes from Adept, which has built an action model, ACT-1, that’s trained on how people interact with their computers. Its goal is to eventually automate some of the searching, clicking and scrolling you have to do now to get tasks done.</p>



<p>Predictive AI applications: Another useful way to use AI’s predictive power is to detect anomalies and then find ways to mitigate them. Abnormal Security, for instance, analyzes a company’s cloud email environment to identify phishing attempts and other threats and remove malicious emails. On the medical front, Viz.ai quickly surfaces patient imaging that should be reviewed by a specialist, and coordinates the care team to improve outcomes for patients with stroke and other time-sensitive conditions.</p>



 On AI’s horizon 



<p>By the time next year’s list rolls out, I believe generative AI and LLMs will still be dominant. But the landscape is changing quickly and there are big opportunities for companies that can move with it. Here are three things to look out for in the coming year:</p>



 
 The Infrastructure layer is very “fat,” with the biggest companies currently in the space offering models and cloud services. This will change as companies building applications learn how to capture value. 



 LLM usage will mature with some companies strongly favoring buying AI models from cloud APIs and others just as passionately wanting to build their own. Many have predicted that startups will graduate from APIs to their own smaller, more efficient models as they grow. Companies with large and unique data stores will see clear advantages to training their own models as moats. Bloomberg’s recent announcement of their bespoke LLM, which is focused on financial language processing, is a great case in point. 



 The fast but far-sighted will survive as this wave of AI unleashes massive societal changes. The ability to adapt, pivot and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities will be key. Because this technology has huge potential to transform work, the only constant will be change.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Generative AI has turned many assumptions on their head. In the early days we thought AI would replace manual work, but robotics turned out to be harder than some parts of cognitive knowledge work. And, equally surprising, the approximate nature of generative models makes them better than expected at creative work and less than completely trustworthy on rote, mechanical tasks.&nbsp;<br>Achieving artificial general intelligence, that futuristic self-learning system that some fear could threaten humanity, is still a moving target. But there can be no doubt that the progress of large language models over the past year has been transformative—and their applications increasingly general. We’re seeing new use cases every day that demonstrate how AI will change <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-for-work-perspective/">the way we work</a>, create and play.</p>

<p>On Saturday 18th March, the Zcash Foundation (ZF) co-hosted its first-ever <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcon-voices/">Zcon Voices</a> event.&nbsp; Zcon Voices: Brazil was held at the Museu do Amanhã in Rio de Janeiro, and welcomed 60+ attendees from across the great country of Brazil. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12GQtO1ULyCzPMblTQrRtRaWRmXcHTRky?usp=sharing">View the event photo album</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1640115789557641216?s=20">this video</a> for a glimpse of the day.</p>



<p>ZF’s event series, Zcon Voices, aims to provide a platform for regional-specific conversation and education about strong use cases for Zcash and financial privacy. Zcon Vozes Brasil was contextualized and organized by our amazing Zcash Brazil team and was presented mainly in Portuguese, with a few Spanish-speaking presenters as well. The event focused on current opportunities in the cryptography and privacy world and challenges in these areas specific to Brazil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Zcash Brazil team was led by former global ambassador <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/u/michae2xl/summary">Michae2xl</a> and, together with ZF staff, executed a professional, thoughtful, and inspiring event (this event was in addition to Zcash Brazil’s <a href="https://zcashgrants.org/gallery/25215916-53ea-4041-a3b2-6d00c487917d/34622050/">ZCG grant</a>). This collaboration created a safe place for open dialogue and fostered thought-provoking discussions. For example, Zcon Vozes Brasil speaker João (Pizza Jay) said, “Privacy loves company” while talking to friends and attendees at lunch.&nbsp; Michael wrote, “…The Zcash Foundation has been instrumental in creating a medium for the community to come together and discuss the latest developments in the Zcash space and privacy.”</p>



<p>The event’s success was due to the speakers’ contributions as well. The content varied from privacy in centralized and decentralized exchanges and DAOs to the flaws with the governance of cryptography. Speakers kept the audience engaged and motivated—so much so, positive conversations and questions were heard throughout the breaks and cocktail reception and rippled into <a href="https://twitter.com/MP_Lustosa/status/1638224375999610881?s=20">social media outlets afterward</a>. In addition, we were privileged to have Brazil’s-own Isabela Fernandes, Executive Director of Tor, close out the one-day conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With support from the AV Club, ZF provided AV equipment and instruction, enabling the event to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Bu77m6IDACk?feature=share">live-streamed and translated</a>. To learn more about the details of the Zcon Voices live stream, you can check out the most recent <a href="https://youtu.be/5j8qMop7IsI">ZF A/V Club Meetup</a>, where they broke down the setup. This donated equipment will be used for future events Team Zcash Brazil will host, in cities like Rio and São Paulo, enabling the team to share their local events with the world.</p>



<p>Finally, ZF would like to thank the organizers, speakers, attendees, and vendors who helped make this event a huge success and strengthened the credibility of Zcash.</p>



<p>Zcash Brazil team leader, Michae2xl, reflected, “This Zcon Vozes Brasil event brings a lot of significant values post-event.&nbsp; For example, it brings credibility, more voice, and more doors open to collaborating with speakers, other projects, and spaces. ”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The energy from Zcon Voices Brazil caused a sound wave heard in Brazil and across the world!</p>

<p>Today we’re pleased to formally announce a new partnership with <a href="https://bonfida.org/">Bonfida</a>, the creators of Solana Name Service (SNS), to enable native resolution of SNS names in the Brave browser and Wallet.&nbsp;</p>

 Solana Name Service: An identity system for the Web3 era 
<p>SNS is an identity system aimed at making the use of Web3 more natural for the general public. SNS names are like usernames, Web domains, and email addresses all wrapped into one. The idea behind SNS is to map a public Solana address (like VapRHFYaeTo2NY1m2o9QV8yY8E6yCqBECtYAgHUyQjb) to a human-readable name (like david.sol)—making it easier to use crypto in daily life. SNS names are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that, once purchased and stored in a self-custody wallet like Brave Wallet, are entirely owned and controlled by the buyer.</p>

 Uses of SNS in Brave Browser and Wallet 
<p>SNS support in Brave is available today on all platforms of Brave across desktop, iOS, and Android (version 1.49). The integration of SNS into Brave provides users with a simplified experience for sending and receiving Solana (SOL) and SPL tokens. With SNS names mapped to Solana addresses, users can now send and receive crypto using easy-to-remember names, making it easy to identify and organize their personal wallets. This reduces the risk of mistyped addresses and accidental loss of funds. To send crypto with SNS, simply type in the .sol address of the person or organization you wish to send funds to. If the domain has been mapped to an address, Brave Wallet will automatically fill it in below the name.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>In addition to simplifying transactions in Brave Wallet, the integration of SNS into Brave also allows users to visit decentralized SNS domains in the Brave browser. Visiting a .sol domain is as easy as visiting any standard .com or .org site. This opens up new possibilities for hosting censorship-resistant websites that are more resilient than traditional Web 2.0 sites—but still just as accessible. By <a href="https://docs.bonfida.org/collection/using-sns/resolving-websites-with-sns">hosting content on IPFS</a>, which is also supported natively in Brave, websites can be more robust against censorship.</p>

 Getting an SNS name 


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>SNS names can be purchased from Bonfida directly, or on secondary marketplaces like <a href="https://magiceden.io/">Magic Eden</a>. Whether you use your SNS name to point to a website, more easily transact with crypto, or to create and access profiles on decentralized social media platforms, SNS provides a simple and straightforward solution. To date, Bonfida has sold over 220,000 domains, integrated with 60 partners, and has plans to expand the reach of SNS to other blockchains.</p>

 Learn more about crypto DNS in Brave and Brave Wallet 
<p>The addition of SNS builds upon Brave’s existing crypto-DNS strategy outlined in an <a>earlier blog post</a>, which details principles we commit to following while resolving domain names, and expands on the types of crypto domains supported in Brave.</p>
<p>To learn more about Brave Wallet, visit <a>brave.com/wallet/</a>. If you’re already a Brave user, you can get started by selecting Brave Wallet from the main menu, or by clicking the Wallet icon in the navigation bar.</p>

The process is usually done off-exchange, meaning that trades do not appear on public stock exchanges.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Dark pools</a> provide liquidity and allow institutional “whales” to complete large trades without disrupting the regular stock markets. It is estimated that at least <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/shedding-light-dark-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">18% of all stock trades in the United States</a> (and as much as 40%) take place in them. In terms of dollar amount, this means hundreds of billions of dollars.<br></p><p>Despite<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=Critiques%20of%20Dark%20Pools,can%20hide%20conflicts%20of%20interest."> criticism</a> for creating an uneven playing field, allowing institutional investors to bypass public markets and execute trades off-exchange, dark pools remain popular with investors who value the privacy, liquidity, and pricing advantages they offer. And they could very well be what the new financial paradigm needs to take off.<br></p> New Finance’s greatest problem<br> <p>As the go-to investment vehicle for big fish in the financial industry, dark pools have evolved over the years to offer a variety of trading protocols and investment options, such as algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading. While the regulations governing dark pools continue to evolve, the role they play in institutional investment strategies will doubtlessly remain significant.<br></p><p>On the opposite corner of finance, the promise of transparency, security and true user autonomy have led Decentralized Finance protocols to grow by leaps and bounds. Nonetheless, DeFi protocols also face their fair share of challenges, including barriers to institutional and enterprise adoption.<br></p><p>The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/total-value-locked-in-defi-surpasses-50-billion-mark-for-first-time-since-ftx-collapse/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">total value locked in DeFi protocols is current</a>y <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/total-value-locked-in-defi-surpasses-50-billion-mark-for-first-time-since-ftx-collapse/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">around $50 billion</a>, yet the amount of institutional money invested in the cryptocurrency sector <a href="https://decrypt.co/118425/crypto-investment-falls-95-percent-to-433-million-2022?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">dropped 95% to $433 Million in 2022</a> (a low since 2018), a stark contrast to the trillions invested in the traditional sector. <a href="https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/sites/default/files/documents/2022_Institutional_Investor_Digital_Assets_Study.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#page=15">According to recent studies</a>, institutions cite price volatility, security and regulatory concerns as reasons why they hesitate to step into DeFi, despite <a href="https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/insights/all-insights/digital-asset-survey.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">91% of institutional investors reportedly being interested in investing in tokenized assets.</a><br></p><p>These same investors also report concerns about the reputation risk associated with DeFi protocols. Given the numerous hacks and exploits in the DeFi space, institutions are worried about the potential damage to their brand should they suffer losses as a result of investing in DeFi.<br></p> And yet, enterprise and institutional capital can doubtlessly benefit from DeFi<br> <p>Even if the risks and volatility are high, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-institutional-defi-and-how-can-banks-benefit?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=DeFi%20would%20bring%20the%20execution,can%20be%20realized%20at%20scale.">established capital stands to benefit from DeFi in a myriad of ways</a>. For one, DeFi protocols create a 24/7 access to almost 100% liquid capital as well as access to an array of decentralized and fully democratized financial services. As an example, DeFi protocols have unlocked <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/yield-farming/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">over $5 billion in liquidity pools</a> through <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-yield-farming-the-rocket-fuel-of-defi-explained/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">yield farming</a>, a strategy not available in traditional finance. <br></p><p>Although the potential upside remains high, regulatory ambiguity makes investing in DeFi over a medium to long-term a daunting project. However, there is a possibility to capitalize on the opportunity for growth and innovation. The DeFi ecosystem is growing at an unprecedented rate, new projects are launched every day, there is a growing trend towards privacy and scalability in the blockchain scene and, above all things, these solutions are composable with one another, enabling multiple automation scenarios.<br></p> Decentralized dark pools <br> <p>A middle-of-the-road solution that both DeFi and traditional players (like <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/onyx/documents/Institutional-DeFi-The-Next-Generation-of-Finance.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">JP Morgan</a>) are starting to recognize lies in the zero-knowledge realm.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-dark-pool-trading-platforms.asp?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Decentralized dark pools</a> operated by compliant entities can become the crossing point on the Venn diagram that bridges institutional capital into DeFi. Thanks to the advances in zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, they can ensure security, privacy, and meet all regulatory requirements to become a comprehensive solution.<br></p><p>ZKPs enable data verification without revealing any information about the input or output data. This makes them ideal for ensuring privacy and security in decentralized dark pools, where participants can trade anonymously without revealing their identities or transaction details. Furthermore, these pools can be configured to interact with DeFi protocols to send assets back-and-forth. In other words, institutions can trade crypto and digital assets privately, securely, and without anyone being able to surveil their activity, but retaining the ability to showcase their history to comply with regulations. </p> The advantages of on-chain dark pools<br> <p>Pairing the above with true decentralization and DeFi’s endless composability potential, it is also possible to see an underlying layer of transactions being used by multiple operators. Such a setup can serve many functions, including:</p>  Separating the liability of operators from that of the protocol. In such a case, if any operator were to be deemed irresponsible and its funds blacklisted, users of other operators could continue undisturbed.  Flexibility at an operator level. Different operators with different risk profiles or different target markets could follow different rules. For example, a given operator could provide open access to all users with a certain transaction limit, while others would be KYC-only.  Benefits to users’ privacy regardless of their operator. Perhaps the greatest possibility is that, if the distinction between operators is sufficiently clear while sharing the same protocol, all users will benefit from the same privacy. This can only happen due to zero-knowledge’s other immediate application, blockchain scalability, which continue to showcase the incredible potential of this technology, whether it is for institutional dark pools, zkEVMs, zk-rollups, or other applications.  <p>The promise of decentralized dark pools is the perfect scenario for institutions to onboard into DeFi en masse. Without the limitation of fully public order books and complete access to DeFi’s opportunities and the ability to perform large trades without network congestion and MEV attacks affecting them, growth will become inevitable as enterprise and institutional capital finally finds its way to decentralized finance.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a chain-agnostic privacy layer that allows users to access DeFi privately and compliantly.

<p>AI algorithms are built on the past two decades of intensive mass-surveillance. And yet, when trying out the latest new models like stable diffusion and GPT-4 many of us nevertheless find them to be awesome. So where do we go from&nbsp;here?</p><p>AI is everywhere lately, but has a less famous sibling in the world of digital technology namely cryptography, that can unlock more socially embedded forms of artificial intelligences (yes, in plural) by placing the power to decide in the hands of people. Strong privacy protections holds the keys to truly revolutionising AI from a societal perspective.</p><p>It is time to privacy-pill the AI debate. And it goes a little something like&nbsp;this…</p> 1 Enhancing privacy in&nbsp;AI <p>AI algorithms are essentially statistics on steroids. They calculate statistical probabilities on large data sets, which means they need large volumes of data in order to calculate more accurately what the next word in a sentence might be, the next pixel in an image, the next movement in a moving image and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Where does all this data come from? So far, this huge appetite for data has been mostly fed by decades of digital surveillance. In this sense, AI is a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0263276411417430?journalCode=tcsa">data derivative</a>. In fact, as it is today, AI is a <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/signals-new-president-messaging-apps-long-term-sustainability/">surveillance derivative</a>. From scraping of public LinkedIn and Twitter data, to the far more ethically dubious use of <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300264630/atlas-of-ai/">prison mugshots</a> to train facial recognition algorithms, even supposedly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artist-finds-private-medical-record-photos-in-popular-ai-training-data-set/">private medical records</a> have cropped up in these vast data sets. AI has been built on a digital industry fuelled by involuntary datafication of us&nbsp;all.</p><p>The issue of privacy is starting to crop up in the debates on AI. But there is a danger that advanced cryptography and privacy tech will be used to “privacy wash” otherwise harmful AI. Differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation can help protect sensitive data and maintain individual privacy while still allowing for AI training. This means individual people can maintain their privacy while nevertheless allowing us to develop AI models. However, this raises an important question: is it not still surveillance if your data is read by a&nbsp;machine?</p><p>The answer is yes. Even if an individual’s privacy is protected, when their data is fed to AI algorithms, this can and will contribute to systems of mass surveillance and control. <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/feature/a-relational-theory-of-data-governance">Protecting an individual’s privacy is not enough</a> because their encrypted data can train an AI that could go on to be used to enhance the surveillance and control of others elsewhere.</p><p>But it does not have to be that way. Securing privacy by default across communications is the first step towards tipping the balances of power when it comes to AI. End-to-end encryption, mixnets as well as zero-knowledge proof cryptography all contribute to radically reducing the amount of personal data gathered and sold by unaccountable companies. Strong privacy protections is the first step towards tipping the balances of power in favour of ordinary people, paving the way for meaningful consent and the ability to withdraw&nbsp;it.</p> 2 Paving the way for Consensual AI <p>Consensual AI is a term coined by artists Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst who have been developing tools to make it a reality in practice: with their group <a href="https://spawning.ai/">Spawning</a>, they set up the project “have I been trained” where artists can search large open datasets for their images and request to opt out. This is in partnership with <a href="https://laion.ai/faq">LAION</a>, a non-profit large-scale image datasets.</p><p>In the case of Spawning, the emphasis is on revoking consent after the fact. But going forward, privacy enhancing techniques such as selective disclosure scheme(including <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">zk-nyms</a>), as well as secure federated learning can empower consensual practices in advance, and enable people to securely share data on their own terms. Data can even be processed on distributed devices without leaving their local storage, allowing multiple entities to collaborate on a common goal without sharing sensitive data. Such techniques can pave the way for active, consensual contribution to AIs by ordinary people, communities and groups, rather than being bought and sold in obscure data&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Privacy technologies secure the possibility for meaningful consent in data and AI. There are already a few flourishing projects that are actively working to ensure that the development of AI is an <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/ethics-soc-3">open</a>, consensual and <a href="https://cip.org/s4d">democratic process</a>. But the ability to decide about data is not just about consent, it is also about who gets to determine what kind of AI is being trained in the first&nbsp;place…</p> 3 Enabling sovereignty and decentralisation <p>Data, data sets and AI are not neutral. The creation and recording of data always entails a perspective about what matters in the world, whether and how it should be recorded. A few years ago an important <a href="https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/986506/7/Indigenous_Protocol_and_AI_2020.pdf">position paper</a> on Indigenous AI was published by The Initiative for Indigenous Futures and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR). The authors discuss how AI might serve the specific worldviews and epistemologies of indigenous people from Aotearoa, Australia, North America, and the Pacific. Practical uses included <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/22/1050394/artificial-intelligence-for-the-people/">reviving near-extinct languages and amplifying worldviews</a>. The implications of this Indigenous AI report are relevant for anyone interested in AI. Importantly, it highlights how AIs are in fact plural, in the sense that its real potential is in the many ways data and algorithms can be used to amplify a kaleidoscope of meaning and intelligences.</p><p>OpenAI, in their recent release of GPT-4, compares its capabilities to human capabilities: “while less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.” The US bar exam was one of the benchmarks used to assess the performance of GPT-4. Its training has been heavily weighted towards the English language and US culture, humour, legal framework and habits. In other words a specific culture and set of tasks. There is no universal “artificial intelligence” in competition with a universal “human”. The cultural habit of framing the debate as a competitive race between “humans” and “machines”is a deeply disappointing and destructive habit for a set of technologies that have far more interesting potential — if we just get this right. The real question here is not whether AI works like a human or not, but rather <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/2023-landscape">who it works&nbsp;for</a>.</p><p>The ability to discern what does or does not matter is exactly what makes AI work, and this is a deeply cultural and situated question that should be under the sovereign decisions of the people affected. Cryptographic techniques for enabling effective data governance and verification are therefore essential so that people can actively participate in deciding what should matter or&nbsp;not…</p> 4 Preventing mis/disinformation and deep-fakes <p>Cryptographic proofs and verification techniques can be used to verify the accuracy and source of information. And this becomes increasingly important for enabling sovereignty of knowledge and information by people in the face of a dominant culture. It is also essential for secure verification of information. Chelsea Manning <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-can-be-defeated-with-cryptography-says-chelsea-manning-at-sxsw">recently pointed out in an interview</a> that AI tools are unleashing a whole new set of problems from mis/disinformation and deep-fakes. There are cases where GPT-4 has essentially invented fictions based on entirely unverified datasets (that even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/05/chatgpt-lies/">led to false stories</a> with severe personal consequences). AI models are “dumb” in the sense that they simply draw on data, and are unable to discern or engage with whether something is true and real or&nbsp;not.</p><p>Communities like <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> are already emerging around curating, labelling and sharing open datasets and collaborating on models. Public blockchains can contribute to such efforts by providing untamperable ledgers of verified data&nbsp;, as well as consensus mechanisms for adding the data to the ledger. People can thereby take part in shaping their shared records of truth and have a say in how AI is trained — through whichever governance methods serve them best: new forms of DAOs, guilds or modernized libraries? Because let’s face it, these are collective issues and not something that individual people have time for in their day-to-day lives.</p> 5 Protecting the freedom to be different — the cypherpunk perspective <p>What is at stake in the future of AI is nothing less than the freedom to be different and not subject to a centralised understanding of what matters in the world. In the late 1980s and 1990s the cypherpunk subculture already foresaw a future where the internet would become a vehicle for mass surveillance and centralised control. A less appreciated aspect of this cypherpunk premonition is its positive contribution by advocating for privacy as enabling the possibility to be different.</p><p>The idea of “AGM” or “Singularity” draw on totalitarian fantasies of deferring authority to some centralised machinic intelligence. And these fantasies lead quickly to deranged justifications about why some humans deserve to survive a future with AI and others not. (In fact, computer scientist <a href="https://abebabirhane.com/">Abeba Birhane</a> has <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/ai-weekly-ai-phrenology-is-racist-nonsense-so-of-course-it-doesnt-work/">written extensively</a> about how AI/AGM has revived the racist pseudoscience of phrenology, again repackaging it as scientific and universal claims). Without privacy, the statistical tyranny of AI will turn anomalies into targets, leading to oppressive systems of manipulation and&nbsp;control.</p><p>As it stands, it is impossible to know whether your data is feeding medical research, click-baiting, racist “predictive policing” or drone strikes. The nature of mass surveillance and AI is that it is collective and relational. Your data is calculated in relation to other people’s data in order to find probabilities and norms in ways that are usually quite hard to trace. For this reason, AI has to be addressed collectively and include privacy as the default for all communications. Only then can people make meaningful decisions about how their data should be used. Privacy enhancing tech protects the freedom to be different and can revolutionise AI by decentralising the power to decide on its development — in the process unlocking a kaleidoscope of intelligences.</p>  Tune in to Chelsea’s Manning’s keynote on AI and Privacy — Monday the 10th at <a href="https://www.talent-land.mx/en/home/">TalentLand, Mexico</a>  Join the Nym masterclass on AI and privacy — WebSummit in Rio in May <a href="https://zealy.io/c/nymportugus-6948/">Win&nbsp;tickets</a>!  <p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@M.Quin/gizlilik-teknolojisinin-yapay-zekada-devrim-yaratmas%C4%B1n%C4%B1n-be%C5%9F-yolu-4a27cee772d5">Turkish</a></p> Learn more <p>Watch</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7KVLGIukBEA">Privacy, the big&nbsp;picture</a>  <p>Read</p>  <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-can-be-defeated-with-cryptography-says-chelsea-manning-at-sxsw">AI can be defeated with cryptography</a>  <a href="https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/986506/7/Indigenous_Protocol_and_AI_2020.pdf">Indigenous AI</a>  <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/2023-landscape">AI Now 2023 Landscape report</a>  <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/feature/a-relational-theory-of-data-governance">A relational theory of data governance</a> Viljoen, S.&nbsp;2022  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921000155">Algorithmic Injustice: a relational ethics approach</a> Birhane, A.&nbsp;2021  <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/3992/Raw-Data-Is-an-Oxymoron">Raw data is an oxymoron</a> Gitelman, L.&nbsp;2013   Join the Nym community <p>Join the conversation on Nym community channels:</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p><a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/five-ways-privacy-tech-can-revolutionise-ai-590db82ec0ab">Five ways privacy tech can revolutionise AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe’s breakthroughs prove persistence pays off.      



 
<p>A stubborn streak runs through Anne Wojcicki’s family. She traces this back to her great-grandmother, a talented singer who spent all her money going to the opera in Tsarist St. Petersburg. Wojcicki makes this out to be an all-consuming obsession: nothing could stop Leah Srubinsky from blowing the conjugal nest egg to watch people unload their lungs on stage.</p>



<p>“Her relatives finally said, ‘enough! The only way to stop you is to move to Siberia,’” Wojcicki says during an interview at her hillside home on the outskirts of Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>Pressed on whether her family had really moved all the way to Siberia because of opera, she insists it’s true. “Apparently the only way to control that DNA was total isolation,” she laughs.</p>



<p>As anyone who has taken grade-school biology knows, 23 pairs of chromosomes populate most cells in the human body; DNA and the four letters that comprise it—A, T, G and C—form the building blocks of life. Wojcicki, founder of pioneering DNA testing company 23andMe, sees much of the world—stubbornness included—through the lens of genetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You have genes and you have environment,” Wojcicki says, reclining on her balcony in the casual garb that has long defined her personal style—puffy jacket, workout shorts and Crocs. “Your environment is always going to play a huge influence, but I do believe you’re born in certain ways.”</p>



<p>Wojcicki herself was born in a certain way, with the kind of background that someone who believes in fate could easily see as charting her future in advance. The product of a Polish Catholic father and Russian Jewish mother (she of the opera-loving stock), Wojcicki grew up in a household that respected tradition and prioritized connecting with one’s roots. Stories passed down about the trials her family endured during Europe’s mid-century conflicts fostered her fascination with “what-ifs” and alternate paths her forebears could have taken.</p>



<p>“Most of the people on my father’s side were farmers, but my grandfather was a ‘breakaway child’,” she says. “He managed to get an education and became a judge. Then he entered politics, and eventually became Secretary of the Polish People’s Party. He resisted Communism to the point that he was sent into prison, and later house arrest. While his wife and son—my father—were able to escape and come to America, my grandfather never managed to leave his home country.” While discussing this episode, she emphasizes the “random people” who helped her grandfather obtain an education in his youth, contrasting his lucky break against the zillion possible lives he could have led but didn’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details of this story came to life when Wojcicki visited Poland during a gap year between high school and college, before starting a career that would see her race to the frontiers of DNA-based biotech. 23andMe has, since its founding in 2006, helped more than 13 million people uncover details about their backgrounds and <a href="https://www.dataminingdna.com/who-has-the-largest-dna-database/">amassed</a> the second-largest genetic database of any company in the world. Wojcicki believes that big data can help solve the mysteries of DNA, but in both her Poland experience and a later backpacking trip to old family stomping grounds in Siberia, she connected most deeply with the small things: the sights, sounds and smells that shaped her ancestors.</p>



<p>“I was interested in a level of detail that wasn’t just surface,” she says. “I wanted to imagine myself living in those places.”</p>



<p>The Siberia expedition especially was a trip back in time: Wojcicki rode a train across the steppe, looking to emulate the horseback travel her ancestors had to resort to in order to escape the pogroms that saw countless Russian Jews killed or forced into exile. During this expedition, the voices of her grandparents echoed in her head, their upbringings already half-formed in her mind.</p>



<p>“I find that people, as they get older—especially when they’re closer to dying—start telling stories about their childhoods,” she says. “It was really interesting to see those come to life.”</p>



<p>This episode helped plant the seed for 23andMe’s mission. It occurred during the recession of the early 2000s, when Wojcicki, who had been working as an investor, needed to “totally detox from the Wall Street world.” Ironically, it was her early foray in finance that exposed her to the concept of health as business. Employed by the Wallenbergs, a wealthy Swedish family that ran a startup fund, she worked on their biotech portfolio, dabbling in exotic fields like xenotransplantation—inserting organs from animals (usually pigs) into humans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I was fascinated by questions of what you’re born with versus what you gain from your experiences.”</p>

<p>It was genes, however, that most enthralled her. “I was always super interested in twin studies—looking at how twins raised in different environments differ and overlap in various aspects of their lives,” she says. “I was fascinated by questions of what you’re born with versus what you gain from your experiences.”</p>



<p>In 2006 Wojcicki turned her need to answer these questions into 23andMe. The <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project">mapping</a> of the human genome three years earlier had driven a wave of interest in genetic technology, and Wojcicki’s company grabbed attention instantly when it launched. 23andMe’s early publicity efforts were largely eye-catching gimmicks, such as hosting a celebrity-studded “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2008/sep/18/genetic.testing">spit party</a>” at New York Fashion Week (the company collects its DNA samples from customers’ saliva) and launching a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/11/23andme-zeppelin-hanging-out-above-my-house-creeping-me-out/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN7tCwcP18Gm4dEy7VxL1D-vRT_7DFu6W6T1TWnAfo5cBEtNcDnyjX7Tof57XZji-xsy1WVU7KVctjuUjwQx-Xk15dVSUgJqds624auVUa9kYifPBaVCS0OsL7Yy6WwbCpyQvts2UZzsIG5F8VcLf2Xz1ztjqrx4aE8rzEqxxV4v">blimp</a> over Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>Wojcicki characterizes these stunts as part of a gut-feel visibility blitz that she presided over directly. “I was the marketing department in those days,” she says, describing early advertisements she bought herself that her team still stumbles upon occasionally. Fortunately, she had a personal network seeped in the fast-moving world of Silicon Valley tech to learn from—her sister, Susan, was one of Google’s earliest employees (and served as CEO of YouTube until this year). Her husband at the time was Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder.</p>



<p>“Sergey’s advice at the time was basically to just put things out there and see how people react,” Wojcicki says. This freewheeling attitude also reflected a trademark disdain for corporate stiffness that persists to this day—indeed, during one of our interviews, Wojcicki wears a joke sweatshirt with a boat sailing toward the horizon that says “F*** this, I’m out.”</p>



<p>Not everyone at the company embraced the early marketing approach. The scientists in particular were skeptical about it, wary of undermining the company’s credibility. At the time, the term “DNA” was rapidly entering the marketing lexicon of firms across the corporate spectrum, threatening to cheapen the image of offerings that genuinely did have DNA as their DNA.</p>



<p>“Our scientists would cringe at the idea of doing an infomercial, say,” Wojcicki says, citing the shopping network QVC as an example of a sales channel the company shied away from at first.</p>



<p>23andMe’s offbeat marketing efforts did work initially, helping sell around 1,000 test kits on their first day—an early tsunami which quickly became a trickle as the novelty wore off. Sales soon slowed to a mere handful of kits per day. Facing a still-nascent appetite for genetic technology, Wojcicki and her team doubled down on product development and user experience. Eventually a more mainstream audience caught on, drawn particularly by the prospect of discovering one’s roots, much as Anne had done on those early trips overseas. This helped the company return to a state of relatively steady growth over the next few years.</p>



<p>Indeed, the concept of ancestry continues to play an important role for the company today. It is the thread that connects its early trajectory to Wojcicki’s own sojourns. The connections she made with people in her ancestral homeland underscored how much potential lay in popularizing this kind of self-discovery. “I lived in a dorm when I went to Poland, and people would tell me I look more Polish than most Poles,” Wojcicki says.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I feel like I can’t keep up with all the family that we’ve found.”</p>
Anne Wojcicki</blockquote>



<p>Unsurprisingly for someone who made a career helping millions construct family trees, her own family tree has expanded over the years, encompassing relatives from Australia to South Africa to Argentina. Ten years ago, Wojcicki’s father wrote a book about his own lineage, although no one in the family has been tasked with keeping track of every new addition to the bloodline.</p>



<p>“I feel like I can’t keep up with all the family that we’ve found,” she says, acknowledging that her own company’s product could potentially help her further explore her family tree’s branches and leaves. “It’s almost like there’s a present sitting at the door, but we haven’t opened it yet,” she muses. “In general, though, I’m more interested in expanding the depth, rather than the width of the tree—with making real relationships with the family members I meet.”</p>



<p>For her customers, gaining visibility into their own family backgrounds is a big selling point of 23andMe. (Quirky tidbits like whether they are likely to enjoy cilantro, wake up early, fear public speaking or a number of other traits come included, too.). However, more weighty assessments, such as likelihood of developing Type 2 diabetes and other more serious health conditions, are featured in its most popular service. In the years after its founding, the company expanded the repertoire of genetic conditions it screened for. Helping its customers interpret these results became a guiding principle for Wojcicki and her team.</p>



<p>“You have to take what’s in that raw, scientific brain and translate it to consumers,” she says, describing the late 2000s and early 2010s as a time when the company was starting to hit its stride in both its scientific mission and place in the broader discourse, when the company’s North Star—to help average people gain access to their genetic information, without what Wojcicki sees as heavy-handed intermediation by the medical establishment—was on the rise.</p>







<p>23andMe had defined a new category, becoming synonymous with at-home genetic testing. But along with success came detractors—including influential members of the medical community. To its skeptics, 23andMe was overly casual about revealing medical risk factors to people without giving them access to professionals who could help them handle the information. Some also question to what extent genetic analysis can truly predict diseases. Wojcicki describes attending a dinner in which a medical adviser for George W. Bush “walked out in disgust” after learning about the company’s product, and another instance in which the company was rejected from a convention held by a “major medical society” when it applied for a booth.</p>



<p>“I’ve been surprised by all the controversy that’s followed us,” Wojcicki says. She turns the criticism back to the healthcare industry, contrasting 23andMe’s work of promoting radical transparency with the industry’s habit of collecting patients’ data without any recourse to opt-out. “People should have choice,” she says. “The potential of genetics is really to help people know, ‘hey, here’s what your risks are, and can you actually do anything that mitigates those risks?’ I think there’s an incredible opportunity for that. You need to have the right information and awareness around [your risks], and [we can] help people understand that a probability is not the same as a predetermined outcome.”</p>



<p>Wojcicki has never been shy about the fact that winning over the medical establishment is not her top priority. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, is another matter.</p>



<p>The regulatory status of 23andMe’s genetic tests was always murky in those early years. Consumer genetics was such a new space, and regulators had almost no precedent on which to base rules. Still, the relationship between 23andMe and the FDA started out amicably: Wojcicki counts David Kessler, who served as the agency’s head from 1990–97, as a friend and close advisor. The company maintained open lines of communication with the FDA throughout its rise, even as the agency maintained a relatively hands-off stance.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When it was just a few Silicon Valley nerds buying these kits online, no one cared.”</p>
kathy hibbs</blockquote>



<p>This started to change in 2010, when a rival company began selling genetic tests at Walgreens. As Kathy Hibbs, 23andMe’s head of legal, describes it, this caused a range of power brokers—from lawmakers to regulators—to perk up their ears.</p>



<p>“When it was just a few Silicon Valley nerds buying these kits online, no one cared,” Hibbs says. “When it starts to look like a mass consumer product—that’s when people pay attention.”</p>



<p>Government engagements—including a grilling from US senators—started filling Wojcicki’s calendar. As the highest-profile consumer genetic testing company, 23andMe attracted the brightest spotlight. But the company also proved uniquely willing to place itself under scrutiny. After the FDA announced it would devise a set of rules for how such firms should engage with customers, 23andMe offered to help with the task—a big mistake, in Hibbs’ telling. “In hindsight, the company probably should’ve just stayed quiet.”</p>



<p>This is because it provided an opening for regulators to request ever more copious data from the company and for them to look askance at every perceived slip-up. 23andMe’s rapid growth targets and relatively lean resources during this time meant that fulfilling sales orders took priority over the cumbersome process of filling out regulatory documents. “They didn’t brush off the FDA intentionally,” Hibbs says. “It was more, ‘We’re a small company and have to get ready for the holidays.’”</p>



<p>As the FDA started growing impatient, 23andMe failed to grasp the agency’s increasingly strident tone. “They simply didn’t speak the same language,” Hibbs explains. “Someone should do dramatic readings of the calls from that time—you could have John Lithgow on one side and Glenn Close on the other. They were really talking past each other.”</p>



<p>The FDA’s restraint eventually crumbled. It was Friday, November 22, 2013. 23andMe was flush with optimism: it had recently broken a sales goal and was sitting on over $100 million in venture funding. Wojcicki was at a company offsite when her assistant texted that she’d received a letter from the FDA. Wojcicki immediately had a bad feeling. “Don’t sign for it,” she texted back, preferring for it to languish in a mail storage facility so “I could at least enjoy my weekend,” she says with a laugh.</p>



<p>But Wojcicki was too late. The letter was a strongly-worded order for 23andMe to immediately stop promoting its product. Its intent and tone were crystal clear. “Some of the uses for which [the product] is intended are particularly concerning,” the letter read. “Even after many interactions with 23andMe, we still do not have any assurance that the firm has analytically or clinically validated [the product] for its intended uses. Therefore, 23andMe must immediately discontinue marketing [it] until such time as it receives FDA marketing authorization.”</p>



<p>Wojcicki’s first instinct was to fight. She thought of suing the FDA. Her second instinct was to call everyone she knew who might be able to help. This proved wise: when she spoke with Kessler, the former FDA commissioner, he told her in no uncertain terms that if she defied the order, she would go to jail. Hibbs hedges on this somewhat, but agrees that criminal charges could follow. “It was like a bad breakup letter,” Hibbs says. “Most companies don’t come back from letters like that.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m so used to being the straight-A student—I became obsessed with proving them wrong.”</p>
anne Wojcicki</blockquote>



<p>The insult turned into injury when, in an unusual move, the agency posted the letter on its website the following Monday, attracting widespread media coverage. A sense of crisis swept through the company. Its then-head of communications resigned. But Wojcicki held firm. “They were insinuating that our product was harmful,” she says. “I’m so used to being the straight-A student—I became obsessed with proving them wrong.”</p>



<p>Tapping her personal network, she poached Hibbs from her post at another genetic testing company, tasking her with leading the effort to win FDA approval. The crux of the challenge was proving that consumers could grasp the implications of uncovering facts about their genome without a doctor in the chain of communication. It is a hurdle makers of over-the-counter pills like Tylenol have to overcome every time they market a new product: can shoppers understand how to take the medication? Do they appreciate the risks and know how to minimize them?</p>



<p>No maker of direct-to-consumer DNA tests had ever grappled with these kinds of questions. According to Wojcicki, many of them employ a “doc in the box” model, in which an invisible doctor rubber-stamps the delivery of a genetic report every time an average Jane requests it. This raises cost and inconvenience. Worse yet, it presumes people are incapable of digesting fundamental information about their own genome. Hibbs compares this to the heavy resistance healthcare bigwigs showed toward at-home pregnancy tests when they first emerged. “The medical establishment fought those tests for years,” Hibbs says. “They honestly thought women could not handle receiving this information at home alone. It is ironic that this situation was playing out again even after people fought so hard to let women read their own pregnancy tests.”</p>



<p>The months following the FDA letter were a hectic scramble to collect this user data through comprehension studies—focus groups where people demonstrate their understanding of a medical product. The data has to be collected in a way that satisfies the FDA’s requirements for diversity, rigor and statistical significance. All told, 23andMe surveyed thousands of people across a wide demographic, even as it was losing money and unable to bring in new revenue due to the moratorium on marketing.</p>



<p>Frustration simmered within the company throughout the saga. Wojcicki, however, was determined to see the setback as an opportunity to not just tick regulatory boxes, but to spark a paradigm shift in the relationship between consumers and their medical information. “The average FDA submission of this type is a few hundred pages; ours was over 7,000,” Wojcicki says—a deluge of data that was meant to prod exactly this kind of broader reckoning. Wojcicki now believes that it paved the way for more breakthroughs in data transparency, such as a federal regulation issued in 2014 that requires medical providers to send patients their lab results the same time they send them to the doctor.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m the kind of person who snaps into action in these kinds of situations.”</p>
anne Wojcicki</blockquote>



<p>Ultimately, what might have constituted an existential crisis to a less committed CEO never rattled Wojcicki. “I’m the kind of person who snaps into action in these kinds of situations,” she says. “My only real worry was how long it was going to take.” Indeed, the company spent well over a year in the wilderness: after painstakingly collecting the data in the months after receiving the cease-and-desist letter, it submitted its application to the FDA in June 2014. In February 2015, it received regulatory authorization to market a genetic health test directly to consumers.</p>



<p>“I have a level of stubbornness that’s apparent to anyone who knows me,” Wojcicki says. Roelof Botha, the Sequoia partner who works with 23andMe and helped it go public in 2021, cites this mix of pragmatism and dogged determination among Wojcicki’s best qualities. “She’s unconventional, but she’s also totally unpretentious,” he says. “She has obviously been very successful, and she is just who she is and very comfortable in her own skin—what you see is what you get. And that makes for a very efficient business relationship, because there’s very little pretense, very little bravado. She’s just direct.”</p>



<p>Botha now sees promise in 23andMe’s current mandate to leverage its massive genetic database to develop treatments for illnesses; in 2018 the company entered into a <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-announces-extension-gsk-collaboration-and-update-joint">partnership</a> with British pharmaceuticals giant GSK to discover and develop drugs based on genetic information in 23andMe’s DNA library from customers who agreed it could be used for this purpose. “I look forward to having several blockbuster drugs a decade from now,” Botha says. “That to me is the real vision and potential of the company.”</p>



<p>That 23andMe not only continues to dominate its field but could eventually evolve into a pharmaceuticals powerhouse is a testament to its integrity in an industry where principles and profit sometimes make for uneasy bedfellows. Our conversations take place during the trial of Elizabeth Holmes, of Theranos infamy—a cautionary tale about how wrong things can go in biotech without a commitment to integrity. Many have placed gender at the heart of the Theranos controversy. Wojcicki permits that gender played a role in the scandal but is hesitant to ascribe specific meaning to it. “I have no doubt it would have been different if she was a man, but I don’t know exactly how,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question of gender has followed Wojcicki’s own career since it started. She emphasizes the importance of elevating women in her organization, even agreeing when asked if she would prefer that the next leader of 23andMe—as far off as that might be—is a woman. Equality is her top priority, however, and she acknowledges that the pendulum can swing too far in the opposite direction: in 23andMe’s early days, the company had “too many women,” as Wojcicki puts it. “We reached a point where I was like, ‘I need men to balance it out!’,” she recalls. “Women tend to flock to work with other women, especially when they’re coming from these heavily male-dominated places.”</p>



<p>One place that certainly was not male dominated was Wojcicki’s childhood home, where she and her two sisters enjoyed a relationship with their parents in which the very idea of “dominance” was completely alien. Her mother Esther, a former teacher who recently published a book about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Raise-Successful-People-Lessons/dp/1328974863">raising successful children</a>, frequently writes and speaks about the importance of questioning authority and challenging preconceived notions of who gets to call the shots.</p>



<p>This ethos forms the core of how Wojcicki now leads 23andMe, whose culture she describes as one of cooperation and willingness to participate in non-ego driven pursuits. It is also one where scientific inquisitiveness and a desire to constantly push the boundaries of discovery are more important than always finding the “right” answer.</p>



<p>“We are very much about recognizing interesting problems and coming up with collective solutions. Sometimes I find people with the right DNA for us, who didn’t flourish because they weren’t in the right environment, but who go on to flourish with us.”</p>



<p>Framing her management ethos in terms of those age-old dance partners—DNA and environment—is of a piece with Wojcicki’s overall worldview, one in which genes and circumstances interact to create a whole human being, in which exploring where one factor begins and the other ends is worthy of a category-defining company and mountains of scientific innovation. Yet despite this audacious ambition, the energy in Wojcicki’s voice as she describes her experiences discovering her roots belies a more down-to-earth motivation: the need to simply and deeply comprehend one’s place in the world.</p>



<p>“Going back to see my father’s hometown, to the apartment he lived in, to taste the food he ate…in the back of my mind I was always thinking, ‘what if it was me?’”</p>

<p>The unprecedented speed and success of mRNA vaccines in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the demand for mRNA as a next-generation nucleic acid therapy. Hundreds of ongoing clinical trials are currently testing mRNA across more than 20 disease categories. The current production process, called In Vitro Transcription (IVT), has been successfully scaled up but produces immunostimulatory byproducts such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), is limited to shorter mRNA products and requires expensive reagents, including very pure DNA plasmids and proprietary enzymes to catalyze the reactions. Sensible Bio has developed a proprietary system to produce mRNA in living cells. By leveraging natural internal cellular processes combined with synthetic biology and biomimetic approaches, Sensible’s platform aims to produce longer mRNA, free of immunogenic contaminants (such as dsRNA), while enabling the production of mRNA with natural modifications, all key attributes for mRNA therapeutics — while lowering production costs by an order of magnitude.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>The mRNA therapeutics market exceeded $40 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow to $130 billion by 2030. We believe that Sensible Bio’s mRNA production platform could potentially replace today’s In Vitro Transcription method for many applications, especially in mRNA therapeutics that require longer mRNA and higher doses. While the company’s initial focus will be on manufacturing best-in-class mRNA and partnering with biotech companies developing mRNA therapeutics, over time they could potentially integrate mRNA design and delivery systems, creating an end-to-end mRNA platform.</p><p>We look forward to joining <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslavgasparek/">Miro</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marian-kupculak-34468a85/">Marian</a> and the <a href="https://www.sensible.bio/">Sensible Bio</a> team on their journey.

<p>A recap of our Nym core team at ETHDenver</p><p>Following The Merge in September 2022, the Ethereum network became <a href="https://medium.com/nymtech/congratulations-on-the-merge-now-to-cure-the-hangover-with-a-strong-dose-of-privacy-c4b0c8eb46ea">more vulnerable to validator privacy issues</a>. Two months later, a hefty community push back occurred following revelations that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/24/ethereum-software-firm-consensys-reveals-it-collects-user-data/">user data including wallet addresses was being collected by Consensys</a> through Infura and Metamask.</p><p>The issue of privacy in Web3 became more pressing than ever&nbsp;before.</p><p>Web3 conferences this year to date have had more privacy-focused sessions than in previous years. This year’s ETHDenver continued this trend which is a massive signal that the web3 community is concerned about&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The Nym team was proud to have the opportunity to be front and centre of this privacy discussion drive, alongside other Universal Privacy Alliance (UPA) members. Here’s a quick summary of what went&nbsp;on:</p> UPA Mini Privacy&nbsp;Summit <p>Watch the full summit here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FK_zjOLNWQ&amp;t=288s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FK_zjOLNWQ&amp;t=288s</a></p><p>ETHDenver week kicked off with the UPA mini privacy summit, organised in collaboration with other UPA members — <a href="https://electriccoin.co/">Electric Coin Co.</a>, <a href="https://www.manta.network/">Manta Network</a>, <a href="https://www.orchid.com/">Orchid Protocol</a>, <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Network</a>, <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec Protocol</a>, <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> and <a href="https://mobilecoin.com/">MobileCoin</a>.</p><p>The opening keynote was done by Juan Benet, Founder of Protocol Labs and creator of IPFS on “Modern Orwellian states &amp; How to prevent&nbsp;them”.</p><p>Watch the keynote here: <a href="https://youtu.be/6FK_zjOLNWQ?t=29">https://youtu.be/6FK_zjOLNWQ?t=29</a></p><p>How to beat surveillance capitalism and reclaim your&nbsp;privacy</p><p>Watch the full panel here: <a href="https://youtu.be/6FK_zjOLNWQ?t=4403">https://youtu.be/6FK_zjOLNWQ?t=4403</a></p><p>Nym General Counsel Ahmed Ghappour joined this panel discussion with Electric Coin Co. SVP Growth, Product Strategy and Regulatory Affairs Josh Swihart, Secret Labs CEO Guy Zyskind and Orchid Protocol Head of Product Travis&nbsp;Cannell.</p><p>The discussion was moderated by Nym Head of PR &amp; Communications Candice&nbsp;Teo.</p><p>Inspiring and open insights on the following questions were provided:</p>  How are enterprises getting away with surveillance capitalism? Are we rationalising the situation with resigned cynicism or are we swayed by the propaganda that this is technological inevitability?  Are governments truly motivated to implement preventive measures against surveillance capitalism given the overlapping objectives?  Has surveillance capitalism reached saturation point or will the advent of web3 companies “innovate” it further, causing even more danger to us as a&nbsp;society?  Can tokenisation offer alternative ownership and business models to surveillance capitalism?  What is the fastest route for us to reclaim our privacy? Is it regulation or can we build our way out of it especially with the unprecedented innovation we have seen in our web3&nbsp;space?  What should we stop doing and what should we start&nbsp;doing?  <p>How can developers protect themselves and adhere to regulations?</p><p>Ahmed also later presented a keynote on “Criminal cases in the ecosystem — how can developers protect themselves and adhere to regulations?”. He broke down past cases for everyone and details of regulatory impact including:</p>  Same statues used in civil and criminal&nbsp;arenas  Parallel investigations done across agencies — OFAC, DOJ,&nbsp;SEC  Sufficient-ness of projects compliance program  Tornado Cash — redesignation done and the agency exercising powers against an algorithm  AML programs  How all of us, both developers and government alike, have to do better about understanding the distinction between speech (and the content of speech) and&nbsp;conduct.   Enabling the Nym mixnet with&nbsp;Metamask <p>Watch the full session here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrDVRhrfYT8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrDVRhrfYT8</a></p><p>Watch the demo video here: <a href="https://youtu.be/GQ836n2j0pU">https://youtu.be/GQ836n2j0pU</a></p><p>At the ETHDenver main conference, Nym CEO Harry Halpin presented on “How to stop your wallet from collecting your personal data: Enabling the Nym mixnet with Metamask”, recapping the privacy issues in Ethereum, Nym tools and what developers can do to ensure privacy for and as&nbsp;users:</p>  No existing solution can defend against mass surveillance  Integration components to run app traffic through the Nym&nbsp;mixnet  Nym mixnet&nbsp;clients  Running a Nym proxy to access RPCs like Infura (privately)  Setting up a proxy&nbsp;yourself  Running your own private RPC&nbsp;node  Demo on a Nym integration with Metamask +&nbsp;roadmap  Validator privacy issues in&nbsp;Ethereum  Development of a new libp2p module to enhance validator privacy with Chainsafe   Cosmos on&nbsp;Tap <p>With Nym being chain-agnostic, it is the best way to bring privacy as default to a global level. This means that we need to tool developers in all ecosystems to integrate privacy by design whether they are building apps, wallets or other services.</p><p>Built using Cosmos SDK, Nym is on a mission to drive interchain privacy. We co-organised Cosmos on Tap: A Cosmos pub talk with other Cosmos projects: <a href="https://evmos.org/">Evmos</a>, <a href="https://akash.network/">Akash Network</a>, <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a>, <a href="https://injective.com/">Injective</a> and <a href="https://www.althea.net/">Althea Network</a> to enable Ethereum developers to find out more about the ecosystem.</p><p>Nym CTO Dave Hrycyszyn spoke on the first panel, “Enhancing Cosmos for Developers” alongside Evmos Co-founder Nic Z. and Secret Foundation Tor Bair. The panel was moderated by Althea Network CEO Deborah&nbsp;Simpier.</p><p>The second panel of the evening was “Cosmos: Infrastructure that Scales” with Akash Network CTO Adam Bozanich and Injective Labs CEO Eric Chen, again moderated by Althea Network CEO Deborah&nbsp;Simpier.</p> Privacy is normal at ETHDenver <p>In a conference-first, ETHDenver hosted a privacy special on the main stage on the last day, with a stellar line-up for privacy advocates and experts. Nym CEO Harry Halpin and Nym GC Ahmed Ghappour joined the following sessions:</p><p>Plausible Deniability</p><p>Watch full fireside chat here: <a href="https://youtu.be/i3zgrqijLSI">https://youtu.be/i3zgrqijLSI</a></p><p>This fireside focused on practical considerations for builders in privacy who want to protect their own privacy, maintain a low profile and/or operate pseudonymously. Nym GC Ahmed Ghappour joined Tor Founder Roger Dingledine to discuss tools that such builders should use and best practices to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>One key takeaway from Ahmed is for builders to educate themselves. There is a need to educate the regulator and government generally, but builders should also educate themselves to really understand the difference between content of code versus&nbsp;conduct.</p><p>On the Front&nbsp;Lines</p><p>Watch full panel discussion here: <a href="https://youtu.be/y-2XP-sDRqQ">https://youtu.be/y-2XP-sDRqQ</a></p><p>In one of the most fascinating panel discussions, Nym CEO Harry Halpin joined Aleo CEO Alex Pruden, Polygon zkEVM Technical Lead Jordi Baylina, Filecoin Foundation Associate GC Kurt Ophsahl and two other activists Abdo Al Rayyis and Jarrel James, to share their experiences fighting against authoritarian regimes. This panel of freedom fighters provided practical insights on the actual tools they rely on and how they use them, where those tools could be better and which tools are still&nbsp;lacking.</p><p>Other privacy&nbsp;sessions</p><p>Watch the other insightful, practical and inspiring sessions&nbsp;here:</p>  Keynote by Sherri Davidoff: <a href="https://youtu.be/kTZ0hPPkevo">https://youtu.be/kTZ0hPPkevo</a>  Keynote by Roger Dingledine: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8rdUK1s9tg">https://youtu.be/D8rdUK1s9tg</a>  Fireside chat with Frances Haugen and Leslie Katz <a href="https://youtu.be/HCIvNEZtjKg">https://youtu.be/HCIvNEZtjKg</a>  Panel discussion, “Take a stand”: <a href="https://youtu.be/tv8Fq3FJmwo">https://youtu.be/tv8Fq3FJmwo</a>  Panel discussion, “Privacy by design”: <a href="https://youtu.be/JTHP2hfhf_c">https://youtu.be/JTHP2hfhf_c</a>  Panel discussion, “We almost didn’t get encryption”: <a href="https://youtu.be/iZX40TFq8Ts">https://youtu.be/iZX40TFq8Ts</a>  Panel discussion, “Privacy vs security”: <a href="https://youtu.be/Eba0Xj2vEKU">https://youtu.be/Eba0Xj2vEKU</a>   Privacy should be normal in&nbsp;Ethereum <p>It was incredible to see the recognition and interest of the importance of privacy at ETHDenver this year. With packed out audiences and post-session discussions from builders, we are confident that this momentum will continue beyond Denver.

    <p>We achieved several major milestones in the development of EON, Horizen’s public EVM-compatible sidechain and smart contracting platform. These milestones include the releases of two separate testnet environments, Dune and Yuma; a new version of Cobalt wallet to support EON testnet functionalities; and other developer tools such as explorers and test token faucet.</p>
<p>Also during Q1, we released three core software upgrades with functionalities to support EON, and <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zend-node-application-disclosure-and-fixes/">fixed a security vulnerability</a> in the ZEND node application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 EON Testnet Environments – Dune and Yuma 
<p>Dune is the pre-alpha and invite-only testnet for EON. It was launched on January 18 and welcomed a small group of 90+ developers to test the platform.<a href="https://yuma.horizen.io"> Yuma</a> is the temporary public testnet for EON that came after Dune. Yuma testnet is public and accessible for anyone to test and try out Horizen’s first public EVM. We were excited to see an even larger influx of developer activities on Yuma, releasing the testnet to a wider pool of testers. Much of their feedback was tremendously helpful in gearing up for our permanent public testnet, Gobi! </p>
<p>Both testnets are important milestones before launching EON to Gobi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yuma testnet is a big upgrade of Dune with key new capabilities and improvements:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Learn more about these new capabilities on Yuma<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-evm-eon-is-now-live-on-yuma-public-testnet/"> here</a>.</p>
 EON Developer Tools and Resources 
<p>We released a set of easy-to-use developer and end-user tools to the EON platform:</p>
 
 <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">EON App</a> with support for <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/cross-chain-transactions/#backward-transfers">backward transfer</a>&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://faucet.horizen.io">Test token faucet&nbsp;</a> 
 <a href="https://horizen.io/wallets/cobalt">Cobalt wallet</a> with built-in testnet faucet and other EVM support 
 <a href="https://yuma.horizen.io">Testnet status dashboards</a> 
 <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/docs">EON documentation</a> 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhZisbhyYIXI4IPY072Q6HDDLi1hAYAp_">EON tutorials</a> 
 
 EON Partnership and Integrations 
<p></p>
<p>In addition to the tools built-in-house, the EON platform is integrated with supported by popular 3rd party tools and products that provide developers and users a streamlined and easy user experience.&nbsp;</p>
 
 ThirdWeb: A low-code web3 development platform, offering smart contract libraries and deployments along with a series of SDKs and APIs including connectivity with Shopify. 
 Revoke.Cash: A preventative tool that helps users practice proper wallet hygiene.&nbsp; 
 Chainlist: Chainlist is a list of EVM networks. Users can use the information to connect their wallets and Web3 middleware providers to the appropriate Chain ID and Network ID to connect to the correct chain. 
 BlockScout: The first fully-featured open-source blockchain explorer available for use by any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain 
 Web3.js: Ethereum JavaScript API 
 Remix: The Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) with a GUI for developing smart contracts. 
 Truffle: A popular development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for developing applications on EVM-based blockchains. 
 Hardhat: A popular Ethereum development environment for developers 
 MetaMask: A popular self-custodial wallet that interacts with the Ethereum and EMV-compatible blockchains. 
 
 
 Multichain: A popular cross-chain bridge with high transaction speeds and no-slippage swaps. 
 
<p>More integrations and products are being added to the EON ecosystem.</p>
 What’s Next for EON – Gobi &amp; Mainnet Preview 
<p>With Yuma, we have registered the first non-ceasable sidechain in testnet. We had to fork the mainchain to upgrade ZEND ahead of time. Gobi will be non-ceasable as well and on the official track.</p>
<p>Gobi will be registered with a setup that will be the same as we will have in mainnet.</p>
<p>47 validators will be active in securing the chain, while there will be more nodes to serve our public RPC other than the nodes dedicated to the EON block explorer.</p>
<p>Among the new features Gobi will bring:</p>
 
 Improved performance 
 Websocket support 
 Security improvements 
 Autoscaling RPC nodes based on demand 
 
<p>When the EON chain is up and running, the team will bring the secure enclave for certificate signing as well.</p>
<p>We will also be launching a bug bounty program and developer grant program in the next phases.</p>

					Making zero-knowledge applications Faster		    
     
 


 
         
    <p>There are two industry-significant updates from the <a href="https://horizenlabs.io">Horizen Labs</a> cryptography team:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/323">Poseidon2:</a> The Horizen Labs team has upgraded the default hash function for zero-knowledge (zk) applications by introducing Poseidon2, an enhanced version of Poseidon.</p>
<p>The Poseidon hash function is currently the default choice for zero-knowledge applications such as zkEVMs, zkVMs, Mina, and various applications within Polygon. Poseidon2 can replace any instance of Poseidon in all zero-knowledge applications, bringing faster hashing speeds to all.</p>
<p>RC64, is another new hash function. There are two scenarios where hashes are needed, in&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) everyday (cryptographic) plain computations, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) circuit (re: SNARK) computations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen Labs cryptography team created the new RC64 hash function that works best for both scenarios. If there is a need for both everyday and circuit computations, using RC64 is preferable over Poseidon2.&nbsp;</p>

 ZenIP 42204: Deprecation of Shielded Pools from Horizen Mainchain 
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204</a>&nbsp;proposed the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain.&nbsp;The purpose of ZenIP 42204 is to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risks.&nbsp;It proposes a solution to eliminate technical debt and avoid regulatory threats that can prevent the greater Horizen community from fully and freely participating in our ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenIP 42204 was met with&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/community-survey-results-are-in-for-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">overwhelmingly positive support from the community</a>, when asked if they are in agreement with ZenIP 42204, 75.3% of survey takers are favorable, 12.7% are neutral, and 11.9% are not favorable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the majority of votes and feedback we have received are in agreement with ZenIP 42204, we will be moving forward with this proposal and plan the changes into a future ZEND software release.&nbsp;<a href="https://podcast.horizen.io/episode/2-removal-of-shielded-pools">Episode 2 of our Beyond the Horizen Podcast</a>&nbsp;goes into further detail on ZenIP 42204 and next steps.&nbsp;</p>

 Events 
 ETHDENVER 
<p>Some members of the Horizen team were in Denver this year for the annual ETHDenver event! This was an immensely valuable event for the team, we were able to have numerous excellent conversations and reconnect with partners, both old and new. We noticed that the major narratives of the event were cross-chain communication and interoperability, zero knowledge, and a future of easier/more user-friendly onboarding from both the developer and user sides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to hosting events at ETHDENVER next year!</p>
 PARIS BLOCKCHAIN WEEK SUMMIT 
<p></p>
<p>Members of the team were at Paris Blockchain this year and thoroughly enjoyed attending the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a wide range of panels and talks, but some of our favorites focused on Web3 and its impact on various industries such as sports, gaming, luxury, and more, NFTs and DeFi, educational talks around user security, and a discussion on CBDCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were able to say hello to a few of our partners, as well as friends, overall the event was quite successful! We hope to be in attendance next year as well.</p>

<p>Today, Brave is launching its Self-Serve Ads Program. These new tools allow brands to set up and run advertising for their products and services within the privacy-preserving Brave Ads and Rewards ecosystem. This is an important next step on our roadmap for Brave and the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token</a> (BAT) to provide effective advertising that protects users’ privacy.</p>
<p>The Brave Ads Self-Serve Program allows brands to set up and run ad campaigns in the Brave Browser and Search ecosystem with minimal assistance from the Brave team. Initially, the Brave Ads Self-Serve Program invites brands to run English-language campaigns in <a>countries currently supported by Brave Ads</a>. We plan to introduce support for additional languages over time.</p>
<p>The program is also an opportunity for brands who are new to Brave to join, and provide feedback and to improve our Brave Ads products.</p>
<p>The Self-Serve Program offers the ability for brands to purchase campaigns to run in the Brave Ads Push Notification ad unit. Over time, the team will be introducing Brave News Ads and Brave Search Ads units to self-serve to be available to directly purchase within the platform.</p>
<p>Advertisers participating in the program will also receive beta access to new self-serve features as we introduce them into the system over time, and will have the opportunity to provide direct feedback and have access to our Brave Ads Product and Brave Research teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave’s direct sales team will continue to sell New Tab Takeovers (formerly named Sponsored Images). These assets will not be available within self-serve given the curated image selection and approval process. However, if program participants express interest in purchasing Sponsored Images, they will be connected with our Sales team to help facilitate that process.</p>
<p>A minimum campaign spend of $1,000 USD per month is required to participate in the self-serve program. Advertisers are required to pre-pay, with either BAT or USD.</p>
<p>Advertisers enrolled in the Brave Ads Self-Serve Program are eligible to receive a 50% discount on their first campaign, <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/10800687258637-How-do-I-buy-crypto-with-Brave-Wallet-">if they purchase their campaign with BAT</a>. Additional campaign discounts for purchasing campaigns with BAT will be available throughout the program.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a>Our current advertising policies</a> will apply to brands in the program; human review will remain a part of the process to ensure the safety of Brave’s users, and preserve the integrity of our brand and product.</p>

 Background 
<p>Brave Ads were first launched in early 2019, available to Brave users who opted-in to <a>Brave Rewards</a>, from Brave’s <a href="https://www.investinblockchain.com/brave-browser-surpasses-5-million/">5.5 million monthly active user</a> base at the time. The concept of advertising with privacy was new to most advertisers (and Brave’s ad platform remains a unique offering still in 2023), so Brave Ads were brought to market as a managed service to help educate and learn with our customers. Brave’s teams of sellers, account managers, operations, finance, and engineering work together to bring in customers and deploy their campaigns into the Brave ecosystem. The managed service approach helps Brave provide white glove service with education on Brave and Brave Ads, while keeping an established onboarding and payment process in place that brands are familiar with.</p>
<p>Brave has since grown significantly, with our user base now at 57 million monthly and 21 million daily active users. The Brave Ads platform and offerings have also grown from one ad unit to <a>four ad units</a> across various Brave products that brands can use to communicate their story and grow their customer base. Brave Search ads are also rolling out and will get access to our 23 million daily queries and over 8 billion annualized queries.</p>
<p>Brave Ads campaigns have also been supported in nearly 200 countries with over 7.5 billion ad confirmation events to date, and there have been over 6,600 campaigns since the inception from over 900 advertisers, from mainstream brands such as Ford, PayPal, Toyota, Mastercard, Intel, Chipotle, Crocs, BMW, Keurig, American Express, Budweiser, Walmart, Amazon, and The Home Depot, as well as from crypto giants like Binance, Coinbase, eToro, Ledger, NEAR, and Solana. The time has come for Brave to bring the Brave Ads Self-Serve Program to market, and grow the ecosystem even further.</p>

 Getting Started 
<p>Brands looking to participate in the program can head over to our Brave Ads <a>Self-Serve Program page</a> to learn more, or to complete and submit the form to join the program’s waitlist. The Brave Ads team will be onboarding groups of advertisers from the waitlist, based on available supply across Brave Ads inventory.</p>
<p>We are excited to enter the next phase of the Brave Ads and Rewards ecosystem with the introduction of the Self-Serve Program, as the Ads platform becomes easily accessible to a broader range of global brands and marketers.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>In this end-of-quarter update, we are delighted to showcase the milestones and accomplishments that have shaped our progress over the past month. Along with our regular monthly progress update, we are also happy to review our performance over Q1 2023 against our freshly-published roadmap.</p><p>As we continue to grow and innovate, we remain grateful for the unwavering support of our thriving community. Let’s take a good look at March 2023!<br></p> Roadmap and Quarterly achievements  Say hi to our new Roadmap! <p></p>Panther Protocol’s first three quarters of 2023.<p>This month, we released our <a href="https://t.co/1e5oSU11CX?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">roadmap for 2023-2024</a>! It outlines all the upcoming milestones for Panther’s v1 deployment. Dive into <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1634108708950097921?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">our recent Twitter thread</a> to see the different components and use cases that we plan to roll out in the journey toward v1. <br></p><p>As Q1 2023 is coming to an end, let’s see how we fared in meeting our quarterly goals for it.<br></p> Q1 2023 <p>As we enter Q2, we are thrilled to announce the successful implementation of some key initiatives that mark a significant milestone in our journey toward decentralization and privacy solutions for institutions and retail users alike.<br></p> New website<br> <p>Firstly, our new website is being coded into existence as you read this. And…<br></p>Ta-da! We’re debuting a new image and style for our revamped site.<p>The new site introduces a style, brand, and messaging change. As Product and compliance design are cemented and brought into life, we’re increasingly confident in the utility Panther can and will have for institutions. This look is meant to reflect it. Accordingly, the contents of the website will reflect a more comprehensive look at our Product’s capabilities and use cases.<br></p><p>As per “a chain-agnostic privacy layer,” we believe this term nicely overcomes one of our most complex branding and marketing challenges to date: explaining Panther in a short sentence. “Chain-agnostic” refers to how you will be able to access Panther’s privacy from many different chains, with no preference towards any L1 or L2, while also being able to move between chains. Meanwhile, “privacy layer” refers to how Panther’s ecosystem benefits from a shared privacy set, allowing users of different chains to privately access DeFi while having the right to opt between privacy and transparency, getting in and out of the privacy layer.<br></p><p>We can’t wait for you to see the rest of the changes we’re introducing!<br></p> Improved documentation<br> A sneak peek into our new documentation structure (but there is more!)<p>In addition to the website revamp, we have also finished updates to Panther’s documentation, marking the beginning of a new era where documentation will be a live process with constant updates and growth.<br></p><p>Our updated documentation is more intuitive and user-friendly, with sections dedicated to stakeholders, retail users, and financial institutions. Furthermore, the new documentation covers essential topics such as Panther’s approach to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and zk-SNARKS. We've also updated critical sections on MASPs, fee structures, DeFi adaptors, and cryptographic primitives.<br></p><p>While some sections are still a work in progress, this approach marks a significant departure from our previous static documentation approach and underscores our commitment to continuous improvement. The documentation itself is experiencing its final review and will be live for you to see it soon!<br></p> $ZKP is being listed in MEXC <p></p>PIP-12 on Snapshot<p>In February, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x742a7667af3d6277d88817c8a3d4ec70006575154d36a4a67bcbe4f5e536d1aa">PIP-12</a> was passed with an approval rating of 98.97%. This proposal involved listing <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/token/about?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/MEXC_Global?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">MEXC Global</a>, a well-known and trusted centralized exchange. In light of this, we initiated the listing process.<br></p><p>The MEXC listing is particularly significant as it will allow Panther users to deposit and withdraw ZKP on Polygon, which complements Panther’s v1 release.<br></p><p>Moreover, the Panther DAO sees the decision to list on MEXC as a strategic move to enhance the Panther ecosystem’s liquidity. <br></p><p>On their side, MEXC Global has commenced voting for the listing of $ZKP as part of its pre-launch listing campaign. This process allows users to stake tokens and cast their votes in support of their preferred project, with the chance to get some tokens airdropped to them. MEXC's goal is to identify and promote high-quality projects to its community, and this listing campaign serves as a crucial filter for achieving that objective. The voting period for $ZKP's listing runs from 2023-04-04 at 12:00 to 2023-04-04 at 21:50 (UTC).<br></p>MEXC’s Community Voting for $ZKP on MEXC’s Kickstarter platform is now live. Governance framework development<br> <p>Finally, as part of Phase 2 of our decentralization phase, we have made solid steps towards formalizing a much-awaited governance framework.<br></p><p>The Panther community has settled on appointing a Council as the last step toward formalizing this framework. The Council will have the core responsibility of vetting which DAO proposals are suitable to move into voting by the Panther community i.e., whether they can be objectively beneficial for the project in the long term.<br></p><p>This discussion is still ongoing on <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s Discourse forum</a>, with the community discussing the onboarding process and metrics. Feel free to join it and participate!<br></p> Technology updates<br>  A busy month as we prepare for v1’s Testnet<br> <p>As our Roadmap shows, Q2 2023 will see the release of Panther’s v1 Testnet, and, as such, many things are developing behind the scenes.<br></p><p>Among these milestones are critical components of smart contracts for fees and rewards on v1, which have already been developed and are pending connection to a Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP). &nbsp;Panther is currently clarifying the parameters for rewarding to crystallize the model before v1's MASP is finished. Contracts are almost finalized, and progress is ongoing in the area of data modeling.<br></p><p>On the KYC/KYT integration front, Panther is currently interacting with other specialists in the DeFi ecosystem to build a comprehensive solution to support compliance attestations and disclosures. We’re getting ready for a significant informational release regarding this component that will be core to Panther disrupting the PriFi scene.<br></p><p>Simultaneously, planning for the v1 dApp continues, with major progress on the UI front. This means that the development of the fully-planned dApp is expected to begin soon.<br></p><p>Panther's DeFi Adaptors design has also been solidified and is ready to become a functional interface. Additional UTXO variable functionalities were added to production too, which we will discuss in greater detail in an upcoming article.<br></p><p>By the way, did you see this <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1639324727364681737?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">alpha drop</a> related to Panther’s cryptography research?<br></p>Panther’s SNARK Research paper will be presented in Istanbul this month. v0.5.2 Upgrades and UI Development<br> <p>A DAO proposal is underway to introduce a community deployment of v0.5.2, an upgrade that features several improvements vital to building v1.<br></p><p>Simultaneously, the Panther community is discussing terms for extending the v0.5 Advanced Staking program.<br></p> Ecosystem<br>  Governance <p>Recently, the community shared a DEX liquidity PIP draft and discussed extending the Advanced Staking program for an additional four months. Keep an eye out for a proposal in the near future!<br></p>Panther’s Discourse Forum‌ ‌<p>Remember to head over to <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">the discussion forum</a> if you want to stay up to date and get involved in the Panther ecosystem's governance.<br></p> zSwap <p>For those interested in learning more about Panther's v1, our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ama-transcript-road-to-v1-w-oliver-gale-saif-akhtar/">AMA transcript</a> provides specific details on the zSwap launch, DeFi integrations, and go-to-market strategy.</p>Road to V1 Ask-Me-Anything<p>If you're curious about how zSwap could potentially address one of the biggest concerns for the future development of the Ethereum and Polygon ecosystems, read this <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1631342447933419520?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Thread🧵</a>.<br></p><p>We have also made the full recording of our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ama-transcript-road-to-v1-w-oliver-gale-saif-akhtar/">Road to v1 Ask-Me-Anything</a> available, complete with subtitles!<br></p><p></p> Media and AMAs<br> <p>Last year, Panther became a proud member of the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/r/5254f285?m=eebf5e16-f447-40b1-a284-b2d55b27ee62">Leading Privacy Alliance</a> to help make privacy-first an industry standard.

This idea led to the creation of modular blockchains, which handle execution, consensus and data availability separately from one another, thus considerably increasing throughput.<br>Dymension is a Cosmos modular blockchain hub that acts as settlement layer for RollApps (app-specific chains).</p><p>Sebastien was joined by Barry, Head of Product at Dymension, to discuss the advantages of developing modular blockchains, their scalability and how RollApps integrate in this environment.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Barry’s background  The evolution of scaling solutions &amp; Dymension’s RollApps  The nuances of different types of rollups (L1 vs. L2, Ethereum vs. Cosmos)  The scalability trilemma and modular blockchains  Cosmos’ ICS scaling  The architecture of Dymension and its RDK  How RollApps choose the data availability layer  RollApp interoperability  Incentivising sequencer neutrality  Network roles in Dymension and differences between SDK &amp; RDK  Use cases &amp; limitations of RollApps  Future roadmap  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/shaolin_flow">Barry on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/dymensionXYZ">Dymension on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://dymension.xyz/">Dymension's website</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/TheInterop">The Interop Podcast on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/CelestiaOrg">Celestia on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture.

<p>Tokenisation is one of the latest web3 trends to emerge. It has taken the world by storm through its relatively simple yet practical use cases in a wide range of industries. In this article, we will explain what it means to tokenise real world assets, the key aspects of tokenising real world assets, the process of tokenising a real world asset, and the benefits and disadvantages of tokenising real world assets.</p>



 Key takeaways  



 
 The tokenisation of real world assets is the process of creating a (fractionalised) digital twin of a physical asset that can be held, bought, and traded on a blockchain. 



 The tokenisation process consists of 3 steps, namely pre-tokenisation step, which refers to all the steps that happen in the real, non-digital, world before the asset is tokenised and put on a chain. The tokenisation step refers to putting all relevant data and data pointers on a blockchain and creating the tokens. And lastly, the post-tokenisation step refers to the distribution of the tokens and the management of the physical asset and tokens. 



 There are 5 key aspects of tokenisation that need to be considered during the process of tokenising and securitising real world assets: technology, secondary markets &amp; liquidity, legal &amp; compliance, custody &amp; settlements, and dispute resolution. 



 The benefits of tokenising real world assets are the fractionalisation of assets, greater liquidity, increased transparency, and lower transaction costs. 



 The disadvantages and possible risks of tokenising real world assets are the fragmentation of ownership, regulatory uncertainty, technical complexity, and counterparty risk. 



 The future of tokenisation is uncertain as there are many challenges ahead before tokenisation can become mainstream but with the right people leading the way tokenisation can become the future of asset management, given the great potential of the tokenisation of real world assets.

<p>Let’s start with what the tokenisation of real world assets actually means!</p>



 What is the tokenisation of real world assets?  



<p>The tokenisation of real world assets refers to the process of creating a (fractionalised) digital twin of a real world asset that can be traded on a blockchain network. The tokenisation process comes with a variety of benefits. Such are the ability to exchange and own the asset in a more secure and transparent manner. But also things like the provenance of the asset, as well as proofs of labor, and more.</p>



<p>The tokenisation of assets also allows them to be divided into smaller parts, making them available to a wider range of investors. Additionally, these assets can easily be traded on global marketplaces increasing their availability to a wide range of investors even further.</p>



<p>Real world asset tokenisation is not limited to certain types of asset classes either. Instead, tokenisation has the potential to benefit a diverse range of asset classes such as tangible assets like real estate, art, precious metals, and luxury goods, as well as intangible assets such as financial instruments, <a href="https://zaisan.io/invoice-financing-tokenisation/">invoices</a>, and carbon credits.</p>



<p>Fractional ownership of properties, for instance, is possible through the tokenisation of real estate, allowing investors to buy and sell small percentages of high-value properties. Similarly, the tokenisation of art can make art investments more accessible to a broader range of investors by allowing them to buy and sell fractions of high-value pieces.</p>



<p>Lastly, tokenisation can potentially solve some of the challenges linked with traditional ownership structures. Tokenisation enables more transparent and efficient ownership structures that can reduce expenses, fraud, and disputes. Smart contracts can also automate many of the processes associated with asset ownership, including transfers, payments, and maintenance.</p>



 How the tokenisation of real world assets works 



<p>Now it’s clear what the tokenisation of real world assets actually means. Let’s take a look at what the process of tokenising a real world asset looks like.<br>In short, the process can be described in 3 main steps, namely the pre-tokenisation, tokenisation, and post-tokenisation steps. Let’s explain this further!</p>



 Pre-tokenisation 



<p>Pre-tokenisation refers to all the steps that happen in the real, non-digital, world before the asset is tokenised and put on a chain. The main parts of this step depend on the type of asset that is being tokenised. It can generally be divided into formalising the value of the asset, verifying ownership of the asset, and ensuring the right processes are in place in order to take care of the maintenance and management of the physical asset, as well as legal processes in case of liquidations, dispute resolutions, and enforcement.</p>



 Tokenisation 



<p>Once the pre-tokenisation step has been completed. It is time to make a digital representation of the asset in the form of tokens. The main part of this step is making sure all relevant information about the asset is either put on a blockchain or pointed to from the blockchain and then creating the tokens of the real world asset.</p>



<p>The connection between relevant data in traditional databases and data on the blockchain is facilitated through the use of (decentralised) oracles in order to ensure all relevant information is accurately represented on the blockchain. These oracles collect data from traditional databases and broadcast it to the blockchain. Furthermore, decentralised oracles do the same but do this collectively in order to reach a consensus on the accuracy and validity of the data being broadcasted to the blockchain.</p>



 Post-tokenisation 



<p>After the previous steps have been completed and the tokenised asset has been created, it’s time to start distributing/selling the tokenised assets. This is typically done through marketplaces or offerings specialised in these kinds of assets. Part of this step is also the perpetual management of both the physical asset and the tokens based on the rules previously set. For something like an art piece this could include the storage of the piece, maintenance of the piece, insurance of the piece, etc., as well as the management of the tokens, including the management of the information about the token.</p>

 Key aspects of the tokenisation of real world assets  



<p>During the tokenisation process the value chain with its stakeholders remains central. Here are 5 key aspects of tokenisation that need to be considered during the process of tokenising and securitising real world assets which all play a role in the success of the whole process. They can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Technology  



 Secondary markets &amp; Liquidity  



 Legal &amp; Compliance  



 Custody &amp; Settlement  



 Dispute resolution  
 



<p>Let’s take a look at each of these aspects!</p>



 1. Technology 



<p>One of the first and foremost aspects of the tokenisation process is the technology aspect. This refers to all the technical questions such as which blockchain will be used, what data standards will be used, if the tokens will be fungible or non-fungible, and more.</p>



<p>The type of blockchain that is best suited for tokenising an asset usually depends on the goals one has in mind when tokenising an asset. Different blockchains have different data standards suited for specific purposes and different marketplaces which facilitate the trading of tokens of real world assets. Additionally, the costs of deploying a tokenised asset on a certain blockchain is of importance. Another key component is smart contract support and the preferred programming language of the smart contracts. And lastly, specific communities on a blockchain can also influence if a tokenised asset is likely to succeed in a certain ecosystem.</p>



<p>All of these considerations combined, along with the decision to go for a certain data standard which determines whether you will end up with a fungible or non-fungible token can be a key determining factor of the success of the tokenised asset.</p>



 2. Secondary markets &amp; Liquidity  



<p>The second aspect to consider during the tokenisation process is the availability of secondary markets and liquidity. This is usually closely related to the choice of blockchain, as most marketplaces tend to support tokens or assets from a single blockchain. Although this is likely to change with a multi-chain future around the corner.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the availability of trusted and proven marketplaces and a community to facilitate the liquidity of the tokens is essential for the success of a tokenised asset.</p>



 3. Legal &amp; Compliance  



<p>The third aspect to consider in the tokenisation process is the regulatory and legal side of things which is relevant at all stages of the process, especially for assets that are deemed to be securities or require other regulatory oversight.</p>



<p>The first part of this is regulatory compliance. Tokenising physical assets usually involves regulatory requirements depending on the jurisdiction in which the asset is located. For example, in the United States, securities laws may apply if the tokens represent ownership in the asset and are sold to investors. Compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations are usually also required either when selling the tokens or when registering on a token marketplace.</p>



<p>The process of issuing tokens should also be carried out in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This includes ensuring that the tokens are not being sold as unregistered securities. And lastly, there may be tax implications when tokenising a real world asset.</p>



 4. Custody &amp; Settlements  



<p>The fourth aspect to consider in the tokenisation process are any custody and settlement requirements. The tokenisation process basically just creates a digital twin of the asset, but for the asset to actually be tokenised various things ought to be considered. For example, it should be ensured that the ownership of the real world asset is actually in the hands of the token holders. And that the party that tokenises the real world asset holds the deeds and titles to prove the ownership of the asset at the time of tokenisation.</p>



<p>But this is of course not the only relevant point related to this aspect of the tokenisation process. Other things like the management of the physical asset needs to be carefully outlined. This refers to things like loans that need to be repaid before an asset can be released, measurements to prevent (and insure against) things like theft, loss, or damage also need to be agreed upon and be put in place, or arrangements regarding the movement, renovation, etc. of an asset.</p>



<p>These aforementioned considerations mostly refer to the management of the physical asset. But for the tokens, there are also various considerations depending on the jurisdiction. There may be restrictions on the transfer of tokens representing ownership of physical assets. For example, in some cases, the transfer of ownership may require the involvement of a licensed broker or agent.</p>



 5. Dispute resolution 



<p>The fifth and final aspect of the tokenisation process is dispute resolution. Even with all arrangements and precautions in place there will always be times where there are misunderstandings and disputes. So how does this work with tokenised real world assets?</p>



<p>When it comes to dispute resolution in the context of tokenised physical assets, the process can vary. This depends on the specific platform or protocol being used to facilitate the tokenisation. In most cases, the smart contract of the tokenised asset outlines the exact rules and agreements related to the token (and real world asset), as well as the process for dispute resolution.</p>



<p>However, another approach is to rely on established legal systems and frameworks to resolve disputes. For example, if a dispute arises between parties involved in a tokenised real estate transaction, traditional real estate laws, and courts could be used to resolve the dispute.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that tokenisation of physical assets is a relatively new technology. There may be some legal grey areas and uncertainties when it comes to dispute resolution. As a result, it’s important for parties involved in tokenised physical asset transactions to seek legal advice and carefully consider the terms and conditions of any smart contracts or agreements before entering into a transaction.</p>



 Benefits of tokenisation of real world assets  



<p>But what exactly are the benefits of tokenising real world assets? Some of these advantages can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Fractionalisation  



 Greater liquidity  



 Increased transparency  



 Lower transaction costs  
 



 1. Fractionalisation 



<p>Tokenisation allows assets to be divided into smaller portions which means that investors can buy and sell fractions of an asset, rather than having to buy the whole asset. For example, instead of buying an entire real estate property, investors can purchase a percentage of ownership in the property. This opens up investment opportunities to a wider range of investors, including those who may not have enough capital to buy an entire asset.</p>



<p>Another benefit of the fractionalisation is that it allows for more flexible ownership structures which can be better tailored to the investors, in turn increasing the appeal of the investment.</p>



<p>Lastly, the fractionalisation of assets can also be beneficial for community building, in the case of valuable art for example. Instead of having a single owner, it becomes a community-owned asset which can increase both the appeal and value of a physical asset. Who wouldn’t want to own part of the Mona Lisa?</p>



 2. Greater liquidity  



<p>Tokenisation makes assets more accessible and tradable on a blockchain, which can increase liquidity. In traditional markets, it can be difficult to find buyers and sellers for certain assets. However, by tokenising an asset and trading it on a blockchain, investors can quickly and easily buy and sell the tokens without needing to go through intermediaries. This can increase the speed and efficiency of transactions, making it easier for investors to enter and exit the market. And unlike traditional asset purchases transactions are instantaneous and seamless.</p>



<p>Furthermore, given that the asset is split up into smaller portions (represented by tokens) the asset becomes an investment opportunity to a wider range of investors, increasing liquidity even further.</p>



<p>It is important to note though that this is not the case for every type of asset depending on the jurisdiction in which the physical asset resides. Token transactions may still be subject to rules and regulations which can make the buying or transfer process equally inefficient as the regular process, and possibly even more cumbersome in some cases.</p>



 3. Increased transparency  



<p>Tokenisation can make it easier to track ownership and movement of assets, as all transactions are recorded on a blockchain. This increases transparency and reduces the risk of fraudulent activity, as ownership of the asset is easily verifiable. Additionally, since all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, it is easier to audit the history of the asset (and tokens). Thus, this can be important for compliance and regulatory purposes.</p>



<p>This can also be beneficial for tracking the provenance of certain assets, as the digital twin can contain the full history of the physical asset.</p>



 4. Lower transaction costs  



<p>Generally speaking, tokenisation can reduce the costs associated with buying, selling, and managing assets. By removing the need for intermediaries like brokers and custodians, tokenisation can significantly reduce transaction fees. Additionally, tokenisation has the potential to make it easier to manage assets. All ownership and transaction data is stored on the blockchain, reducing administrative and legal costs associated with traditional asset management.</p>



<p>It is important to mention however that the tokenisation process can also increase costs if the stakeholders want greater trust and transparency before, during, and after the tokenisation process.</p>



 Disadvantages of tokenisation of real world assets 



<p>As with any novel technology, there are never only advantages. Some of the disadvantages and possible risks of tokenising real world assets can be summed up as follows:</p>



 
 Fragmentation  



 Regulatory uncertainty  



 Technical complexity  



 Counterparty risk  
 



 1. Fragmentation 



<p>While fractionalisation can be seen as a benefit, it can also lead to the fragmentation of ownership. The more diversified the ownership of an asset becomes, the more difficult it will be to reach consensus on decisions related to the asset which can possibly lead to conflicts between token holders, which consecutively could impact the value of the asset.</p>



 2. Regulatory uncertainty  



<p>As the use of tokenisation is relatively nascent, there is still regulatory uncertainty surrounding it. This can create challenges for both investors and issuers alike, as they may be unsure about how to comply with regulations, and which regulations apply to tokenisation exactly.</p>



<p>Furthermore, new regulations surrounding tokenisation could also pose new threats and hurdles to the overall tokenisation process.</p>



 3. Technical complexity  



<p>Tokenisation requires technical knowledge to implement. It can prove to be a barrier for everyday asset owners looking to tokenise their assets. But a steep learning curve is not the only possible barrier. A lack of understanding of all the aspects of the technological side can lead to poorly designed and written smart contracts. In turn, this opens the door to hackers and cyberattacks.</p>



<p>Furthermore, given the technical complexity of using this kind of technology token holders of lower technical proficiency may be more susceptible to falling for new forms of scams and hacks.</p>



 4. Counterparty risk 



<p>While tokenisation can reduce the need for intermediaries, it can also create new forms of counterparty risk. As is the case with any type of marketplace or exchange, if the tokens are held on that marketplace or exchange, you do not control the funds yourself. If one of these exchanges goes bankrupt or gets hacked, it can become difficult to recover the investments on that marketplace or exchange.</p>



<p>While this can of course be mitigated by taking the tokens out of the platform, history has shown that many people still prefer the convenience of keeping their tokens on an exchange, despite the possible risks. Furthermore, if organisations want to manage their tokenised assets themselves they might require specific roles and functions to manage the relevant wallets which hold the tokens.</p>



 Fractional ownership: the future?  



<p>The tokenisation of real world assets has clear benefits and opens up many new opportunities. However, on the flip side, there are also many challenges ahead. As with any nascent technology, it remains to be seen whether tokenisation will become the norm for ownership of various types of real world assets or just a small technological sidestep with little impact.</p>



<p>For tokenisation to become the norm, pioneers will need to pave the way for others. There will need to be major developments in terms of technology, marketplaces, regulations, and more before tokenisation can become mainstream. Nonetheless, with the clear benefits in mind and the constantly growing interest in web3 technologies , the future seems bright for tokenisation.</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, data storage is a crucial component for all applications, regardless of their scope or complexity. While traditional Web2 offers a wealth of storage options tailored to various use cases, such as SQL, NoSQL, Filestorage, S3, and FTP, the transition to Web3 demands a similar expansion of storage infrastructure to accommodate its unique requirements.</p><p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> has emerged as the de-facto standard for storing data in Web3, with its decentralized file storage protocol being ideal for images, videos, and static content. However, IPFS was never designed to handle personal data, and thus, a more suitable solution is necessary.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/data-storage">Verida DbStore</a>, the first “self-sovereign” database infrastructure for Web3, which promises to revolutionize how data is managed by offering users guaranteed ownership, the speed and performance of traditional databases, and the ability to permanently delete their data. As a new decentralized infrastructure and architecture, Verida DbStore is specifically designed for rapid access to highly changing, structured personal data with encryption as a fundamental aspect of the protocol.</p><p>Let’s delve into the intricacies of IPFS and Verida DbStore, comparing their architecture, security, performance, storage types, and suitability for handling personally identifiable information (PII).</p>At a glance: IPFS vs Verida&nbsp;DbStore Architecture <p>IPFS consists of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of block storage nodes, where each node is responsible for data identified by its unique hash. Users can retrieve data from any node, which collaborates with other nodes to locate and return the requested information.</p>IPFS consists of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of block storage&nbsp;nodes<p>On the other hand, Verida is a P2P network of database storage nodes, each responsible for a user-specific queryable database. Data on the network is identified by the owner and database name. To retrieve data, users look up the database storage nodes associated with a user and request the data from one or more nodes. Data is replicated across multiple nodes based on geographical and user preferences.</p>With Verida, a user can use their private key to sign, encrypt and access their&nbsp;data Type of&nbsp;storage <p>IPFS stores unstructured blobs of data such as images, videos or&nbsp;PDFs.</p><p>Verida stores structured data in a document database that can be queried, indexed and replicated.</p> Security <p>IPFS lacks native authentication or encryption, making all stored data publicly accessible without permissions or security restrictions, akin to a globally distributed hard drive with universal read&nbsp;access.</p><p>In contrast, Verida incorporates end-to-end encryption as a fundamental aspect of its protocol. All data requires authorization for access and a decryption key, ensuring security on par with traditional database infrastructure. Verida also offers flexible permission configuration for each user database, allowing control over read, write, update, and delete permissions.</p> Performance <p>IPFS, inspired by torrenting technology, uses distributed hash tables to find content across nodes. While this allows for fast read responses when data is cached locally, it leads to significant latency in discovering new data, resulting in unpredictable and slow response times. This latency issue makes IPFS unsuitable for dynamically changing data without additional protocols.</p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ipfs-measurements/">Real world data from Cloudflare showing an average response time of 44.4 seconds for newly created content on&nbsp;IPFS.</a><p>In contrast, Verida is designed for sub-second reads and writes. Although there’s some initial overhead in discovering a user’s database, once connected, data transfer occurs via a P2P socket connection. This makes Verida ideal for applications requiring “web2-like” performance, where interactions are primarily “app-to-user” or “user-to-user.”</p> Suitable for&nbsp;PII <p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes sensitive data like health records, names, addresses, and financial records that are legally protected in most countries. Regulations dictate the storage, transfer, and user rights concerning PII.</p><p>IPFS, a globally decentralized network, is unsuitable for storing PII because it offers no control over data storage or replication, nor guarantees data deletion, which is necessary for compliance with the “right to be forgotten” in many jurisdictions.</p><p>Verida DbStore, also a globally decentralized network, allows users to control where their data is stored. By default, the <a href="https://www.verida.io/">Verida Wallet </a>selects <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/infrastructure/storage-node">storage nodes</a> in the user’s country or region, ensuring regulatory compliance. Users can change these nodes or host their own for greater self-sovereignty. They can also delete their data from storage nodes, delete their identity and data entirely, and exercise their “right to be forgotten.” Verida combines the advantages of decentralization with regulatory compliance.</p>The <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk">Verida Client SDK</a> is designed to empower user’s to control where their data is&nbsp;stored. IPFS as a base&nbsp;layer <p>Numerous projects are developing decentralized database infrastructure for Web3 using IPFS, including Textile, Ceramic, and Web5. At first glance, this approach may appear logical, as IPFS serves as the filesystem for Web3 and could potentially be transformed into a queryable database. However, this strategy proves to be impractical.</p><p>This approach is similar to constructing a permissioned, encrypted MySQL on a public S3 bucket. This would be slow and vulnerable to security threats, making it an undesirable option. While some projects incorporate an encryption layer over IPFS, the eventual breaking of current encryption would leave the data exposed, as it is both public and permanently accessible. In contrast, Verida safeguards encrypted data through authentication and authorization layers, adhering to industry best practices for protecting sensitive information.</p><p>To address these issues, some projects introduce additional server-side infrastructure on top of IPFS, forming new “storage networks.” However, if extra infrastructure is necessary, it would be more efficient to build on a foundation designed as a database from the outset, rather than relying on an ill-suited base technology like&nbsp;IPFS.</p><p>It is essential to note that IPFS is suitable for various use cases, such as storing immutable public records, NFT images or videos, or whitepaper PDFs. However, it is not an ideal choice for personal data storage, which necessitates a more fitting alternative.</p> Verida’s approach <p>At Verida, we’ve adopted a groundbreaking approach by creating nodes that are not based on IPFS, but rather on well-established database technology that supports authorization, permissions, and decentralized identity standards. This innovative strategy combines the best of both worlds: the reliability of battle-tested, industry-leading database technology and seamless integration with emerging decentralized identity standards through our provided <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk">SDKs</a> and server components.</p><p>In a world where users can own their personal data, it’s critical to provide a mechanism to share encrypted data with third parties. The Verida protocol leverages encrypted data replication which is facilitated by peer-to-peer database synchronization at the protocol&nbsp;level.</p><p>This standards based architecture allows for the addition of various storage engines, making Verida DbStore the first of many decentralized storage solutions expected to emerge over the next decade. This forward-thinking infrastructure ensures that we stay ahead in the evolution of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>We invite you to explore Verida DbStore through the <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/databases">interactive tutorial</a> in our <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">developer documentation</a> and join us on our mission to empower users with self-sovereign identity and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Together, we can shape the future of Web3 and unlock its full potential.</p> Want to learn&nbsp;more?

<p></p><p>Communities play an important role in any blockchain and crypto projects. Community members became project ambassadors and were the first to spread the word about these new revolutionary technologies. In this article, see how Horizen leverages its community thanks to its ambassador program.</p>



 Blockchain and crypto projects rely on their communities.&nbsp; 



<p>It is due to the precursory character of these technologies. They are too avant-garde for the mainstream media and too complicated for the general public. It took communities to be able to take an interest in emerging projects and to promote them more widely.</p>



<p>Take bitcoin, for example. One of its strengths is drawn from its original community, the cypherpunks. These are the best cryptographers in the world who helped the bitcoin technology emerge and have given it credit, as well as shedding light on revolutionary technology.</p>



 What is a (crypto) community? 



<p>Suppose we have a look at the definition of community. In that case, we find:</p>



 
 a unified body of individuals: such as the people with common interests living in a particular area 



 &nbsp;a group of people with a common characteristic or interest living together within a larger society 



 a body of persons of common and especially professional interests scattered through a larger society 
 



<p>(source: <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community</a>)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto communities were born with people with shared crypto and freedom interests, living on the internet. They are linked by a shared policy (e.g., decentralization, banking freedom, currency sovereignty) but are still part of a larger society. Everybody can join the ownership by owning cryptos! And that’s the beautiful thing about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we know that the emergence of crypto and blockchain technologies is due to their communities, how do we use this strength by being a blockchain project?</p>



<p>The answer is with Horizen and its Zenvangelists!</p>



 The Horizen Ambassador Program 



<p>The Zenvangelists are active members form the Horizen community who are dedicated to contributing to and growing with Horizen. </p>



<p>&nbsp;Zenvangelists are web3 believers from all walks of life who are passionate about Horizen. Anybody can become a Zenvangelist, as long as they are:</p>



 
 A part of the Horizen community. 



 Interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general 



 Always willing to help other members of the community 



 Eager to contribute to the growth of the Horizen community  



 Want to be committed to continuous learning and education 



 Be a self-starter (autonomous, self-taught, in short: passionate) 
 



<p>How do we empower our Zenvangelists?</p>



 
 We are always available for guidance and support 
 



 
 We hold monthly meetings where they can discuss community matters and share ideas with the Horizen team and leadership 



 Zenvangelists have exclusive early access to new Horizen product and service releases before the public 



 We help Zenvangelists grow their personal network and reach, improve their skill sets, and provide event opportunities to represent Horizen.   



 We reward Zenvangelists for their effort in many ways, including swagkit, ZEN rewards, free event participations etc. 
 



 Some are Legends! 



<p>They are OGs, community, and project backbones or have joined us recently but have shown exceptional activity: let me introduce you to the Legend Zenvangelists.</p>



<p>Let me introduce you to our Zenvangelists: <a href="https://twitter.com/mahnoor089">Mahnoor,</a> our daily task moderator, <a href="https://twitter.com/pvmihalache">PVM</a>, our party organizer, <a href="https://twitter.com/DeFiFUDDestroy">DeFi-Money-Printer</a>, our livestream host, <a href="https://twitter.com/paragism_">Paragism</a>, our technical writer and <a href="https://twitter.com/xgarreau">Xavier</a>, our technologies tester and community teacher.&nbsp;</p>

															Why Horizen?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;In short, I chose Horizen because of its strong community, its innovative vision, and its potential to make a real difference in the world.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;Mainly because of the privacy focus, constant development, and great potential. The innovating sidechains were giving new tools to developers, with $ZEN powering the future of DeFi, Play2Earn games, DApps, Web3, and NFT projects</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;What first garnered my interest in crypto, as many like to joke about being “in it for the tech” was truly my growing interest in GPU mining. I’d tried to mine Ethereum at the time and had been failing with graphics drivers and related issues, so I found that ZEC was comparably profitable at the time and was easy to set up and get going.</p>
<p>When I found that Horizen would have the same algorithm and supply of coins, I saw opportunity at being an early supporter. The passion of the team at an early stage and to this day has always been something that stands out to me.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;Horizen looked like a big project and has since grown even bigger. There are 3 companies, a doxxed team, a news website, a blog, the academy, an open GitHub, the Horizen Early Adopter’s Program, and the HDE (Horizen Developer Environment). There are tools for the community: Discord, Twitter accounts, and Telegram channels … It even has a meme coin^^</p>
<p>There was a lot of work to build the Zendoo protocol, and since it was released, a new era has started, with Tokenmint and EON. I hope many sidechains will be added to the ecosystem in the coming months/years.</p>
<p>Paragism:&nbsp;The strong ethos of privacy attracted me initially. I also found Horizen very dedicated to bringing new innovations with its research-driven culture and strives to push technological boundaries. This blockchain project keeps delivering back-to-back developments with continuous R&amp;D regarding various vital parameters to achieve high scalability and extendibility.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;The project has a clear vision, excellent leadership, a capable team, unique technology, and major industry partners. Horizen ticks all the boxes, and with Horizen EON launching, we will soon see Horizen carve out its market fit.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;At the end of 2017, while preparing for my own business, I wanted to learn more about the blockchain area. At that time, I found the ZenCash homepage and sent a direct email to send a proposal saying that I would like to work while learning.</p>
<p>We also asked for consent by presenting an article on zencash’s forum, which is now unused.</p>
<p>At the same time, I conducted various communication, such as sharing many conversations and Korean market research.</p>
<p>Based on that, I joined the current Horizen, and I strongly agree with the direction we are heading now, the role as a platform, and the cultivation of an ecosystem that focuses on practically necessary privacy such as Data-Privacy.</p>
<p>I first announced the launch of Horizen Korea at ZenCon0, and since then I have made preliminary contact with many partners for Horizen Korea in Korea.</p>
<p>Now that we are almost ready to announce the business outline and official launch, we will soon be able to meet Horizen Korea, which is taking on various challenges as much as the Korean community members expect of Horizen.</p>
<p>Guan:&nbsp;Because the project has a sustainable funding model and cool graphic designs. Horizen is an inclusive ecosystem where everyone is rewarded for their contributions.</p>

						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;I’ve been actively involved in the crypto ecosystem since 2019, and I’ve been passionate about the potential of blockchain technology to transform the way we live and work. Since then, I’ve been exploring different projects and communities in the space, and I was excited to join the Horizen team in late 2021.</p>
<p>As someone who has always been interested in the intersection of technology and finance, I was drawn to Horizen’s vision of a decentralized, privacy-focused ecosystem that empowers individuals to control their assets and data. I’ve been impressed by the team’s commitment to innovation and dedication to building a community-driven platform that can make a difference in people’s lives.</p>
<p>As a tracker of daily task submissions, I’ve had the opportunity to engage with Horizen users daily and see firsthand their enthusiasm and passion for the project. I’m honored to be part of such a vibrant and dynamic community, and I’m excited to see what the future holds for Horizen and the wider crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;I joined the Zenvangelists in May 2021. I was expanding my reach into the Cryptoverse and was happy I could join the community. I was enhancing my blockchain knowledge, and Horizen was one of the chains that impressed me.</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;I’ve been involved with Horizen since early 2017 very near the launch of the project when I first heard about it being supported on the first ever exchange for Horizen, Bittrex, which happened to be the first alt-coin exchange I had used in my crypto journey.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;I don’t remember when I first heard about Bitcoin, but at the time, I thought it was cooler to search for Alien life running SETI or help research with Folding@home than to mine cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>I saw all this crash in 2018 and thought the ecosystem had turned to silly speculation.</p>
<p>But, after a while, during the bear market, I started looking into the ecosystem again and saw great people building interesting projects. I bought some cryptos and read a lot of whitepapers.</p>
<p>I started a website. The first tutorials I wrote were about Bitgreen and Zelcash (now Flux) configuration.</p>
<p>In 2020, I started looking into masternodes and Horizen was one of my first ones. A Secure Node was cheap, and the APY was very good before the halving.</p>
<p>I started to dig deeper into Horizen with the public release of Zendoo on the testnet, tested it on a VPS, completed some HDE tasks, and therefore wrote some articles.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;Horizen was one of the first coins I bought when I started my crypto journey in 2017. I wasn’t active in the community then, but I used to lurk on Telegram. I was always impressed by how accessible the team was, and Rob was always in the chat, answering questions and engaging with the community.&nbsp; His passion was infectious. During the 2018/19 bear market, I became more involved in the community. I tried to help where I could, such as live streaming the weekly team meetings, amplifying Horizen news through HorizenClips, and doing some end-of-year and zendoo launch community Livestream events.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;I learned about Bitcoin from the end of 2015 and started mining with my computer at home. I didn’t get as much volume as the current Bitcoin whales, but I started to pay more attention to the technology called blockchain rather than profit.</p>
<p>Technically, it came out earlier, but the technology that was almost dead came back to the world through an example of Bitcoin, and since then, as new technologies such as Ethereum’s smart contracts have been introduced, the blockchain industry has begun to draw attention.</p>
<p>These days, diversity that can be utilized within the blockchain industry, such as NFT, is possible, but in the past, there were many people who took a business approach with a conceptual nature as a simple payment method. In it, I was obsessed with the thought of whether it would be right for someone to look into my wallet address, even though it is a wallet address made up of addresses that are very long and difficult for people to memorize.</p>
<p>From this point of view, even in terms of a simple payment method, we can see the importance of privacy.</p>

						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;For those interested in joining the Zenvangelist program or any other crypto community, I would say: go for it! Being part of a community is a great way to learn, grow, and contribute to a larger cause. It’s an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals, share your knowledge and experience, and make a difference.</p>
<p>My advice would be to start by getting involved in the community in whatever way feels most comfortable to you. This could mean joining a Discord group, participating in social media discussions, attending meetups or events, or contributing to open-source projects. Whatever you choose, be sure to stay engaged, be respectful, and be open-minded. Everyone in the community is there to learn and grow; working together can achieve great things.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t be afraid to take on leadership roles and responsibilities within the community. Whether becoming a Zenvangelist, organizing an event, or contributing to a project, stepping up and taking action is the best way to make a real impact and show dedication to the cause. So, if you’re passionate about crypto and blockchain, I encourage you to get involved and join a community today.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;The Zenvangelist Program, like the majority of crypto communities, empowers the users. You bring your skills, work with others, and learn. Being part of a strong, vibrant, and fun community will bring more knowledge than many courses.</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;For any community members whether new or old my greatest advice to give would be to never underestimate the impact you may have on the communities and projects you are involved in, and in many cases opportunities will arise and those passionate community members certainly stand out of the crowd (and if not make sure you let yourself be heard in a constructive manner) a little effort goes a long way when we all work together to build something greater than one team or project can build alone.</p>
<p>Paragism:&nbsp;Horizen community is rich in resources. It will enable you to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual growth of the ecosystem. The sense of togetherness is profound and enjoyable here.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;Joining a crypto community is still the best way to learn about the ecosystem and a project.</p>
<p>The more you speak with people, meet others, and share what you know, the more your knowledge and comprehension grow. That’s a win-win. You become better and help others understand our ecosystem.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;I say jump in! The Zenvangelist program is great because you can tailor it to suit your own unique talents! It is also a great way for you to get to know the team and community better, and it can help open lots of doors if you are pursuing a career in crypto.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;Sure! In the Korean community, there are many valuable members who play many roles. For example, AstarZen is directly producing PFP NFTs for node operators in our Korean community. Needless to say, Ken is also the spiritual pillar of our Korean community.</p>
<p>Guan:&nbsp;We are an honest and lovely community with many interesting and smart people! Come on and join us, You won’t regret it!</p>

															How does it feel to be named Legend Zenvangelist?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor: Being recognized as a Legend Zenvangelist within the Horizen community is amazing. Being acknowledged for my contributions and dedication is an honor.</p>
<p>I believe it helps promote the project, impart my wisdom and experience, and assist in adopting and engaging new users.</p>
<p>However, having the title of Legend Zenvangelist carries more obligations than just a title. It entails continuing to be involved and active in the community, sharing my knowledge and suggestions, and assisting in determining the project’s direction. It entails setting an example for others and motivating them to get involved and change the world.</p>
<p>Overall, being recognized as a Legend Zenvangelist is humbling, and it inspires me to keep putting in the effort and helping the Horizen community. I’m happy to be a part of this thriving ecosystem and eager to see what we can accomplish together.</p>
<p>PVM: I feel proud to be named a Legend Zenvangelist but still humble. It’s a title that makes me feel appreciated and the reason to keep working as hard as I did until now. Now I have to lead by example and maintain high standards</p>
<p>DeFi: It’s an honor to be recognized as Legend Zenvagelist, and my pleasure to see where the Horizen Ecosystem has come from, to where it is now, and being a part of where it is going. I truly believe the greater market is largely unaware of the constant building going on throughout the years and could be near the precipice of true recognition as a DeFi, Smart Contract platform – being secured by the largest node network and hybrid Proof of Work network structure under the hood.</p>
<p>Paragism: It is a matter of pride. Horizen community has empowered me to bring positive changes. I am grateful that my involvement and work have been recognised.</p>
<p>Xavier: That’s a funny bonus, but honestly, being called a legend wasn’t part of the plan when I joined the Zenvangeslists^^</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp; I feel a little undeserving because I have been pretty quiet in the community lately as I have been busy launching a new business in Seoul. But Horizen is definitely my favourite project!</p>
<p>Jonghun: I am delighted to hear that I have been selected among the valued Zenvangelists for more diverse endeavors. I am happy that I will work harder in the future with Horizen Korea as my new starting point, but I accept it with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Guan: I feel so honored to be a Legend Zenvangelist, spreading Horizen is a significant thing in such a very early stage!&nbsp; I also meet a lot of super cool ZEN-frens from all over the world. It’s a fantastic journey in my life!</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Mahnoor, thank you so much for being here every day for the community. You were even here during your maternity leave to help the fellowship. Where do you find this constant energy to be present in the community?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I believe that the crypto and blockchain space has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about money, data, and identity, and I’m committed to doing my part to help bring about that change. Whether it’s through tracking daily task submissions, answering questions in Discord groups, or participating in social media discussions, I always try to be available and responsive to community members.</p>
<p>Of course, there are times when it can be challenging to balance community involvement with other responsibilities, such as family or work. But ultimately, I believe that being present for the community is an important part of my role, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute in any way I can.</p>
<p>Overall, my energy and enthusiasm for the Horizen community comes from my belief in its potential and my passion for the work that we’re doing. I’m honored to be a part of this dynamic and innovative ecosystem, and I look forward to continuing to contribute in any way I can.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: PVM, you are our event Zenvangelist and an excellent writer. So tell us, what is the best: hosting or participating in the party?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: Hosting parties and events is fun, and taking part is even better. My friends tell me to make “PVM Entertainment and Leisure” a real thing, as the events I create are always top of the crop!</p>
<p>This is what I love to do … to create events that suit every crypto user, from NFT lovers to Crypt edges. I constantly think about new party activities and themes and ways to reward the participants with memories and good vibes”</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: DeFi, you are the new Horizen community voice. You have great skills in hosting and green screen management. What came first, the desire to play with editing software or to talk about the Horizen project entertainingly?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: AI would say my desire in content, editing, and feeling though I have an above average understanding of many concepts that others may benefit from all to tie in together, but to answer which came first, it was the tinkering around while bringing some creativity to the mix – I’d been doing so since the Windows XP era on Windows Movie Maker… Although the quality and effort was poor at best, I always try to make incremental improvements over time (even if it means two steps forwards, one step back at times).</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Paragism, what is different in the Horizen community?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: The Horizen community gives a sense of belonging. All ideas are welcomed and we get to see plenty of expressions. The community members also get to learn new things and hone their skills.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Xavier, you are the always-willing-to-try-tech-things-guy among the Zenvangelists. You make great tutorials and create love, hug, and cakes in our tokenization platform and EVM. Where does this genuine willingness to share come from?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I love tech. I love to learn new technologies. I started coding at 7 and never stopped learning different flavors of basic (Turbo) pascal, c, c++, java, SQL, HTML, javascript, php, tcl, … and systems administration.</p>
<p>I’ve been sharing my knowledge since 98, I think. It was one of my end of studies projects to write a website generator in java (v1.0.2) and use it to generate a website. The website was called Alaide (that means“help needed” in French). It was a collection of tutorials about HTML 3.2, CGI programming, and java.</p>
<p>I then wrote articles for the French Linux magazine for several years, mainly about Linux development.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time browsing the apache forums and community websites like “léa Linux” or “le site du zéro.”</p>
<p>Nowadays, I work as a freelance sysadmin and developer and help my customers understand and face their tech problems. I’m still writing tutorials, helping people on Twitter and Discord, testing things, and helping people in their crypto journey.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Jonghun, you’re more than the Korean community backbone; you made it to the Horizen team! What made you stay at Horizen through the years?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I have had various experiences within the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>I helped launch a global exchange in Korea and played the role of COO, and I am advising on various projects.</p>
<p>Unlike many projects, Horizen always develops by clarifying the vision set in the beginning, responding to the market, and knowing how to adapt.</p>
<p>From a currency with a simple privacy function, now as a platform, we are expanding the ecosystem for various projects. Of course, we are preparing to support the use of the Privacy function where it is actually needed, rather than abandoning it.</p>
<p>In the Korean community, not only me but Ken and so many people are moving together.</p>
<p>Maybe not just community members, but each of them speaks a lot about Horizen’s development direction in a really logical and passionate way.</p>
<p>There was also strong support from the community about removing the shield pool from the main chain this time. When voting on this, members of the Korean community debated day and night.</p>
<p>In addition to my vision for Horizen, Horizen, with such a passionate community, will keep everyone in the future.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Guan, You are an OG who did much for the Horizen community. What made you stay through the years?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: The team always knows how to push things forward. the project’s core cross-chain protocol Zendoo solves scalability that can massively help many web2 businesses into web3.</p>

<p>Horizen inspired artwork from Zenvangelist <a href="https://twitter.com/S1DARTA0">Sidarta0</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>“I love the sleeping astronaut. A lot. But also <a href="https://sidarta.in/product/topsy-turvy-drawing/">Topsy Turvy</a>, one of the first artworks that got people from Horizen further interested in letting me have art on their products. I still have the original; it blows my mind that no one has ever bought it. I love the colors and the weird randomness. It was created in the flow. One of my favorites. Because I still remember the process. It was a fun piece to do. And also very hard to do again.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>Last but not least, special thanks to Psyrax, JC, our Legend Zenvangelist SupportMan, who is always available to assist the community with any node/mining-related questions. You’re the backbone of our Discord server, essential to the community. So, thank you!</p>

 Why release a transparency report? 



<p>Electric Coin Co. is committed to openness and transparency — as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital currency, and in support of our mission to empower people with economic freedom. This transparency report details company income, expenses, and use of funds during Q3 2022.</p>



<p>Key takeaways</p>



 
 Bootstrap received coins at a value below the ECC operating-expense level for Q3 2022. During this time, Bootstrap received coins at an average of $461,000 a month (at the Q3 average ZEC price, $60, for each of the three months’ distribution dates), and Bootstrap and ECC incurred average monthly expenses of approximately $766,000.&nbsp; 



 At the end of Q3 2022, Bootstrap and ECC collectively held approximately $3.0M in USD and approximately 116.9K ZEC.&nbsp; 



 As of March 16, 2023, the company held approximately $1.3M in USD and approximately 110K ZEC.&nbsp;

							<p>We could start this post by saying that our motivation to create a Zebra package for Arch Linux was that Arch enjoys the highest average rating of any Linux distribution on <a href="https://distrowatch.com/index.php?dataspan=score">DistroWatch</a>. However, the truth is that one of our engineers uses Arch (btw.), and he thought it would be handy to have Zebra packaged.</p><p>Packages in the official Arch repositories contain compiled binaries signed by their maintainers. The Arch developers maintain essential packages, and so-called trusted users maintain the rest. In addition to the official repositories, the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">Arch User Repository</a> (AUR) lets anyone from the Arch community share their own package. The difference is that AUR packages do not contain binaries but a script that pulls, builds, and installs the software for the user. Arch users are encouraged to inspect the script’s content before executing it.</p><p>Zebra is currently packaged in the AUR. The <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zebrad">package</a> prepares dependencies, pulls Zebra’s source code from GitHub, and builds and installs the same binary as the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/zfnd/zebra">Docker image</a>.</p><p>AUR users can vote for a package to increase its popularity, and trusted users can adopt popular packages and promote them to the official repositories. As the ArchWiki says, “a good number of new packages that enter the official repositories start in the AUR”. The original zcashd node already has an official package, and Zebra will hopefully follow. So if you are, by the way, using Arch, feel free to install the zebrad package and let us know how it went on our Discord, or on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/technology/zebra/46">Zcash Community Forums</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Electric Coin Co. (ECC) has been working since June to resolve Zcash wallet performance issues that are affecting users of third-party apps Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable.* All three of these mobile wallets utilize the ECC SDK.</p>



<p>Our engineers have made progress, however, work remains —&nbsp;including further updates to zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet — to fully restore good user experience in the impacted apps.</p>



<p>Solving these issues is our No. 1 priority, even taking precedence over our long term roadmap. Internally, we are calling this “Emergency Mode.”&nbsp;</p>



 The syncing problem 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented some wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. (The current wallet sync process requires scanning the entire blockchain before funds are available to be spent.) If a wallet won’t sync, a user can’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>



 What we’ve done so far 



<p>Within weeks of identifying the problem, ECC released two updates to zcashd that resolved full node issues, and work was underway on the SDKs. In October, we released zcashd 5.3.0 to fix out-of-memory issues, but further public releases specifically relevant to these syncing issues were delayed, as ECC engineers were pulled off task to build zcashd 5.3.3 and 5.4.2 — critical updates that remediated vulnerabilities inherited from Bitcoin Core.</p>



<p>Here’s a summary of what we’ve done, so far, to address wallet performance issues:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Released zcashd 5.1.0 and 5.2.0 in July to address performance in full nodes 



 Released zcashd 5.3.0 to fix a number of intermittent out-of-memory issues 



 Completed most of the code updates and testing for zcashd 5.5.0, which implements fee changes. Note: users should have the ability to spend funds without a full wallet sync upon the release of zcashd 5.6.0. 



 Completed a portion of the back-end work required to support the next release of the iOS and Android SDKs, which will include the first phase of an improved sync capability. 
 



 Exiting Emergency Mode 



<p>Our top priority is ensuring users can access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, so we’re building updates that will allow users to receive and spend new incoming funds faster,** and we’re implementing features that provide visibility on syncing progress.</p>



<p>Only after these capabilities are delivered —&nbsp;and when we’re confident that wallets are not being impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior —&nbsp;will we consider exiting Emergency Mode and widening our focus to include other initiatives.</p>



<p>The table below represents an estimated release schedule to address the wallet syncing issues. Each release is slated for delivery within a half-month window to allow for dozens of inherent dependencies. Interim releases may occur based on specific requirements or dependencies throughout this process. Version numbers listed may also change based on emergency or other unplanned impacts.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that after these releases are made available, third-party developers may need a number of days or weeks to implement and test.</p>



DateReleaseDetailsFirst half of April 2023zcashd 5.5.0A transaction-fee structure change based on overall size (inputs/outputs) and frequency of transactions (ZIP-317) will make attempts to spam or flood the network with txs much more expensive and unlikely. Mobile wallet users sending regular single recipient transactions will not be affected by this change.<br><br>Fund availability improvement will provide the ability to spend funds before a wallet is fully synchronized.&nbsp;<br><br>While this release will have no immediate positive effect on the wallet user experience, this is a necessary step toward exiting emergency mode.Second half of April 2023lightwalletd 0.5Partners currently running lightwalletd servers will need to apply this update to allow the future SDK capabilities to properly function and deliver an improved user experience via the mobile wallets.<br><br>Supports future zcash 5.6.0 update.Second half of AprilECC prototype walletThis initial version of the app is being developed with a minimum feature set as a test platform to validate current Zcash functionality and serve as a prototype for future feature development.<br><br>Initial distribution will be limited with a broader product launch later in 2023.Second half of May 2023zcashd 5.6.0DAGSync capability, which will enable fast sync and scanning of the blockchain<br><br>Users will not see the changes to the UX until the SDK update 0.6 (outlined below) goes out.Second half of May 2023Mobile SDK updates 0.6 (iOS &amp; Android)This update will include support for third-party app access to fund availability and improved sync capabilities.<br><br>Once this update is live, it will be up to the individual wallet developers to integrate the new features into their application, which will enable users to access their funds without issues and improve the overall Zcash user experience. This will end the emergency mode.



<p></p>



 



 



<p>* Based on community feedback, Ywallet has been working well and appears to be unaffected by high transaction load on the network.</p>



<p>** The speed benchmark we’ve set for downgrading from emergency mode is that a typical Zcash user can receive and spend funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in one hour. This is not a perfect measurement (use cases can vary wildly), nor is it our end goal (we know a great user experience demands more), but we believe it’s important to set a reference goal for internal and community alignment. Future speed improvements will be planned once the critical issues are resolved.</p>

  Alfredo Garcia describes a new Zebra feature to store Zcash block data in an elasticsearch database, which allows us to use Kibana to explore and visualize the data.

							<p>The Zcash blockchain history is big and rich—any block explorer application can just call RPC methods from a zcashd node and present the data in the desired way. Data analysis is hard in this context, on the one hand, you can just do what a specific application will allow you to do, or on the other hand if you need different visualization you have to create your own app.</p><p>As an alternative, we can export and index all block (header and transaction) data fields into an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">elasticsearch</a> database and use <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana/">Kibana</a> as a front end to do some analysis.</p><p>The possibilities of data visualization are huge with Kibana and all we need to do to create them is to feed an elasticsearch database with valid JSON block data.</p><p>When the elasticsearch feature is enabled, each block is sent from Zebra into elasticsearch; this is in addition to saving the block in the internal rocksdb database. We can then guarantee Zebra’s correct ongoing functionality and storage in the desired external database at the cost of more hard drive storage and a longer synchronization time.</p><p>Once the data has been inserted into the database, the Kibana part is easy. It may be able to provide many answers to existential questions our community deserves to know, for example:</p>  How many Orchard transactions have we had since its introduction? (Adoption)  How many shielded coinbase transactions have we had since its introduction? (Adoption)  How many Sprout transactions did we have in the last X period? (Deprecation)  How many transactions per block have we had on average since the start of the blockchain? (Information)  Which hours of the day are more transactions executed? (User distribution)  What is the average size of a block or transaction? (Parameters)  What is the distribution between Orchard, Sapling, Sprout and transparent transactions? (Information)  And many, many others.  						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
																														 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							The Zebra elasticsearch feature has only been tested on Testnet so far. Here is a guide on how to set it up; it is pretty easy.

What I think is needed next:
 
 	 Deploy the Mainnet in the cloud 
 	 Setup Kibana for listening to an external IP address. Optionally attach a domain name to it. 
 	 Create and share Kibana usernames and passwords between people interested in creating visualizations 
 	 Create dashboards with Zcash data 
 	 Share links to visualization in forums, twitter, news, etc. (external users do not need Kibana access to see shared visualizations)

<p>Scientific research &amp; publishing are gruelling tasks that extend outside the scope of science itself. Centralised publications abound in archaic practices that span from submitting a paper to getting it peer-reviewed and finally published, process which may take even up to years. In addition, research requires funding from very early stages of pursuing an idea, all the way to its finality (i.e. clinical trial or real-life applications). In TradSci (traditional science), funding is usually obtained once progress has already been achieved or when a startup has been formed.<br>DeSci (decentralised science) sets out to change this paradigm by funding early stage research via DAOs. When it comes to scientific publications, peer reviewing is also decentralised and incentivised, considerably speeding up the process. Moreover, contributions can be clearly retraced, avoiding false claims over IP, and the research itself becomes much more easily accessible and disseminated.</p><p>We were joined by Vincent Weisser &amp; Laurence Ion, stewards of Vita DAO, to discuss the advantages of DeSci in general, and the progress of longevity research in particular.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Vincent’s background and his interest in longevity  Laurence’s background and his interest in biotech  The purpose of DeSci  Which science branch is better suited for DeSci  How DeSci fixes contribution acknowledgement &amp; incentive misalignment  From research idea to startup via DeSci funding  $VITA token utility  Accelerating scientific publishing via DeSci  How IP is attributed in a DeSci setting  Project review and governance in Vita DAO  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentweisser">Vincent Weisser</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/longevion">Laurence Ion</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/vita_dao">Vita DAO</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/molecule_dao">Molecule DAO</a>  <a href="https://www.vitadao.com/projects">Vita DAO projects</a>  <a href="https://www.molecule.to/">Molecule</a>  <a href="https://www.bio.xyz/">Bio DAO launchpad</a>  <a href="https://www.longevityprize.com/">The Longevity Prize</a>  <a href="https://longevity.review/">The Longevity Decentralized Review</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst &amp; Meher Roy.

  Partnering with Hex: Data Collaboration Made Easy  <p>Barry, Caitlin, Glen and their team are building a collaborative workspace for the modern data stack—where delivering insights is seamless. </p>  <p>By Matt Miller and Michelle Bailhe Fradin</p><p>Published March 23, 2023</p>  



 
<p>Data is the competitive advantage of the 21st century. Without access to the right information, businesses are unable to make the quick decisions they need to survive—and any dream of AI is off the table. The good news is that the wave of the cloud has brought with it a whole set of new companies and technologies to collect and break down more information than we ever could have imagined, including cloud data warehouses, real-time data and integration, efficient data loading, transactional cloud databases, transformation and metrics. These products and others like them are giving us better information than ever before and the companies behind them have created more than $100B of market cap in the process.</p>



<p>The irony, though, is that atop this modern data stack, teams are still forced to use kludgy, decades-old analytics tools to actually make all of that data useful and deliver insights to users. But these are the types of opportunities we love at Sequoia: when a shift in the competitive landscape creates a clear opening for an enduring company to emerge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we are thrilled to embrace just such an opportunity and announce our partnership with <a href="https://hex.tech/">Hex</a>. We believe the platform that co-founders Barry McCardel, Caitlin Colgrove and Glen Takahashi and their team are creating has the potential to transform how businesses work together—in modern languages, with modern infrastructure. Hex starts its journey with data scientists, offering them the best way to collaborate on notebooks and work together to deliver insights. It ends with an analytics platform that empowers both business users and data analysts to quickly find the answers they need to do their jobs.</p>



<p>We learned about Hex through our partnerships with Snowflake and dbt, where customers were raving about their experiences with the product. People tell us they love the collaborative experience it offers and the ease it gives them in accessing the information they need. For some customers, Hex is already being used not only by data scientists, but the whole company.</p>



<p>When we first met Barry, Caitlin and Glen, they weren’t raising money. We are thankful to them for nonetheless being patient with our interest—and for seeing value in the opportunity to partner with us. We are excited to put Team Sequoia behind Hex, and we look forward to seeing them accomplish their dream of making data an easy and collaborative experience for everyone. By doing so, they will rightfully claim their spot as the crown jewel atop the modern data stack that is changing our world.</p>

      Developer Tools 2.0          
	By Charlie Curnin, Josephine Chen, and Stephanie Zhan	 



Illustration: Tyler Comrie



Published March 22, 2023
        Generative AI stands to change how work happens in one industry after another. But software engineering’s transformation isn’t done yet.        



 
<p>Copilot has caught lightning in a bottle. GitHub’s AI-powered companion for developers, suggesting the code you might want to write next, is a hit in more ways than one. It’s beloved by engineers, attracting more than <a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/">a million</a> within about a year and delivering a substantial boost in productivity. (Even if you’re a <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1608895189078380544">top engineer</a>, it might write half your code or more.) It also stands to become a commercial blockbuster. Charging $10-19 per seat per month, Copilot could grow to generate $1 billion or more in annual revenue among GitHub’s <a href="https://github.blog/2023-01-25-100-million-developers-and-counting/">100 million users</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Copilot’s success has set off a gold rush. Founders have raced to bring the power of large language models to all kinds of other industries, building tools to help professionals write, code, design and create media. There’s “Copilot for lawyers,” “Copilot for doctors” and “Copilot for designers,” and many more “Copilot for X”’s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are all exciting directions. We think <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">generative AI</a> stands to transform <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyatweetybird/status/1628446962742874112">one industry after another</a>, making all kinds of professionals <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-for-work-perspective/">more effective at work</a> and delighting waves of consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there’s a lot more to do for developers. Copilot, which leverages OpenAI’s model Codex, may be just the opening salvo in AI’s transformation of how software engineers work. Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">predicted</a> in 2017 that neural networks would create a new generation of software, “Software 2.0,” and we may see the same reinvention of the tooling that helps people make software—a “Developer Tools 2.0.”</p>



<p>There are many opportunities here. Some founders are iterating on the in-editor, get-help-while-you’re-coding experience Copilot popularized, trying different interaction patterns or different models. Think of Replit’s <a href="https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter">Ghostwriter</a>, Sourcegraph’s <a href="https://twitter.com/sourcegraph/status/1618719148087070721">Cody</a>, <a href="https://www.tabnine.com/">TabNine</a> and others.</p>



<p>Many other opportunities lie further afield. You might target work engineers do beyond writing code, like debugging and documentation—or other work engineering orgs do, like incident response. You might think of value props other than “write code faster,” like “write code that’s more performant or more secure.” You might throw out the plugin form factor and rebuild an entire application. You might focus on personas other than the software engineer, like the data scientist who needs a boost writing in notebooks (see: <a href="https://hex.tech/magic/">Hex</a>), or the data analyst toiling away writing SQL queries. There’s a wide waterfront of opportunities to explore and many places to hook into developers’ workflows.&nbsp;</p>
 



<p></p>







 
<p>Building legendary companies to enable this won’t be easy. Copilot faces <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446821/microsoft-openai-github-copilot-class-action-lawsuit-ai-copyright-violation-training-data">legal scrutiny</a> over concerns related to <a href="https://githubcopilotlitigation.com/pdf/06823/1-0-github_complaint.pdf">software piracy</a>. Microsoft, the incumbent with control over both GitHub and VS Code, enjoys significant distribution advantages. Many founders have started building with LLMs, making many opportunities competitive. GitHub itself just announced plans to offer broader AI functionality through a brand-new version of Copilot, powered by GPT-4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in our view, there’s a massive opportunity for AI to transform software engineering, and it’s a matter of who, not if. We think important ingredients in who prevails will be focusing on developer experience, providing net-new capabilities, and making strategic choices around how to land and expand in developers’ workflows. Success here can mean rewriting how engineering happens—and having a chance at building a generational company.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>On November 6, 2019, the Electric Coin Company (ECC) signed an <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Trademark-Agreement-ZF_ECC_notarized-pages-and-signed.pdf">agreement</a> with the Zcash Foundation (“ZF” or “Foundation”) to donate the worldwide trademark rights for registered Zcash logos and word marks. This donation is subject to a number of ongoing enforcement and performance obligations that ZF must undertake and maintain in order to remain in compliance with the agreement. The obligations include:</p><p>“Foundation will have the right, at its own expense, to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the trademark applications and registrations included in the Trademark Rights and the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of any new or additional U.S. and non-U.S. trademark applications and registrations for the Trademark Rights […] and agrees to take such actions as are necessary to […] maintain in good standing all trademark registrations”</p><p>In addition to the registration and enforcement requirements in the ECC/ZF agreement, ZF must also comply with trademark laws and regulations in fifteen countries/jurisdictions (including the European Union as one entity), with more likely to follow in the future. This is a significant undertaking by ZF as trademark related activities require both external and internal resources in order to ensure proper enforcement and maintenance of the registered marks.&nbsp;</p><p>Why is trademark enforcement important? In addition to ZF’s required actions under the ECC donation agreement and required actions under all registration jurisdictions, enforcement is important in order to:</p>  Identify official sources of information, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent or incorrect information.  Identify official apps and services, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent activities.  Protect the reputation of Zcash, its associated entities, and the Zcash community.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>How does ZF monitor trademark usage and how is enforcement initiated? ZF utilizes a multi-faceted approach:</p>  We work with multiple trademark lawyers to inform and lead our worldwide registration and enforcement efforts. These efforts include monitoring trademark registrars worldwide to ensure we are disputing potential infringements as early in the registration or renewal processes as possible.  We subscribe to multiple “watch services” that monitor apps, social media usernames, domain name registrations, and other online services. When a trademark violation is identified, we take immediate action to notify the offending party and resolve the violation.   <p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of our enforcement partners identifies Zcash trademark violations with a focus on social media and apps. Through only this one partner, since November 2021, we have flagged 793 incidents and we have successfully enforced 602 infringements, with 78 enforcements currently pending. In addition, we have 8 “major” incidents underway (which may include URLs, apps, social media, and/or trademark registrations) in cooperation with law firms in six countries.</p><p>Enforcement actions can be lengthy (and costly) processes with opportunities for both ZF and the alleged offender to respond and counter-respond multiple times prior to a final resolution.</p><p>ZF will include trademark action tracking statistics, beginning with the Q1 2023 report, to further increase transparency related to our trademark enforcement actions and progress.&nbsp;</p><p>What can you do to help keep current and future Zcash community members safe from scams and misinformation?</p>  Become familiar with ZF’s <a href="https://zfnd.org/trademark-policy/">trademark policy</a>.&nbsp;  If you create, or have created, a project that requires trademark usage approval and you haven’t requested approval yet, please do so <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BTlMl98PCJ8ZwPWDcNd4xprRHtjSbdCj5navaOuPjWY/viewform?edit_requested=true">via this form</a>.&nbsp;  If you create, or have created, a project that does not require trademark usage approval (because it is informational or otherwise isn’t required by the policy), please ensure your project is clearly marked as an unofficial source to avoid confusion.&nbsp;  Report suspected trademark violations <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uXLdYuSxCMuzk4HZULg-J78rrnOE0qey9P8rQHX_LVg/viewform?edit_requested=true">via this form</a>.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>ZF appreciates your assistance and cooperation as we strive to keep the Zcash community informed, safe from scams and misinformation, and presenting a unified and clear message across all online platforms.&nbsp;</p>

 Building games of imperfect information with Aztec’s Noir&nbsp;language <p>Noir was conceived of as an open-source, universal zero knowledge language. It was always meant to make the experience of developing in zero-knowledge much more accessible, by:</p>  having simple to read syntax that’s easy to reason&nbsp;about  abstracting away cryptographic concepts and security considerations  incorporating cryptographic libraries for commonly used crypto primitives  <p>So when we heard about the <a href="https://mach34.space/">Mach34</a> team and their work on BattleZips — a Battleship clone relying on zero-knowledge — we knew we had to work together.</p><p>We met the Mach34 team after they placed at the ETHDenver 2022 hackathon with a Circom-written version of the classic Hasbro game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a>.</p><p>Shortly after we released <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge-ff43f38d86d9">Noir</a>, they expressed interest in rewriting Battlezips, providing us feedback, and creating a tutorial series on writing zk circuits and programs in&nbsp;Noir.</p><blockquote>📺 Watch the BattleZips-Noir YouTube series&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25_FzjlG7ZU&amp;list=PLabpoAlaCBY3SM6xHmZCOhPHlmLB4EY6H&amp;ab_channel=AztecNetwork">here</a>.</blockquote><p>We provided them an Aztec Grant in late 2022, and they were off to the races, culminating in showcasing the Noir-powered Battlezips running in the browser at our sponsored game night at ETHDenver 2023.</p><blockquote>🚢 Play Battlezips <a href="https://battlezips.com/">in your&nbsp;browser</a>.</blockquote><p>Here’s an unabridged conversation with Mach34 on their experience building on Noir and what developers can expect building on the universal zk language.</p> A Noir-ish conversation with&nbsp;Mach34  Q: Tell us about BattleZips. How does the game use zero-knowledge cryptography? <blockquote>A: BattleZips is a zero-knowledge implementation of the popular board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a> that uses proofs to shield ship positions. While this is by no means an original idea for a zero-knowledge application, Battleships was chosen as it is a simple but complete example of integrating arbitrary business logic in zero knowledge circuits.</blockquote><blockquote>By settling zero knowledge proofs in smart contracts, we can create novel digital and economic interactions that make the existing role of Information Escrow by third parties obsolete. BattleZips helped us understand how to apply zero knowledge proofs, and we hope the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25_FzjlG7ZU&amp;list=PLabpoAlaCBY3SM6xHmZCOhPHlmLB4EY6H&amp;ab_channel=AztecNetwork">BattleZips-Noir course</a> gives you the same advantages!</blockquote> Q: What inspired you to start Mach 34 and develop BattleZips? Why explore&nbsp;Noir? <blockquote>A: BattleZips marked the beginning of our journey into zero-knowledge cryptography and expanded our horizon on where this technology could be applied in real world use&nbsp;cases.</blockquote><blockquote>This is one of the factors that lead us to creating Mach 34. Mach 34 is a Web3 and ZK Software Consultancy. We chose to focus on mastering the web3 tech stack for the sake of expertise rather than a specific application. This enables us to explore any industry ripe for decentralization, growing our overall experience with the enterprise of&nbsp;web3.</blockquote><blockquote>Corporations and governments alike habitually abuse the authoritative topology of web2 networks; as Web3/ ZK Consultants, we have the means and the desire to help innovators usurp centralized processes and give sovereignty in cyberspace back to the&nbsp;users.</blockquote><blockquote>It is crucial that we stay up to date with the latest trends in this fast developing space to ensure we provide superior expertise to clients. Our prior experience writing proofs demonstrated to us that there is a significant variation between the different tools that exist, how rapidly they can be applied to an engineering problem, and what they accomplish. This led us to explore Noir upon its official release and see how it differentiated itself from pre-existing alternatives.</blockquote> Q: How did you find the ease of usability of Noir compared to other zero-knowledge domain specific languages you’ve worked&nbsp;with? <blockquote>A: Prior to Noir we used the Circom language and the Halo 2 proving system written in Rust. Proceeding from a first look at the Noir documentation to writing circuits was a fairly quick and straightforward process.</blockquote><blockquote>We thought that Noir lived up to most of what it promised in its introductory <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge-ff43f38d86d9">medium post</a>. If one were to begin learning Noir without wanting to get bogged down in learning the inner workings of ZK and how circuits translate to proofs then they could certainly do so. It does a good job of abstracting away from the more complex aspects of the&nbsp;topic.</blockquote><blockquote>One thing that could improve the developer experience is ensuring that the nargo command-line tool and the Aztec NPM packages compile the same Noir version. This is an issue we ran into mid way through the development process that resulted in a refactor to ensure we could test our circuits with the Aztec NPM packages.</blockquote> Q: As a full-stack development shop, how has the process of incorporating zk-cryptography changed the way you approach software development projects? <blockquote>A: Our interest in zero-knowledge cryptography was one of the driving factors for starting Mach 34. Historically and to this day, one of the most sought after skills in the web3 space is the ability to write smart contracts.</blockquote><blockquote>Similarly as the past few years have shown, we believe enabling privacy and scalability in web3 applications is only going to become more and sought after and ultimately a necessity. In anticipation of this we have positioned ourselves at Mach 34 to have the skills and expertise necessary to help companies engineer ZK solutions.</blockquote> Q: What kind of impact do you think Noir and other zero-knowledge domain specific languages will have on the broader software development community? Where do you see the industry&nbsp;going? <blockquote>A: Noir and other ZK DSLs play a pivotal role in the proliferation of zero-knowledge cryptography by abstracting away from the underlying cryptographic principles.</blockquote><blockquote>As history shows, abstraction is absolutely necessary for any technology to become widely adopted. If engineers were never able to design high level programming languages from low-level opcodes then we would have far fewer and less effective software developers than we do&nbsp;today.</blockquote><blockquote>Once the complexity and thought is removed from the underlying components that make zero-knowledge cryptography possible in the first place, engineers have more time to think about applications that would benefit from ZK. It looks like we are about to enter an exciting phase where we will start to see more examples of the technology applied to real world use&nbsp;cases.</blockquote> Q: What advice would you give to developers who are interested in learning more about zero-knowledge cryptography and how to use it in their projects? <blockquote>A: This is definitely an exciting space to get involved in given it is still very much in its infancy. It is poised to solve issues related to privacy and scalability in public blockchains, as well as contexts out of web3 where there is currently a lack of much needed&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>This being said, resources for learning are still sparse and those that exist often have a technical complexity that can make them hard to digest. It can take quite a bit of patience and perseverance to become acclimated to this space but it is well worth the effort given that you are one of the individuals pioneering the ecosystem.</blockquote><blockquote>If you are a developer that has an interest in getting started in ZK then I think reading some high-level introductory materials would be a good starting&nbsp;point.</blockquote><blockquote>After a basic understanding is gained on the topic then exploring a DSL like Circom or Noir to write a simple circuit would be a beneficial next&nbsp;step.</blockquote><blockquote>Once it becomes clearer to you what can be accomplished and what tools are at your disposal then really the limit is what you can ideate. The cool thing is that there is still so much room for novel innovation that it could very well be the case no one has thought of your idea yet. Don’t sit idle and wait for things to develop further! Now is a great time to jump&nbsp;in!</blockquote> Q: Are there any upcoming projects at Mach 34 that you can share with us that utilize zero-knowledge cryptography or other cutting-edge technologies? <blockquote>A: Mach 34 has been researching and working towards constructing a “Zero-Knowledge State Channel”. While rollups offer fantastic scalability, we were put off by the need for a sequencer. Furthermore, aside from Aztec Connect and a few others, ZK Rollups do not have any private state. Thus, we began to explore how state channels might be repurposed with zero knowledge.</blockquote><blockquote>To open a ZK State Channel, parties will agree on the terms of the execution (like a smart contract). The channel initialization dictates what steps can be taken next, and by whom. Rather than posting every transaction on-chain, a state object is recursively built off-chain.</blockquote><blockquote>While previous state channel constructions had optimistic trust assumptions, we can leverage ZK to perform verifiable computations that have instant, trustless finality. Once a state channel has reached an end condition, the entire state execution is notarized by posting the state channel proof on-chain for all nodes to verify in zero knowledge.</blockquote><blockquote>This final proof further employs zero knowledge to hide most of the intermediate state; only pre-determined derived metrics or public outputs are made publicly available on-chain.</blockquote><blockquote>This has many interesting use-cases; we plan to demonstrate how this construction is useful for credit scoring by adding ELO scores to the State Channel version of BattleZips. This provides a verifiable metric that scores the performance of an individual without revealing any of their in-game&nbsp;moves.</blockquote><blockquote>We envision countless use-cases for ZK State Channels across all segments of web3. Undoubtedly, there are use-cases that we haven’t thought of. For this reason, all of our work on ZK State Channels is free and open source. While we intend to utilize the infrastructure for profit, we want to make sure that all possibilities are explored in service of the best possible future for web3 developers and&nbsp;users.</blockquote> Q: What are some use cases you’re excited&nbsp;for? <blockquote>A: One area of exciting potential outside of blockchain is how zero-knowledge can transform personal identification.</blockquote><blockquote>When providing personal ID, the majority of the time more information is conveyed than necessary. Proving one is of a legal drinking age need only confirm the person is above 21 years of age, yet sharing the ID divulges information such as street address and&nbsp;name.</blockquote><blockquote>Using zero knowledge proofs conceivably one could prove they are at least 21 without having to provide additional information. Another example is having to provide a social security number in a KYC process. Leaking a SSN number can have catastrophic consequences so one would prefer this is done as infrequently as possible. With ZK proofs instead one could prove they bear a SSN number without needing to reveal exactly what theirs&nbsp;is.</blockquote> Explore the BattleZips project <p>We’re thrilled that the <a href="https://mach34.space">Mach34</a> team have done such a deep and candid dive into Noir’s capabilities, and their feedback has been invaluable.</p><p>For developers interested in building on Noir, check out their well-documented BattleZips repo.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/BattleZips/BattleZips">🚢 Explore the BattleZips Github repo and codebase</a>.</blockquote> Build on&nbsp;Noir <p>Interested in building zero-knowledge applications on Noir — or contributing to the open-source project?</p>  Get started in our docs&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">here</a>.

 The Ironic Bearishness of using VEIL as Cash 

<p></p>

<p>I and many others are long-time proponents of using both Veil and Bitcoin as cash. A discussion has arisen in the Veil community of people sponsoring developers working on specific development projects, although this is applicable to any Veil Project role.</p>

<p>One commented that as we are “Veiliens” we would surely prefer all remuneration to be done using Veil. This should communicate our preference for and support of Veil as a currency, and certainly it is superior as a privacy coin, but there are some factors that unexpectedly, or ironically, as some would put it, work the opposite!</p>

<p>Let’s suppose that we are paying a developer who has no other source of income, not even welfare. So we know that he has to pay for food or he will starve, and for computer resources too. While some might suppose that any Veil that gets sold for food must have been bought. Buying and selling pressure should cancel each other out, but this is not going to be the case.</p>

<p>Let’s consider that this Veil is not being bought at the exact same time as the same amounts are being sold, in fact, as a Veilien you already have a bag of it, but we also believe that Veil needs to recover 100 to 1000 times its current value, so we will consider the demand and supply and market sentiment dynamics as they are after a 99.9% drop in the value.</p>

<p>Certainly, if Veil had continued its rise in 2019 from its regular trading in the five to seven thousand satoshi range, with a little-known all time high of ten or twenty thousand sats, Veil would certainly be trading comfortably in the multi-dollar range. 20,000 satoshis today, at the time of writing is $5.63. Well, if you are prepared to pay someone 100,000 Veil for some work, valued at $338.20 today, with a Veil price of 12 sats (since increased before posting this article), knowing that those one hundred thousand Veil should be worth TWENTY BITCOIN, or USD$564,236.20, and with a $100,000 Bitcoin, TWO MILLION DOLLARS, you would not want to part with that Veil knowing that they will be DUMPED on the market and probably not even get the $300 dollars worth of work you are expecting!</p>

<p>We see therefore that the Veilien above, by allowing those 100,000 Veil to be dumped on a weak market is not only communicating that they don’t think Veil should regain its all time high, but his or her action will only further depress the market.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that no Veil team member is receiving 100,000 Veil in a month for their work. So, let’s consider the opposite approach. Paying with a currency that has established value and a highly liquid market. That might be Bitcoin itself, or if the sponsor and the sponsored developer live in the same country, it might be their shared national fiat currency.</p>

<p>Before that, let’s consider a managed approach to using Veil as an incentive. The sponsor has the Veil already, as should be expected for a Veilien believer, so he pays the developer, and at the same time places buy orders for the full amount that the developer will need to sell for his or her essential needs. However low the sponsor places his buy orders is the maximum extractable value that the developer can likely instantly gain from the market, BUT there might be other sellers, and the developer might not manage to sell all of the sponsorship before the sponsor’s BIDs are all taken. So, the sponsor needs to bid for a greater amount of Veil or the value transfer from the sponsor to the developer may fail. This has inefficiencies, as the sponsor has to budget more than the value the developer will gain from the transaction, and both will have to play the market, distracting both from developing Veil.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the fiat sponsorship approach, much as we instinctively abhor and avoid fiat currencies. Assuming the sponsor and the sponsored both are able to use the given fiat currency, not at all certain these days, so long as there are no transaction fees, and no interference from banking or government agencies, the full value of the sponsorship will be enjoyed by the beneficiary of that sponsorship, and they will be able to put their full efforts into the necessary developments they have been hired to do. At the same time, the sponsor, a faithful Veilien, can hold on to their (more) valuable (to them) Veil, to be used when the product of the development work has been able to make Veil more popular. Furthermore, the developer seeing how they are improving the ecosystem, may be motivated to budget some percentage of their earnings, from the sponsorship or from other income, into buying some Veil for themselves! This will be Veil that does not get dumped on the market.</p>

<p>Now, I’m still in favour of using Veil, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and so on, as cash, it is necessary, when you expect a long term price recovery, to replace any amount that has been used for spending, knowing that when you spend what was, and should once again be, ten thousand dollars, but only receive five hundred dollars of value for it, if you really believe that, you will replace it the same day, as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p>Please join our Veil community. We hope you become a “Veilien” and see the merit in sponsoring a developer for the RingCT staking project, or for other projects within the Veil ecosystem, or sponsor or become a marketer. Don’t be too shy to attach your business name to the sponsorship, for example: “Bill’s Bicycle Boutique, sponsor of Sato’s She, Veil RingCT staking developer!”</p>

<p>[ Please note that this approach assumes that the current coin price is as a result of a deep bear market. It is highly likely that the opposite approach would be most popular in the heights of a bull market, where anyone wants to get their hands on the currency as a high priority. ]</p>

  Partnering with Turnkey: Crypto Private Key Infrastructure  <p>Sam, Bryce and Jack are giving builders the protections they deserve—with an accessible, self-serve API.</p>  <p>By Alfred Lin</p><p>Published March 21, 2023</p>  



 
<p>Throughout the ups and downs of crypto financial markets, one thing has remained the same: builders are still building. The number of <a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report">active developers</a> contributing to open-source projects continues to climb, and is now more than 300% of what it was in 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the crypto developer stack takes shape, custody is, of course, a core pillar—but many custody products were originally designed to support buy-and-hold financial use cases, not the development of new products. While existing enterprise custody solutions are helping larger organizations scale, developers have their own unique set of circumstances, and in their search for self-serve solutions, too often encounter long sales cycles, large annual minimums, and delays in support for new chains and tokens. Many developers simply give up on the API dream and settle for integrating existing solutions that don’t fully meet their needs.</p>



<p>Sam McInvgale, Bryce Ferguson and Jack Kearney met while building Coinbase’s innovative Custody product, and have seen these challenges firsthand. They were determined to give developers the custody infrastructure necessary to make building in crypto easier. The result is <a href="https://www.turnkey.io/">Turnkey</a>, a private key management platform offering the same advanced security protections major financial institutions demand, but designed just for developers. Sam, Bryce, Jack and their team have built an accessible, easy to use, API-first product that helps users self-custody their crypto via secure enclaves, a deterministic operating system and a custom language for managing permissions. Developers can go from sign-up to signing a transaction in minutes, not months—and generate thousands of wallets programmatically across chains.</p>



<p>We first met the Turnkey team through Bryce, a Sequoia Scout whose passion for all things crypto we knew well. When he introduced us to Sam and Jack, we quickly realized this was a company with three co-founders who would each be backable on their own.&nbsp; They now are leading an expert team with years of experience securing billions of dollars of crypto across Coinbase, BitGo and Polychain. We are grateful for the opportunity to partner with them and lead Turnkey’s seed round.<br><br>Now, they are <a href="mailto:hello@turnkey.io">expanding that team</a> and launching a <a href="http://www.turnkey.io">closed beta</a> of their platform, and we encourage anyone building in crypto to give it a try. Today’s launch is an exciting step toward the future of the crypto developer stack, and we can’t wait to see how Turnkey empowers the next generation of builders.</p>

  Partnering with Tavus: AI-Personalized Videos  <p>In a video-first world, how do you create customized outreach that scales? Hassaan and Quinn are using AI to crack the code.</p>   
	By Stephanie Zhan	 



Published March 20, 2023
  



Tavus co-founders Hassaan Raza and Quinn Favret



 
<p>We live in a world where sales emails often seem too impersonal, where many marketing materials are filled with stock content, and where the efficacy of traditional performance marketing has declined severely. Audience engagement has become a scarce and valuable resource—and capturing attention has become an increasingly acute challenge. Customers want only the content most relevant to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tavus co-founders Hassaan Raza and Quinn Favret knew this pain all too well. By experimenting at their previous company, they discovered that personalized videos that touched on the specific needs and desires of each customer received far higher click-through and response rates compared to content meant for the masses. And so they labored away, creating hundreds of clips for their customers during overnight recording marathons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But they knew there had to be a better way. How could you build a workflow tool that would empower business professionals to create personalized videos, but without needing to manually record each and every one?</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">Tavus</a>: a platform that can build a personalized AI version of any sales or marketing professional. A rep starts by completing a 15-minute&nbsp; recording to train their personalized AI, then records a single template for each set of videos they want to create. Using a simple yet powerful text editor, designing individual videos for every customer is as easy as typing up a script, with unlimited variables for personalization to address their specific needs—and voilà! Tavus automatically creates clips with pixel-perfect videos of you that replicate your facial expressions and voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I first tried the product in late 2021, the night after meeting Hassaan and Quinn. It was in alpha at the time, but even then, it felt like magic. We were delighted to partner with them at the beginning of their journey, and to lead their seed round. They are a special pair, with vision, grit, customer obsession, and a creative lens through which to redefine the way sales and marketing should be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, just 18 months later, Tavus creates video on par in quality with anything you would create manually—and makes it a whole lot easier and faster! Even better, Tavus integrates into a company’s programmatic workflows: if a lead submits a form from your website, for example, they can automatically receive a customized Tavus video follow-up instead of a standard email. Already, these customers are seeing results—including 10x higher engagement and 300% increases in response rates, all while reps report saving 10+ hours per week.&nbsp;<br><br>AI is reshaping every industry, and sales and marketing tools are no exception. We’re excited to be working with the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tavus-io/jobs/">growing Tavus team</a> to supercharge the work of the next generation of sales and marketing professionals. Come check it out here: <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">tavus.io</a>.</p>

   Hester Peirce is one of five SEC Commissioners. She's been a Commissioner since 2018, with her term ending in 2025. Peirce, a previous podcast guest of Bankless, consistently makes first principles statements and is known to often dissent for her colleagues on crypto-related actions…we talk about that in today’s episode. These are a couple of many reasons why we enjoy her and her guidance so much.

<p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a revolutionary concept that is gaining traction in the world of digital identity management. In simple terms, SSI is a way for individuals to take control of their own digital identity and personal information, and use it to interact with the world around them. This has the potential to revolutionise many industries, including the travel industry.</p>



 The Benefits of Using SSI in the Travel Industry 



<p>In short, the benefits using SSI in the travel industry can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Travellers control their own personal information 



 Travel companies do not have to worry about storing sensitive personal data 



 The travel process is more streamlined 



 Identity can be verified more efficiently and securely 
 



<p>Let’s explore these benefits more in-depth below!</p>



 Streamlining the Travel Process 



<p>One of the biggest challenges facing the travel industry today is the need for passengers to provide a vast amount of personal information to various parties throughout the travel process. This information is often collected, stored, and shared in an unsecured and decentralised manner. This leads to vulnerability to security breaches and identity theft. And as shown by various research, <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/marriott-british-airways-and-easyjet-fail-on-data-security-with-hundreds-of-security-risks-exposed-by-which-a6a2q2L2YtdZ">many travel companies’ websites suffer from serious data security risks.</a></p>



<p>With SSI, individuals can create a digital identity that includes all of their personal information and documentation, such as passport and visa details. This digital identity can then be used to quickly and easily verify one’s identity with various organisations and services throughout the travel process, such as airlines, airports, and hotels.</p>



<p>This has several benefits for travellers. Firstly, it eliminates the need for passengers to carry physical copies of their documents, which can be lost, damaged, or stolen. Instead, passengers can access their documents digitally. This is done by using their self-sovereign identity, which provides a more secure and convenient way to verify one’s identity.</p>



<p>In addition, it reduces the time and effort required to provide personal information and documentation. It makes the overall experience smoother and more efficient. Finally, it allows travellers to have greater control over their personal data. They can choose which information to share with which organisations. Furthermore, they can revoke access to their digital identity at any time.</p>



 How SSI Helps Companies in the Travel industry 



<p>Another benefit of self-sovereign identity for companies in the travel industry is that it reduces their risks related to storing customer data. With traditional forms of identity verification, companies are often responsible for collecting, storing, and protecting large amounts of personal information about their customers. This can be a costly and time-consuming process. It also exposes companies to potential liabilities in the event of a security breach or data leak.</p>



<p>With self-sovereign identity, customers can securely and easily share only the necessary information with companies. Consequently, this reduces the amount of data that companies need to store and manage. This can help to reduce the risks and costs associated with managing customer data. It can also help to protect companies from potential liabilities.</p>



<p>Additionally, using self-sovereign identity can allow companies to build trust with their customers. It shows that they are committed to protecting personal information and providing a secure and convenient experience. As a result, self-sovereign identity can be a win-win for both companies and customers in the travel industry.</p>



 The Potential Downsides of Using SSI in the Travel Industry 



<p>Using self-sovereign identity in the travel industry has a lot of potential for both companies and travellers. One must know that there are also potential downsides and risks. Namely the following few:</p>



 
 Lack of adoption: Self-sovereign identity is a relatively new concept. It may take some time for it to be widely adopted by individuals and organisations in the travel industry. 



 Compatibility issues: Not all organisations and services in the travel industry may be able to accept self-sovereign identity as a form of verification. This could limit its usefulness for some travellers. 



 Potential for misuse: As with any technology, self-sovereign identity has the potential to be misused by individuals with malicious intent. For example, individuals could create false or fraudulent digital identities in order to access services or commit crimes. 



 Security concerns: While self-sovereign identity can provide a more secure way to verify one’s identity, it also introduces new security concerns, such as the need to protect digital identities from hacking and other forms of cyber attack. 



 User error: Self-sovereign identity relies on individuals to manage their own digital identities. Mistakes or errors made by users could potentially compromise the security of their personal information. 
 



<p>While these potential downsides and risks should be taken seriously and should be addressed adequately, traditional forms of identity (verification) suffer similar downsides and risks. And if implemented correctly while taking various precautions, self-sovereign identities will be able to provide a more efficient and secure way of handling your identity and personal information.</p>



 Introducing: A Self-Sovereign Identity Tool for Travellers 



<p>Zaisan offers tooling that is helping to make SSI a reality for travelers. A <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/identity">self-sovereign identity platform</a> that allows individuals to create, manage, and share their digital identity in a secure and convenient manner. With this tooling, travellers can easily access and share their travel documents, such as passports and visas, with the relevant parties, making the travel process smoother and more efficient.</p>



 Conclusion: Self-Sovereign Identity is Poised to Transform the Travel Industry 



<p>In conclusion, self-sovereign identity has the potential to revolutionise the travel industry. It allows individuals to take control of their own digital identity and personal information. Despite the potential risks and downsides, SSI is looking to be a solid way to handle personal data. Web3 identity tools are helping to make this vision a reality, making it possible for travellers to securely and easily access and share their travel documents. As SSI becomes more widely adopted, the travel industry is sure to see significant benefits in terms of security, convenience, and efficiency.</p>

<p>Network Disruption Resolution</p><p>On March 11, 2023 the DERO network suffered a chain split due to issues with developer controlled seed nodes. These nodes act as an anchor for network participants to uniformly sync with the rest of the blockchain network. Since services have yet to be restored, the blockchain remains split, which includes a chain that is stuck (seed nodes) and a heavier chain that has more mining activity. Since DERO utilizes proof-of-work consensus and the absence of our seed nodes, all network participants are left to choose which chain to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Together with various esteemed members of our community, we have collectively decided to move forward with the heaviest chain as we continue to restore service to our seed nodes. Below, you will find instructions on how to get your node up and running by using community and foundation hosted public&nbsp;nodes.</p> UPDATE (3/19/2023): The DERO network is no longer reliant on seed nodes. <a href="https://github.com/deroproject/derohe/releases/tag/Release117">The latest release provides these updates</a>. The following solution is no longer required.  Remote Node (Wallets) <p>The default remote nodes are also down, so you will need to specify a node address when launching your CLI wallet. Instead of using the ‘- -remote’ argument, run your wallet with the following arguments:</p> ./dero-wallet-cli-linux-amd64 --daemon-address=node.derofoundation.org:11012 <blockquote>Or specify node.derofoundation.org:11012 in your connection settings when using&nbsp;Engram.</blockquote> Daemon (Node) <p>Run your daemon with the following arguments:</p><p>CLI</p> ./derod-linux-amd64 --add-priority-node=78.159.118.236:11011 --add-priority-node=209.58.186.186:11011 --add-priority-node=23.81.165.146:11011 --add-priority-node=85.17.52.28:11011  <a href="https://github.com/DEROFDN/netrunner">Netrunner</a>  ./netrunner --add-priority-node=78.159.118.236:11011 --add-priority-node=209.58.186.186:11011 --add-priority-node=23.81.165.146:11011 --add-priority-node=85.17.52.28:11011 <p>Alternatively, you can download the following files and place them in your mainnet&nbsp;folder:</p>  <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings/raw/branch/master/peers.json">peers.json</a>  <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings/raw/branch/master/ban_list.json">ban_list.json</a>  <p>You can right-click and “Save As” each file above, or visit the repo: <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings">https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings</a></p><blockquote>Please note: You may need to replace these files before each launch of your&nbsp;daemon.</blockquote><p>Below is a list of public nodes that are available:</p>  ams.derofoundation.org:11011  213.171.208.37:18089 (MySrvCloud)  5.161.123.196:11011 (MySrvCloud VA)  51.222.86.51:11011 (RabidMining Pool)  74.208.54.173:50404 (deronfts)  85.214.253.170:53387 (mmarcel-vps)  163.172.26.245:10505 (DeroStats)  44.198.24.170:20000 (pieswap)   Explorers   <a href="http://explorer.derofoundation.org">explorer.derofoundation.org</a>  <a href="https://explorer.deronfts.com">explorer.deronfts.com</a>  <a href="https://derostats.io">derostats.io</a>   Moving Forward <p>During this time, the decision has been made to keep exchange wallets in maintenance mode for the time being. We will send out further communication once we have an ETA of when they will become available.</p><p>We also aim to eventually remove the use of seed nodes in the future, but our young network and on-going development may require their usage for a bit longer. There are also plans to prevent such issues in the future, which will be provided at a later date. We were delighted to see solidarity win in the end and could not have done it without the help of our community.</p><p>We would like to take this time to thank the DERO community again for their efforts and patience during this&nbsp;time.</p> Privacy together. <p>—</p><p>Join the DERO community!</p><p><a href="https://forum.dero.io/">Forum</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/29GNSJ4">Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/DeroProjectGroup">Telegram</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DERO_Foundation">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeroProject/">Reddit</a></p><p><a href="https://dero.io/">Website</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/deroproject/dero-network-update-2def3c133f38">DERO Network Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/deroproject">DERO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/halborn-discovers-zero-day-impacting-dogecoin-and-280-networks">Halborn disclosed vulnerabilities in some code forks of Bitcoin Core</a>, which could be exploited to crash nodes. An attacker could potentially take advantage of these vulnerabilities to crash mining nodes, and thus reduce (by approximately 50%)&nbsp; the amount of hashpower required to mount a 51% attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash was one of the currencies affected by this disclosure, as zcashd is a code fork of Bitcoin Core. <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">ECC has released new versions of zcashd that remediate the vulnerabilities</a>. Anyone who runs a zcashd node should update immediately.</p>



<p>There is no evidence to suggest that these vulnerabilities have been exploited on the Zcash network, and there is no reason to suspect that the Zcash network is susceptible to a 51% attack (even if the required hashpower were reduced by 50%).&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra">Zebra</a> is an independent Zcash node implementation, and is not based on Bitcoin Core. Halborn has confirmed that Zebra is not vulnerable to these issues. However, we have taken the precaution of hardening certain sections of our codebase to make Zebra more resilient to similar memory exhaustion attacks.</p>



<p>We would like to express our gratitude to ECC for coordinating the Zcash ecosystem’s response to this security disclosure.&nbsp;We would also like to thank Halborn for responsibly disclosing these vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>Releases 5.3.3 and 5.4.2 harden zcashd code and remediate vulnerabilities inherited from Bitcoin Core that may have affected more than 280 chains,<a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/halborn-discovers-zero-day-impacting-dogecoin-and-280-networks"> according to blockchain security firm Halborn</a>.</p>



<p>We have no evidence that an exploit has occurred on the Zcash network, and these bugs do not compromise user privacy or impact Zcash supply. As always, if you notice any unusual activity in your node, please report it to security@z.cash.</p>



<p>All Zcash node operators on 5.3.1 or 5.3.2 should update to <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.3.3">5.3.3</a> immediately, and all Zcash node operators on 5.4.0 or 5.4.1 should update to <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.4.2">5.4.2</a> immediately. <a href="https://z.cash/download/">Prebuilt binaries and Debian packages</a> will be available in the next few hours.</p>



<p>The vulnerabilities, discovered by Halborn in a 2022 audit of Dogecoin, were first disclosed to ECC and contributors to other affected networks on Feb. 14, and more details were relayed in a Feb. 17 call. ECC initiated our security process immediately and began coordinating with ZecSec.com, the independent Zcash-community-funded security team, and with Zcash Foundation, who analyzed the impact on zebrad, its own implementation of a Zcash node. We also reached out to Horizen, Komodo, and other teams with whom we have disclosure agreements.</p>



<p>Within days, we had zcashd patches ready for third-party testing, but the public releases have been delayed to allow other projects time to complete their own remediations and to allow for coordinated comms, given the sensitive nature.</p>



<p>Halborn found that the bugs could allow an attacker to utilize peer-to-peer network messages to fill the memory of a node and crash it. By crashing other people’s mining nodes, an attacker could potentially reduce, by around one half, the amount of hashpower they would need to mount a 51% attack on the Zcash network. A successful 51% attack could potentially be used to execute a double-spend attack, which could result in users who received transactions from the attackers losing their funds. We have no reason to believe that the Zcash network is currently vulnerable to a 51% attack — with or without the “one half discount” on the attack cost — but out of an abundance of caution, we’ve hardened the zcashd nodes so that they cannot be crashed using this bug.</p>

 A giant leap toward a fully programmable encrypted zkRollup <p>Today we’re announcing the sunset of Aztec Connect, our privacy infrastructure that served as the encryption layer for Ethereum.</p><p>One week from today, deposits into the Aztec Connect contract both from <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> and other front-ends like <a href="https://zkpay.finance/">zkpay.finance</a> will be disabled.</p><p>Users will continue being able to withdraw with no fees for one&nbsp;year.</p><p>Our sequencer will slowly reduce the frequency of rollup blocks for withdrawal, with a final sunset date approximately one year from now: March 21st, 2024. Here are the critical&nbsp;dates:</p>  13th — 21st March: Aztec Connect normal functionality  21st March 2023 at 2PM UTC: Deposits&nbsp;disabled  One-year withdrawal window (March 13th, 2023 — March 21st,&nbsp;2024)  March 21st, 2024: Last Aztec rollup sent from Aztec sequencer  March 21st, 2024 onwards: users will have to run withdrawal software or rely on community-run sequencers  <blockquote>▶️ Head to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> today to begin withdrawing funds.<br>▶ View withdrawal instructions <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> What’s Next <p>As of March 21st, 2024–approximately one year from now–Aztec will no longer run a sequencer. That means the current system will no longer publish rollup blocks processing Aztec Connect transactions, contract permissions will be renounced, and all rollup functionality will be&nbsp;ceased.</p><p>At that point, withdrawals will be highly technical. While we remain optimistic that a community-operated sequencer will be functional, everyday users will have to rely on that infrastructure or run their own sequencers to withdraw.</p><p>Thus, while withdrawals will always be possible, they will become significantly more burdensome after March 21st, 2024. We therefore recommend users withdraw funds as soon as possible.</p><blockquote>▶️ Head to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> today to begin withdrawing funds.<br>▶ View withdrawal instructions <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> Open sourcing Aztec&nbsp;Connect <p>As of today, Aztec has fully open sourced the entire Aztec Connect protocol complete with scaling upgrades and a new secure&nbsp;SDK.</p><blockquote>▶️ See the open source Aztec Connect repo&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect">here</a>.</blockquote><p>We encourage the Aztec community to fork, deploy, and operate a new version of the system. We’d love to see an independently-operated Aztec Connect and are ready to fund it. Head to our open-source repo and docs to learn more about running an Aztec Connect&nbsp;fork.</p><p>The second wave of our grants program is coming up in April, and we look forward to funding community-run infrastructure then. In the meantime, keep in touch on our <a href="http://twitter.com/aztecnetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://discord.gg/aztec">Discord&nbsp;server</a>.</p> Aztec’s Vision <p>At Aztec, our goal has always been to develop a truly decentralized general-purpose encrypted zkRollup with the security of Ethereum.</p><p>While Ethereum has created a world computer that can read and write to public state, Aztec aims to fulfill the vision by adding the ability to read and write to private&nbsp;state.</p><p>In our mission to achieve that vision, we’ve taken a step-wise, incremental approach to the development of encrypted transactions on Ethereum.</p><p>The first attempt at on-chain privacy using a zkRollup was Aztec 1. Aztec 1 was slow, inefficient, costly, and limited in its functionality to basic private transfers.</p><p>Our latest effort was a set of privacy infrastructure and tools for Ethereum called Aztec Connect. It not only extended privacy functionality on Ethereum beyond simple payments and toward arbitrary smart contract interactions, it hinted at the cost savings that encrypted rollups are ultimately able to achieve through transaction batching.</p><p>Aztec Connect was a critical step in our mission to build a fully programmable encrypted zkRollup. Not only did it provide critical feedback, it proved to us the battle-worthiness of our sequencer and rollup contracts.</p><p>The immense research invested into Aztec Connect will be usable and indeed critical to the development of our next-gen product. Having an encrypted rollup live and in production gives us confidence in our shift to focusing on a fully programmable version.</p> The Future is&nbsp;Noir <p>As we move forward, our mid- and long-term focus will be solely directed towards the development of two major products, which are mutually compatible and interlinked:</p>  Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge  Our next-generation encrypted zkRollup  <p>Noir continues to gain new features by the day, with the Noir tooling team publishing regular releases. We are convinced Noir is the simplest, most powerful way to write programs in zero-knowledge.</p><blockquote>▶️ <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">Install Noir today</a> and go from 0 to programming in zkSNARKs in less than an&nbsp;hour.</blockquote><p>With additional resources at their disposal, the Noir team will only grow its functionality. Not only is Noir useful today as a generalized programming language for zk development — capable of using multiple proving backends and verifying to any EVM chain — a modified version of Noir will be the smart contract language for Aztec’s next-gen zkRollup.</p><p>Expect more Noir features and a full set of specifications for our newest zkRollup in the first half of 2023. To learn more about our next-gen system, check out our&nbsp;docs.</p><blockquote>Learn more about the next generation Aztec protocol&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec3">here</a>.</blockquote> Onward <p>The Aztec community has been a vital part of the development and success of Aztec Connect, and we are incredibly grateful for the 100,000+ users who have used Aztec Connect for private DeFi. It has long been obvious that privacy in a blockchain context is an absolute necessity, and Aztec Connect further validated that&nbsp;thesis.</p><p>It’s undeniable that Aztec Connect was an important stepping stone towards realizing our ultimate goal. It’s now time for us to focus fully on that goal: a decentralized general-use encrypted zkRollup.</p><p>To all our partners: thank you for betting on Aztec. We’re excited to bring you a fully-featured Noir and local devnet for our next-gen network by the end of 2023.&nbsp;Onward!</p> Frequently Asked Questions <p>Q: How do I withdraw&nbsp;funds?</p><blockquote>A: Navigate to <a href="https://zk.money">zk.money</a> or your preferred front-end. View withdrawal instructions for <a href="https://zk.money">zk.money</a> here: <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset</a></blockquote><p>Q: Is Aztec done building privacy products?</p><blockquote>A: Not even close. We’re laser-focused on building more Noir features and bringing you a programmably private L2 to be announced in the first half of&nbsp;2023.</blockquote><p>Q: Is Aztec shutting&nbsp;down?</p><blockquote>A: Nope. Our team has raised <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-raises-100-million-to-build-encrypted-ethereum-dd5062ba949c">over $125 million</a> from investors like a16z and Paradigm to bring encryption to blockchain.

<p>Brave Firewall + VPN, powered by Guardian, is now available on desktop with the recent 1.49 version of the browser, completing Brave’s already available Android and iOS VPN offerings so users can benefit from full cross-platform protection.</p>
<p>The desktop VPN will be rolled out in various regions over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today. The desktop VPN also includes cross-device support, which enables users to connect five devices to one VPN subscription, regardless of platform.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 Affordable cross-device subscription 
<p>Today, almost everyone uses the Internet on more than one device (like your laptop at home, and your phone on the go). Brave’s new cross-device VPN subscription model lets you connect and protect five devices—across Android and iOS, macOS and Windows—to one subscription. Brave’s Firewall + VPN service is available for $9.99/month, or $99.99/year (annual plans for desktop purchases are coming soon). With five supported devices per account, you can protect each device for less than $2 a month.</p>
<p>The Brave browser blocks ads and trackers on every webpage, keeping you much safer while you browse; the Brave Firewall + VPN blocks trackers in every app on your phone, even outside the Brave browser.</p>

 Already using Brave Firewall + VPN on your mobile device? 
<p>If you already have a Brave Firewall + VPN subscription on your Android or iOS devices, visit the VPN section of the Brave browser settings. This will take you to <a href="https://account.brave.com/">account.brave.com</a>, where you can manage your subscription and automatically link more mobile or desktop devices.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 How to get started with Brave VPN on mobile or desktop 
<p>We’ve made the setup process for Brave Firewall + VPN as simple as possible. Don’t worry about downloading any extra apps; simply open the settings menu in the Brave browser on desktop or mobile, and toggle on VPN. You’ll then be taken to account.brave.com, where you can easily complete the setup.</p>
<p>Brave Firewall + VPN is the easiest way to protect all your devices—and all your apps—directly from the browser.</p>

 Brave-level protection, even outside the Brave browser 
<p>Brave browser puts your privacy first by blocking ads, trackers, cookies, scripts, and more while you browse the Web. Brave Firewall + VPN is a premium service that goes even further by enabling you to:</p>
 
 Mask your IP address 
 Change your location online 
 Prevent your ISP from snooping on your activity 
 Access your favorite content no matter where you are 
 Protect your Internet traffic on apps outside the Brave browser 
 
<p>Brave Firewall + VPN, powered by Guardian, extends all the protection you expect from Brave outside of the browser on Android, iOS, and macOS (and Windows, <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/11973307463181">with an added workaround</a>). That means giving you network-level protection against unwanted surveillance on the apps you use, across all your devices. Guardian is a leading Firewall + VPN technology platform that was recently acquired by DNSFilter.</p>
<p>Note that iOS and Android users can use our integrated <a>Privacy Hub</a> (a feature coming soon to desktop as well) to check exactly which trackers are blocked, including outside of Brave. The Privacy Hub highlights risky pages and trackers, and ties those trackers to the tech companies and publishers behind them, showing users how often sites try to invade their privacy.</p>

 Your privacy and anonymity guaranteed 
<p>When choosing a VPN, you’re trusting the provider with your data. Brave’s VPN service is powered by Guardian, stores no log files, and uses no cookies. We can’t store any of your connection or browsing data, because we don’t collect any of it in the first place.</p>
<p>We’ve also implemented an onboarding process that enables you to sign up for Brave Firewall + VPN using only an email address and payment information.</p>
<p>Once you sign up, you’re issued unlinkable daily tokens that validate your subscription when using the VPN. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of the VPN, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>

 Protect yourself from ISPs 
<p>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are the backbone of Internet connectivity; virtually all Internet traffic passes through them. This puts many of them (depending on their jurisdiction) in a position where they could easily collect and sell user data; in fact, various ISPs sell this data to advertising brokers to build a more comprehensive ad profile of the user. Because they have privileged access to user Internet traffic, they can even monitor your activity and slow down your Internet connection speeds as they see fit. But with Brave Firewall + VPN, you can easily mask your IP address and cloak your Internet activity, even from the prying eyes of ISPs.</p>

 More online freedom 
<p>While traveling abroad, you might find that your favorite sites or news outlets no longer work. That’s due to geo-restrictions that prevent certain sites and apps from being accessible from certain locations. With Brave Firewall + VPN, you can connect to the Web from local servers around the world, making it appear like that’s where your traffic is originating. This enables you to bypass geo-restrictions in the browser and access your favorite content no matter where you are.</p>

 Added firewall protection 
<p>A VPN is great for encrypting your internet traffic, but it can’t block harmful trackers and other online nuisances. That’s where a firewall comes in. Most standard, free, and even other premium VPNs don’t include a firewall—which serves as a secure barrier between your device and the Internet. It blocks unwanted trackers, harmful traffic, and other malicious things from ever reaching your phone, tablet, or computer.</p>
<p>How does it work? Brave’s built-in firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing flows of data based on a set of rules. So if an app is secretly broadcasting tracking data, Brave Firewall + VPN will detect and block the offending activity while still ensuring the app functions normally.</p>

 Try Brave Firewall + VPN today 
<p>Ready to protect your Internet traffic across all your devices? You can try Brave Firewall + VPN  with a free 7-day trial. To do so on your desktop device, open the Brave browser and click the new VPN icon in the browser address bar. Or, when using the Brave browser on your phone, go to the Settings menu, and toggle Brave Firewall + VPN to on. (If you don’t see this option, update to the latest version of Brave on your device.) It’s the safest, easiest way to protect yourself online, on every app, on every device.</p>

<p>With the upcoming launch of Polygon's zkEVM mainnet, L2s are undoubtedly a huge narrative that is unfolding in 2023. It is time to take a step back and recognise the incredible amount of effort that has gone into researching and building L2 scaling solutions in general and zk rollups in particular. Tech-wise, we barely scratched the surface of general purpose processors that can handle zk circuits, so there is still tremendous room to grow. As layer 2s become more efficient, so will the applications that are dependent on blockchain throughput.</p><p>We were joined by Jordi Baylina (tech lead) &amp; David Schwartz (CTO) from Polygon's zkEVM, to discuss the different milestones &amp; challenges they had to overcome in designing a zk rollup, from circuits to mainnet.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jordi’s &amp; David’s backgrounds  The idea behind Hermez Network  zkEVM scaling &amp; validity proofs  How different ZK rollup models function  What challenges zkEVM encountered during development  Evolutionary pathways in the realm of ZKPs  Auditing zkEVM  Trusted setup requirement for zkEVM  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jbaylina">Jordi Baylina on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsrz">David Schwartz on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonZK">Polygon zkEVM on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

 The humble beginning <p>At Privy, we are building the simplest way to onboard all your users to web3, whether they are new to the space or tried-and-true experts. This means building a library that enables developers to <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3s-coming-of-age-c588af57c94d">meet users where they are</a>, and cater to diverse audiences whose product experiences grow with their engagement.</p><p>Privy’s <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3-for-users-not-experts-52c692c25bb1">embedded wallets</a> allow applications to create fully-functional Ethereum wallets on-demand without requiring users to leave the app. With this feature in place, we believe we are about to unlock a significant UX boost for the Web3 ecosystem!</p><p>The space itself is abuzz with changes that will profoundly shape UX, as threshold-based multi party computation matures, and smart contract wallet architectures (often called “account abstraction”) are standardized. While we are extremely excited about these evolutions and are working with partners to bring them into our own product, our core focus is enabling developers to build meaningful end-to-end solutions from day 1. To that end, we wanted this post to share some technical details on how embedded wallets got their&nbsp;start.</p> In the beginning, there was&nbsp;entropy <p>A wallet is born when 128 bits of entropy are chosen randomly by a CSPRNG. These bits are converted to a mnemonic via <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">BIP-39</a> which is used to derive the user’s wallet key&nbsp;pair.</p><p>While wallet software is many things, the entirety of the wallet can be reduced to these 128&nbsp;bits.</p><p>The choices are 128, 160, 192, 224, or 256 bits. These map to 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 word mnemonics. 128 was chosen for its simplicity. This will be configurable by integrating applications.</p> Sharing is&nbsp;caring <p>It’s critical the entropy (henceforth referred to as the mnemonic) is secured and only accessible by the end-user it belongs&nbsp;to.</p><p>Privy’s embedded wallets achieve this by deploying a Shamir Secret Sharing scheme where the mnemonic is split into N shares and can be recovered using M of N shares. In our implementation, three total shares are allocated, with two belonging to the end-user and one secured by Privy. This has two core advantages: Privy alone cannot reconstruct the mnemonic and access user keys, and the user can always access their keys without needing to go through&nbsp;Privy.</p> We value our&nbsp;clients <p>To protect users and remain non-custodial, mnemonics and other plaintext key material are never transmitted over networks or exposed to servers. Everything happens on the end-user’s device. Wallets are created on the end-user’s device. Shares are reconstructed on the end-user’s device. Requests are serviced on — you get&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thus, clients are responsible for protecting the user’s wallet. While the UI remains under control of integrating applications, we leverage headless iframes to create a sandboxed environment where keys can safely be used to service requests sent to the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Compatibility is&nbsp;key <p>We value interoperability and choice. Users must be able to take their wallet keys with them in the event they no longer wish to use&nbsp;Privy.</p><p>Like all modern wallets, embedded wallets are <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets</a> and adhere to the multi-account hierarchy specified in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">BIP-44</a>. This ensures compatibility across existing wallet software and thus enables users to switch clients at any time with the click of a&nbsp;button.</p> User experience is paramount <p>Private keys and mnemonics are not particularly human-friendly, especially for non-technical users. Therefore, it is imperative that Privy shield users from the technical underpinnings. To the extent possible, Privy creates a Web2-like experience with features your every day user would expect. Examples include social logins, cross-device support, and simple account recovery.</p><p>One feature to highlight here is enabling developers to craft human-readable messages for their users. This enables signature and transaction requests to be on-brand and contextually relevant.</p> Looking ahead <p>Enabling users to come in with their existing wallet, or create one on the fly for app usage unlocks new possibilities in web3. Building for diverse audiences is essential to driving web3 forward all while maintaining that which makes the space exciting: ownership, interoperability and composability of data and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>We believe embedded wallets are going to be huge. Even though we’re just getting started, we’re excited about various improvements across the UX, DX, and the overall security of these wallets. If this sounds like a feature that would give your app a boost, <a href="https://50fzxaracbi.typeform.com/to/v5gtHb74?typeform-source=www.console.privy.io">we’d love to help get you&nbsp;started</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/embedded-wallets-a-birds-eye-view-85557184bfb6">Embedded Wallets: A bird’s eye view</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

    <p>Horizen EON is our first public proof-of-stake sidechain and a fully EVM-compatible smart contracting platform that allows developers to efficiently build and deploy dapps on Horizen, while fully benefiting from the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p>In this step by step guide below, we will walk you through the process of creating an ERC-20 Token on Gobi Testnet – the permanent public testing environment for EON.&nbsp;</p>
 Tools used in this tutorial 
 
 <a href="https://matamask.io">MetaMask</a> 
 <a href="https://faucet.horizen.io/">Gobi test token faucet</a> 
 <a href="https://chainlist.org/?search=yuma&amp;testnets=true">Chainlist</a> 
 <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard">Open Zeppelin</a> 
 <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Remix</a> 
 <a href="https://gobi-explorer.horizen.io/">Gobi block explorer</a> 
 
<p>We assume you already have MetaMask installed on your browser for this tutorial. If you do not, you can <a href="https://metamask.io/download/">download MetaMask here.&nbsp;</a></p>
 STEP 1: Connect Gobi Testnet to MetaMask&nbsp; 
<p>You can easily<a href="https://chainlist.org/chain/1663"> connect Gobi Testnet to MetaMask through Chainlist.</a> Follow the instructions on the screen, Gobi Testnet should appear on your MetaMask:</p>
<p></p>
 STEP 2: Claim test token – TZEN 
<p>You’ll need TZEN as transaction fees to send your newly created tokens. You can get TZEN from the <a href="https://faucet.horizen.io/">Gobi test token faucet</a>. Copy and paste your Metamask address in the “Wallet Address” field on the faucet.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 STEP 3: Create your code on Open Zeppelin and create a new contract on Remix 
<p>Now we are ready to create your ERC-20 token! To do so, a simple way is via the <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard">Open Zeppelin wizard</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we are going to create a Javier Token in honor of our team member Manon’s #ZenCat Javier. Here is him supervising Manon.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Select the “ERC-20” tab&nbsp; 
 Complete the following fields:
 
 Name: think of a cool name for your token 
 Symbol: your token symbol 
 Premint: The amount of token you want to create 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 When you are done, click on “Open in Remix” and it will lead you to the Remix webpage 
 Rename your file according to the name of your token/ smart-contract 
 
<p></p>
 STEP 4: Deploy your smart contract on Gobi Testnet 
<p>To deploy on the Gobi testnet, first, make sure Gobi testnet is selected and connected on MetaMask</p>
 
 On Remix, go to “Deploy and run transactions” by clicking the Ethereum icon on the left&nbsp; 
 Select “Injected Provider – MetaMask”&nbsp; 
 Be sure that the address here matches your MetaMask address in the “ACCOUNT” field 
 
<p></p>
<p>Go on the Compiler and make sure that the “Enable Optimization” is checked</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-5.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Go back to “Deploy &amp; run transactions” and click “Compile” (The green play icon)<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-6.jpg"></a> 
 Click on “Deploy”  
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-7.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Click on “Confirm” on MetaMask 
 
<p></p>
 STEP 6: Verify your smart contract on the Gobi block explorer 
 
 On Remix, your contract should appear on the left. Click on “Copy” 
 
<p></p>
 
 Import your token on MetaMask
 
 Click on “import a token” 
 Paste the contract address 
 Click on “Add a custom token” 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 Go on the Gobi Explorer <a href="https://gobi-explorer.horizen.io/">https://gobi-explorer.horizen.io/</a> 
 Paste on the search bar and press “Enter” 
 Your contract should appear&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-11.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-12.jpg"></a></p>
 STEP 7: Flatten and publish 
 
 On Remix, go back in “File Explorer” 
 Use the right-click and select “flatten” 
 Click on the flattened contract 
 Copy the data on the right, you can select all with “Crtl+A” 
 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.05-AM-1.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Go back on the Gobi Explorer at your contract address and click on “Code” then on “Verify and Publish” 
 Select “Via flattened source code”, then click on “Next” 
 Make sure to have the same data on the Solidity Compiler, and the data that appears on the Gobi block explorer and paste the code on “Enter the Solidity Contract Code” 
 Make sure to enter the “Contract Name”. Here “Javier Token” 
 Click on Verify and Publish. Your code is now verified!&nbsp; 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.05-AM-2.jpg"></a></p>
<p></p>
 STEP 8: Send tokens 
 
 Go on MetaMask, to your newly created token, and click on “send” 
 Enter the address where you want to send your tokens to&nbsp; 
 Enter the amount and click on “Next” 
 Click on “Confirm” 
 The tokens are sent, and you can view them on the Gobi explorer! 
 
<p>The recipient may have to import your token in MetaMask. To do so, he must click on “import a token” and then paste the token contract address available on the Gobi explorer. (You can also send him the token contract address, the one you used to import the token on your MetaMask at the beginning of the tutorial)</p>

Just like a composer feeds an instrument the notes to play, a prompt engineer feeds an AI a map of what to produce. And if we know anything from music it’s that composing great music takes great skill!</p><p>In this episode we explore the emerging importance of prompting with Guy Parsons, the early learnings of how to do it effectively, and where this field might be going.</p><p>Will the prompt engineer be more like the highly sought after DevOps engineer, or a proficiency like Excel that you find on every resume?

<p>Today, all of us at Web3auth moved a step closer to realising our mission of passing the identity ownership back to the individuals and users. We partnered with FOX -owned Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) to provide a seamless Web3 user onboarding experience for The Masked Singer Experience.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1626028978220990464">https://twitter.com/i/status/1626028978220990464</a></p><p>A typical web3 wallet’s user onboarding experience involves setting up a seed phrase for authentication, which is a complex and tedious task. It takes the user anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes. This timeframe has churn written all over it, and it is quite significant in web3 user adoption standards.</p><p>But this has been the standard practice over the years. After we launched Web3Auth and had numerous customers using our wallet infrastructure, several consumer-focused applications have seen a 3x increase in conversion rates, from 24% to about 63%, as opposed to conventional seed phrase wallet solutions.</p><p>In a significant paradigm shift that we have been able to enable today, we joined forces with FOX Entertainment-owned Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) to offer the most seamless onboarding experience possible for the fans of The Masked Singer Experience. This digital fan community is an evolution of the singing competition The Masked Singer — television #1 unscripted series.</p><p>With this partnership, Web3Auth will allow the fan community to connect to The Masked Singer Experience seamlessly, by logging in to the experience and setting up a web3 wallet directly via email, social and Google accounts instead of having to use the conventional seed phrase-enabled wallets. After this collaboration with us, users will need only less than a minute to set up their wallet accounts.</p><p>We decided to give this renewed onboarding journey a special&nbsp;name.</p><p>Two-Factor Wallets&nbsp;(2FW)</p><p>Users can set up a 2FW via 2FA flows — including social logins, phone, laptops, or even biometrics which would take less than a minute. The 2FW also significantly enhances wallet security — if one factor is damaged, users can still recover the wallet using the other&nbsp;factors.</p><p>Our Co-founder and CEO Zhen Yu Yong recommends three key factors for web2 businesses to consider for a successful web3 project&nbsp;launch:</p>  intuitive user experience  familiar user&nbsp;journey  security  <p>He believes that intuitive user experience and accessibility are paramount to allow the show’s fans and crypto enthusiasts to enjoy the reimagined Masker Singer NFT experience.</p><p>But the partnership only makes more sense for Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL). It empowers creators to build their communities through web3-centered fandom experiences that allow people to interact with content in new ways, ultimately reshaping the entertainment industry as we know it by infusing it with a new sense of freedom, access and control. BCL believes the future of the entertainment industry lies within Web3, which will help democratize access to Hollywood, strengthen the bond between creators and their communities and pave new avenues for creativity, innovation and&nbsp;success.</p><p>Today, we have been able to scale Web3Auth to a place where we have already onboarded over 500 web2 and web3 applications and wallets.

 Web3Auth Self-host SDK is now Core&nbsp;Kit <p>Simplification in access — a core principle our entire team at Web3Auth consistently strives for. It has been a significant part of our engineering culture. Today, we move a step closer towards our mission to simplify Web3 wallet infrastructure for everyone.</p> Our Self-host SDK is now Core&nbsp;Kit <p>We decided to do a little rebranding to our Self-host SDK, and call it Core Kit. Because it is the core infrastructure that resides underneath all of our products. Simple and&nbsp;easy.</p><p>Of course, there are reasons why we chose to change the&nbsp;name.</p>  The very term self-host could possibly imply that our customers had to do a lot of heavy-lifting.  It could have been very easily interpreted with our Plug &amp; Play&nbsp;SDK.  <p>Here is a little context pertaining to the underlying technological architecture in our two flagship SDKs — Core Kit (previously Self-host) and Plug &amp;&nbsp;Play.</p><p>These SDKs are built on top of an underlying SDK called tKey, which stands for Threshold Key. The <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/tkey/">tKey SDK</a> manages private keys by generating shares using Shamir Secret Sharing, a threshold cryptographic algorithm technique. The image below shows how the tKey SDK architecture plays out in a virtual environment.</p>Web3Auth’s tKey SDK architecture<p>Now when it came to Self-host as a term, ‘hosting by the self’ was a possible misinterpretation we did not want our customers to take away from&nbsp;it.</p>  Self-host offered a bundled package of core components or UI-less SDKs to help a customer customize their desired user interface (UI) to further generate and manage their shares. This implies only one thing — it empowers you to retain your own brand’s user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)&nbsp;flow.  On the other hand, the core purpose of our Plug &amp; Play SDK was to offer a standardized and default user interface (UI) and a user experience (UX) flow from Web3Auth — so that our customers could seamlessly generate and manage their desired number of&nbsp;shares.  <p>By definition, this particular SDK is supposed to be a set of tools that would help you build an authentication engine for your platform — essentially, a non-custodial wallet. But the problem is that our Plug &amp; Play SDK also has a similar purpose, but the only differentiation is that — it allows no room to customize any&nbsp;shares.</p><p>The change of name to Core Kit also refers to exactly what our SDKs offer — a bundled package of UI-less SDKs (or core components) to help you gain better access and control over the user experience (UX) flows, while retaining your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Here is what the Core Kit&nbsp;entails:</p>  tKey JS SDK, which works on web and react&nbsp;native.  A web-based Single Factor Auth&nbsp;SDK.  A NodeJS Server SDK hosted on the backend nodejs&nbsp;server.  <blockquote>“Owing to this potential misinterpretation, we wanted to take this space and opportunity to explain why we decided to do this rebranding.”</blockquote><p>As we move forward, we are soon going to launch the tKey Android iOS SDKs over the coming few months. Besides, we are also going to launch an aggregator SDK for all of the Core Kit in Web, to allow for better ease of integration.</p><p>If you are an enterprise looking to add a powerful web3 component to your existing systems, look no further — Core Kit is&nbsp;here!</p><p>Furthermore, below is a summary of all the other product updates we&nbsp;have:</p> A revamped Plug &amp; Play&nbsp;SDK <p>Our Plug &amp; Play suite now has all UI SDKs, giving you quick and easy access to our platform.</p><p>Here is what the suit includes:</p>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/modal/">Web Modal&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/no-modal/">Web No Modal&nbsp;SDK</a>  an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/android/">Android SDK</a>, an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/ios/">iOS&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/react-native/">React Native&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/flutter/">Flutter&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/unity/">Unity&nbsp;SDK</a>  a Unreal SDK is out, documentation will be launched&nbsp;soon   Updated documentation <p>All of our documentation has been revamped with a new <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/quick-start">quick start</a>, and general flows to highlight our products and integration better.</p><p>Check them out&nbsp;<a href="https://web3auth.io/docs">here</a>.</p> We’re on Discourse, our newest community portal! <p>We have now fully migrated from GitHub Discussions to a brand new community forum on Discourse to enable a superior community support experience, better search capabilities, more accurate suggestions, and quicker responses.</p><p>Join our community forum&nbsp;<a href="https://community.web3auth.io/">here</a>.</p><p>Over the last 4 years, our team at Web3Auth has been able to onboard over 500 applications and wallets across Web2 and Web3. Today, we manage more than 12 million user keys a month, a growth that is significant and exponential from that of our previous&nbsp;years.</p><p>Traditional wallet authentication methods such as seed-phrases, are difficult to remember and are vulnerable to phishing attacks. We have been working hard the last 4 years on various key management technologies and we believe we have been instrumental in pioneering this paradigm shift in the industry, especially after having launched our <a href="https://web3auth.io/mpc.html">Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</a> technology.</p><p>But this is only the beginning. As we continue this journey to achieve our audacious mission, which is to make digital ownership human-centric and accessible to everyone, we want to thank you for being a part of our thriving community and for your support in helping us build this wallet infrastructure for&nbsp;all.</p><p>We’d love for you to try out Core Kit, the Plug &amp; Play SDKs, and join us in the product conversations on <a href="https://community.web3auth.io/">Discourse</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/important-product-updates-web3auth-self-host-and-plug-and-play-590bdf414ef6">Important Product Updates — Web3Auth Self Host and Plug and Play</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is to clarify our response to a detailed internal investigation into a claimed vulnerability attack on Web3 Magic&nbsp;Links.</p><p>Today, we want to take this opportunity to address a claimed vulnerability on Magic Links in Web3 highlighted by DFNS.co. Read more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/24/crypto-wallet-firm-dfns-says-magic-links-have-critical-vulnerability/">here</a>.</p><p>The disclosure describes a phishing attack on passwordless Magic Links, that affects Web2 applications but was aimed specifically toward Web3 applications.</p><p>A short summary of the incident with the timelines:</p>  This phishing method was disclosed to us privately on Thursday, 23rd February 2023, over a voice&nbsp;call.  Between 23rd and 25th February, upon discovery of the phishing attack, the Web3Auth team launched a detailed investigation into potentially affected users and their accounts.  In conclusion, the investigation found no cases of existing users being affected by this&nbsp;attack.  A verification challenge and stricter IP policies were implemented to prevent future phishing attempts on Monday, 27th February, 2023.  <p>A brief overview of the phishing&nbsp;attack:</p><p>When a user wants to sign up and log in to any user account on the internet, the conventional flow is that he or she would get a verification email with a link to confirm and verify the email address. Upon verification, the user would now be able to access the dashboard or the user&nbsp;account.</p><p>But in this case, which happens to be a phishing attack, a malicious third party comes into play. It triggers a login request, because of which it sends out a passwordless web3 Magic Link to the user’s email. The link could possibly have a call-to-action button that prompts the user to log in. When the user clicks on it, the malicious third party would now be able to log in on behalf of the user, but the user is kept in the dark about the consequences until the account is accessed or&nbsp;altered.</p><p>This was how the claimed vulnerability attack unfolded, which turned out to be a well-known phishing&nbsp;attack.</p><p>Upon intimation of the issue on 23rd Feb 2023, Web3Auth conducted a detailed investigation into potential scenarios under which the issue might have occurred.</p><p>The investigation found that there were no such cases of this vulnerability found with respect to our existing user accounts. Our current policies that are already in place, display the origination of login requests as well as open channels for support, for identified malicious requests. These shall effectively prepare us for similar malicious incidents where the user did not activate the request in the first place. Rest assured, we continue to conduct our business and everyday operations while our users have absolutely nothing to worry&nbsp;about.</p><p>Our future commitment</p><p>However, this gave us an opportunity to further tighten our existing security measures. As part of some immediate remedial actions, we have proactively added additional security policies to identify potential and existing phishing attacks. This included matching and verification of a numeric login code to identify false requests, along with more stringent IP blocking, if the attack originated from different locations.</p><p>To ensure that we handle similar issues in a timely and effective manner, we have developed a Security SOP. Further, if you happen to discover any issues with our product, please email us at security@web3auth.io. Our team shall quickly review your submission and respond within 72 hours. While submitting these issues, kindly provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, the potential impact, and any additional information that may be&nbsp;helpful.</p><p>Feel free to refer to our <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/contribute/bug-bounty">bug bounty program</a> as&nbsp;well.</p><p>As part of our commitment to platform security, we will acknowledge your submission and keep you informed of our progress in addressing the vulnerabilities. We would also publicly recognize your contribution, with your permission, in our security hall of&nbsp;fame.</p><p>We take the security of our platform very seriously. We acknowledge your support and extend our gratitude for joining us in our mission to improve the security of Web3Auth and Web3 as an entirety.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auths-statement-on-the-recent-magic-link-phishing-attack-afd7f46566cf">Web3Auth’s statement on the recent Magic Link phishing attack</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Social logins to Two-Factor wallets that leverage the security of their devices as well. Here is where we echo a similar philosophy and align with Safe on the&nbsp;same.</p><p>”Today, there is a binary choice for users. They can either completely give up ownership of their assets to a custodian and play in a walled garden, or bear the full responsibility of protecting their assets and scrutinizing every transaction. Small everyday burdens of gas fees, seed phrases, jumping wallets, and switching networks to do simple transactions have made web3 unusable by the&nbsp;masses.</p><p>We need to do&nbsp;better.”</p><p>As for developers, if you want to understand more and build on top of the Account Abstraction experience, join us in a month-long global AA Hackathon.

 Web3Auth vs Magic — How to choose your Key Management Solution  Authentication is one of the most important components of any application and as the Web3 movement grows, wallet &amp; private key management becomes its most critical aspect. The right to own your own key and the right to own your own identity.  For any dApps, the fundamental question is — how are you managing your users’ wallet? Keeping in mind this critical question, we are comparing two of the leaders in the wallet management space, Web3Auth and&nbsp;Magic. <p>Before we deep dive into the technical details and comparison, let’s understand what these solutions are trying to achieve. Both Web3Auth and Magic replace seed phrases with intuitive one-click logins making onboarding into web3 seamless while giving control to the application to manage their&nbsp;flows.</p><p>Further to that, the infrastructure and usage of both the platforms is very different and needs a deeper understanding. For this, we will be comparing the two platforms on the following aspects:</p>  Wallet Management: How the users’ private keys are managed and held&nbsp;safe?  Authentications Options: How many types of authentication and 2FA methods are supported?  Multichain Support: How many blockchains are supported and utilised?  White Labelling and Customisation: How much control the developer has on the UX&nbsp;flows?  Scalability: How the platforms perform for applications at&nbsp;scale.  Ease of integration: How easy it is to implement a basic instance of the platform.  Open Source &amp; Native platforms support: How much code is publicly available and audited? How many platforms are supported?   Differences in Wallet Management Infrastructure <p>According to the Magic’s <a href="https://magic-whitepaper-key-based-authentication-system.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Magic+Whitepaper.pdf">Whitepaper</a>,</p><blockquote>“Magic’s Delegated Key Management leverages Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) provided by Amazon Web Services’ Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Dedicated user master keys generated using AES-256 with 384-bits of entropy are stored on the HSMs. The master keys never leave the hardware as they are meant to be locked inside and unable to be exported. All encryption and decryption operations happen inside the hardware modules themselves. HSMs are a lot like popular 7 FIDO devices like YubiKeys or hardware-based wallets for cryptocurrency storage such as Trezor or Ledger, but instead of traditional harddrive storage, they sit in the cloud, secured by AWS’s data&nbsp;centers.</blockquote><blockquote>Users’ private keys are encrypted by these hardware-based user master keys, which means that attackers need to gain access to the hardware to be able to retrieve the keys, and are forced to stay within Magic’s adversarial infrastructure — which is capable to detect, impede, and monitor attacker’s progress to prevent and mitigate any damages.”</blockquote><p>Hence, we can see that Magic depends on Amazon Web Service’s (AWS) Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for their key encryption. The users’ private keys are encrypted by these hardware-based user master keys and stored separately in a multi-region MySQL database.. This approach is good in terms of speed and availability, however has a major flaw, wherein the entire private key sits encrypted on the cloud secured by AWS KMS which can be a single point of failure. Hence, we can regard their solution as a semi-custodial system.</p><p>Web3Auth is a<a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-is-here-9387d570990b"> fully non custodial MPC (Multi Party Computation) solution</a> where the user keys are distributed across a network of nodes owned by the top firms in the crypto industry and the user’s own devices. This is enabled by an on chain node network distributed key generation followed by an off chain multi-sig. The key is never fully owned by anyone and only the user has the access to it via their own authentication methods. While making a blockchain transaction, the key is never reconstructed or stored anywhere, rather a series of partial signatures are done across the network and user devices and the final signature is generated for the transaction.</p><p>This infrastructure can be used across the world with node availability throughout the world with industry leading speeds and a surety that user keys are never owned by a single entity&nbsp;anytime.</p><p>You can read more about Web3Auth’s <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/overview/key-management/">Wallet Management Infrastructure</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-is-here-9387d570990b">New MPC Solution</a>.</p> Authentications Options <p>One of key features of Web3Auth and Magic is the support of any social, federated identity ( Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, etc.) and custom JWT auth providers. This allows developers to integrate any kind of login method, provided they are using JWT ID Token for user registration.</p><p>In addition to this, Two Factor Authentication is a key aspect of keeping your accounts secure. Magic supports 2FA with mobile operators like Authy and Google Authenticator and/or SMS authentication giving you the traditional experience of&nbsp;2FA.</p><p>Web3Auth introduces a new layer of security here with the introduction of Two Factor Wallets. Web3Auth actually uses its off chain multi sig to distribute keys into multiple devices and or SMS/ other authentication methods. This enables you to get a true decentralised 2FA setup where your keys are secured even if one of the authentication methods is compromised.</p> Multichain Support <p>Web3Auth’s SDKs are chain agnostic, ie. they can be used on any blockchain. Today there are thousands of dApps built on numerous blockchains that have integrated Web3Auth. On the other hand, Magic supports 20+ popular blockchains.</p> White Labelling and Customisation <p>Web3Auth allows applications and wallets to fully customise and whitelabel the solution. Using the various options of integration available, you can even make Web3Auth totally invisible in the user flow focusing totally on your application end to end. Magic does provide a range of customisation options, but it is limited as compared to Web3Auth.</p> Scalability <p>Both the solutions do very well in terms of scalability of users and availability across multiple regions. Being hosted on AWS HSMs, Magic is available worldwide within their servers. These servers are owned by&nbsp;Amazon.</p><p>Web3Auth’s network of nodes are hosted worldwide and by trusted industry leaders like Polygon, Binance, Tendermint, ENS, Etherscan etc. Additionally, with the new Sapphire network of Web3Auth, applications can choose to run their own nodes in addition to the nodes available publicly giving them flexibility and control over their user scalability.</p> Ease of Integration <p>A basic integration of both the platforms is quite easy and straightforward. With Web3Auth a basic of the Plug and Play SDKs requires just <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/quick-start">4 basic steps</a> and with excellent documentation and examples guiding you throughout the journey of building your own customised solution. A basic integration takes less than 15 mins of work and no extra customisation is required for being production ready. You also have the flexibility to migrate to a more advanced integration with our range of SDKs available for different use cases and platforms. We also have an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/integration-builder">integration builder</a> which, according to your requirements, shapes up a ready to use code that can be directly implemented in your application.</p><p>A basic Magic integration takes a similar approach with one additional step. You need to use custom authentication for using any social login provider apart from email passwordless. Their documentation and guides are great to follow along and one can figure out how to implement them&nbsp;easily.</p> Open Source &amp; Native Platform&nbsp;Support <p>Open source is at the heart of decentralisation. Both Web3Auth and Magic have strong multi platform support and an active open source community around their products. Web3Auth supports Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, Unity and Unreal Engine. Magic supports all of them except Unreal Engine. They additionally support PHP and WordPress logins.</p><p>At Web3Auth, all these SDKs are open sourced alongside our core infrastructural SDKs and smart contracts controlling the nodes as well. These are fully audited by some of the top smart contract auditing firms in the world.
