<p>It’s no secret that we are in an era defined by data collection and algorithmic insight. And the concept of a surveillance society is no longer theoretical, but a lived reality impacting everything, especially our financial interactions.</p><p>As the lines between public and private blur, the need for privacy in financial transactions has intensified, moving from a niche concern to a mainstream imperative. We sought expert insight from Eric Stanek, a respected mentor within the PIVX Ambassador Program, to tackle fundamental questions around&nbsp;privacy.</p> 1. In your opinion, what constitutes a “surveillance society?” <p>A surveillance society exists when governments and corporations can monitor every citizen’s activities without justification or oversight. While we already face significant digital surveillance through tech platforms and government data collection, a true surveillance society emerges when this monitoring becomes total and automated. The combination of digital currencies, artificial intelligence, and comprehensive data tracking creates unprecedented control mechanisms that can influence behaviour, restrict freedoms, and undermine democratic principles. This represents a level of societal control that surpasses historical dictatorships in both scope and effectiveness.</p> 2. Why has the concept of privacy in financial transactions become a more pressing issue in recent&nbsp;years? <p>The development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) represents the most significant threat to financial privacy in modern history. CBDCs enable governments to track, control, and restrict every financial transaction in real-time. We’re already seeing implementations in authoritarian regimes where citizens face restrictions on basic necessities based on their social credit scores or political views. The programmable nature of CBDCs allows for automatic enforcement of spending limits, geographic restrictions, and even expiration dates on savings. Financial transactions reveal intimate details about our lives, relationships, and beliefs; information that should remain private in free societies.</p> 3. How do privacy coins specifically address the challenges posed by a surveillance society in terms of financial freedom and individual autonomy? <p>Privacy coins utilize zero-knowledge proofs to completely hide transaction amounts, sender identities, and recipient addresses without relying on breakable encryption. This technology creates the digital equivalent of physical cash transactions as only the parties involved know the details. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies where all transactions are publicly visible, privacy coins ensure that even completely legal activities remain confidential. This protection is essential because financial surveillance can be used to target individuals for their political beliefs, personal relationships, or lifestyle choices, even when no laws are&nbsp;broken.</p> 4. We’ve seen regulators target privacy-centric cryptos. Do you really think there’s a future for such projects? <p>Privacy coins will survive regulatory pressure because the underlying technology cannot be eliminated, and economic incentives will always favour jurisdictions that embrace innovation. Just as governments couldn’t stop the internet despite its threat to traditional control mechanisms, cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow regardless of regulatory hostility. Competition between nations ensures that some will recognize the economic advantages of crypto-friendly policies. The fundamental properties of decentralized networks make them resistant to complete shutdown, and true privacy protocols represent technological advancement that cannot be uninvented.</p> 5. Are privacy coins essential for protecting civil liberties? <p>Privacy is a fundamental human right that forms the foundation of all other freedoms. Without financial privacy, individuals cannot exercise true autonomy in their personal, political, or economic choices. As Edward Snowden noted, “Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” History demonstrates that surveillance powers, once granted, are inevitably expanded and abused. Privacy coins provide a crucial check against governmental overreach and ensure that citizens retain control over their personal information and financial autonomy.</p> 6. Critics often link privacy coins to illicit activities. How do you respond to these concerns? <p>Criminals have always used whatever tools are available — cash, banks, cars, phones, and the internet — yet we don’t ban these technologies because of their misuse. Government agencies and traditional financial institutions, despite extensive AML and KYC regulations, remain involved in the largest financial crimes globally. Privacy coins simply extend the same confidentiality we expect from physical cash to digital transactions. The argument that only criminals need privacy is fundamentally flawed and ignores the legitimate need for financial confidentiality in protecting individuals from theft, coercion, political persecution, and corporate surveillance.</p> 7. Is it possible for privacy coins to exist in a way that balances individual privacy with the need for law enforcement to combat crime? If so,&nbsp;how? <p>The current system already demonstrates that financial surveillance fails to prevent crime while creating significant risks for law-abiding citizens. Public financial information would dramatically increase crimes like kidnapping, extortion, and home invasion by revealing individuals’ wealth. Privacy coins can coexist with law enforcement through targeted investigation methods that don’t require mass surveillance of all citizens. Exchange interfaces and optional transparency features can provide compliance pathways for those who choose them, while preserving the fundamental right to financial privacy for personal transactions.</p> 8. Do you foresee privacy coins becoming mainstream, or will they remain a niche aspect of the cryptocurrency market? <p>Privacy will become the defining issue of the next two years as CBDC implementations reveal their control mechanisms to the general public. Major blockchain projects are already integrating privacy features, which will dramatically increase awareness and adoption. Projects like Cardano’s Midnight are investing heavily in privacy infrastructure and education. As surveillance concerns become more apparent and privacy technology matures, the demand for financial confidentiality will drive mainstream adoption. The principle that “a rising tide lifts all boats” applies directly to the privacy coin ecosystem.</p> 9. If you were advising a government on how to approach privacy coins, what would be your key recommendations? <p>Governments should adopt a hands-off approach: no taxation, tracking, or restrictions on privacy coins. Public officials should use transparent, public blockchains for all government transactions to ensure accountability and eliminate corruption. Private citizens should have access to private transactions to maintain their freedom and autonomy. This approach recognizes that cryptocurrency technology cannot be stopped and will ultimately achieve the separation of money and state. Governments that embrace this reality early will benefit from increased innovation and economic growth, while those that resist will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.</p> 10. Imagine a future where central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are widely adopted and highly programmable. How would privacy coins fit into such a financial landscape? <p>In a CBDC-dominated landscape, privacy coins will likely operate through decentralized exchanges and circular economies, as centralized platforms may be restricted from supporting them. However, the excessive control mechanisms of CBDCs will likely accelerate adoption of privacy alternatives as citizens experience firsthand the limitations of programmable money. Privacy coins will serve as the escape valve for individuals seeking to maintain financial autonomy. The more restrictive CBDCs become, the more valuable privacy coins will appear to users who recognize the importance of financial freedom and personal sovereignty.</p> 11. If you had to design a “perfect” privacy coin, what features would it prioritize, and how would it address current criticisms? <p>A perfect privacy coin must prioritize usability, security, and regulatory compatibility while maintaining true decentralization. PIVX exemplifies this approach as a privacy-focused cryptocurrency dedicated to being private digital cash for the internet. Essential features&nbsp;include:</p>  Near-instant transactions for practical daily use, eliminating the delays that hinder adoption.  Zero-knowledge privacy protocols provide unbreakable transaction confidentiality without relying on potentially vulnerable encryption methods.  Fair launch principles with no ICO or premine ensure equitable distribution and prevent centralized control by early investors or developers.  Near-zero fees make the currency accessible to users worldwide, particularly in developing economies where transaction costs matter&nbsp;most.  FATF/AML/CFT compliance via special ‘Exchange Addresses’ mitigates regulatory concerns while maintaining privacy, demonstrating that privacy and compliance can coexist. Operating without a legal entity structure prevents single points of regulatory failure and government targeting.  Self-funding mechanisms through community governance ensure long-term sustainability without external dependencies.  A community-driven meritocracy ensures decisions benefit all users rather than corporate interests, while environmental sustainability through proof-of-stake consensus addresses climate concerns that plague energy-intensive cryptocurrencies.  Decentralized masternode governance distributes decision-making power across the network, preventing centralized control while maintaining network efficiency and security.  <p>These features collectively create a privacy coin that addresses current criticisms while remaining true to cryptocurrency’s foundational principles of decentralization and individual sovereignty.</p><p>PIVX.

  Partnering with Traversal: Because every engineer remembers their first time … troubleshooting   <p>Anish, Ahmed, Raaz and Raj are bringing AI to troubleshooting—one of the biggest pain points for engineering teams.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a>	 



Published June 18, 2025
  



TEAM TRAVERSAL.



 
<p>We’ve been looking for a company like <a href="https://www.traversal.com/">Traversal</a> for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more than a decade, we at Sequoia have been obsessed with <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-unstoppable-rise-of-the-developer-economy/">“the rise of the developer,”</a> guiding our partnerships with companies that cater to engineers like GitHub, MongoDB and Stripe. And Bogomil has been fascinated with observability for years: shortly after joining Sequoia in 2020, after a friend pointed out to him that “observability is a s***show,” he <a href="https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-future-of-observability-6918caaa021">identified</a> that a new generation of tools would help technical teams care for their systems.</p>



<p>More recently, it became clear that the road to reinventing observability ran through AI. Back in 2023, as GitHub Copilot caught lightning in a bottle, Charlie and our partners Stephanie and Josephine <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-powered-developer-tools/">recognized</a> that founders might apply AI to many problems engineering teams face beyond writing code. One we were excited about in particular was troubleshooting, the painstaking process of finding the root cause of a bug, often using observability data.</p>







<p>All we needed to do was find the right team to work with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Believe it or not, our relationship with Traversal’s team dates back years, too. Traversal’s founder, Anish Agarwal, knew our partner, Shaun Maguire, and former partner Dan Chen through their shared alma mater, Caltech. They remembered him as the star student who somehow managed to triple major, excel on the tennis team and still have a social life. Charlie knew co-founder Ahmed Lone, met the rest of the team and encouraged them to apply to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, our company-building program for Sequoia pre-seed and seed-stage founders.</p>



<p>They were the type of team we were looking for. In our view, AI troubleshooting was first and foremost an AI problem, and an observability problem only second. Traversal’s team of three Ph.D.s from MIT and Berkeley, who’d studied causal ML and reinforcement learning—and one former Citadel Securities quant trader who’d lived this problem firsthand—seemed like the right fit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2024, when we finally all got in one room—Sequoia’s San Francisco space atop a chocolate factory—it was obvious to us as investors what to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Observability is one of the crown jewels of infrastructure and a hotspot for generational companies. Businesses like Splunk, Datadog, Grafana and Cribl help thousands of engineers monitor their systems and generate billions in annual revenue in the process. And still, the job is unfinished. Troubleshooting remains deeply painful.</p>



<p>Picture getting woken up at 3 a.m., gathering with dozens of people in a Slack war room and “dumpster diving” through heaps of observability data to find the proverbial “needle in a haystack” root cause. That’s what engineers today do to troubleshoot. It takes hours, sometimes days, sometimes the needle is never found at all. When there are issues (and every software company has issues), slow troubleshooting costs companies dearly in terms of missed revenue and customer trust. And it costs devops and site reliability engineers (SREs) dearly in terms of lost sleep and missed dates.</p>



<p>Troubleshooting is so painful, in fact, that <a href="https://www.traversal.com/about-us">“Every engineer remembers their first time”</a>—their first production incident, that is—in the words of Traversal (then Interaction Labs) co-founder Ahmed, a former quant trader at Citadel Securities, where troubleshooting is about as high stakes as it gets. Below, he talks about a harrowing experience of troubleshooting, with minutes before the market opened.&nbsp;</p>



AHMED TALKING ABOUT HIS “FIRST TIME”—TROUBLESHOOTING—A HARROWING EXPERIENCE AS A QUANT TRADER, MINUTES BEFORE THE MARKET OPENED.&nbsp;



<p>Traversal automates troubleshooting. Their AI SRE uses a unique mix of LLMs and causal ML to do the dumpster diving, finding root causes automatically. Traversal does the dirty work, so engineers can fix problems ASAP. Companies save money and gain customer trust, and engineers no longer need to pull their hair out in the middle of the night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traversal only got started a year ago, and already they’re showing they can deliver real business ROI to companies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSvKGf2OGak">DigitalOcean</a>, American Express, Cloudways, Eventbrite and more. LLMs aren’t always great troubleshooters out of the box, but Traversal’s team has developed a unique approach: swarms of parallel investigations with proprietary statistical tools make them immediately effective at enterprise scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combine their technical skills and sense of humor with their customer obsession and ability to <a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/traversal">recruit exceptional talent</a>, and you’re starting to get a picture of Traversal’s team. That’s why we’re so excited to be their partners after leading their seed round a year ago, and to support their mission: making life for engineers and engineering teams much, much better.&nbsp;</p>

  Partnering with Crosby: A Law Firm at the Speed of AI  <p>Ryan, John and their team are pairing legal LLMs and bright legal minds to enable companies scaling quickly to execute their contracts faster than ever.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/alfred-lin/">Alfred Lin</a>	 



Published June 17, 2025
  



CROSBY CO-FOUNDERS JOHN SARIHAN AND RYAN DANIELS.<br>



 
<p>In the age of AI, everything from coding to design to sales is moving faster — but contracting remains slow and has become a major impediment, especially for companies that are scaling fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://crosbylegal.com/">Crosby</a> lets the fastest growing companies reach agreement between humans, at the speed of software. They’re bringing together world-class legal and engineering talent to build the world’s first hybrid law firm, one that combines human oversight with AI’s superhuman speed.</p>



<p>Semantics, details and nuance are foundational in law. Crosby co-founders Ryan Daniels and John Sarihan recognized that people are still better than technology at capturing the subtleties of certain clauses and connecting the dots between business context and legal documents. Crosby built their product accordingly, with both people and AI agents playing a vital role. Agents handle initial passes at standard changes, flag common issues and prepare preliminary redlines, allowing Crosby’s attorneys to focus on strategic decisions and complex legal reasoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That MSA you need signed ASAP? Crosby will return a marked-up copy in less than an hour, advising which terms to accept or push back on based on their context about your business. Crosby plugs into your existing deal desk workflow, ingests inbound contracts and order forms and delivers results faster than any human, at a fraction of the cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critical to Crosby’s success is the complex knowledge base they build for each customer, incorporating legal preferences and becoming more bespoke over time. Ultimately, Crosby will enter a negotiation understanding everything about your preferences — and the preferences of the business across the table — so it can suggest the optimal solution. Your contract process is faster and more affordable, without sacrificing trust or quality. Crosby provides your company the same legal resources as a larger enterprise, and frees up your GTM team to do what they do best: closing deals and winning, faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re already seeing this happen for Crosby’s customers, including Cursor, Clay and UnifyGTM. They’re processing sales contracts in two hours or less, saving thousands of dollars and dozens of hours as Crosby turns what once was an expensive, lengthy process into a competitive accelerant.</p>



<p>Like Crosby itself, Ryan and John’s partnership pairs exceptional legal and engineering talent. We at Sequoia already knew John, a phenomenal engineer and product leader, from his days at Ramp. Ryan worked with our general counsel at Cooley after researching legal AI at Stanford Law. The two of them are wonderfully complementary and have incredible chemistry, which has translated to them building a killer team and serving raving customers. We are proud to lead Crosby’s seed round, and to be alongside their <a href="https://crosby.ai/careers">expanding team</a> as they become a trusted partner for fast-growing companies.</p>

  Why AI Labs Are Starting to Look Like Sports Teams  <p>With compute more abundant, talent is the new bottleneck in AI. Star players are signing pay packages that resemble those of professional athletes.
</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 



Published June 17, 2025
  



 
<p>I wrote extensively about AI last summer, starting with <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">AI’s $600B Question</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/">The Game Theory of AI CapEx</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-data-center-buildout/">AI is Shovel Ready</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/steel-servers-and-power/">Steel, Servers &amp; Power</a>, and ending with <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-ai-supply-chain-tug-of-war/">AI’s Supply Chain Tug of War</a>.</p>



<p>Reflecting one year later, it’s interesting how little has changed: AI’s $600B Question is now roughly AI’s $840B Question, assuming that Nvidia reaches something like $210B in run-rate data center revenue by year-end 2025. OpenAI remains the lion’s share of AI’s overall revenue, crossing $10B recently, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openais-annualized-revenue-hits-10-billion-up-55-billion-december-2024-2025-06-09/">Reuters</a>. The total revenue in the AI ecosystem still pales in comparison to the dollars that have been put into the ground — if anything, my estimates last year around how much revenue the Big Tech companies were making on AI were probably too high.</p>



<p>There have been three major improvements in AI over the last year: First, coding AI has really taken off. A year ago, the demos for these products were mind-blowing, and today, the coding AI space is generating something like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ai-vibe-coding-startups-burst-onto-scene-with-sky-high-valuations-2025-06-03/#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20AI%20coding,to%20build%20their%20own%20models.">$3B in run-rate revenue</a>. The second change is that reasoning has found product-market fit, and the AI ecosystem has gotten excited about a second scaling law, around inference-time compute. By repeatedly querying these models and by using reinforcement learning, we can get better, more robust results. And finally, there seems to be a <a href="https://x.com/deedydas/status/1932619060057084193">“smile curve”</a> around ChatGPT usage, where this new behavior is really getting ingrained into day-to-day life.</p>



<p>The app layer ecosystem for AI has continued to improve, leveraging cheap compute and integrated workflows to build durable businesses. More abundant compute has been good for the startup ecosystem, and companies like Harvey, Sierra, Abridge, SmarterDx, Perplexity, OpenEvidence, Clay, Sesame and many others have made great strides around packaging this capability for their customers. Our ambition one year ago was to back as many of these companies as possible, and that continues to be our ambition today.</p>



<p>There is one dynamic, however, that has really changed since last year. A year ago, everyone was talking about cluster size and pre-training scaling, and now that seems to have quietly disappeared from the public dialogue. Perhaps this is because new clusters are taking longer to get online, or because as Ilya Sutskever said in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1hdrjvq/ilyas_full_talk_at_neurips_2024_pretraining_as_we/">December</a>, “Pre-training as we know it will end.” By the same token, one year ago we were seeing a consolidation in research labs because of the daunting costs of building a foundation model lab. Microsoft/OpenAI, Amazon/Anthropic, Google, Meta and xAI emerged as five “finalists” in the AI race as others folded, because these companies had reached GPT-4 level models and had sufficient capital to continue scaling. Now, by contrast, a new cohort of players has sprouted up, including SSI, Thinking Machines, and DeepSeek, who claim talent, not raw compute scale, as their primary differentiators.</p>



<p>Whereas one year ago the narrative was around pre-training compute requirements driving consolidation, today the narrative is all about talent advantages being critical in a world of increasing compute abundance. This is especially true for Google and Meta. Google is under siege from a product positioning perspective and is doing everything in their power to reverse this dynamic. Meta’s bold decision to acquire a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/scale-ai-founder-wang-announces-exit-for-meta-part-of-14-billion-deal.html">49% stake in Scale</a> and bring in CEO Alex Wang to lead their new “founder mode” AI lab is an even more clear move in this direction. For both companies — and for the ecosystem at large — the message of 2025 is that large-scale clusters alone are insufficient. Everyone understands that new breakthroughs will be required to jump to the next level in the AI race — whether in reinforcement learning or elsewhere — and talent is the unlock to finding them.</p>



<p>With their obsessive focus on talent, the AI labs are increasingly looking like sports teams: They are each backed by a mega-rich tech company or individual. Star players can command pay packages in the tens of millions, hundreds of millions, or for the most outlier talent, seemingly even billions of dollars. Unlike sports teams where players often have long-term contracts, AI employment agreements are short-term and liquid, which means anyone can be poached at any time. One irony of this is that while the notion of AI race dynamics was originally popularized by the AI safety community as a boogeyman to avoid, this is exactly what has been wrought across two distinct domains: First compute and now talent.</p>



<p>I think this is a function of human nature. When have humans ever seen something wonderful, and then said, “Now we have enough, it’s time to cool off?” It is an intrinsic property of humanity that once critical thresholds are passed, we take things all the way to the extreme. We cannot hold ourselves back. And when the prize is as big as the perceived AI prize is, then any bottleneck that gets in the way of success — especially an illiquid bottleneck like talent — will be pushed to staggering levels.</p>



<p>And yet, even amidst this fierce competition, the broader AI ecosystem also feels calmer today than at any point in the last three years. That’s because for most people, the race itself is now a constant and the market structure feels stable. People are getting comfortable with the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-in-2025/">status quo</a>. The unstable competitive equilibrium is itself stable — for now.</p>

<p>Spain is set to roll out new legislation to tighten the leash on crypto tax reporting. Under the new directive, Spanish authorities will have the power to exchange data on digital assets held on international exchanges and seize cryptos from tax defaulters.</p><p>While proponents highlight the benefits of increased financial accountability, these new measures, which include comprehensive data reporting requirements for crypto exchanges and expanded asset seizure powers for tax authorities, point to the evolving relationship between digital assets and state&nbsp;control.</p><p>Once enforced, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) will be mandated to report extensive transaction data and user holdings directly to the Spanish tax agency. This aligns with the broader European Union’s Directive on Administrative Cooperation on Tax Transparency for Crypto-Assets (DAC8), a continent-wide initiative to address the challenges that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies presents for national tax collection.</p><p>Under DAC8, Spain’s tax authorities will not only receive data from domestic VASPs but also gain access to information on Spanish citizens’ crypto accounts held with exchanges in other EU member states, and potentially in third countries that enter into data-sharing agreements with the EU. This widespread information exchange is projected to bolster tax compliance across the EU significantly, with estimates suggesting billions in additional tax revenue. For Spanish crypto holders, this means a new era of heightened scrutiny regarding their digital asset activities, regardless of where their assets are&nbsp;held.</p><p>Adding another layer to this regulatory shift, the new Spanish law empowers the tax agency to directly seize the cryptocurrency holdings of individuals with outstanding tax debts. This expands the agency’s existing capabilities, which were traditionally limited to conventional bank accounts. The move underscores a clear intent to bring digital assets under the same enforcement umbrella as traditional financial instruments, providing the state with a more comprehensive toolkit for surveillance and debt recovery.</p><p>The EU’s DAC8 directive is set for full enforcement in January 2026, with the first data exchanges scheduled for late&nbsp;2027.</p><p>PIVX.

  Partnering with Aspora: Diaspora Banking Goes Global  <p>Parth and his team are bringing digital banking to immigrants around the world.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/luciana-lixandru/">Luciana Lixandru</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/george-robson/">George Robson</a>, and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/james-flynn/">James Flynn</a>	 



Published June 15, 2025
  



PARTH GARG, FOUNDER OF ASPORA.



 
<p>The day we met Parth Garg, we knew he was special. After an intro over Zoom, we scheduled a 24-hour trip to see him and the Aspora team in-person—and found them crammed into a Dubai hacker house, pushing tirelessly toward a major campaign. When we asked where we should go to discuss a possible partnership, Parth suggested perching on a few armless chairs in the apartment’s tiny, windowless and very active kitchen.</p>



<p>We ended up finding a spot to chat in our hotel that was a bit more comfortable for a three-hour meeting, but that moment reinforced what we already knew and loved about Parth: he was intensely focused on the company. Success in fintech often hinges on building not only in the right order, but also as quickly as possible. Parth is in the 99th percentile on both.</p>



<p>He is also smart, ambitious, decisive—and all the more impressive, self-taught. Born in India but growing up across the Middle East (where he played cricket, acted, participated in Physics Olympiads, and founded an NGO) Parth saw the roadblocks his parents and other non-resident Indians (NRIs) faced to participating in India’s economy. By age 21, he had dropped out of Stanford to solve the problem himself with <a href="https://www.aspora.com/">Aspora</a>.</p>



<p>The Indian diaspora represents one percent of the country’s population, but has a massively outsized impact on its economy. These 15 million NRIs don’t just send money home to their families. They also invest in the booming Indian stock market, take out loans, and account for close to a quarter of the country’s real estate transactions. But opening an NRI account with a legacy bank is still a painful, months-long process of mailing paper forms and even flying back to sign in-person.</p>



<p>This is a problem for Indians abroad, but also for most other immigrant communities.&nbsp;Aspora is bringing diaspora banking into the modern age, with fully digitized services to allow global diasporas to participate in their home countries’ growth stories—starting with non-resident Indians around the world. Parth and his team have already transformed remittances for these customers, streamlining the process of sending money home at half the cost of competing solutions. Next, Aspora will expand to offer a comprehensive neobanking product, with access to local savings, investing and more. And the product is just the beginning of Aspora’s growth: while the NRI market itself is massive, it is just one of many diasporas that want to support the economy at home.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia were privileged to be among Aspora’s first believers when we led their Series A late last year, and in the few short months since, their performance has reached new heights. Like Parth himself, the team around him is relentlessly driven and intent on delighting their customers, delivering constant product improvements and drastically cutting transaction times. Their customers have responded in kind, and total payment volume has increased every month, to approximately $2B today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To stay ahead of that rapid growth, Aspora is ramping up hiring, looking for ambitious, hungry people to help them solve this complex problem. If you are interested in joining this remarkable team, please <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Aspora">reach out</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Parth worked out of Sequoia’s London office in recent months, we’ve had a firsthand view of his leadership. He is a dynamo, with maturity to match his intensity and an ability to go deep on every aspect of the business, and our conviction in him and the high-caliber Aspora team has only grown. We are excited to support them as they scale—and as Aspora expands into the U.S., Canada and Europe—by doubling down and co-leading their Series B.</p>



<p>Aspora’s new HQ here in London is a far cry from that crowded apartment where we first met, but Parth and his team remain fiercely focused on the same mission that drove them back then. We can’t wait to see how they bring digital banking, and new opportunities, to immigrants all over the world.</p>

 PIVX Weekly Pulse (June 6th, 2025 — June 12th,&nbsp;2025) <p>Your weekly dose of PIVX update is here! Stay informed on market trends and community news.</p> Upcoming Upgrades   Project Zomboid On-chain Integration: Get ready, survivors! PIVX Labs is dropping a game-changer into the zombie-infested world of Project Zomboid in the coming weeks. We’re talking about a new on-chain integration for a community-run server, funded by Labs and powered by our “PIVX Promos” tech. Imagine this: you’re scavenging for supplies, battling hordes of the undead, or even duking it out with other players, and BAM! You find real, on-chain PIVX as in-game&nbsp;loot.  MPW Multi-Everything: A little birdie told me that My PIVX Wallet (MPW) is working on a game-changing “multi-everything” upgrade that will make your life a whole lot easier. Soon, you’ll be able to create multiple accounts and multiple masternodes right within the app, giving you unparalleled control and making management a breeze. The timeline is a month or&nbsp;two.   Market Pulse   Masternode Count: There are currently 2,109 active masternodes on the PIVX network, up from last week’s&nbsp;2,107.    Price Check: The daily USD value of PIV traded between $0.13 and $0.15 this week, averaging $0.1371. This is a slight uptick from last week’s average of $0.1368. Despite the general bullish sentiment across the broader crypto market, PIV has continued to trade sideways.    Trading Buzz: PIVX’s trading volume climbed from $14.2 million to over $16 million, aligning with the sideways price movement that suggests a period of consolidation. Daily trading activity remained strong, consistently exceeding the $2 million benchmark.  <p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>San Francisco, CA, June 12, 2025 – At AWE USA 2025, XRSI, a global Standards Developing Organization (SDO), announced the launch of the <a href="https://xrsi.org/rdg">Responsible Data Governance (RDG) 2025v1</a>. This first-of-its-kind global standard is designed to help organizations mitigate data exposure risks across AI, cloud, immersive, and traditional environments. RDG offers a structured approach to building trust throughout the entire data lifecycle, encompassing creation and collection, storage, processing, sharing, archiving, and deletion.</p>



<p>RDG applies to any organization that designs, deploys, or operates technologies that interact with real-world user behavior, make algorithmic decisions, handles sensitive or inferred data that spans industries such as healthcare, education, government, and consumer platforms.</p>



<p>“RDG is how we move from aspiration to accountability,” said Kavya Pearlman, Founder and CEO of XRSI, “it gives organizations a clear, certifiable way to demonstrate responsible data use from the moment they begin.”</p>



<p>RDG turns fine-print promises into clear, auditable proof of trust.</p>



<p>From the moment you start your journey with RDG you earn a publicly verifiable Seal to demonstrate your commitment. This is a clear signal to your customer base of your intent to demonstrate your trust. As you go through your assessment and demonstrate adherence to the 7 goals of RDG, your certification is granted.</p>



<p></p>



 RDG – A New Global Baseline for Trustworthy Data Governance 



 
 
<p>The RDG standard is built around seven strategic goals:</p>



 
 Comprehensive Data Lifecycle Management 



 Role-based Accountability 



 Process Standardization 



 Third-Party Data Governance 



 Automated Decision Making &amp; Use of AI Systems 



 Alignment with Regulatory Compliance 



 Continuous Improvement 
 



<p></p>



<p>Certified organizations, through accredited Certifying Bodies (CBs), receive:</p>



 
 A two-year certification with annual check-ins 



 A publicly verifiable Seal of Trust 



 Audit reports and evidence-based validation 



 Sector-specific deployment support and custom integrations 
 
 



 

 
 



 RDG – Independent Certification Administered by Cautelare 



<p><a href="https://cautelare.com/">Cautelare is the Principal Certifying Body</a> responsible for ensuring the quality and long-term integrity of the RDG certification process. Tasked with administering assessments and overseeing compliance, Cautelare plays a critical role in upholding the RDG standard through impartial oversight and mission-aligned governance.</p>



<p>“We’re putting the XRSI RDG standard into practice by working directly with the visionary organizations that recognize its value,” said Kavya Pearlman, Founder and CEO of XRSI. “XRSI created the standard, but we’re choosing to stay actively involved to ensure that the first wave of adopters gets it right with Cautelare.”</p>



<p></p>



 RDG – Globally Aligned, Immediately Actionable 



<p>RDG functions as a flexible overlay to existing compliance regimes, simplifying complexity while providing a measurable path toward governance maturity and regulatory readiness.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



 RDG 2025v1 Release 



<p>The standard is available for reading now at <a href="https://rdg.xrsi.io">https://rdg.xrsi.io</a> <br>and is on its inaugural version (2025v1).</p>

  Partnering with Nominal: Powering the Next Era of Hardware Engineering  <p>Cameron, Jason and Bryce are building the modern software stack that hardware teams have always needed but never had.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/anas-biad/">Anas Biad</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/alfred-lin/">Alfred Lin</a>	 



Published June 12, 2025
  



Jason, Cameron and Bryce.



 
<p>Hardware engineers built the electric grid, put humans on the moon and connected continents with airplanes. They designed the world we live in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hardware manufacturing that enabled those innovations followed a linear process: build a prototype -&gt; test it -&gt; validate it -&gt; move to large-scale production. This process assumed long timelines, rigid production cycles and minimal testing after deployment. It worked in an era when hardware products were shipped every decade, not every year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we are entering a new age of hardware. Reindustrialization, rising defense spending, global competition and the pace set by companies like SpaceX are putting pressure on hardware teams to move fast. Today’s hardware engineers need to continuously test, build and improve their systems, not just once, but throughout the entire development and operations.</p>



<p>This approach of continuous building and testing is not a new concept. It happened in software engineering and defined the cloud era. But, it has mainly remained unachievable in hardware, as we simply didn’t have a modern, purpose-built technology stack for it. Instead, hardware engineers were relying on workarounds, often involving a patchwork of solutions not built for hardware telemetry, and strung together with custom code or working with incumbent hardware testing systems from the 1980s, intended for traditional hardware companies that ship new products every 10 years, not every 10 weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nominal’s three co-founders, Cameron McCord, Jason Hoch and Bryce Strauss, saw these pain points firsthand from their experiences at the U.S. Navy, Lockheed Martin and with Palantir’s customers. They founded Nominal to finally solve this and enable hardware engineers to continuously test and build physical products in the same way software engineers continuously test and build digital products.</p>



<p>Nominal is building a multi-product platform. There are currently two publicly available products, with additional announcements to follow.</p>



 
 <a href="https://nominal.io/">Nominal Core</a> was the first product. It enables engineering teams to manage, monitor, and analyze hardware telemetry data in a single, collaborative environment, from testing to production and operations. 



 <a href="https://nominal.io/connect">Nominal Connect</a> is the second product launched earlier this year. It’s a solution to build hardware-in-the-loop test applications for automation and edge processing. 
 



<p>These software-for-hardware products are already transforming how hardware engineers design and build their products. Nominal’s current customers range from modern hardware startups and scale-ups to very large enterprises, from defense/aerospace to energy and transportation, from the U.S. to Europe, and from the DoD to commercial customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These successes, among <a href="https://nominalinc.substack.com/s/field-notes">others</a>, are just the beginning, and we are excited to lead their Series B and be by their side in creating and defining this new software category that will power the next era of hardware.</p>

<p>After nearly 5 years of dedicated service as an Engineering manager at Zcash Foundation, we’re excited to share that Pili will be taking a well-deserved, brief sabbatical. From July 1, 2025 through&nbsp; September 30, 2025, Pili will be stepping away to recharge and spend quality time with her family.</p>



<p>We wholeheartedly support Pili’s decision to take this break and look forward to welcoming her back refreshed and re-energized this fall.</p>



 What’s Next? 



<p>During Pili’s sabbatical, technical project management responsibilities will be handed over to Natalie Eskinazi (<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/u/nsheep/summary">@nsheep</a>). As a capable and longstanding member of the engineering team, Natalie&nbsp;brings a wealth of experience and a deep understanding of our projects. We’re confident that the transition will be seamless, and the ZF engineering team will continue its work as usual.</p>

<p>Today Stripe is announcing the acquisition of our portfolio company Privy. We originally partnered with Henri Stern and Asta Li in the Seed Round (co-lead with Sequoia) in 2021, and have invested in every round since then (joining Paradigm and Ribbit Capital as they led later rounds). Henri’s reputation as a crisp intellectual and rigorous executor from his days at Protocol Labs made us pay attention when we heard he was going to build a new company, and meeting his co-founder Asta Li gave us the conviction that this was going to be an n of 1 team for the&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Privy started a little over three years ago and, in that short period, has built the preeminent infrastructure for the adoption of crypto wallets, supporting 75 million accounts, over 1,000 developer teams and billions of transactions. Maybe most importantly, Privy is a key enabling fabric for a plethora of crypto rails-based applications. We are ecstatic for the team, and have been in awe of their execution quality, drive and tenacity that powered them through the inevitable dark hours that arise on any entrepreneurial journey.</p><p>While discussing the merits of partnering with Stripe together, Henri said something to us that stuck: “it’s not a finishing line–it’s a starting line” — because Privy has also built a core pillar for the future adoption of stablecoins and the enablement of new financial applications. Teaming up with Stripe and working with the Bridge team, will allow Privy to tap into one of the internet’s largest ecosystems to further execute on their&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Though from the outside it may have looked like an easy ride for Henri and Asta, the truth is much more complicated. They started the company with a seemingly very different mission: to provide an infrastructure for privacy as a service so small to medium-sized companies could operate safely on sensitive user data without having to give up important usability features which rely on PII such as emails &amp; notifications. As user privacy &amp; security is a core part of the founding DNA of Privy, their evolution to providing leading wallet infrastructure was not only in line with their ideals but with the expertise they had already built in technologies such as TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) and safe UX. It was this focus on what is truly good for users that kept Henri and Asta focused through the crypto euphoria of 2021 to the depths of despair in 2022 and to where we are&nbsp;today.</p><p>We can’t wait to see what team Privy continues to build — and why don’t you consider<a href="https://www.privy.io/careers"> joining&nbsp;them</a>.</p>

  Privy and Stripe: Making the Future of Finance Frictionless  <p>Congratulations to Henri, Asta and the entire team.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/shaun-maguire/">Shaun Maguire</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a>	 



Published June 11, 2025
  



 
<p>At Sequoia, we aim to partner with outlier founders who see the future before it’s obvious. Henri and Asta were early to recognize the importance of seamless onchain experiences and helped define embedded wallets as a core category for anyone building on crypto rails. Today, we’re thrilled to share that Privy will be joining forces with Stripe.</p>



<p>Before Privy, Henri had done exceptional work at Protocol Labs and Asta was one of the first incredible engineers at Aurora. Beyond being stars at these Sequoia portfolio companies, Henri was friends with Shaun and Asta with Josephine. These deep relationships gave us strong conviction to be their very first believers, leading Privy’s seed round in 2021.</p>



<p>At the time, Henri and Asta had a bold vision for how to make crypto safer and more usable, even though account abstraction remained a concept and embedded wallets were just a theoretical idea. Over the last two years, crypto adoption in the real world has exploded, particularly in money movement. Wallets are key to unlocking even more growth. Privy’s mission of making it easy for developers to build experiences on crypto rails that are both frictionless and secure is now a pressing need—essential to giving more users worldwide access to the global financial system.</p>



<p>Joining Stripe will allow Privy to serve its existing customers with greater resources, and to empower more developers in changing how value moves through the internet. We have seen the benefits of that partnership with Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge earlier this year, and we believe this is just the beginning of a huge journey for Privy.</p>



<p>We couldn’t be more excited for Henri, Asta and the Privy team. As we wrote in our seed investment memo, Privy is addressing a sea change that will redefine global finance over the next 20 years. That opportunity hasn’t changed, but in joining Stripe, Privy can further catalyze it. Over the past 3 years, the Privy team has done an outstanding job, scaling to serve 75M+ accounts across 1,000+ developer teams. As part of Stripe, the potential ahead for Privy is boundless. We can’t wait to see how this team shapes the future of finance.</p>

 What You Need to Know about Canada’s Bill C-2: Concerns Over Privacy, Civil Liberties, and Overreach <p>About a week ago, Canada introduced <a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/45-1/bill/C-2/first-reading">Bill C-2</a>. Officially known as the Strong Borders Act, the legislation has sparked debate regarding its potential impact on privacy, civil liberties, and sweeping&nbsp;powers.</p><p>While the government says that the bill is designed to combat organized crime and drug trafficking and enhance immigration system integrity, critics argue that in its pursuit of security, it erodes fundamental privacy rights, undermines civil liberties, and grants government agencies unprecedented authority with insufficient oversight.</p><p>For one, the Strong Borders Act is omnibus, proposing amendments to numerous acts, including the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Oceans Act, the Criminal Code, and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act (CSIS Act), among others. This expansive nature raises concerns about inadequate parliamentary scrutiny, as such rules often bypass the detailed review that more focused legislation would&nbsp;receive.</p> Eroding Privacy and Expanding Surveillance Powers <p>One of the most contentious aspects of Bill C-2 is its potential impact on digital privacy and government surveillance. There are “lawful access” provisions buried within the legislation that appear to grant law enforcement and intelligence agencies easier access to internet subscriber information and communications.</p>  Warrantless Access Concerns: The bill reportedly makes it easier for agencies like the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) to access basic subscriber information, such as IP addresses and personal data, potentially without a warrant in “urgent” circumstances. This directly challenges previous Supreme Court of Canada rulings that affirmed a reasonable expectation of privacy in such&nbsp;data.  Electronic Service Provider Obligations: C-2 proposes obliging “electronic service providers” (e.g., internet providers, social media platforms) to ensure they can fully comply with requests to access or intercept communications. While the government assures no “backdoors” into encryption will be required, I must say that the document’s language around defining “encryption” could pave the way for such mandates in the future, compromising secure communications.  Expanded Mail Searches: The legislation also reportedly amends the Canada Post Corporation Act, removing barriers that prevent police from searching mail and expanding Canada Post’s own inspection authority to open letter&nbsp;mail.   Impact on Asylum Seekers and Immigration Rights <p>The bill’s proposed changes to Canada’s immigration and asylum system have drawn sharp condemnation from human rights groups, who describe them as a significant rollback of protections:</p>  Arbitrary Deadlines for Asylum Claims: C-2 introduces new ineligibility measures for asylum claims, notably a one-year deadline for individuals to claim asylum after arriving in Canada, and a 14-day deadline for those entering irregularly from the United States by land. Critics argue these arbitrary time limits ignore the often complex and traumatic circumstances faced by asylum seekers and could lead to vulnerable individuals being unjustly denied protection, potentially in violation of international human rights&nbsp;law.  Government Power to Cancel Documents: A particularly alarming provision grants the government broad authority to cancel, suspend, or modify groups of immigration documents (such as visas, work permits, or permanent resident cards) in the “public interest,” including for reasons related to national security or public health. This power could lead to mass cancellations, suspensions of new applications, or pauses in processing existing ones, introducing immense uncertainty and potential financial ruin for applicants without clear recourse or compensation.  Increased Information Sharing: The bill facilitates wider sharing of personal information of individuals immigrating to Canada with other government departments and even foreign entities, raising significant data privacy concerns for newcomers.   Overreach and Lack of Oversight <p>Beyond specific provisions, critics express fundamental concerns about governmental overreach and a lack of independent oversight embedded within C-2. For instance, the Canadian Coast Guard will double as a security force with new powers to conduct security patrols and collect intelligence. However, there is no independent oversight or review body for these expanded security functions.</p><p>Meanwhile, the broad and undefined nature of “public interest” as a basis for cancelling immigration documents grants significant discretionary power to the Cabinet, raising fears that this could be used for political purposes or to target specific&nbsp;groups.</p><p>In general, many see the asylum reforms as an attempt to align Canada’s immigration policies more closely with those of the United States, which have historically been criticized for their restrictiveness.</p><p>In conclusion, civil society organizations, including the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group (ICLMG), Amnesty International Canada, and the Migrant Rights Network, have unequivocally called on the government to withdraw Bill C-2. They argue that if genuine border security concerns exist, the government should introduce targeted legislation developed through full consultation with experts in civil liberties, privacy, and immigration and refugee&nbsp;rights.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>SHIELD is PIVX’s custom implementation of the popular zK-SNARKs privacy protocol. As the name suggests, it offers complete transaction privacy, instantly hiding the financial details of both the sender and receiver.</p><p>In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to use SHIELD for private transactions on the PIVX blockchain.</p><p>Fun fact: Did you know that PIVX gives you the power to choose your privacy level? Depending on your privacy needs, you can easily turn SHIELD on or off for each transaction.</p> Types of PIVX Transactions <p>There are actually four types of transactions on the PIVX blockchain — Transparent, Shielding, De-Shielding, and&nbsp;SHIELD.</p>  In a Transparent transaction, details like the sender’s address, receiver’s address, and the amount sent are all publicly visible on the blockchain. For PIVX users, it’s important to know that transparent addresses begin with ‘D’, whereas SHIELD addresses start with&nbsp;‘ps’.  Transparent to transparent transfer  Shielding happens when funds move from a transparent address to a SHIELDED address. In this scenario, the sender’s address and the amount are visible, but the receiver’s details remain completely private.  Transparent to Shielded&nbsp;Transfer  Conversely, De-shielding is when funds are transferred from a SHIELDED address back into a transparent one, making the transaction details visible&nbsp;again.  A fully SHIELDED transaction involves two SHIELDED addresses. The details of both the sender and receiver are completely hidden.  <p>Notice the difference in the various types of transactions. In the SHIELDED transaction, for instance, we are unable to pull any significant details from both parties. However, in the Shielding transaction, while the sender’s details were public, the receiver is literally unknown.</p> How to use&nbsp;SHIELD <p>SHIELDED transactions can be initiated from either the PIVX Core wallet or the MyPIVXWallet.</p><p>The PIVX Core wallet is the official full-node client for desktops, offering comprehensive features like staking and masternode functionality, though it requires downloading the entire blockchain. Alternatively, MPW (MyPIVXWallet) is a lighter web wallet that’s faster to set up, uses fewer resources, and still provides strong security with mnemonic passphrases, without the need for a full blockchain download.</p>  To use SHIELD with the PIVX Core wallet, <a href="https://pivx.org/wallets">download</a> the wallet from the official PIVX page. Once your wallet fully synchronizes with the blockchain, you can immediately start sending and receiving private transactions. Specifically, select the “Shielded” tab, and input the recipient address, amount, and any additional labels.  Similar to the Core wallet, you can send and receive SHIELDED transactions on MyPIVXWallet. The steps are identical. However, you do not need to download the entire blockchain. Simply switch to Private mode, input the transaction details, and hit&nbsp;send.  <p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy. Your Choice.<br>To stay on top of PIVX news please visit PIVX.org and Discord.PIVX.org.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/a-practical-guide-to-using-shield-for-private-transactions-c7210e5a9f0a">A Practical Guide to Using SHIELD for Private Transactions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Apart from incentivising market participants to secure the network through inflationary rewards, many consider staking as an equivalent of stock dividend yield. As a result, although Bitcoin is regarded as digital gold, protocols are looking for ways to increase its utilisation in DeFi and, ultimately, generate yield. Nowadays, while newer networks are struggling to attract investors and sustain a healthy, decentralised validator set, more established blockchains capture the lion’s share of PoS actors. However, in a constant race for profit basis points, centralised consolidation of stakers seems inevitable. Join us for a fascinating discussion on the staking landscape and the challenges it may present to decentralisation.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Increasing BTC utilization through BTC yield  Looping yield products  The maturation of the staking market  Chorus One staking portfolio  How to prevent staking consolidation  Retail vs. institutional-grade operators  Symbiotic, Eigenlayer &amp; restaking yield  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/berlincrypto">Mirko Schmiedl on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/tobias_ju">Tobias Jung on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/StakingRewards">Staking Rewards on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Following legislation enacted last Friday, Australian victims of ransomware attacks are now legally required to declare any payments made to cyber criminals.</p><p>The new mandate is not universal but targets organizations with an annual turnover of over AUS $3 million and a select group of entities operating within vital critical infrastructure sectors. Notably, the threshold is expected to encompass approximately 6.5% of all registered businesses in Australia, collectively representing roughly half of the nation’s economic activity.</p><p>These designated entities are now obligated to report any ransomware payments to the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) within a tight 72-hour window. Failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.</p><p>However, the government will focus on extreme cases for a start and engage with other victims until next year when a stricter regulatory stance will be&nbsp;adopted.</p><p>The primary driver behind the legislation is the need for enhanced visibility into the ransomware threat landscape. Until now, reporting such incidents and payments has largely been voluntary, leading to a significant underestimation of the true scale and financial impact of these cyberattacks. “Current voluntary reporting mechanisms are underutilised and consequently, ransomware and cyber extortion attacks remain significantly underreported,” the Australian government highlighted when the <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7250">bill</a> was first proposed last&nbsp;year.</p><p>Data from the Australian Institute of Criminology suggests that only one in five victims of a ransomware attack report the incident.</p><p>The rule follows a series of high-profile cyberattacks that have plagued Australian private businesses, including major breaches affecting Optus, Medibank, and MediSecure, pushing cybersecurity to the forefront of the national political agenda.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>“The future of manufacturing is autonomous, powered by AI-based factory operating systems” is hardly a controversial statement. In fact, a glimpse into today’s most advanced factories already reveals a world where robots, not humans, perform many core manufacturing processes. So, one might think this is easy terrain for AI. Think&nbsp;again.</p><p>The reality is that the complexity and uniqueness of industrial use cases, coupled with diverse systems and machinery, legacy software, and entrenched data silos — all within high-stakes production environments — make impactful AI adoption a formidable challenge. Yet the imperative for AI in manufacturing continues to grow. Labour shortages, intense global competition, geopolitical pressures, and the relentless pace of technological advancement have left many industrials struggling to keep&nbsp;up.</p><p>What if there were a way to integrate AI into high-value manufacturing processes in a step-by-step manner, with immediate ROI? And what if these AI agents could be composed together to enable fully autonomous manufacturing?</p><p>Enter Manex AI (formerly Datagon&nbsp;AI)</p><p><a href="https://www.manex.ai/en">Manex AI</a> is currently deploying AI agents into the end-of-line quality assurance processes of Tier 1 manufacturers — including BMW, Stellantis, Rehau Automotive, TDK Electronics, Still, BSH, and Henkel — via its flagship product, Qualitatio. This solution helps reduce warranty costs and boost customer satisfaction by integrating directly with plant systems, including robots, human workflow tools, data sources, and sensor&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>Once embedded, Manex AI begins mapping and learning production processes, gradually expanding the range of use cases and value it delivers. This ease of adoption, combined with high impact, is what truly sets Manex AI&nbsp;apart.</p> Our Thesis <p>Industrial manufacturers are under growing margin pressure and are eager, yet slow, to adopt AI to optimize their operations. Rather than tackling deeply entrenched Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) head-on, Manex AI begins with nimble, high-ROI use cases that encourage quick adoption and build trust. From this entry point, the company can scale horizontally and vertically within each plant — expanding its footprint and progressively taking on more control over the production environment. In doing so, Manex AI becomes a critical enabler of AI adoption in industry.</p><p>Although only 18 months old, the company is already demonstrating strong growth and traction — a testament to the execution capabilities of Nathan Gruber, Andreas Schoch, Fabian Gruber, Philipp Becker, and the entire Manex AI&nbsp;team.</p><p>We are thrilled to support Manex AI in building the fabric layer technology for autonomous manufacturing, alongside Lightspeed, Capmont Technology, and the CDTM Venture Fund.

<p>After a decade of existence, Ethereum has gone a long way from its initial whitepaper, yet many efforts in scaling and finding product-market-fit have been severely criticized for falling short of their promise. However, despite numerous other ‘Ethereum killers’ being launched over the years, none has managed to attract so many developers and liquidity while sticking true to ethos that (once) powered and united this industry. This year’s ETHPrague plans to confront exactly these existential challenges and steward community culture towards addressing outside criticism and external reality checks. Ethereum’s development, while adapting to market pressures, it always aimed to stick true to its core values in order to remain a technological bedrock for the future of humanity.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The vision for ETH Prague  Takeaways from main sessions  High-level overview of ETH Prague  The resurgence of Polkadot  European crypto summer events  The general state of the Ethereum ecosystem  Celo’s transition to L2  L2 liquidity fragmentation  Choosing the right L2 to build  Improving hackathons  Lightning round  Final words  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/austingriffith">Austin Griffith on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/marek_">Marek Olszewski on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/justbrendax">Brenda Loya on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/jbschweitzer">Joseph Schweitzer on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/buidlguidl">BuidlGuidl DAO on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/Celo">Celo on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/WeAreTellor">Tellor on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Compared to 10–15 years ago, cybercriminals have gotten pretty crafty. Gone are the days when hackers only tried to break through firewalls with brute force attacks. Today’s cybercriminals are exploiting the human element. And that’s where phishing and social engineering come into play, and honestly, they’re becoming the go-to methods for digital bad actors worldwide.</p><p>Do you know that nearly 60% of organizations globally experienced a ransomware attack in 2024, with over 90% of businesses experiencing a phishing attack in the same&nbsp;year?</p> Social Engineering: The Art of Human Manipulation <p>Social engineering is psychological manipulation designed to trick people into giving away confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. It is actually a broad term that includes things like ransomware attacks, phishing, whaling, smishing, and scareware, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>These attacks work because they exploit fundamental human traits — our desire to be helpful, our tendency to trust authority figures, and our fear of getting in trouble. Social engineers are like digital con artists who study human psychology to make their scams more effective.</p> Phishing: The Digital Bait and&nbsp;Switch <p>Think of phishing as the online equivalent of a con artist pretending to be someone they’re not. These attacks typically involve sending fake emails, texts, or creating bogus websites that look legitimate — like they’re from your bank, favorite shopping site, or even your workplace.</p><p>The goal is to get you to hand over sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal&nbsp;details.</p><p>The name “phishing” is a play on “fishing” — because these attackers are essentially casting a wide net hoping to catch unsuspecting victims. Pretty clever wordplay for criminals, right?</p> The Many Faces of Digital Deception  Email Phishing: The Classic&nbsp;Approach <p>This is probably what most people think of when they hear “phishing.” You get an email that looks like it’s from a legitimate source — maybe your bank saying there’s a problem with your account, or a shipping company claiming they couldn’t deliver a package. The email usually contains a link to a fake website designed to steal your login credentials.</p><p>What makes these particularly tricky is how authentic they can look. Modern phishing emails often use official logos, proper formatting, and even mimic the writing style of legitimate companies.</p><p>Phishing emails are alarmingly effective. You may be surprised to learn that the median time for users to be compromised is under one&nbsp;minute.</p> Spear Phishing: The Targeted&nbsp;Strike <p>While regular phishing casts a wide net, spear phishing is more like using a sniper rifle. These attacks target specific individuals or organizations and are highly personalized. The attacker might spend weeks researching their target, gathering information from social media, company websites, and public records to craft a convincing message.</p><p>For example, they might send an email to a company’s CFO that appears to be from the CEO, requesting an urgent wire transfer. Because the email includes personal details and company-specific information, it seems legitimate.</p> Whaling: Going After the Big&nbsp;Fish <p>Whaling is spear phishing aimed at high-profile targets such as CEOs, politicians, or celebrities. The attacks are often extremely sophisticated because the potential payoff is huge. A successful whaling attack might give criminals access to an entire company’s financial systems or sensitive government information.</p><p>In the fall of 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a devastating phishing attack initiated the previous year. Hackers, impersonating Apple, sent emails to top executives containing a malicious link that prompted them to enter their Apple ID credentials. These stolen credentials were then used to gain employee login information and deploy “Wiper” malware, ultimately crippling Sony’s network, leading to the theft of over 100 terabytes of sensitive data, and costing the company over $100&nbsp;million.</p> Vishing: Phishing Over the&nbsp;Phone <p>Voice phishing, or “vishing,” involves phone calls instead of emails. The caller might pretend to be from your bank’s fraud department, claiming they’ve detected suspicious activity on your account. They’ll then ask you to “verify” your account information, including passwords or&nbsp;PINs.</p><p>These calls can be particularly convincing because the caller might already have some of your personal information (obtained from data breaches or public records), making their story seem credible.</p> Smishing: SMS-Based Attacks <p>With smishing (SMS phishing), attackers send text messages containing malicious links or requesting personal information. These might look like package delivery notifications, bank alerts, or even COVID-related health updates. Since people tend to trust text messages more than emails, smishing can be surprisingly effective.</p> Pretexting: Creating False Scenarios <p>Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario to engage with victims and steal their information. The attacker might pose as a coworker, IT support person, or customer service representative. They’ll create a believable story about why they need your information — maybe they’re “updating the system” or “verifying your account for security purposes.”</p> Baiting: Offering Something Too Good to&nbsp;Refuse <p>Baiting attacks offer something enticing to spark curiosity or greed. This could be a free USB drive in a parking lot (loaded with malware), a too-good-to-be-true online deal, or a “free” software download. The bait hooks victims into taking actions that compromise their security.</p> Why Do Social Engineering Attacks Work So&nbsp;Well?  We’re Wired to&nbsp;Trust <p>Humans are generally trusting creatures — it’s how we function in society. We assume that the person calling from “the bank” actually works there, or that the urgent email from our “boss” is legitimate. Attackers exploit this natural tendency to trust authority figures and familiar&nbsp;brands.</p> Information Overload <p>In our fast-paced digital world, we are constantly bombarded with emails, messages, and notifications. When rushing through our inbox, it’s easy to miss the subtle signs that something might be a scam. Attackers count on this — they know that busy people are more likely to click first and think&nbsp;later.</p> Fear and&nbsp;Urgency <p>Many successful attacks create a sense of urgency or fear. “Your account will be closed in 24 hours!” or “Suspicious activity detected — act now!” They pressure people into making quick decisions without thinking things&nbsp;through.</p> Social Media Intelligence <p>Social engineering attacks have become more sophisticated partly because there’s so much personal information available online. A quick scan of your social media profiles can reveal your employer, family members, hobbies, and recent activities — all valuable information for crafting a convincing attack.</p> Red Flags: Spotting the&nbsp;Scams  Email Warning&nbsp;Signs <p>Keep an eye out for generic greetings like “Dear Customer” instead of your actual name. Legitimate companies usually personalize their communications. Also, watch for urgent language, threatening consequences, and requests for sensitive information via email — real companies rarely ask for passwords or account numbers through&nbsp;email.</p><p>Check the sender’s email address carefully. Scammers often use addresses that look similar to legitimate ones but have subtle differences — like using “arnazon.com” instead of “amazon.com” or adding extra characters.</p> Too Good to Be True&nbsp;Offers <p>If someone is offering you something that seems too good to be true, it probably is. Whether it’s a “Nigerian prince” wanting to share his fortune or a “limited time offer” for a luxury item at 90% off, extreme offers should trigger your skepticism.</p> Pressure Tactics <p>Legitimate businesses don’t typically pressure you into immediate action with threats. If someone is insisting that you must act “right now” or face dire consequences, take a step back and verify their claims through official channels.</p><p>Be also wary of any unsolicited request for personal information, especially passwords, Social Security numbers, or financial details. Legitimate organizations have secure ways of handling this information and won’t ask for it through email or unsolicited phone&nbsp;calls.</p> Building Your Defense&nbsp;Strategy  Email Security Best Practices <p>First, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your important accounts. Even if someone gets your password, they’ll still need access to your phone or authentication app to get in. It’s like having a deadbolt in addition to your regular door&nbsp;lock.</p><p>Use strong, unique passwords for each account, and consider using a password manager to keep track of them all. I know it seems like a hassle, but it’s much less hassle than dealing with a compromised account.</p><p>Be cautious with email attachments and links. If you receive an unexpected attachment, even from someone you know, verify it’s legitimate before opening it. When in doubt, contact the sender through a different communication method to confirm they actually sent&nbsp;it.</p> Verification Procedures <p>Develop a habit of verifying suspicious communications through independent channels. If you get an email claiming to be from your bank, don’t click the links in the email. Instead, go directly to your bank’s website or call the number on your credit card to verify the communication.</p><p>This independent verification is crucial for phone calls too. If someone calls claiming to be from a company and asks for personal information, hang up and call the company’s official number to verify the&nbsp;request.</p> Technical Safeguards <p>Keep your software updated. Those annoying update notifications exist for a reason — they often include security patches that protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates when possible.</p><p>Use reputable antivirus software and email filters. These tools can catch many phishing attempts before they reach your inbox. However, don’t rely on them completely — human judgment is still your best&nbsp;defense.</p> Creating a Security-Conscious Culture <p>Whether at work or at home, foster an environment where it’s okay to be cautious and ask questions. Create a culture where “better safe than sorry” is the norm, not the exception. Encourage family members or colleagues to double-check suspicious communications rather than risking&nbsp;it.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

 PIVX Weekly Pulse (May 23rd, 2025 — May 29th,&nbsp;2025) <p>Stay in the loop with your weekly PIVX update! Get insights into market trends and discover what’s new with the community.</p> Market Pulse   Masternode Count: The number of active PIVX masternodes currently stands at 2,088, a small decrease from last week’s total of 2,121. It looks like a few masternodes have gone offline in the past&nbsp;week.    Price Check: The Daily USD Value of PIVX experienced a further decline this week, with daily prices ranging between $0.14 and $0.15. The weekly average settled at $0.15, down from last week’s $0.1609. While the precise reason for this sharper drop isn’t fully clear, it likely reflects the broader volatility in the crypto market, as assets like Bitcoin also saw losses of over 4% in the last seven&nbsp;days.    Trading Buzz: Amidst a growing bearish sentiment among traders, PIVX’s total weekly trading volume saw a further dip, decreasing from $13.4 million to approximately $12.9 million. Nevertheless, daily trading activity remained robust, consistently exceeding $1.5&nbsp;million.  New Listings: Despite weakening prices and market action, the PIVX team continues its strong development push. This past week saw PIVX land new listings on both ExPlace and Intercambio. Furthermore, the integration with Edge Wallet is complete, enabling users to seamlessly store, send, and receive PIV coins through the Edge&nbsp;wallet.  <p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>In this episode a16z co-founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz sit down with legendary music producer and bestselling author Rick Rubin to explore the origin of his unexpected new creation: "The Way of Code"*</p><p>Blending ancient philosophy and modern AI, The Way of Code reimagines the 3,000-year-old Tao Te Ching for the age of artificial intelligence, software, and “vibe coding.” What began as a viral tweet quickly evolved into a creative manifesto—part book, part tool, part spiritual operating system for the future.

We hope you enjoy this deeply personal and surprisingly practical conversation on how to live—and create—in the age of AI.&nbsp;</p><p>The Way of Code:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEFVQndMZXJNeVFYVUJIeU40SzFua3dEUDA4UXxBQ3Jtc0tuRVZIXzZaLTBYcXU3TDV1Sk44am1FTzNyV2JIam52OWxncGRkVXNBTFpwODRrT0NCdXNDcjk2Nld5aGc1QlFINFR3Y045bUxmRzJvd0E2bVNJbXlLM3BmandSaTVyZ2pXT0ZDVFlQWFdFTU10Zktuaw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thewayofcode.com%2F&amp;v=7s9C92Pkcc0"> https://www.thewayofcode.com/</a></p><p>“Tools will come and tools will go.

 Meet May’s featured partners 
<p>This month’s partners are bringing Web3 into the rhythm of daily life, from movement-based challenges and golf rewards to community tokens, creative tools, and immersive gaming.

<p>New partner offers will roll out across the Brave Rewards Offer Wall, Notification Ads, and New Tab Takeovers throughout the program, giving users fresh ways to explore, engage, and earn with BAT.</p>

 Moonwalk Fitness 
<p><a href="https://moonwalk.fit/">Moonwalk Fitness</a> is an accountability app that combines daily step goals with financial incentives.

Hitting your goals protects your deposit, while missing them forfeits a portion to a prize pool shared by the most consistent players.</p>
<p>Brave first partnered with Moonwalk in 2024 on several step challenges, including <a href="https://x.com/AttentionToken/status/1815891960638419160">Step for Gold</a>, during the Paris Winter Olympics and the <a href="https://x.com/AttentionToken/status/1836090717225251206">Singapore Stroll</a> at Solana Breakpoint. BAT sponsored the bonus prize pools for each, drawing hundreds of signups via Brave’s unique game codes. In May, Brave and Moonwalk teamed up again for <a href="https://x.com/moonwalkfitness/status/1923456840228040901">Accelerate Impact</a>, a charity challenge benefitting <a href="https://bonkcoin.com/">BONK</a>’s <a href="https://www.bonkforpaws.org/">Bonk for Paws</a> initiative.

  Partnering with Rillet: The Financial ERP for the AI Age  <p>Nicolas, Stelios and their team have rebuilt the foundation of the CFO suite.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/julien-bek/">Julien Bek</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/roelof-botha/">Roelof Botha</a>, and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/cornelius-menke/">Cornelius Menke</a>	 



Published May 28, 2025
  



Rillet Co-Founder Nicolas Kopp.



 
<p>Over the past 10 years, innovations have remade nearly every aspect of fintech—and in the process, unbundled a stack that was once wholly contained within a company’s ERP (enterprise resource planning) system. But the general ledger (GL)—the central record-keeping system that is the beating heart of financial operations—has been static, still dominated by legacy ERP solutions like NetSuite or Sage, launched decades ago.<br><br>For businesses trying to scale, the pain is real. They’re forced to graduate from products with limited functionality that no longer meet their needs to arcane, inefficient systems that take 10 or more specialists to run—and 15 to 20 days of manual work to close each month.</p>



<p>Why has this ERP foundation, so ripe for disruption, remained virtually untouched? In part because replacing the general ledger is a high-stakes proposition in a risk-averse field—and in part because it’s very hard to build.</p>



<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://www.rillet.com/">Rillet</a> co-founders Nicolas Kopp and Stelios Modes decided to take on that challenge, and rebuild an AI-native ERP from the ground up. The mission is to enable CFOs to achieve a zero-day close, and lay the foundation for a “one-person Finance function.” With a robust GL and features such as multi-entity support and advanced revenue recognition, Rillet becomes the go-to solution for businesses that are scaling past QuickBooks, as well as those that are slowed down by their NetSuite setup and want to modernize their CFO stack.</p>



<p>Prior to starting Rillet, Nicolas and Stelios experienced firsthand the challenges of working with traditional GL solutions while scaling the neobank N26. They recognized the sharp contrast between the hollowed-out legacy ERPs and the consumer-grade UI of newer solutions, and they understood that AI’s massive savings potential was pushing CFOs to innovate.</p>



<p>Over the past year, those insights have paid off, and Rillet has experienced strong pull from the market, attracting customers such as Windsurf and Decagon and collecting glowing reviews across the board, with an NPS of more than 70 and a perfect score on G2. Companies that once slogged through six-month deployments of legacy solutions can get up and running on Rillet in just weeks. Consulting-heavy customizations are replaced by simple user-friendly workflows and real-time reporting with pre-built investor metrics. Zero-day closes will soon be not the exception, but the expectation.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia are excited to lead Rillet’s Series A and support their growth, as their team—split across New York, Barcelona and now Menlo Park—continues to <a href="https://www.rillet.com/careers">expand</a>. What they’ve already accomplished is impressive, but it is just the start. We believe Rillet’s next chapter, around agentic automation of the Finance function (including auditing, accrual and reconciliation) will take the CFO experience to a whole new level. Thanks to Nicolas, Stelios and their team, CFOs finally have a fully modern foundation—that they can build on for years to come.</p>

 The Verus community’s presence at Consensus 2025 marked what many attendees described as the most impactful conference appearance in the project’s history. For those of us who were there — and for the broader community who made it possible — this event demonstrated a shift in how the blockchain industry understands and values what the community has&nbsp;built.  When Complex Ideas Finally&nbsp;Click <p>Throughout the conference, we witnessed something special: moment after moment where visitors to our booth suddenly understood concepts that had previously seemed abstract or unclear. One community member described these as “lightbulb moments” — that instant when someone grasps not just what Verus does, but why it&nbsp;matters.</p><p>The phrase that seemed to catalyze these moments? “DeFi is not an&nbsp;app.”</p><p>This simple statement opened doors to deeper conversations about what we’ve always known: that DeFi should be a foundational primitive built into blockchain protocols, not bolted on top through vulnerable smart contracts. Marketing professionals and developers alike found themselves nodding along as we explained that smart contracts are essentially stored procedures in a shared global database — useful, but hardly the revolutionary construct they’re often portrayed to&nbsp;be.</p> Real Conversations About Real&nbsp;Problems <p>What set this conference apart wasn’t just theoretical discussions. Attendees brought real concerns about security vulnerabilities they’re facing today. When we talked about the recent DNS redirection attacks on platforms like Curve, heads nodded knowingly. When we asked, “How will anyone solve phishing if users have to give smart contracts direct access to their wallets?” — the silence was&nbsp;telling.</p><p>These weren’t gotcha moments. They were honest technical discussions about fundamental challenges in blockchain architecture. And we had answers that resonated.</p> The Presentation That Changed Perspectives <p>The recorded presentation “Own or be Owned: How Verus Secures Ownership in a Digital World” at the Protocol Village by Michael J. Toutonghi, lead developer, became a focal point of our conference presence. Following the talk, booth traffic surged with attendees wanting to dive deeper into the concepts presented.</p><p>In the presentation we announced Commons Powered Apps. More on that in a future&nbsp;article.</p> “Wait, This Isn’t a Company?” <p>Perhaps the most gratifying reactions came when visitors learned about Verus’s structure. The disbelief was palpable: How could something this technically sophisticated, this well-organized, this professional, not be backed by venture capital or run by a corporation?</p><p>“It’s entirely community-driven,” we’d explain. No ICO. No pre-mine. No company behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>The authenticity of that message — backed by the reality of what the community has built — changed conversations immediately. Suddenly, we weren’t just another blockchain project. We were proof that communities can build world-class technology without traditional corporate structures.</p> Building Bridges to the&nbsp;Future <p>The conference generated exactly the kind of connections we hoped for. Our booth became a hub for substantive technical discussions with projects and companies exploring blockchain solutions for their real-world challenges.</p><p>These weren’t casual meetups. These were in-depth conversations with organizations that immediately understood the limitations of current blockchain approaches and were actively seeking alternatives. The technical depth of these discussions — and the genuine interest in Verus’s architectural differences — has resulted in a list of follow-ups.</p><p>What struck us most was the quality of these interactions. Rather than the typical conference small talk, we found ourselves in detailed technical discussions about specific implementation challenges and use&nbsp;cases.</p> A Community Effort in Every&nbsp;Sense <p>None of this would have been possible without the Verus community members who funded the Consensus presence. Every donation, large or small, contributed to putting our best foot forward at this critical industry event. The booth &amp; the ability to have a presentation — all of it came from community support.</p><p>For those who couldn’t attend but contributed: you were there in spirit, and your support directly enabled every conversation, every connection, and every breakthrough moment we experienced.</p> Looking Forward <p>As we process the connections made and opportunities identified at Consensus 2025, one thing is clear: the industry is ready for what Verus offers. The questions we’re answering aren’t theoretical anymore — they’re practical, pressing problems that developers and organizations need solved&nbsp;today.</p><p>The shift we experienced at this conference wasn’t just about better messaging or a nicer booth. It was about the broader blockchain ecosystem reaching a level of maturity where the foundational questions we’ve been addressing for years are now front and center for everyone.</p><p>For the Verus community, Consensus 2025 wasn’t just another conference. It was validation that our patient, principled approach to building better blockchain infrastructure is exactly what the industry needs. And we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>Thank you to every community member who made our Consensus 2025 presence possible.

<p>FROST, which stands for Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold, is an advanced cryptographic protocol designed to improve threshold signature schemes. Unlike traditional single-party signatures, FROST enables a group of participants to collaboratively generate digital signatures using shares of a private key, so that only a specified threshold of participants is needed to authorize a transaction. This approach boosts both security and resilience against key loss or compromise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>FROST is notable for reducing network overhead during signing operations, supporting efficient two-round (or even single-round, with preprocessing) signing without sacrificing security or concurrency. These features make FROST especially suitable for Zcash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 What is FROST for Zcash? 

<p><a href="https://zfnd.org/announcing-a-new-version-of-frost/">Our rationale from the onset of this project</a> was that “Zcash transactions should be publicly indistinguishable (i.e. an adversary observing the blockchain should not be able to gain any information about who the payment is for, how much the payment is, or who authorized the payment). Zcash previously did not have a good mechanism to achieve this goal in a multi-party setting, where a group of users want to jointly control funds and authorize transactions. Prior to FROST, the best protocols to perform this signing process required either undesirable implementation complexity, high network overheads to perform signing operations, the inability to support a threshold number of signers, or undesirable privacy leaks such as exposing the number of signers. Consequently, our decision to design a new threshold scheme stemmed from the desire to improve the state of threshold signature research to match the needs of Zcash users today.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to advancing privacy and security in digital transactions, the FROST for Zcash implementation we developed stands out with several important features. Notably, it is designed to keep the same security guarantees of RedDSA, in particular unlinkability, which is required by the Zcash protocol. This prevents attackers from linking two FROST-generated signatures to the same person. This makes integration straightforward for developers and organizations without the need for major infrastructure changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To support adoption, Zcash Foundation (ZF) provides <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/">user-friendly libraries</a>, <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">demo applications</a> and <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/tutorial.html">tutorials</a>, making it easy for anyone to incorporate FROST for Zcash into their projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Why did we develop FROST for Zcash? 

<p>ZF committed to building FROST for Zcash to address several important needs within the Zcash ecosystem. One of these primary motivations was to develop a secure, privacy-preserving multisignature implementation for shielded transactions, a functionality that was previously missing. The goal from the onset was to ensure seamless compatibility with existing Zcash standards and protocols, like RedDSA. This allows developers and projects to integrate FROST for Zcash into their systems without having to overhaul their infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ZF also wanted to make advanced cryptographic tools more accessible through user-friendly libraries, demo applications, and tutorials to help developers adopt FROST quickly and easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 What is the current state of FROST for Zcash? 

<p>We have now concluded our development work on the FROST reference implementation, <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost"><code>frost-core</code></a>, along with the ciphersuite crates. To help with deployment, we have also developed tools to help participants communicate with each other: <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost-zcash-demo/">a frost server, <code>frostd</code>, and the command line tool <code>frost-client</code></a> whose purpose is to work as a standalone tool but also as reference for wallets to integrate FROST.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 What Happens Next? 

<p>The next step is for wallets to integrate FROST using those tools directly or as reference, knowing that ZF is willing to provide guidance as needed. If wallet developers are hesitant to run their own <code>frostd</code> servers, the team is open to deploying a production version. Importantly, the frostd server doesn’t need to be trusted, as all messages are end-to-end encrypted; it only relays information, similar to lightwalletd, and leaks minimal metadata that can be further protected with tools like Tor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some existing concerns about the lack of a standardized key generation specification for FROST, which currently limits interoperability; progress on this front is ongoing, and we hope to complete that soon with guidance from ECC engineers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 FAQs 

<p>Why does Zcash require its own implementation? Why isn’t there one FROST implementation for all protocols?</p>

<p>Zcash requires a custom FROST implementation to maintain its privacy guarantees and protocol-specific needs, as generic FROST variants lack critical features like rerandomized signatures (ensuring threshold-signed transactions mirror single-party ones for anonymity) and compatibility with Zcash’s shielded transaction systems (Sapling/Orchard). Additionally, Zcash integrates share recovery mechanisms, identifiable aborts, and safeguards against concurrency attacks-adaptations unnecessary for non-privacy chains. Since blockchain protocols prioritize divergent tradeoffs (e.g., Bitcoin’s simplicity vs. Zcash’s unlinkability), a universal FROST standard is impractical due to cryptographic nuances (curves, serialization) and ecosystem-specific security requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does FROST for Zcash have commercial applications outside of Zcash?</p>

<p>No, this reference implementation was created specifically for the Zcash ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Has FROST for Zcash been audited?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, there have been two audits: the first one by NCC audited the core crates which implement the cryptographic part of FROST; <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/us/research-blog/public-report-zcash-frost-security-assessment/">check the complete report</a>. The second audit covered the <code>frostd</code> and <code>frost-client</code> helper tools and was done by Least Authority; the complete report is available <a href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/zcash-frost-demo/">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why is a FROST server needed? What is the risk of using it?</p>

<p>The FROST server simply helps participants to communicate with each other; most devices today are behind firewalls or routers which make direct peer-to-peer communication difficult. Technically the server is not even aware that it is being used for FROST!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the <code>frost-client </code>tool we have developed (which also serves as reference for other implementations and also works as a library) does end-to-end encryption of all messages. This means that the server does not need to be trusted and won’t be able to see the content of the messages. The server is able to gather metadata though (e.g. who is talking to who at what times), but that risk can be mitigated by using e.g. Tor. The risk is very similar to the risk that wallets take by using lightwallet servers.</p>

<p>Also note that using the FROST server is optional. We believe that it’s the easiest path forward until a better solution is developed, but wallets are free to handle user communication as they wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is missing for a regular Zcash user to be able to use FROST?</p>

<p>The missing piece is for wallets to integrate FROST. The required tooling to make that happen has already been completed by ZF (though of course wallets are free to use the implementation and design they wish to). Technical-inclined users can use FROST with Zcash today using our <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">frost-client command line tool</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is this reference implementation of FROST capable of being included in NU 6.1?</p>

<p>Due to the way FROST works, it’s not required to change the protocol in order to use FROST with Zcash. Therefore, yes, FROST can be used in NU 6.1, or even now with NU 6.</p>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO–May 20th, 2025: In a major step forward for digital identity and internet decentralization, Brave has become the first browser to launch its own on-chain top-level domain. In partnership with Unstoppable Domains, the new .brave domain is now available to Brave’s over 85 million monthly active users—offering a seamless way to own digital identity, send crypto, and navigate Web3. Minted on the Polygon blockchain, .brave domains will resolve across multiple networks—including Base, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Sonic, and more—making them widely compatible in the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>The launch of .brave marks a defining moment in the evolution of the internet, bridging the mainstream browser experience with the permissionless power of Web3.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to put privacy, ownership, and control back in the hands of users,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave. “.brave is more than a domain—it’s a user-owned identity layer, native to the Brave ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Through Unstoppable Domains, Brave users can now claim personalized .brave domains that unlock a full suite of decentralized tools. .brave domains can be used in the Brave Wallet, allowing for crypto payment in a simplified way. They can host censorship-resistant websites on IPFS, which are directly accessible within the Brave browser without traditional hosting fees. .brave domains will be directly resolvable within the Brave browser and the Brave Wallet starting in version 1.81 which will be available in Nightly, and targeted to Release on August 5th, 2025.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency payments become simpler and more human with .brave names replacing long wallet addresses. Users can also build a verifiable on-chain identity through UD.me, showcasing their digital assets, wallet connections, and public credentials within the broader Brave community.</p>
<p>The .brave domain integrates with Unstoppable’s broader ecosystem, offering secure, badge-gated messaging, domain trading through the Unstoppable Marketplace, and frictionless access to dApps, games, and metaverses via Login with Unstoppable.</p>
<p>“This is a bold leap toward an open internet,” said Sandy Carter, COO of Unstoppable Domains. “.brave puts digital identity in the hands of everyday users, not platforms.”</p>
<p>As part of the rollout, Unstoppable Domains will join Brave’s <a>Rewards 3.0 Partner Program</a>, further expanding the reach of the Basic Attention Token (BAT). With over 99% of BAT’s 1.5 billion supply in circulation, BAT now ranks as the 14th most held token on Ethereum and is accepted by 1.5 million verified creators worldwide.</p>
<p>Brave and Unstoppable are taking the next step in expanding the reach of the .brave domain by exploring the process for ICANN gTLD registration. While still in the early stages and subject to regulatory review, this move could pave the way for .brave to function across both the traditional Web2 internet and decentralized Web3 environments.</p>
<p>The potential ICANN accreditation would mark a significant milestone in the shared mission to empower users with greater control over their digital identities—no matter which corner of the internet they call home. This effort reflects a broader vision of a more open, interoperable web where innovation and ownership go hand in hand.</p>
