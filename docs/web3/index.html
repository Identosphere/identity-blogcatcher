 Episode 4: The Fall&nbsp;Guy <p>The mahogany door of Victoria’s office loomed before Mark like a judge’s bench. He steeled himself, pushing it open to find Victoria perched on her leather throne, her expression a chilling blend of fury and icy calculation.</p><p>“Mark,” she began, her voice a razor’s edge, “this… fiasco… has cost us dearly. Clients are fleeing, our stock is plummeting, and the sharks are circling.”</p><p>Mark met her gaze, a flicker of defiance in his eyes. “It wasn’t just the vendor, Victoria. Our own negligence — “</p><p>“Enough!” she snapped, cutting him off. “Damage control is paramount. We need a scapegoat, someone to absorb the blame. And that someone, Mark, is&nbsp;you.”</p><p>The blood drained from Mark’s face. “But I — “</p><p>“You raised concerns,” Victoria interrupted, her voice dripping with false sympathy. “You were the whistleblower. It’s a tragic irony, a noble sacrifice. The narrative writes&nbsp;itself.”</p><p>Mark felt a wave of nausea. He was being thrown to the wolves, sacrificed to protect the very system that had enabled this disaster.</p><p>The following weeks were a blur of carefully orchestrated chaos. John Doe Wealth, with the complicity of a compliant media, spun a tale of a rogue employee, a well-meaning but ultimately reckless advisor who had inadvertently exposed the company to risk. Mark’s concerns, once dismissed, were now amplified, and twisted into a narrative of personal responsibility.</p><p>He was ostracized; his reputation tarnished. Clients, once trusting and friendly, now regarded him with suspicion and anger. Some, driven to desperation by their financial losses, resorted to desperate measures. He heard whispers of bankruptcies, families torn apart, and even a suicide linked to the breach. The weight of their suffering bore down on him, a crushing burden of guilt he couldn’t&nbsp;escape.</p><p>Meanwhile, John Doe Wealth emerged relatively unscathed. The stock price rebounded, the media frenzy subsided, and the executives responsible for the systemic negligence escaped with their fortunes intact. The breach became a footnote, a cautionary tale of individual error, not a systemic&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Mark, stripped of his career and reputation, found himself adrift. He sought solace in anonymity, moving to a small town, and taking on odd jobs to make ends meet. He haunted the internet, researching privacy coins — decentralized currencies that promised anonymity and security, a stark contrast to the centralized financial system that had betrayed&nbsp;him.</p><p>One evening, while browsing a cryptocurrency forum, he stumbled upon a thread discussing the John Doe Wealth breach. To his surprise, it wasn’t filled with condemnation of the company, but with praise for its swift action in identifying and punishing the “culprit.” The comments were chillingly familiar, echoing the carefully crafted narrative spun by John Doe and the&nbsp;media.</p><p>Mark realized then that the truth didn’t matter. In the age of information overload, perception was reality. He had become a symbol, a convenient scapegoat, a cautionary tale to distract from the deeper rot within the&nbsp;system.</p><p>But as he delved deeper into the world of privacy coins, a spark of defiance ignited within him. He saw a possibility, a chance to build a new system, one based on transparency and individual empowerment. He began to envision a future where financial privacy wasn’t a privilege, but a right, protected by technology, not controlled by institutions.</p><p>The fall guy had fallen, but he wasn’t broken. He was rising, armed with knowledge and a newfound purpose. The system had tried to silence him, but it had inadvertently given him a voice, a platform to challenge the status quo. What could possibly go wrong? He was about to find&nbsp;out.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>Last year we launched Brave Search Ads in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Today we share an update on our rapidly growing advertising business on Brave’s independent and privacy-preserving search engine, and preview our plans for expansion in the coming year.</p>
<p>From January to December of 2024, Brave grew search advertising clicks by 15x alongside organic search query growth of 80% (656 million in January to 1.19 billion in December). This initial customer success is the result of targeting the top 1% of paid search advertisers in our primary target regions. These are brands that are hitting the limit of efficiency with Google Ads, and who see Brave Search as a means to unlock additional reach. In most cases, the added conversion volume is in line with Brave’s market share in the region, but in some cases brands see as high as 5% growth on total paid search spend while maintaining their target rate for return on ad spend (ROAS).</p>
<p>Today, over half of the top 20 largest paid search advertisers worldwide are customers of Brave Search Ads, including Amazon Ads Sponsored Products, B&amp;H Photo, Booking.com, CompareCredit, Nerdwallet, Stubhub, and Wayfair. Partnering with these leaders in paid search has been of tremendous value to the development of Brave Search Ads. With their help, we’re discovering new ways to achieve scale and improve the effectiveness of our advertising platform.</p>
<p>Our customers have been overwhelmingly supportive of our entry into the paid search market. Brands unanimously agree there should be more competition. At 90% of market share, Google wields pricing power that their customers have no choice but to accept. Our customers know that by buying on Brave Search, they are contributing directly to the development of a more competitive and fair search advertising market, and reaching engaged users and tech early-adopters who value privacy and independence. Importantly, first-movers on Brave Search Ads have benefited from category exclusivity in what is otherwise a highly saturated market, giving them an edge over competitors who exclusively buy Google Ads.</p>
<p>Overall, Brave Search advertisers are extremely satisfied with their experience; 9 out of 10 customers who started Brave Search Ads campaigns in 2024 have continued to advertise in consecutive months.&nbsp;</p>

 What’s driving success at Brave 
<p>The two key forces behind our success in 2024 were the continued growth of the Brave browser (where in most regions Brave Search is the default), and the effectiveness of search engine advertising for all kinds of businesses.</p>
<p>Brave browser and Brave Search are growing at a sustained pace each month. In January, the Brave browser counted 80 million active users worldwide, and 1.29 billion Brave Search queries. The latest numbers are <a href="https://x.com/BrendanEich/status/1886617512353390979">shared regularly to the public by our CEO Brendan Eich</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Search advertising is a well-established market where ads help users find products they show clear intent for with their search keywords. Advertisers on Brave Search are seeing available keyword volume passively increase each month, with conversion rates remaining steady at 100, 1,000 or 10,000 monthly clicks. Brave Search has achieved a predictable and gradually-growing stream of new Web traffic, and thus conversion volume for advertisers. For the first time since Bing, there’s an independent search engine with high-quality search results that convert customers as well as or better than Google Ads.</p>
<p>While the formula itself is simple—a growing search engine plus good ads equals more advertisers—Brave Search didn’t appear overnight. The project began nearly two decades ago <a>with Cliqz, which became Brave Search</a> with a 2021 acquisition, and that tremendous effort is now bearing fruit. We’re very optimistic for the future given Brave Search’s global growth as well as its new features that make it hugely popular with users, such as <a>Answer with AI</a>, the answer engine with an integrated chatbot, and <a>ReRank</a>, which enables users to customize their search rankings.</p>

 About Brave and Search Ads 
<p>Brave builds a suite of tools—starting with the Brave browser and Brave Search—that give people better choices online with leading privacy and security protections, independence from Big Tech, tools to reduce distractions, and access to innovative features like generative AI.</p>
<p>Search Ads are sponsored results on the Brave Search results page. They are currently available to select advertisers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, and Germany. To learn more and inquire about advertising on Brave Search, visit <a>brave.com/brave-ads/search</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:adsales@brave.com">adsales@brave.com</a>.</p>

 通过迁移到Base,Horizen立即与高度活跃的DeFi和dApp生态系统连接,为$ZEN提供了更大的实用性和可访问性。    <p>该提案的目的是增强Horizen的Base设施,采用潜力和生态系统范围,同时保持其隐私和零知识（ZK）创新重点，迁移到Base的主要好处包括:</p>  <p>前所未有的可扩展性和低费用</p>  Base利用了Optimism的OP Stack,并计划将交易速度缩减到1秒以下的最终结果,而成本低于1美分—是ZK驱动的应用程序的理想选择，    <p>开发人员成长与CoinBase支持</p>  Base提供了蓬勃发展的开发人员社区,丰富的流动性和强大的营销支持,使Horizen具有竞争优势。    <p>机构级安全与信任</p>  作为Coinbase支持的网络,Base增强了ZEN的机构信誉,巩固了其在Grayscale和Coinbase生态系统中的地位,并保持了$ZEN持有人的合规优势。    <p>未来证明和更大的网络效应</p>  预计2025年将有100个+应用在Base上使用,Horizen可以早期采用,更深的流动性和更大的互操作性。    <p>在可扩展的生态系统中增强隐私</p>  Horizen将可扩展性与先进的隐私创新相结合,将保护隐私的技术带入了Superchain。    <p>优化的ZK集成</p>  Base灵活的模块化架构使Horizen可以利用现有的汇总Base架构,同时专注于ZK创新的开拓性。    <p>跨链互操作性</p>  Base强大的桥接功能可促进与其他L2和L1的互操作性,从而扩展了$ZEN的范围和可组合性。    <p>成本效率</p>  与维护独立的基于基板的链相比,Base已建立的Base架构降低了开发成本。      为什么要搬到Base-为什么现在呢？ <p>迁移到Base的建议不仅是技术上的转变,而且是使ZEN的采用,实用性和长期价值最大化的战略举措，</p><p>一年前,此举是不可能的-但今天,区块链景观发生了重大变化:</p>  <p>Base已发展成为一个繁荣的生态系统,超过了TVL和开发人员参与度的主要竞争对手，</p>  <p>第3层解决方案已成为改变游戏规则的缩放模型,可实现超低成本交易和更大的灵活性，</p>  <p>Horizen Labs在L2 / L3生态系统方面获得了第一手经验,有助于将Base确定为Horizen未来的最佳选择，</p>  <p>通过迁移到Base,Horizen可以与Coinbase支持的快速扩展的网络保持一致,同时保留其利用零知识证明实现可信赖的数字未来的愿景。</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  最终思想:视野的确定时刻 <p>此举的目的是巩固Horizen在隐私和可伸缩性方面的领导地位,确保我们保持竞争力,创新性并深入以太坊生态系统。</p><p>Horizen一直致力于为未来建设,这一过渡标志着朝着实现我们的使命迈出大胆而必要的一步。</p><p>保持联系并加入对话:</p>  <p><a

<p>激励:&nbsp;与以前的Base设施相关的代币学组件可以进行调整,以优化激励措施并增强实用性,采用性和长期价值，</p>  <p>无缝迁移:&nbsp;现有的ZEN余额将无缝迁移到新的L3结构,从而确保用户的连续性，</p>  <p>交流协调:&nbsp;我们正在与主要交易所（例如Binance,Coinbase）紧密合作,以确保平稳过渡，</p><p>此过渡旨在将Horizen更深入地整合到Base和Optimism中,并利用其生态系统来扩展可访问性和采用性，</p>    <p>这会影响Horizen 2.0路线图和时间表吗？</p><p>尽管我们预计可能会加速,但很快就会提供详细的时间表以确保透明度，</p>  <p>Horizen还会专注于隐私吗？</p><p>是，Horizen致力于启用隐私优先应用程序的承诺保持不变，Horizen在ZKP和隐私保护技术方面的专业知识将成为其在Base生态系统中差异化的核心部分，</p>  <p>为什么Horizen现在采取这一行动？</p><p>Horizen一直将可扩展性,隐私和长期可持续性放在首位,而现在过渡的决定是由技术准备,生态系统成熟度和战略时机共同驱动的，</p><p>此前,第3层（L3)生态系统仍在形成,关键Base设施,最佳实践和工具仍在构建中，现在,随着OP Stack和Base变得更加强大,L3Base架构得到了改进,集成途径更加清晰,确保Horizen可以有效地进行此过渡的时机恰到好处，此外,更广泛的以太坊和乐观主义生态系统已经达到成熟水平,采用和流动性可以更好地支持新的L3,从而降低早期风险，</p><p>通过现在移动,Horizen有机会成为&nbsp;已建立项目中的先行者,利用新兴但快速扩展的生态系统,同时确保无缝且得到良好支持的过渡，</p>  <p>此举将如何影响$ZEN流动性？</p><p>集成到Base中可以使ZEN更接近高度流动的生态系统,从而使用户和开发人员更容易访问和贸易，Base与Coinbase的紧密联系提高了知名度,并增加了进行更深入的交换整合和机构支持的可能性，</p>  <p>Horizen还会支持EVM和Solidity智能合同吗？</p><p>是！移至Base可确保完全的EVM兼容性,从而使现有开发人员可以更轻松地在Horizen上进行部署,而无需学习新框架，</p>  <p>Base的体系结构如何使Horizen开发人员受益？</p><p>Base的体系结构为Horizen开发人员提供了强大,可扩展且对开发人员友好的Base,从而可以更快地部署,降低成本并访问不断发展的工具和Base架构生态系统，</p><p>Horizen开发人员的主要好处:</p>  <p>降低开发开销:&nbsp;Base建立在OP Stack上,提供了BaseBase架构,从而降低了启动和维护L3的复杂性，开发人员可以利用现有的工具,SDK和框架,而无需从头开始构建自定义解决方案，</p>  <p>可扩展性和成本效益:&nbsp;Base的体系结构可实现高吞吐量和低交易成本,非常适合需要频繁交易的应用程序,例如DeFi,游戏和隐私保护技术，</p>  <p>访问与Coinbase连接的Base架构:&nbsp;Base与开发人员工具,法定设备和安全增强功能进行了深度集成,使构建者可以利用简化用户入职和增长的资源，</p>  <p>未来证明的生态系统:&nbsp;随着Base的不断发展,Horizen开发人员将从正在进行的Base架构改进,安全升级以及整个生态系统对缩放解决方案的支持中受益，</p>  <p>通过在Base上建造,Horizen&nbsp;开发人员可以专注于创新而不是Base架构,加速创建可扩展的,保护隐私的应用程序,同时确保与以太坊不断发展的生态系统长期保持一致，</p>  <p>Horizen EON上现有的dApp和合同会怎样？</p><p>我们正在评估最佳技术方法,我们的初步评估表明,可能需要在Base appchain上重新部署Horizen EON上的现有dApps和智能合同，虽然可能需要进行一些调整,&nbsp;这一转变为开发人员提供了宝贵的机会,使他们可以访问Base的更广泛生态系统,更深的流动性和更低的交易成本,增强可扩展性并采用其应用程序，</p><p>为了支持这一过程,我们将提供明确的指导和帮助,包括技术资源和迁移支持,以确保平稳过渡，此举使Horizen社区在增长最快的区块链生态系统之一中蓬勃发展,为dApp和开发人员释放新的机会。</p>  <p>移至Base是否意味着Horizen放弃了权力下放？</p><p>没有，Horizen致力于分散化,同时利用Base来实现可扩展性和可访问性，Base本身建立在遵循以太坊权力下放原则的OP Stack之上,随着时间的流逝,Base的治理和Base设施有望进一步分散，</p><p>此外,Horizen将通过社区治理和对分散式隐私保护技术的持续研究,继续促进权力下放，</p>  <p>为什么要基于Base和OP Stack而不是其他新兴技术？</p><p>Base和OP Stack由于其强大的开发人员生态系统,可扩展性以及与以太坊安全模型的集成而成为主要的L2 / L3Base架构选择，</p><p>Horizen与蓬勃发展的,得到良好支持的技术堆栈保持一致,以确保长期的可持续性,互操作性和持续的创新，此外,Base在Coinbase的大力支持下提供了长期的信誉以及对生态系统增长的明确承诺，</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Taylor Hornby and Ted Hoffmann have joined the Zcash Foundation board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taylor and Ted’s considerable expertise, along with their perspective as community members will enhance the Foundation’s ability to better support and serve the Zcash community.</p>



<p><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/earthrise-for-the-zf-board/49274">Taylor Hornby</a> (earthrise on the Forum) brings extensive experience to the Zcash ecosystem, having worked at the Electric Coin Company (ECC) during Zcash’s pre-launch, later returning to ECC in 2018 as a security engineer, before leaving in 2022 and becoming the Zcash Ecosystem Security Lead through 2023. His stated focus is aligning engineering efforts with product improvements and adoption, fostering unity among community leaders through constructive dialogue, and promoting a culture of collaboration and accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/boggerster-for-the-zf-board/49271">Ted Hoffmann</a> (boggerster on the Forum) is a European citizen fluent in French, German, and English, with nearly a decade of experience in cryptocurrency. He’s particularly passionate about Ethereum and Zcash, valuing open finance and permissionless financial privacy as essential safeguards against authoritarian financial controls. He believes Zcash’s privacy features are critical for fostering a democratic society. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum, Cosmos, Bitcoin, and Zcash, Ted advocates for a community-first approach to advancing Zcash, prioritizing effective communication, streamlined technology, robust onboarding, and a transition to proof-of-stake (PoS).</p>



<p>Taylor and Ted’s arrival coincides with the departure of Peter Van Valkenburgh and Amber Baldet from the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peter has been a remarkable board member and visionary. Over the past eight years, his steadfast dedication has been instrumental in shaping the Foundation into what it is today. From boldly advocating for the Foundation’s unique charitable mission to ensuring that our new trademark policy supports greater decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem, he has set a high standard for our mission of building financial privacy infrastructure for the public good. His commitment to privacy, decentralization, and open-source innovation has left an indelible mark on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As he settles into his new role as Executive Director at Coin Center, we thank him for many years of service and wish him continued success in defending the rights of developers and advancing privacy for all.</p>



<p>Amber’s involvement in Zcash dates back to her time at JP Morgan, where she was responsible for establishing a partnership with the Electric Coin Company that triggered a huge amount of interest in Zcash’s technology. She was one of the first ZF board members appointed based on the community’s feedback, and she has been steadfast in ensuring that the Foundation stays focused on its mission. Her experience in technology leadership roles, and as a startup co-founder and CEO, has been invaluable to the Board and to me personally, often bringing a much-needed dose of reality to our discussions. Her presence on the board will be sorely missed but she will continue to serve the Zcash community and mission as a founding member of the Financial Privacy Foundation’s board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the board, the Zcash Foundation team, and the entire Zcash community, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Peter and Amber for helping guide me through the past four years, and for their vision, dedication, and lasting impact on the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



<p>— Jack Gavigan, Executive Director</p>

<p>Welcome to the Empeiria’s first development update of 2025! We're kicking off the year with our mainnet launch around the corner, technical updates and ecosystem advancements to set the stage for a transformative year for the Empeiria ecosystem!</p>Intelligent Digital Product&nbsp;Passport 1. iDPP: Intelligent Digital Product&nbsp;Passport <p>As featured by the World Economic Forum, Empeiria has been selected for the TradeTech Regulatory Sandbox. This initiative, launched by the World Economic Forum in partnership with the Ministry of Economy, UAE (MoE) and Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED), aims to drive regulatory innovation in cross-border digital&nbsp;trade.</p>  TradeTech Regulatory Sandbox: <a href="https://www.tradetechglobal.org/sandbox">https://www.tradetechglobal.org/sandbox</a>    WEF Linkedin Announcement: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/world-economic-forum-trade_tradetech-global-tradetech-forum-activity-7288556517350363137-V2rd">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/world-economic-forum-trade_tradetech-global-tradetech-forum-activity-7288556517350363137-V2rd</a>  <p>As part of a pilot for the World Economic Forum we’ve developed a new product based on Empeiria’s infrastructure — iDPP, a Verifiable Credential-based system for product authentication.</p> What is&nbsp;iDPP? <p>A next-gen product designed for a framework of trust to verify the authenticity, origin and compliance — without compromising privacy.</p><p>Key Features</p>  Decentralized &amp; Verifiable — Uses blockchain-backed credentials instead of self-reported data.  Cost-Efficient &amp; Scalable — Off-chain storage (IPFS) minimizes blockchain fees.  AI &amp; Blockchain Integration — Automates trust-based interactions, making verification seamless.  <p>Why does it&nbsp;Matter?</p><p>In an age of deepfakes, counterfeiting, and opaque supply chains, verifiable data is the missing trust layer. iDPP ensures manufacturers, regulators, and consumers can verify products instantly.</p> 2. Mainnet Launch&nbsp;Progress <p>Mainnet is in its final stage of development, with key optimizations ensuring security, performance, and scalability.</p> Key Technical Milestones <p>✅ 400% Efficiency Boost<br>The document update process is now faster and more scalable — A major DID module refactor improves storage compression &amp; processing speed.</p><p>✅ Expanded Simulation Testing<br>We’ve expanded our simulation tests to catch rare edge cases and unexpected interactions to catch edge cases before they happen, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p><p>✅ SoftNodes — A New Mechanism for Long-Term Participants<br>A feature designed for those who want to stake and validate over the long run. Users can easily manage staking, select validators, receive rewards, and monitor their node activities.</p><p>✅ Network &amp; Automation Preparations<br>We’re actively configuring servers and automation scripts for the mainnet launch to ensure network stability ahead of&nbsp;launch.</p><p>✅ Comprehensive Developer Docs<br>We’ve completed an extensive documentation set, covering standard blockchain interactions and our custom features. Developers and users can quickly understand the chain’s capabilities and operational guidelines</p> 3. Additional Development Updates  OneClick Deployment Portal <p>We continue to refine the OneClick Deployment Portal, which recently went live. Our focus is on optimizations and security reviews to ensure safer and more straightforward deployments across the ecosystem. Given our role as a trust layer, these audits help us maintain top-tier reliability standards.</p> AI Agent Integration &amp; Use&nbsp;Cases <p>We’re building tools where an AI agent interacts with users and leverages verifiable credentials. For example, an AI agent can conduct user assessments, issuing credential-based certifications for those who meet certain criteria — ideal for exams, training, or automated skills verification. Another application involves AI-based credential verification, where an AI system validates credentials such as employment records or certificates — useful in job interviews or background checks.</p> Telegram Game&nbsp;Updates <p>We continue expanding our Telegram-based game (gEMPE) with new missions, improved gameplay, and additional features. The goal is to keep the experience engaging and fresh for our community while rewarding users for participation.</p> Summary <p>Thank you for being part of our journey! 2025 has already seen a flurry of innovation: from the iDPP rollout to wrapping up preparations for our mainnet launch. We’re committed to delivering impactful solutions for decentralized data and digital identity.</p><p>We look forward to an exciting year of growth, collaboration, and pioneering new possibilities in verifiable data and blockchain technology!

 ShadeX — Cosmos Encrypted Money&nbsp;Market <p>The Cosmos is going through ATOM realignment, the process of protocols prioritizing ATOM and its community as a critical asset to achieving collective success.</p><p>Shade as an encrypted DeFi suite, rapidly embraced ATOM alignment by accruing and liquidity-providing ATOM and stATOM on ShadeSwap. Shade currently holds ~16,000 ATOM in its treasury.</p><p>Beyond just accruing ATOM, Shade is launching ShadeX — the world’s first encrypted money market. Users are empowered to lend out their crypto assets, passively earning interest fees and yield from users who borrow their assets from a lending pool. The ShadeX money market maintains solvency via a system of liquidations of collateral from insolvent borrowers, returning the borrowed debt back to&nbsp;lenders.</p><p>ShadeX will feature ATOM and stATOM as both lendable and borrowable assets. Additionally, ATOM and stATOM will be usable as collateral on ShadeX to borrow other popular assets (i.e. BTC, ETH, USDC, SILK,&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>Historically, money markets throughout crypto expose all lending and borrowing data. This means transparency for how much interest has been accrued to a user’s position, how much someone has borrowed, and even how close they are to liquidation! Can you imagine a world where you knew everyone’s credit ratings, mortgages, and student loan&nbsp;debt.</p><p>We believe ShadeX is a key trailblazing experiment for onboarding institutional and large liquidity into a data-secure lending and borrowing environment. The power of the CosmosSDK and CosmWasm have empowered protocols (such as Shade) to build compelling financial primitives for anyone in the world to&nbsp;access.</p><p><a href="https://shadeprotocol.io/blog/shadex-coming-soon">ShadeX - Redefining Crypto Lending/Borrowing via Encryption - Blog</a></p><p>If you are interested in bringing your ATOM to the world’s first achievement, we invite you to join us for the launch of ShadeX on March 5,&nbsp;2025.</p><p>All you need is some SCRT for gas and ATOM for lending/borrowing to begin experiencing the most data-secure DeFi in all of&nbsp;crypto.</p><blockquote>Bridge your ATOM today → <a href="http://app.shadeprotocol.io">app.shadeprotocol.io</a></blockquote><p>X: <a href="https://x.com/Shade_Protocol">https://x.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.co/u3bysYisf1">https://t.co/u3bysYisf1</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/shadex-cosmos-encrypted-money-market-ff866e1d39c6">ShadeX — Cosmos Encrypted Money Market</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Ecosystem Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Partnering with OpenEvidence: A Life-Saving Healthcare Revolution  <p>This AI-powered search engine for doctors could be one of the most important companies of the next decade.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/pat-grady/">Pat Grady</a>	 



Published February 19, 2025
  



OpenEvidence co-founder Daniel Nadler.



 
<p>Choosing the right medicine for a prostate cancer patient, based on the latest efficacy research. Accessing expert guidance in a rural area, where sub-specialists are scarce. Uncovering overlooked studies in a review of OCD treatments. Identifying the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism before it’s too late.</p>



<p>These are just a few of the millions of ways more than a quarter of U.S. doctors have used the specialized medical search engine <a href="https://www.openevidence.com/">OpenEvidence</a> in the roughly one year since it launched. Already, the scale of its impact is a prime example of AI as a force for good. But if co-founders Daniel Nadler and Zachary Ziegler and their team achieve what we believe they can, the lives they help save could soon be measured in the millions.</p>



<p>This transformative technology comes as the U.S. healthcare system reaches a breaking point. With just one million active physicians for a growing—and aging—population of 340 million, doctors are stretched thin. On top of clinical work, they spend countless hours sifting through journals, to ensure their life-and-death decisions are based on the latest research. But a new PubMed article is published every <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266638992400076X#:~:text=Over%201.5%20million%20scientific%20articles,the%20PubMed%20database%20every%20year.">three minutes</a>, and medical knowledge doubles every <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116346/#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20the,0.2%20years%E2%80%94just%2073%20days.">73 days</a>. It is impossible to keep up.</p>



<p>Like a ChatGPT for doctors, OpenEvidence automates this information hunt. The platform searches across 35 million peer-reviewed publications—and, thanks to a new content partnership, is trained on The New England Journal of Medicine. There are no hallucinations; if the literature is inconclusive, OpenEvidence simply doesn’t respond. And it communicates just like healthcare professionals do—conversationally, and complete with medical charts and graphs.</p>



<p>A second-time founder, Daniel was already well ahead of the AI curve when he launched the financial technology platform Kensho, which was acquired by S&amp;P in 2018 and is credited with the company’s AI evolution. When COVID-19 hit, he couldn’t stop thinking about applying what he’d learned to healthcare. So he founded OpenEvidence with a mission to organize the world’s medical knowledge—and help physicians quickly surface the latest and most effective treatments for their patients. Daniel has proven to be a magnet for talent, attracting top AI researchers to the OpenEvidence team—including Zachary, a brilliant computer scientist from Harvard—and assembling a world-class medical board to ensure the platform gives physicians exactly what they need.</p>



<p>The response has been remarkable: in less than a year, OpenEvidence became perhaps the fastest-growing healthcare business in history, with more than 35,000 verified doctors registering each month. Aside from the iPhone, we believe no technology has been adopted by doctors so quickly. Even more remarkable is that it all happened via word of mouth; the engine of OpenEvidence’s growth is trust. And because the app is free to every doctor in every U.S. care center, it’s assisting not just doctors in top hospitals, but also small, independent practices in hard-to-reach communities across the country.</p>



<p>Sequoia is proud to lead the Series A for OpenEvidence and partner as their first institutional investor, and we look forward to supporting them as they continue to grow. The work Daniel, Zachary and their team are doing has the potential to create one of the defining companies of the next decade—and to revolutionize medicine for doctors and their patients alike.</p>

<p>In January, Italy’s data protection authority, Garante, blocked access to the Chinese AI firm DeepSeek. The agency cited serious concerns about the company’s handling of user data and its lack of transparency.</p><p>The move trailed an investigation where DeepSeek’s responses to Garante’s inquiries were deemed insufficient. According to Garante, DeepSeek’s operators, Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence and Beijing DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence, claimed they did not operate in Italy and were not bound by European data laws. Consequently, the regulator did not only block the service but also launched a formal investigation.</p><p>Italy is not alone in its concerns. DeepSeek’s rapid ascent has triggered global scrutiny, with lawmakers and regulators worldwide raising questions about its privacy policies, potential ties to Chinese censorship, and the implications for national security. While specific details of actions taken by other countries may not be publicly available due to ongoing investigations or diplomatic sensitivities, it is widely understood that several nations have expressed concerns and are monitoring the situation closely. These concerns often revolve around data collection practices, potential government access to user information, and the potential for misuse of AI technology.</p><p>Adding to the growing unease, cybersecurity firms have discovered significant vulnerabilities in DeepSeek’s large language models (LLMs). These LLMs are susceptible to “jailbreak” techniques, which allow users to bypass safety protocols and generate harmful&nbsp;content.</p><p>The discovery of these vulnerabilities in DeepSeek mirrors similar issues found in other AI platforms. OpenAI recently patched a flaw in its ChatGPT-4 model that allowed attackers to manipulate the chatbot’s responses. Similar vulnerabilities have been identified in Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5-VL model and GitHub’s Copilot, demonstrating a broader challenge in ensuring the safety and security of advanced AI&nbsp;systems.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/italy-blocks-deepseek-ai-over-data-risks-e2c5f3654a34">Italy Blocks DeepSeek AI over Data Risks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Tilman Tschoeke’s first day at RobCo was in the spring of 2022. The small-scale industrial robotics company was still tiny, with just 25 employees in their Munich office. It was a challenging time for European startups—the characteristic precarity of early-stage entrepreneurship was exacerbated by rising interest rates and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Companies were counting every euro carefully.</p>



<p>RobCo’s 28-year-old cofounder Roman Hölzl gave Tschoeke a laptop, informing his new head of finance that he’d have to bring his own charger. A few days into the job, Tschoeke was given access to the company’s bank account as he prepared to issue salary payments. At first glance, the numbers he saw there made no sense. He asked Hölzl if he could give him access to the second bank account, to which Hölzl replied, “Oh, there is no second account.” Tschoeke’s stomach sank. He could only choose to trust Hölzl’s seeming unflappability, which proved to be a sound judgement call when a well-timed payment from the company’s seed round arrived days later.</p>



<p>Tschoeke was beginning to appreciate that flirting with the boundaries of sensible and possible was just another weekday for Hölzl. It wouldn’t take long working with him before Tschoeke, like so many others who know the young CEO, came to understand that Hölzl views the world as a series of obstacles to surmount, odds to overcome and races to win. It’s a trait that has defined Hölzl’s triumphs. In the most immediate, physical sense, it has also led him to the edge of disaster.</p>



 



<p>Hölzl comes from a long line of competitive skiers. His paternal grandfather was a skier, having picked it up during an apprenticeship in post-World War II Switzerland. He eventually settled in Munich and ran a small butcher shop—exhausting manual labor that reliably put food on the table even during times of scarcity. Their three sons eventually took up teaching skiing to pay their way through school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When they weren’t skiing, both of Hölzl’s parents ran a small car dealership in Neuburg an der Donau, a calendar-pretty Bavarian town an hour north of Munich. In the winter, they would drive their sons, Roman and Florian, the three hours to the alps. By the time Roman was a teen, he was an instructor himself—a family vocation that Florian now sees as surprisingly apt preparation for his big brother’s work as a founder. It required keeping a cohort (of kids, usually) motivated to brave any sort of dreadful weather or scary terrain. Roman had to present himself as fearless to instill confidence in those who counted on him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Hölzl brothers built their nerve by throwing themselves, often literally, into sports—tennis, swimming, trampolining, skateboarding, whatever. Roman was a stronger skier and more intense competitor than his younger brother, a trait Florian believes grew out of Roman’s obsession for optimizing his performance. Skiing, a sport where the smallest mistake can turn into a personal disaster, became Roman’s prime testing ground for visualizing a plan, experimenting at top speed, and applying learnings to future runs.</p>



<p>Most German school days ended at lunchtime. After school, when they lacked the hours necessary to drive to the slopes, they would scour the internet to find videos of new tricks, refine them on their trampoline, and then later experiment on the mountain. In the snowless summer they would lay down wooden pallets covered with fake grass near their home and lather soap on the pipe of a bicycle rack so they could slide on a rail.</p>



<p>By Roman’s mid-teens he was jumping, freestyling and competing constantly against the best skiers in Europe. “We did these 70-foot jumps—that’s double flips, three-and-a-half rotations, corkscrews,” he said. “Basically rotations out of your natural axes and back into it.” He was strong enough that he earned sponsorships from two French companies and was winning competitions with titles such as King of Shred. Well into secondary school, Germany’s education system still allowed him to manage his time as he saw fit. He would show up to class mainly just to take exams, while skiing close to a hundred days a year. His enviable LinkedIn summary of this professional period of his life reads, in part: “Backflips, deep snow, and great times!”</p>



<p>His grades were adequate but certainly not fantastic, and in the winter of 2012, his father challenged his then 18-year-old son to get better marks. If he could, they’d take a ski trip to Canada. Hölzl accepted and got the grades. The day before they were set to depart on their trip, they went skiing. That was when Hölzl took the worst fall of his life and suffered a compression fracture in two spots in his lower back.</p>



<p>He spent a night immobilized in the hospital in an awkward position that made his feet fall asleep. As he lay awake, he contemplated what his life would be if this was, in fact, paralysis. Years later, in hard moments with his startup, he would reflect on that long, numb night.</p>



<p>“If things go south at RobCo, I’m benchmarking against that,” Hölzl says, “which puts everything so much into perspective that company-building becomes a bit of a different beast. It will never be as bad as it was that night in March 2012.”</p>



<p>That next morning, imaging showed that his spinal nerves were fine; he would recover. His family moved his bed upstairs from the basement to the living room. There, as he convalesced, Hölzl had to remain still, really for the first time in his life. He had a lot of time to consider a future in which he might not ever be able to ski. “Having an injury where maybe there’s not going to be a next time,” his brother says, “it’s terrifying. But maybe for Roman, it was necessary to learn patience.”</p>
 



Hölzl on the slopes in Hochzillertal and Kitzbühel, Austria



 
<p>After his injury, Hölzl spent weeks wearing a stabilizing exoskeleton to hold his spine in place. He spent the next season easing back onto the slopes but was far from competing. So what did he do with the other 80-or-so days that he otherwise would’ve been skiing? “That’s when I first started pouring energy into uni,” Hölzl said.</p>



<p>Over the course of the next few semesters, he went from the bottom 25% of his class to the top 3%. School was the new arena where he sized up the competition and was determined to come out on top. “You want to have that same feeling,” he says, “even if it’s an engineering event.”</p>



<p>For as long as he could remember, Hölzl was fascinated by the way his skis, boots and bindings enabled him to do things like launch himself down a mountain at explosive speeds and jump vast distances. “What I always found the most interesting was the intersection of humans and technology,” Hölzl said. “In skiing I witnessed how great it can be if things work out well with you and your technology. But also if it doesn’t go well, with a big crash.” Keen to explore that intersection, Hölzl pursued human factors engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2016 he enrolled at the Technical University of Munich, one of Europe’s best engineering universities. During those studies, he also completed a research fellowship at Harvard. His research tended to focus more on user experience—in robotics and autonomous driving—than on back-end engineering.</p>



<p>He met Constantin Dresel and Paul Maroldt when he began a Ph.D. program back at the Technical University of Munich in 2019. Together they ran a practical lab course in robotics and drilled into what they saw as the promise of modular robotics: developing industrial robots that were nimble, safe and able to be reconfigured quickly, thus opening a potentially huge market of smaller manufacturers that historically hadn’t been able to afford to automate manual tasks. The three men were able to plug into Munich’s hub of industry, taking advantage of weekly feedback from advisor companies and deploying prototypes, which gave them practical testing opportunities that validated their otherwise abstract mathematical work.</p>



<p>When the trio launched RobCo in 2020, it was a seamless move into commercializing the work they’d already been doing in the lab. From their time immersed with industry leaders, they understood that manufacturers were fretting over labor shortages that only promised to worsen in the coming years. RobCo aimed to create a robot capable of alleviating that labor shortage and drastically increasing productivity. Picture a programmable arm, perhaps about the size of a human arm or larger, that can do fine, complex manual tasks on repeat ad infinitum.</p>



<p>Two weeks after they claimed the name, they learned that the hit video game Fallout contains a multibillion-dollar robotics company called RobCo. Hölzl just thought it was short, easy and punchy. Now their YouTube videos are peppered with appreciative fan comments—“Ay when y’all releasing zeta invaders”—which gives the cofounders occasion to smile, to think how their startup is blurring the lines with science fiction.</p>
 







 
<p>The early-stage “kind of garage-style” company that Tilman Tschoeke took a chance on in 2022 was powered in large part by Hölzl’s sheer zeal. Hölzl’s fire impressed Tschoeke. “That’s clearly one of his key character traits—he’s very competitive, in a positive sense,” Tschoeke says.</p>



<p>Today, Hölzl’s typical pitch to potential clients begins, he says, with them pitching him. Companies want to know: Can you really do this? Can you install a robot that can laser-cut aluminum bicycle parts, for instance, or pack hearing aids and stack the boxes onto pallets? So RobCo’s opener is simple enough. You’re having trouble finding people. It’s only going to get worse. Let us automate some basic tasks for you. Hire our robots.</p>



<p>Roughly 70% of their customers had never used physical automation before. But all of a sudden the 150-year-old manufacturer de Crignis had RobCo arms molding sheet metal into cladding for machines, and Frank Präzisionsteile, a company that manufactures parts for aerospace and medical devices, had RobCo arms filling the overnight shifts no human workers wanted. And on and on.</p>



<p>RobCo’s modular arms are small enough that they don’t need to be bolted to factory floors. They can be up and running in a matter of a couple of days rather than weeks. “Many of those companies are really just lacking those people,” Hölzl said. “And we’ll see the labor time bomb basically ticking faster and faster in Germany between 2025 to 2028. That’s when the most people will go on pension ever in the history of the country.”</p>



<p>A RobCo robot costs a customer between 2,000 and 4,000 euros per month, or about a third of the cost of the two shift workers its labor can replicate. The size, speed and scale of their robots are what Hölzl calls, in a manner befitting a former elite athlete, “superhuman, but only a little bit.” The RobCo arms can move something that weighs 40 kilograms a few thousand times a day. Greater weights and distances require much more robust robots, the sort that larger factories have used for decades. RobCo has carved its niche in taking over discrete, standalone tasks that would usually require a human operator.</p>



<p>As for the humans building these machines, Hölzl and his cofounders have complementary strengths. In the early days, Dresel focused on the back-end software (the founders built their platform on C++, running on Linux). Maroldt was the hardware guy, the prototyper. Hölzl focused on user interfaces, designing them to be as seamless as possible.</p>



<p>“The best user interface is one that doesn’t exist, in a sense,” Hölzl said. “The key really is, which parts of the overall teaching of the user interface can you just abstract away?” For example: Their perception mechanism is so refined that a user can indicate to the robot a pickup point and a dropoff point for a part, and the robot can detect the rest—what the parts are, how to find and grab them, and how to place them where they need to go. Hölzl says that such a process would have previously required a programmer to feed the machine 50 separate instructions.</p>



<p>Sequoia came across RobCo in 2022 when a scout forwarded Luciana Lixandru the company’s deck. The premise was, essentially, “UiPath for the real world.” Lixandru, who had led the Series A for UiPath—a Romanian company that automates digital tasks, and which is now worth nearly $8 billion—latched onto the thesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upon meeting Hölzl, she knew he was a special founder: Hölzl’s switch from elite skiing to academic performance was unconventional but promising. “He’s honestly amazing,” she says. “He’s very articulate, very high IQ, very ambitious, very competitive. At Sequoia, all our partners are really competitive. You put him at that table and he still might be the most competitive person there.” Lixandru recalls putting Hölzl in touch with a colleague of hers, a fellow German, and the two eventually met up. The colleague later reported back that they’d taken a nice Sunday bike ride. “And then, when I talked to Roman,” Lixandru says, “he was like ‘We had a biking race.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hölzl was surprised when he first heard from Sequoia; he thought RobCo, as a robotics firm, wouldn’t appeal to venture capitalists who tend to back software companies. The great drawback of robotics is that unlike software, robots are made of stuff. “With software, you build one product and you sell it a million times,” Lixandru said. “Here you have to rebuild every single product that you build and then go deploy it. And you have to do this in a smooth, capital-efficient way.” Eventually the goal is to expand across the globe—the U.S. market remains the ultimate prize—but scaling robotics is an even greater feat than scaling software. Every unit has to be built, shipped, installed and monitored. Sequoia is betting that Germany, a hub of mid-sized engineering and manufacturing companies, is the right place to start scaling.</p>



<p>In one sense, RobCo keeps pushing so fast by doing the least. Rather than dabble in theoretical solutions, the company builds only the specific features its clients ask for and need. Tschoeke says that his CEO has the charisma to sell and to communicate a vision, as well as the technical background to resolve customers’ engineering concerns. “He’s very to the point,” Tschoeke says of Hölzl. “Whatever the question is, he has answers. And I think that’s his biggest strength.”</p>



<p>RobCo is now approaching 100 employees, supplying small- and mid-sized manufacturers in Germany with its robotic arms. The company is filling a market niche that Hölzl believes may include tens of thousands of companies. As RobCo reaches more customers, it’s also gathering data with a long-term aim of making robots that work even in unstructured use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In Germany we have a quote that means, basically, ‘Impossible is nothing,’” Tschoeke says. “From a technical perspective, when they say, ‘OK, no, we cannot do it in two quarters because typically it takes a year,’ we say, ‘OK, let’s do it in one quarter.’ And we’ve proved it many times. This comes strongly from Roman. He is always pushing that balance pretty strongly.”</p>



 



<p>Hölzl misses his skiing days. His life now is spent in the office six days a week obsessing over RobCo. Get him talking about skiing and you can hear the joy in his voice. From RobCo’s HQ in Munich, he’s a short drive from alpine skiing. But when he daydreams, it’s of western Canada or of Hokkaido. Japan, he says, has the greatest snow in the world.</p>



<p>He and Florian recently splurged on a first for them: skiing in the Caucasus Mountains. Florian traveled to Georgia from Germany; his brother arrived directly from a work trip abroad, feeling a little worse for wear amid all the travel. They headed to a tiny village where the next morning, a man wearing ski boots picked them up in a Ford Raptor pickup truck. He drove them to a clearing outside town where a helicopter flew them to 15,000 feet and they got a glimpse of Russia before they dropped into virgin mountainside powder.</p>



<p>Florian remembers it as a sublime day on the mountain. He also watched his brother closely. After a few runs, Hölzl was actually the one to beg off early. His schedule had caught up with him, and in a moment of uncharacteristic restraint, he decided not to push himself to the absolute brink.</p>



<p>They left the mountain with light still in the sky. After two days of rest—an eon for any founder to put everything on pause but an eternity for this one—he finally felt right. On the third day, Hölzl began to bang out emails and take calls. “He was hyped to work again,” Florian says, “because he had so many ideas.” Florian felt that he was witnessing an understanding dawn on his brother in real time: Not every race in Roman Hölzl’s life required a headlong sprint, it turns out. It took Hölzl a mere three decades on skis to learn that he, too, is only human—a realization that just might help sustain his human-augmenting robotics company for years to come.</p>

<p>Today, we have adopted a new trademark policy for the Zcash trademarks. You can read the full policy <a href="https://zfnd.org/trademark-policy/">here</a>.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we highlight some of the important changes, and explain why we believe this new approach supports and enables greater decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



 Background 



<p>For the past five years, use of the Zcash trademarks was governed by an <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zcash_Trademark_Donation_and_License_Agreement_20191106.pdf">agreement</a> between the Zcash Foundation (ZF) and the Electric Coin Company (ECC). Following ECC’s decision to terminate that agreement, ZF became the sole steward of the trademarks. This provided an opportunity to review and update the trademark policy to reflect the growing decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



<p>Our overarching objective in making these changes is to allow members of the Zcash community to use the trademarks as broadly and permissively as possible for purposes that are natural and well-intentioned in the context of a decentralized cryptocurrency, while still protecting the trademarks (and thus, Zcash’s name, brand and reputation) from misuse by those who seek to mislead, deceive or defraud.</p>



 Key Changes 



<p>At a high level, the changes introduced in this new trademark policy are aimed at making it:</p>



 
 Shorter and simpler: The most obvious change is that the new trademark policy is shorter and simpler. The old policy was adapted from the Model Trademark Guidelines, which are intended for open source software projects. By reviewing the policy from the perspective of Zcash as a cryptocurrency, we were able to make it shorter, simpler, and therefore easier to understand. 
 



<p></p>



 
 More permissive: The new policy is also more permissive. The old policy was drafted in a way that required that certain uses be explicitly licensed. While we sought to make it as simple as possible to license the trademark, it still required paperwork, which discouraged some people and teams.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 
 Minimized in scope: The new policy seeks to minimize the scope of uses that must be explicitly licensed. For example, the old policy permitted the use of the Zcash trademarks on promotional goods for free giveaways but not for sale. This meant that anyone who wanted to make and sell Zcash-branded merchandise was required to obtain a license from ZF. The new policy removes this restriction, meaning that anyone can now make and sell Zcash-branded merchandise, like stickers, t-shirts or mugs.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 Eliminating the Trademark’s Role in Zcash Governance 



<p>The trademark agreement created a governance role for the trademarks by stipulating that network upgrades were subject to approval by both ECC and ZF. If either party objected to the activation of a network upgrade, the Zcash trademarks could no longer be applied to either fork of the blockchain.</p>



<p>The ZF Board believes that it is no longer appropriate to use the Zcash trademarks in this way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash is a decentralized cryptocurrency, defined by a documented protocol, and implemented as open source software (most notably <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash?tab=readme-ov-file#the-zcashd-full-node">zcashd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/?tab=readme-ov-file#about">Zebra</a>). The nature of open source software means that anyone is free to copy and modify that software, including making modifications to the way the Zcash protocol is implemented. They may then invite others to run that software. If this were to occur without broad consensus support across the Zcash community and ecosystem, it could result in a contentious hard fork.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the event of a persistent contentious hard fork, in order to prevent user confusion, the Zcash Foundation may use the Zcash trademarks to call for specific naming conventions at exchanges or other entities to clearly distinguish between the two tines of the fork. However, the Zcash Foundation will endeavor to not use the Zcash trademarks as a means of persuading the larger public that one tine of the fork or the other is the canonical and only legitimate version of Zcash.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>As Zcash and its ecosystem evolves and become more decentralized, the structures that have built up to support Zcash must also evolve. The Zcash Foundation is committed to ensuring that it adapts to better serve the Zcash mission and community. That commitment includes supporting ongoing decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem, and this new trademark policy is an important step in that direction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, we are keen to hear the community’s feedback and suggestions (both of which helped inform our decision-making on this policy), so please engage on the Zcash Community forums.</p>

<p>Zcash Foundation has developed this <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zcash-Foundation_Participatory-Grant-Making-for-Decentralized-Cryptocurrency-Ecosystems.pdf">discussion draft</a> and an AI-generated <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zcash-Foundation_Participatory-Grantmaking-in-Decentralized-Cryptocurrency-Ecosystems.wav">audio companion</a> in order to empower our community as we collectively explore various future Participatory Grantmaking (PGM) models. Its purpose is to provide an overview of potential approaches without endorsing or advocating for any specific model. The inclusion of any particular funding model in this document should not be interpreted as an indication of support or preference by the Zcash Foundation.</p>



<p>Participatory Grantmaking (PGM) is a natural extension of Zcash’s commitment to decentralization and community governance. The exploration of PGM models for Zcash represents our collective commitment to transparent and inclusive decision-making. The PGM framework enables community members to actively participate in determining how resources are allocated, ensuring that funding decisions align with the collective vision of Zcash’s future.</p>



<p>By examining different models, we can work together to identify mechanisms that:</p>



 
 Preserve Zcash’s core principles of privacy and decentralization 



 Ensure equitable participation in funding decisions 



 Maintain transparency while protecting participant privacy and 



 Strengthen community engagement and ownership 
 



<p></p>



<p>We invite discussion on the Zcash community forum to facilitate <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/unlocking-the-future-of-zcash-through-participatory-grantmaking/50379">an open dialogue about potential PGM implementations</a>, knowing that the success of any chosen model will depend on active community participation and careful consideration about how it serves Zcash’s mission. The ultimate decisions rest with the Zcash community, determined through collaborative discourse and deliberation.</p>

And although it is an independent project from some PIVXLabs devs, it cleverly uses your PIVX wallet as your identity — pretty slick,&nbsp;huh?</p><p>Just a quick note: they’ve since renamed it Vector, so that’s what we’ll be calling it from here on&nbsp;out.</p><p>I even had the chance to chat with JSKitty, one of the brains behind the whole thing, and you can find my interview with him <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/uncovering-chatstr-an-interview-with-jskitty-d4c84b7f5af8">here</a>. I tried out the secret messenger, and here’s what I&nbsp;think.</p> First Impressions <p>Vector’s interface is undeniably simple. The clean design makes it incredibly easy to navigate, even for those unfamiliar with secure messaging. The basic structure works, and it works&nbsp;well.</p><p>Real-time message delivery was smooth and reliable, and the inclusion of emojis, while basic, added a touch of personality to conversations. The core functionality — sending and receiving encrypted messages — is Vector’s strength.</p> The Security Question: Encryption and Seed&nbsp;Phrases <p>Vector’s primary selling point is its focus on security. While I am not familiar with all the backend stuff, the team claims that the app offers a “solid vault-like privacy, without sacrificing the common, fun, enjoyable experience of a well-featured app.”</p><p>In terms of login requirements, Nostr users can sign up with their nsec private key while PIVX users can use their 12-word seed phrase. Although Vector does not store seed phrases at all, I find it unsettling using it at the initial signup. Subsequent logins require a 5-digit decryption pin.</p> Current Functionality <p>While simplicity can be a pro, Vector currently lacks a handful of the features users may expect from modern messaging apps. There are no advanced features like disappearing messages, voice or video calls, or rich media sharing. This makes it feel somewhat basic compared to established players.</p><p>Another significant drawback is the user discovery system. You need the “npub” (of someone to chat with them. This means you can’t easily discover or connect with new users within the app. This severely limits the potential for community growth and makes it feel isolating.</p><p>In general, Vector has potential. The core functionality — secure, real-time messaging — is there. The simple interface is easy to use. However, the cumbersome user discovery system holds it back. The app is still a work in progress and it will be interesting to see how it evolves in the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

  The Arc PMF Terrifying Questions Framework  <p></p>   
	By Team Sequoia	 
  



 
<p>In <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, our company building immersion for Sequoia’s pre-seed and seed-stage founders, we focus on the path to product-market fit. Using the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/pmf-framework/">Arc PMF Framework</a>, we describe three distinct PMF archetypes, depending on how customers view the problem your product solves. This new companion framework is about application: Once you understand the three archetypes and your company’s place in the world, what steps can you actually take day-to-day to pursue PMF, and how do you know you’re on the right track?</p>



 Answer the Four Terrifying Questions 



<p>Achieving durable product-market fit requires tackling four terrifying questions that should keep you up at night as you build your business. Each terrifying question has positive indicators that mitigate your fear and indicate you’re headed in the right direction, and a resolution that confirms you’re ready to tackle the next terrifying question. As you build conviction in your answers to the terrifying questions, you get closer to PMF.</p>
 







 
 



 How to Answer Each Question&nbsp; 



<p>The more overlap between your company and the market opportunity, the closer you get to resolving the terrifying question.</p>
 


 
	 
					 
				The Arc PMF Terrifying Questions Framework			 
				
	 

			 
			 
				Your unique advantage			 
			 
				What is my company’s right to exist?			 
			 
				The opportunity			 
		 
	 



 
<p>The first terrifying question to confront is: What is my company’s right to exist? Great companies are built on a founder’s authentic insight about a market opportunity. At this stage your work is to understand the category, the competition and your unique advantages as a founder. How clearly can you describe your founder-market fit? Pressure-test the originating belief behind your business. You want to understand if the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tam-sam-som">TAM</a> provides a big enough reward. As you refine your idea, there will be positive indicators that suggest you’re heading in the right direction.</p>



 
 You can articulate why it’s a compelling category and market, and why now is the moment to capture it 



 Your wedge or entry point into the market opportunity becomes clearer 



 You can articulate your unique advantage in seizing this specific opportunity—why you have founder-market fit 



 Ideation compounds as you hone your direction—information and conversations result in “productive pivots” that build sequentially; you feel progress, not just motion&nbsp; 
 



<p>Conviction in your originating belief should grow as you pressure-test your idea and see more positive indicators. You know that you’ve answered this question when you’re ready to marry the idea for the next decade-plus, and you’d recruit a best friend to work on it with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, when David Vélez was starting Nubank, he turned down an opportunity to join Sequoia as a partner in California. He had always wanted to start a company, and after finishing Stanford GSB he felt a pull back to Latin America. He then spent months pressure-testing his insight about the opportunity to disrupt Brazilian banking. The deeper he dug, the stronger his conviction in the idea became, and he identified his wedge: credit cards, which offered a lower regulatory barrier to entry. Once he was resolved and knew he was ready to commit, Nubank was born.</p>
 


 
	 
					 
				The Arc PMF Terrifying Questions Framework			 
				
	 

			 
			 
				What you think matters			 
			 
				Do people care enough?			 
			 
				What customers think matters			 
		 
	 



 
<p>You have an insight into a market opportunity, but the terrifying question remains: Do people care enough about the problem you’re solving? If people don’t care enough, you won’t be able to build a meaningful business by addressing it. They need to care about the problem not only in the abstract, but they need to be willing to pay for the solution. Speaking with potential customers gives you this information. You need a critical mass of conversations to produce enough evidence: We’ve seen companies conduct 50+ conversations in a week. Positive indicators that the problem resonates with customers:</p>



 
 High hit rate on cold outreach (which is more likely to reflect truth vs. warm leads predisposed to “be nice”) 



 More people than you invited show up to calls and demos 



 Customers’ eyes light up at your pitch and they lean in; your idea represents an unlock for them: “I want this now!” 



 Customers express clear willingness to pay for the solution&nbsp; 



 Customer responses help you refine the idea and sharpen what a differentiated solution might look like<br> 
 



<p>It’s important to be objective about how customers externalize these positive indicators, and not let confirmation bias cloud your judgement. If only one in 10 customer conversations lean in, the problem may not matter as much as you thought—but what matters most is the depth of engagement. You’re looking for a set of customers who respond passionately and feel your pitch really speaks to them. Dig deeper into what they have in common and laser focus on this segment. It can be easy to talk yourself into believing that customers are more excited about your idea than they are. The conversations that resonate most strongly will help you define your ICP, how they see the problem and why it matters to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ultimate resolution you’re seeking through these conversations is a set of design partners—initial customers who are excited to co-create the solution with you. If you’re seeing rabid customer interest and you’ve secured design partners, then you’ve successfully validated the problem and answered this terrifying question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before launch, DoorDash’s founders <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/crucible-moments-doordash/">spoke</a> with “three or four hundred” small businesses. While their initial idea was about last-mile delivery, they weren’t initially targeting restaurants, since they thought Grubhub and others had already solved this problem. However, they discovered through customer conversations that competitors only routed orders, and left restaurants to make their own deliveries. Local restaurants that couldn’t afford their own delivery staff were the most passionate merchants DoorDash interviewed, with a burning unmet demand. Their first onboarded customer was a macaroon store in Palo Alto that had been turning down dozens of orders per week because they couldn’t deliver them.</p>

				Your roadmap			 
			 
				Does my product actually change behavior?			 
			 
				Customers’ established behavior			 
		 
	 



 
<p>After you’ve validated the problem, there are still likely many different ways you could choose to build your product to solve it. At this stage, the terrifying question becomes: Does your product actually change behavior? It needs to not only work but to delight customers enough to transform their behavior. Your primary task at this stage is iterating on your product and evolving features to find positive indicators that users are consistently engaging with at least one feature. A product feature becoming “sticky” signals that it’s adding enough value to change users’ behavior, in addition to other positive indicators:</p>



 
 A clear “lightbulb” moment in your demo that makes your product click for people 



 Short activation period: users are able to on-ramp and get immediate value from the product, which you can measure as engagement 



 A specific feature in your product becomes durably sticky, even if it’s not the entire product surface 



 Customers make nuanced feature requests, point to a compelling feature set 



 Power user behavior emerges as an outlier pattern among a subset of customers&nbsp; 



 Evangelism and virality emerges—users start telling peers about a specific feature or capability 
 



<p>As you iterate on the product to move your metrics up, your North Star is engaged and retained users. A growing set of retained users, and a low churn rate, give you conviction that your product is indeed changing customers’ behavior. If your most engaged users match the ICP you identified earlier, it should strengthen your conviction in the problem. If not, this will help you refine your understanding of the problem and your ICP, and evolve your product to serve them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drew Houston of Dropbox <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/crucible-moments-dropbox/">says</a> product virality is “an exponential game, but also a game of inches.” As Dropbox came out of beta and opened to general availability, the team obsessed over every surface of the onboarding flow and feature usage. They soon figured out that users who shared files with contacts got the most value from the product. As they optimized for file sharing—even advertising on Craigslist to get users in the office to test new designs—the product began to spread virally, with high activation and retention rates, and low churn.</p>

				Your sales playbook			 
			 
				Will customers pay enough to build a business?			 
			 
				Customer spend			 
		 
	 



 
<p>After finding product traction and building conviction in your solution, the next terrifying question to confront is: Will people pay enough for it to build a real business? Scaling a meaningful business requires an exchange of value: customers have to be happy to pay your asking price. Your initial beta customers likely won’t pay your ideal price point, and that’s OK—getting there is a process. As you seek to prove the hypothesis that your price target is realistic, you should iterate on your sales process just like you iterate on product features, testing how to demo, price, package, activate, onboard and support your customers. As you strengthen the value exchange with customers, you’ll see positive indicators:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Discovery process confirms your assumptions about budget availability&nbsp; 



 Customers don’t balk at your asking price or slow roll the deal 



 High ratio of engaged users upgrading from the free tier to the paid tier 



 Contract reviews happen quickly; you don’t get stuck in procurement purgatory 



 You don’t find yourself in a knife fight with competitors based on price 
 



<p>The ultimate answer to whether customers will pay enough to build a business is a list of paying customers who feel they get great value from your product at your asking price. But to achieve your ambition and build an important company, you need to grow. You should be able to chart a path to $500M in revenue based on your conviction in the problem, your assessment of the TAM and the strength of the value exchange.</p>



<p>When Block first introduced the Square mobile card reader, they intended to sell the hardware and software to merchants. The founders had answered the terrifying questions of whether people cared enough about the problem and whether their product changed behavior, but they were still iterating on the price point and how much people would pay. As Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/crucible-moments-block/">explains</a>, at one point they realized the best value exchange would be to give the hardware and software away for free, and charge a percentage fee on each transaction. The company would get recurring revenue rather than a one-time sale, and their customers would get immediate value without any capital outlay—a win-win, which quickly brought them to PMF.</p>



 Revisiting the Terrifying Questions 



<p>While the terrifying questions build on one another, you shouldn’t think of answering them in a strictly linear way. Practice is always messier than theory, and it’s possible you’ll confront multiple questions at once, and move fluidly between them over time.</p>



<p>For example: In 2022 Robinhood, already a public company with over $1B in annual revenue, made a profound realization about their ICP: their core customer was not the first-time amateur getting started with investing, as they’d thought, but rather the “active trader” making many trades per week or day. In our Crucible Moments podcast, founder Vlad Tenev <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/robinhood-ft-vlad-tenev-reinventing-finance-for-a-new-generation/">describes</a> how discovering this caused the team to revisit who cared most about the problem they were solving, whether their product was optimized to deliver those users the most value, as well as the value exchange with those customers. Over two years, the company radically evolved its offerings based on these insights and iterated to strengthen their answer to each terrifying question. The result has been dramatically increasing revenue per user (and Robinhood’s share price along with it).</p>



<p>Every time you expand to a new customer or product line, you confront the same terrifying questions again. PMF is an ongoing pursuit, not a finite destination. But we believe that if you answer each terrifying question, the output is product-market fit.</p>

 Episode 3: The&nbsp;Fallout <p>The news reports were relentless. Every channel, every website, screamed about the John Doe Wealth data breach. “Millions Exposed,” “Financial Chaos,” “Lawsuits Loom.” Mark stared at the television screen in his now-empty office, the vibrant city lights outside mocking his despair. His initial surge of ambition after securing Victoria’s investment had evaporated, replaced by a gnawing dread. Victoria’s words, “Trust is earned, Mark, and it’s a fragile thing,” echoed in his mind. He had earned trust, and now, through no direct fault of his own, it was crumbling.</p><p>The breach wasn’t just a headline; it was a personal catastrophe. Clients he had painstakingly cultivated, people who had entrusted him with their livelihoods, were now victims. He’d received frantic calls, tearful voicemails, and even a few angry threats. The weight of responsibility, heavier than ever, threatened to crush&nbsp;him.</p><p>He hadn’t slept in days, haunted by images of his clients’ faces, their anxieties mirroring his own. He knew he had to do something, anything, to try and mitigate the damage. But what? He was just one advisor in a vast, crumbling system.</p><p>Driven by a desperate need to understand how things could have gone so horribly wrong, Mark delved deeper into the breach’s origins. He spent hours poring over leaked internal documents, technical reports, and cybersecurity analyses. What he discovered was far more disturbing than he had imagined.</p><p>It wasn’t just lax security at the third-party vendor. It was systemic complacency within John Doe Wealth itself. The documents revealed a pattern of ignored warnings, budget cuts to cybersecurity, and a general attitude of “it won’t happen to us.” Mark found emails where his own concerns about the vendor’s data access had been dismissed by senior management as “alarmist.” There were memos detailing known vulnerabilities in the company’s systems, vulnerabilities that had been patched superficially, if at&nbsp;all.</p><p>He discovered that the data analytics firm, the supposed source of the breach, had flagged their own security concerns to John Doe months prior. They had even offered to implement enhanced security measures, but John Doe had balked at the cost. They had prioritized profit over protection, short-term gains over long-term security.</p><p>The picture emerging was one of gross negligence, a culture of indifference to client data security. Mark felt a wave of nausea. He had been part of this system, profiting from it, blind to its&nbsp;rot.</p><p>He thought back to his father, working tirelessly to provide for his family. He thought of his own struggles, his relentless climb to success. Had it all been for nothing? Had he built his career on a foundation of lies and&nbsp;deceit?</p><p>The phone rang, jolting him from his thoughts. It was Victoria. Her voice was grave. “Mark, I need to see you. Immediately.”</p><p>He knew what this meant. The fallout was reaching the highest levels. His carefully constructed world was about to implode. As he walked towards Victoria’s office, he felt a strange sense of calm. The fear was still there, but it was mixed with a newfound resolve. He couldn’t undo what had happened, but he could expose the truth. He owed it to his clients, to himself, and to the memory of his father, who had always taught him the importance of integrity. What could possibly go wrong? He was about to find&nbsp;out.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>Ever wished for a messaging app that truly prioritized your privacy? Meet Chatstr, a new project designed with exactly that in mind. We chatted with one of the brains behind Chatstr, developer JSKitty, to get the inside scoop on this exciting new&nbsp;app.</p> Chatstr’s debut was rather unexpected. What’s the story behind the messaging app? <p>The concept behind Chatstr is something me and another community member have dreamt about for at least the last 6 years, but previously never had the skills or resources to achieve. I set out a personal hobby challenge in January to code one myself, mostly for learning and personal purposes, but I realized the idea could benefit far more than just myself, and we decided to make it a full&nbsp;venture.</p> What specific privacy challenges in existing messaging apps inspired you to create Chatstr? Were there particular use cases you had in&nbsp;mind? <p>The long answer is in our <a href="https://github.com/JSKitty/Chatstr?tab=readme-ov-file#purpose">Purpose/Vision document</a>, the short answer is: proprietary comms apps are full of backdoors, closed code, and sketchy encryption systems that compromise anyone looking for genuine security — while on the flip side, the world’s largest ‘privacy apps’, have a below-par user experience to the likes of Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.</p><p>Chatstr is designed to have solid vault-like privacy, without sacrificing the common, fun, enjoyable experience of a well-featured app — of which, many would rather sacrifice their privacy for that thread of convenience.</p> Chatstr aims to be a private messaging app. How does it differentiate itself from other secure messaging apps already available? What unique features or approaches does it&nbsp;offer? <p>One of the biggest private messaging ecosystems is Matrix. Although it has incredible encryption practices, it lacks massively elsewhere:</p>  It scales awfully, with massive resource requirements for only a small set of&nbsp;users.  It leaks metadata, and the only solution is to disable the nicer features.  Its sets of clients are, generally, very buggy, feature-lacking, and inconsistent.  <p>Chatstr’s design fixes all of this from the bottom&nbsp;up.</p> What are your primary goals for Chatstr in terms of user adoption and impact? Do you envision it becoming a mainstream messaging platform, or serving a more niche audience? <p>My personal goal for Chatstr is incredibly simple; become the new Telegram. Telegram’s user experience makes it undoubtedly my favorite messenger of all time. The app is efficient, fast, and contains dozens of useful and fun features by design. It is my #1 inspiration, but without encryption, their entire model relies on “trust me bro”, and that’s not good&nbsp;enough.</p><p>Although Chatstr isn’t designed for a niche audience — as it wraps its encrypted properties in a completely hidden, easy, seamless manner, it isn’t against having one. It’s just designed so that anyone can obtain privacy,&nbsp;easily.</p> Can you describe the technical architecture of Chatstr? How does it utilize PIVX’s blockchain and other technologies to ensure secure and private communication? <p>At the moment, the PIVX blockchain has no involvement in Chatstr — although some of the cryptographic parts of PIVX are supported (such as Login-via-Seed Phrase or BIP39), and potentially more in areas we find feasible, like in-app transfers of PIVX between&nbsp;users.</p><p>Chatstr’s networking is built upon Nostr Protocol, with zero centralised or proprietary components. Everything operates on community-ran Nostr Relays, everything is pure open-source, and Private Messaging contents are encrypted using the <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/17.md">NIP-17</a> standard.</p> What were the biggest technical hurdles you encountered during the development process, and how did you overcome&nbsp;them? <p>One of the difficult things to get right in encrypted contexts is file transfers — which ended up being implemented as a two-layer encryption system in Chatstr. Cross-platform capability is also a difficulty. Chatstr aims to be usable on all major platforms, including desktop and mobile OSs. It took some work, but I managed&nbsp;it!</p> How does Chatstr handle key management and user identity? What security measures are in place to protect user keys and prevent unauthorized access? <p>Much like MPW’s diskless-key setup, Chatstr does not store keys on the disk until you’ve set a 5-digit pin — plus, Chatstr does not store Seed Phrases at all: only the nsec master key derived from the Seed&nbsp;Phrase.</p><p>Once a pin is set, ramped-up Argon2 is used to hash your pin, while ChaCha20 is used to encrypt your nsec&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Even if all of those security layers were broken via physical or remote access to your system, and an attacker accessed your raw nsec — your PIVX stored on the Seed Phrase would remain&nbsp;safe.</p><p>Sadly, your comms would be compromised in such a case; but eventually, a rolling-key exchange will be added to Chatstr, enabling the ability to destroy conversations on-the-fly, and make them irrecoverable, even if your private keys were to be obtained.</p> Scalability is crucial for any messaging app. How do you plan to address scalability challenges as Chatstr’s user base&nbsp;grows? <p>Nostr scales almost infinitely in parallel, thanks to its design and architecture. While users can optionally host their own relays to further improve privacy, it’s not necessary. I am personally offering multiple Nostr Relays for free to Chatstr users as well, and they can use various public-free and paid relays that offer bandwidth use to our users. There are already hundreds of relays, with millions of events handled. Chatstr will utilise this to the&nbsp;fullest.</p><p>In the extreme long-term, if we are truly to compete with Telegram’s size, then it’s possible we could enable a simple ‘Nitro-like’ payment model that grants users extra filesize, bandwidth, and features — while helping us cover the cost of ultra-large relays.</p> What programming languages, frameworks, or development tools did you use to build Chatstr, and why did you choose&nbsp;them? <p>Chatstr was built with love: a pure Rust backend with a WebKit frontend via the Tauri framework. Rust is efficient, secure, and modern, maintaining the horsepower of C/C++ without the drawbacks. WebKit is a powerful and efficient browser engine used as our frontend rendering engine in Chatstr. Tauri is the framework combining the two: enabling cross-compilable apps for all platforms, with an incredibly efficient footprint compared to Electron and its alternatives.</p><p>During the early test releases, Chatstr has consistently used less than 40mb of RAM, some users even reported less than 10mb, a stark contrast to Discord’s &gt;300mb-2gb.</p><p>Chatstr uses hardly any power, and when idling, often near-zero CPU.</p> What future features or functionalities are you planning to add to Chatstr? Are you considering integrating other decentralized technologies or services? <p>At initial release, Chatstr aims to have the majority of non-voice/video features that all messengers have in common: full file transfers, in-app photos and video sharing, live statuses, a beautiful chat interface, and all with absolutely solid privacy and stability.</p><p>After initial release: this list could be unimaginably long, and I have some great ideas, but it’s too early to share them for&nbsp;now.</p><p>Technologically, I’ve been playing with the idea of integrating PIVX Shield in some manner — albeit, struggling with the idea of on-chain messaging, given the eventual possibility of those messages being decrypted, which is something Chatstr combats with its selective relay-based protocol.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>As online content becomes predominantly AI-driven, intellectual property (IP) rights should not be neglected as (human) creators will heavily rely on them. While the main use cases for blockchains revolve around financial applications, one could argue that our everyday lives constantly intersect IPs in different forms. Although the legal framework is abundant, proper recording, monetization and disputes are often a burden for independent creators. Story Protocol aims to create a decentralised framework for IP management, tokenizing it both through NFTs and fungible tokens, allowing creators to register fully programmable IP, that is also recognized and enforced through the traditional judiciary system. Using smart contracts and programmable metadata, Story Protocol ensures proper monetization for creators whenever their IP is used.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jason’s background  Current IP pain points  Tokenizing IP  Story Protocol blockchain  Preventing IP infringement  Story Protocol validators  Interoperability  Onboarding traditional IP to Story Protocol  Story Protocol’s legal framework  Enforcing IP rights on Story Protocol  Hiding or demonetizing on-chain IP  Governance &amp; disputes  Roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/jasonjzhao">Jason Zhao on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/storyprotocol">Story Protocol on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.2.0">2.2.0</a>. In this release, we introduced an additional consensus check on the branch ID of NU6 transactions, along with some important refactors and other improvements.</p>



<p>In order to support the new node and wallet stack that will enable us to deprecate zcashd, this release includes the ability to lookup transaction ids by their transparent inputs and revealed nullifiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This release also includes a number of updates and enhancements to our JSON RPCs such as an updated JSON RPC crate, accessor methods to <code>zebra-rpc</code> requests and responses to enable Zaino to construct and deconstruct these types. We have also included fixes and updates to some RPC methods to closely match zcashd behaviour. The <code>getblock</code> RPC method now returns transaction details at verbosity level 2, the getblockchaininfo method will return the genesis block when zebra has an empty state, and the <code>getrawtransaction</code> output and RPC errors in general are now as close to zcashd we are able to at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can see a full copy of the included changes in the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.2.0">v2.2.0 Release Notes</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,&nbsp;</p><p>January was a month of steady progress, marked by key technical advancements, advancing partnerships, and media coverage. With enhancements to the codebase, ongoing development of future versions, and continued media presence, Panther is gaining momentum and positioning itself as a leader in the privacy and compliance space for DeFi.</p><p>Here are the highlights from January.</p> Technical Progress 

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Panther Protocol’s development continues to move forward at a strong pace, with key enhancements made to the codebase based on <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/changelog/overview-1?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">external testing</a> and <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/learn/security-audits?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">audits</a> from <a href="http://veridise.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Veridise</a>. These updates focus on improving performance, security, and scalability, ensuring a solid foundation for future releases.</p><p>Panther contributors remain focused on advancing the framework that supports <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/zone-manager?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zone Managers</a>, a critical component of Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/start-here/what-is-panther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">architecture</a> designed to <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/compliance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">enhance compliance</a> and <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">confidentiality</a>.</p><p>Additionally, preparations for the forthcoming Canary Network are well on track, with Panther Tech contributors focused on configuring and integrating <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-joins-forces-with-purefi-to-enable-compliance-in-prifi/">PureFi, an official Panther KYC/KYT partner</a> with <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/changelog/overview-1/stage-5?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">EtherSpot’s bundler service</a> on Polygon.&nbsp;</p><p>The controlled testing environment provided by the Canary Network will allow for real-world experimentation with new features, reinforcing Panther’s commitment to innovation and resilience. The Canary Network will be owned and operated by the forthcoming Swiss-based Panther Protocol Foundation (the Foundation), which is expected to form soon.</p><p>With work accelerating, important technical announcements will be coming from the Panther ecosystem in the days ahead. Stay tuned for what’s next.</p> Ecosystem Updates <p></p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>In December, the Panther Protocol Foundation secured agreements with <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/09/2993959/0/en/Panther-Protocol-and-Eurobit-Partner-to-Pioneer-Compliant-and-Confidential-DeFi.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Eurobit</a> and <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/17/2998455/0/en/PureFi-and-Panther-Partner-to-Enable-Privacy-Enhanced-Compliant-On-Chain-Transactions.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi</a> to apply to become Zone Managers. In January, Panther’s ecosystem team actively worked with these partners to establish the necessary infrastructure to support their onboarding. At the same time, these partners worked to refine their own frameworks to effectively use Panther’s core privacy and compliance-enhancing features.&nbsp;</p><p>As these partnerships continue to progress, Panther ecosystem contributors are also focused on attracting additional financial service providers as part of an ongoing effort to expand&nbsp; Panther’s network of Zones.</p> Panther in the Media <p></p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Panther was recently featured on<a href="https://www.cnbcarabia.com/episode/13922?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> CNBC Arabia’s Crypto Weekly</a>, where co-founder Dr. Anish Mohammed acted as spokesperson, discussing key aspects of Panther’s mission. You can catch the interview at 14:50 in the episode. Panther was also quoted twice by <a href="http://cryptonews.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">CryptoNews</a>, highlighting the protocol’s growing recognition with news media. Later in January, Panther was featured on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3McVc6CWU&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">CryptoCoinShow</a>, where Dr. Mohammed outlined Panther’s roadmap for 2025. Panther was also interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx-lILA9zVk&amp;list=PLHfKQ5FrydSB6UsJga1g3_msqqRXvVm76&amp;index=2&amp;t=2063s&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Kirill Ivanov</a>, which included a detailed explanation of Panther’s model and its potential impact on the DeFi space.&nbsp;</p> Conclusion <p>January was a key month for Panther Protocol, with significant technological advancements, new ecosystem developments, and growing media attention. January saw updates to the codebase, along with the progress on future iterations and the Canary Network. Meanwhile, partnerships with Eurobit and PureFi continue to shape Panther’s role as a leader in privacy-enabled compliance for DeFi. As Panther gains momentum, the project is closer than ever to realizing its vision of a confidential and compliant DeFi ecosystem.</p>

  Partnering with Avelios: Healthcare for the Modern Age  <p>Christian, Nicolas, Sebastian and their team are transforming hospital information systems—and improving the lives of doctors and patients alike.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/anas-biad/">Anas Biad</a>	 



Published February 6, 2025
  



Avelios co-founders Christian Albrecht, Nicolas Jakob and Dr. Sebastian Krammer.



 
<p>We’ve all been there. You book a medical appointment and fill out your forms online—but when you arrive, you’re handed a clipboard full of the same questions to answer all over again. And behind the scenes, doctors and staff are also spending valuable time copying and pasting, making their demanding jobs even harder.</p>



<p>It happens because the operating system most hospitals run on was developed in the ‘90s, if not earlier. Data is unstructured; interoperability is non-existent; UIs are anything but user-friendly. The consequences, in terms of both inefficiencies and patient outcomes, are severe. Yet despite decades of technological development, hospital information systems (“HIS”) remain undisrupted. Why? They are incredibly difficult to build.</p>



<p>The typical HIS is a complex and mission-critical web of modules, and the hospitals that run them are highly regulated and understandably risk-averse—which can make launching an HIS company just as grueling as launching the product itself. New companies in this space often revert to simple point solutions that try to integrate with a legacy HIS, instead of the ground-up overhaul healthcare clearly needs.</p>



<p>The team at Munich-based <a href="https://en.avelios.com/">Avelios</a> has seen the challenges up close. During the height of COVID, Dr. Sebastian Krammer spent valuable time counting patients by hand, then reported the results to authorities via fax. And when he and Nicolas Jakob, a software engineer and deep learning expert, tried to expand their promising research on classifying skin conditions with AI, they quickly discovered hospitals’ antiquated systems couldn’t provide the data they needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So they teamed up with Christian Albrecht, a McKinsey alum and previous co-founder with Nicolas, to solve the problem. And instead of “treating the symptoms” by building on top of outdated legacy software, they decided to take the hard path of “treating the cause” and tackle the problem at its core, by building a completely new HIS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, Avelios built a full hospital information system, including documentation (e.g., EHR, medication, operating room management); administration (e.g., billing, staff, clinic management); patient portals; AI solutions, and more. They took a modular approach so they could land in hospitals with one offering before expanding to the full operating system. But then multiple sea changes in the market accelerated their plans:&nbsp;</p>



 
 One of the leading HIS providers announced they would sunset their product in 2027, creating an urgent need for more than 1,000 hospitals to replace their systems. 



 Regulators in Germany and elsewhere responded to problems revealed by COVID-19 with both fines for failing to digitize and funding for modernization. (Germany’s Hospital Future Act, for example, dedicates €4.3B to this.)&nbsp; 



 Demand for AI exploded, putting a spotlight on the difficulties of accessing data and integrating with legacy hospital systems—which are exactly the challenges that Avelios was designed to solve. 
 



<p>Avelios, in other words, is the right team, with the right product, at the right time. As a result, they have already won several of Germany’s largest public and private hospitals.</p>



<p>When we met the team, we were deeply impressed by their ambition, the depth and breadth of the product, the customers they’d won and their revenue growth—and more importantly, that they achieved all of this with just pre-seed funding (!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately for us, Christian, Nicolas, and Sebastian agreed to a partnership, and we are proud to lead this Series A round as they and their <a href="https://avelios-medical.jobs.personio.com/?language=de">fast-growing</a> team work toward their goal of revolutionizing healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an Avelios-powered future, doctors and staff will have the system of record and AI tools they need to make better, more informed decisions. They’ll be able to focus on the reason they got into medicine in the first place—helping people. And their patients will get not only a seamless experience but the best possible care.</p>

<p>This is the 32nd post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Pavel Beloborodov (Senior Software Engineer), and was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (Lead for Privacy Engineering).</p>
<p>Starting with desktop version 1.75, advanced Brave users will be able to write and inject their own scriptlets into a page, allowing for better control over their browsing experience.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Customize a website’s appearance with custom scriptlets</p>
<p>Brave already offers the cleanest and safest out-of-the-box browsing experience of any Web browser. Users get best-in-class 3rd-party ad and tracker blocking, privacy protections, cookie notice blocking, and many other enhancements (read more on our <a>privacy updates</a> blog series). Most importantly, these features are enabled by default, so users get the best possible experience the moment they install Brave. There’s no need to manually install Web extensions (and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-removes-500-malicious-chrome-extensions-from-the-web-store/">take on the risk of malware</a>) or worry about <a>Google’s Manifest V3 changes</a>. With Brave, things just work.</p>
<p>However, some users want the freedom to customize how ads and trackers are blocked in their browser. In addition to offering the ability to write custom filters and <a>subscribe to community-maintained ones</a>, we now support custom scriptlets that enable advanced users to write JavaScript and inject it into any website.</p>

 With great power comes great responsibility 
<p>Adblockers like Brave Shields, <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Resources-Library">uBlock Origin</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/Scriptlets">Adguard</a> already use scriptlets internally for extended blocking capabilities. For instance, they can load a harmless version of a tracking script instead of the real one, maximizing privacy while minimizing breakage. Custom scriptlets bring this same power to Brave users. However, this power requires extreme caution. Only scripts that are confirmed safe should be injected, and for this reason the feature is “gated” behind a Developer mode flag in Shields &gt; Content filtering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Custom scriptlets are stored locally in your browser, and never leave the device.</p>

 How to use custom scriptlets 
 
 On desktop, open the Settings menu. 
 Navigate to the Shields section, then to Content filtering. (Or you can go directly to brave://settings/shields/filters.) 
 Scroll down and enable Developer mode. 
 



    


    



      
      
    
 
 Under Custom scriptlets, click Add new scriptlet and write your JavaScript. Give it a name (note that the custom scriptlet always gets saved with a user- prefix). Then click Save.&nbsp; 
 



    


    



      
      
    
 
 Finally, insert the rule by adding a custom rule for the website you want to modify, and press Save changes. Note that you must use filter rule syntax, which looks something like “example.com##+js(name-of-your-scriptlet.js)”. For more information, <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#scriptlet-injection">see the custom scriptlet technical documentation</a>. 
 



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Once the scriptlet is done, you can visit the website you just modified to see the difference:</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Before: stackoverflow.com without the custom scriptlet</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>After: cleaned up stackoverflow.com with the custom scriptlet which removed the sidebars</p>

 Editing or deleting a custom scriptlet 
<p>You can easily edit or delete your custom scriptlet using the buttons on the right.</p>



    


    



      
      
    

 Another way Brave makes the Web user-first 
<p>By default, Brave prevents fingerprinting while ensuring functionality on websites by <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Fingerprinting-Protections">randomizing the output</a> of many Web APIs. But with custom scriptlets, you could completely disable a Web API on a website you don’t trust. You could also inject a scriptlet to prevent websites from disabling right-click. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Brave prioritizes the user first, in line with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">W3C’s priority of constituencies</a>. Our bet on best-in-class 3rd-party ad and tracker blocking reflects this user-first approach. We initially built custom scriptlets to help us with our own adblock-related debugging, but decided to release it as a feature because it proved so useful. Please give it a try, and tell us what you think on <a href="https://community.brave.com">community.brave.com</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://x.com/brave">social media</a>.</p>

<p>Cloud computing hasn’t seen a fundamental upgrade since Amazon launched EC2 in 2006. Software development is fundamentally changing in the wake of breakthrough LLMs and generative AI. As software development is democratized, deployment and management must follow. We’re excited to be backing (together with <a href="https://www.usv.com/">USV</a>) veteran open source infrastructure developer <a href="https://evanphx.dev/">Evan Phoenix</a> on his journey to change this with&nbsp;<a href="http://miren.dev">Miren</a>.</p><p>Miren is building a modern cloud operating system, purpose-built for this new environment. Miren’s software will allow for hybrid deployments across home/office computers, data centers and existing clouds, creating an integrated, modular ecosystem which gives customers flexibility and reduces lock-in to vendors. This not only increases flexibility and reduces cost but gives customers the ability to easily integrate compute over private &amp; sensitive data without compromising ease of management.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>AI changes deployment needs from two directions: 1) to train/fine-tune models, companies need to run compute workloads on sensitive private local data and 2) with generative AI, development is democratized but deployment is not. Miren meets both these needs with a flexible system that is both designed for scale and is opinionated enough to provide extremely simple deployment &amp; management of code. With genAI apps and individual developers as an initial GTM, Miren can gain adoption from the bottom up and work its way into startups and then large enterprises with promise of easy compliance, lower costs, and maximum flexibility.</p><p>—</p><p>Disclaimer: The information contained in this article has been prepared solely for informational purposes and is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any entity managed by BlueYard Capital (“BlueYard”).

<p>The European Union has long championed itself as a global leader in data privacy, setting stringent standards with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, a recent court ruling has exposed a glaring contradiction: the European Commission, the body responsible for enforcing these rules, has been found guilty of violating them.</p><p>This “privacy paradox” raises serious questions about the EU’s commitment to its own principles and the effectiveness of its data protection framework.</p> The Case: A Breach of&nbsp;Trust <p>The case, which made headlines at the beginning of the year, involved a German citizen who, in March 2022, visited the now-inactive “futuru.europa.eu” website, a platform run by the European Commission. While registering for an event, the individual used the “Sign in with Facebook” option. However, this seemingly innocuous action resulted in the Commission transmitting the individual’s personal data, including their IP address and browser metadata, to Meta’s servers in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>This data transfer violated EU data protection laws, specifically Article 46 of Regulation 2018/1725, which governs the transfer of personal data by EU institutions to third countries. The court found that at the time of the transfer, the US did not ensure an adequate level of protection for EU citizens’ personal data. Moreover, the Commission failed to demonstrate the existence of any appropriate safeguards, such as standard data protection clauses or contractual agreements, that would have legitimized the transfer.</p> The Ruling: A Landmark&nbsp;Decision <p>The General Court of the European Union ruled against the European Commission, ordering them to pay the individual €400 in compensation for the non-material damage caused by the data transfer. This landmark decision marks the first time the Commission has been held liable for infringing EU data protection laws.</p><p>The fact that the very institution tasked with upholding data privacy standards has itself violated them undermines public trust in the EU’s ability to protect personal data. It raises concerns about whether other EU institutions and bodies are also flouting these&nbsp;rules.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>This week, a16z cofounder Ben Horowitz had a rare and invaluable conversation with Dr. Clarence B. Jones, a pivotal figure in American history.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Jones, who served as speechwriter, attorney, and advisor to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., shared his personal insights on race, inclusion, and the lasting legacy of the civil rights movement in 2025.</p><p>In their wide-ranging discussion, Dr. Jones reflected on the timeless wisdom of Dr. King, quoting one of the most enduring lines from the "I Have a Dream" speech: “I want my four children to be judged by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin.”</p><p>“That, to me, is still, that’s the template,” Dr. Jones said. “That still remains a template.”</p><p>Their conversation covered critical themes in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, delving into the history of the movement, the lessons from "Letter from Birmingham Jail," and the profound impact Dr. King’s work continues to have today.</p><p>It was a rare opportunity to hear directly from someone who not only witnessed history but played a key role in shaping it, and we hope you enjoy it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>About Dr. Clarence B. Jones:</p><p>Dr. Clarence B. Jones served as legal counsel, strategic advisor, and draft speechwriter to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from 1960 until Dr. King’s assassination in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. During that time, Dr. King depended on Dr. Jones for legal and strategic counsel and assistance in drafting landmark speeches and public testimony. He is credited with writing the first seven paragraphs of the iconic I Have A Dream speech.&nbsp;</p><p>Across the decades following Dr. King’s assassination in 1968, Clarence B. Jones worked to carry on Dr. King’s legacy, to continue the nonviolent struggle for social justice, voting rights, and democratic inclusion. He is the founder of the Dr. Clarence B. Jones Institute for Social Advocacy, and also serves as the Founding Director Emeritus of the Institute for Nonviolence and Social Justice at the University of San Francisco. Dr. Jones is also the author of three acclaimed books "What Would Martin Say?", "Behind the Dream: The Making of the Speech that Transformed a Nation" and "Last of the Lions".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you think: <a href="https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z">https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z</a></p><p>Ben on X:&nbsp; <a href="http://twitter.com/bhorowitz">http://twitter.com/bhorowitz</a></p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today we’re excited to announce Rerank on Brave Search, a simple yet powerful feature to customize search rankings by boosting or removing domains from search results.</p>
<p>Rerank allows users to tweak the one-size-fits-all ranking of search engines with their own explicit input, providing a more transparent personalization compared to other more opaque forms of personalization that neither help with algorithmic transparency nor user privacy. Rerank is available for free and available for all searches made on <a href="https://search.brave.com/">search.brave.com</a>.</p>

 Make Brave Search your own with Rerank 
<p>The new Rerank feature introduces a panel on the search results page to give individual users more control over the presence and ranking order of the websites they see in Brave Search. The panel lists domains, each with the option to thumbs up (raise) or thumbs down (discard) the domains from the results. From that point forward, raised domains will be boosted higher up in the rankings a user sees, while discarded domains will no longer be included among the results. A domain’s up-rank or down-rank can be adjusted or undone at any time.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<blockquote>
<p>“Rerank enables users to easily adjust search results according to their preferences, explicitly, while being in full control. No opaque personalization is done by unknown algorithms, as Rerank puts users in charge of their search experience.”</p>
<p>– Arjaldo Karaj, VP, Brave Search</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use of Rerank will not change domain presence or ranking for other users or on Brave Search as a whole—Rerank only applies for the users who choose to use the feature, and only on that user’s device. Rerank does this while upholding Brave’s industry-leading privacy promises. Rerank does not track users <a>1</a>, and modifications can be cleared at any time in the search settings.</p>

 When and how to use Rerank 
<p>Rerank expands Brave’s mission of a user-first Web. Use of a search engine is personal and a one-size-fits-all approach isn’t always best. Consider a professional interior designer who scours the Web for inspiration to support their work. They may not get much value from sites that publish content for personal DIY projects. Thanks to Rerank, they can now discard unwanted sites and curate a more tailored set of domains for their professional needs. If that same interior designer is a paid subscriber to some online decor magazines, they could use Rerank to boost results from those sites.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p><a>Answer with AI</a>, the Brave Search generative-AI feature that provides concise answers to question-like queries, will also benefit from Rerank modifications. When changes are made to the user’s own search rankings, Answer with AI will source some (though not all) of the information it uses to generate answers from these newly-modified search results.</p>

 Personalized search at Brave offers multiple options 
<p><a href="https://search.brave.com/help/goggles">Goggles</a>, the technology powering Rerank, were first introduced to Brave Search in <a>June 2022</a>. Goggles gives you a way to create, apply and share custom filters that change the way results are ranked. Examples of Goggles include&nbsp; “News from the left,” “News from the right,” and “Tech blogs”.</p>
<p>Goggles are one of several ways Brave ensures algorithmic transparency and openness in search. We don’t editorialize Brave Search, but all search engines have unique intrinsic biases that result from data and algorithmic choices. Goggles empowers users to counter any intrinsic biases in the algorithm and allows anyone to create search use-cases that may be niche for an all-purpose search engine. The community of Brave Search users can create a Goggle, and “publish” it for any other Brave Search user to use, or even copy-and-modify for their own preferences.</p>
<p>Rerank isn’t a replacement for Goggles, but rather a faster, more accessible way for individual users—regardless of technical ability—to achieve a similar result.</p>
<p>For those interested in switching between pre-made reranking configurations, default Goggles can be applied by navigating to the Goggles tab alongside Images, Videos, and News tabs on the search results page (SERP). Brave also lists popular Goggles, surfaces an <a href="https://search.brave.com/goggles/discover?q=books+about+f1+engineering">open repository of Goggles made by the Brave community</a>, and has <a href="https://search.brave.com/goggles/create">guides for users to make and submit their own</a>.</p>

 About Brave Search 
<p>Brave Search is the fastest growing independent search engine since Bing. Unlike Big Tech search engines, Brave Search doesn’t profile its users. And unlike supposedly alternative engines, Brave Search serves results from an independent index of the Web. This means Brave Search can offer both industry-leading privacy and an effective counter to the bias and censorship prevalent in Big Tech’s personalization.</p>
<p>Brave Search also offers “Answer with AI,” a real-time answer engine which provides AI-powered summaries at the top of the search results page whenever a question-like query is detected, giving users quick, concise information.</p>
<p>Brave Search continues to reach new highs, serving more than 38 million queries per day (and more than 1.2 billion queries each month). It’s the default search engine for most new users of the Brave browser, which now has over 75 million users worldwide.</p>
<p>Brave Search also offers a <a>Search API</a> so that other companies can power their search and AI apps.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Technical note: Rerank changes are stored locally in your browser’s cookie storage (which can be manually cleared at any time) and passed to search via a cookie. Similar to a user’s IP address and any other personally identifiable information, Brave Search does not use this Rerank cookie to track user queries. <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/rerank">Learn more</a>.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

  The Stochastic Mindset  <p>AI tools will change the way we work by changing the way we think.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a>	 



Published January 22, 2025
  



 
<p>Most descriptions of AI’s potential to change how we work are by now familiar: AI will automate repetitive tasks, increase worker impact, improve job satisfaction and disrupt entire industries. But how will using AI tools change the actual experience of work? Will AI change the way we think?</p>



<p>AI is the next era of computing, and one of its hallmarks is moving from deterministic to probabilistic or “stochastic” outputs. As AI spreads, workers are engaging with a new software paradigm that calls for a new mindset. In a recent episode of Sequoia’s Training Data podcast, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/training-data-dust/">Dust co-founder Gabriel Hubert</a> introduced the concept of the “stochastic mindset” as “the biggest shift in the use of the tools that we have since the advent of the computer.”</p>



<p>Randomness and uncertainty are a part of life, but in the context of modern knowledge work we have been trained to optimize for certainty and predictability. The stochastic mindset invites us to move from rote workflows to iterative development of tools, content, strategy and more.</p>



<p>The stochastic mindset moves us from having minimal leverage on a task and 100% certainty of its outcome to 100% leverage on a task and far less certainty on the exact manifestation of its outcome. This transition is the difference between doing something yourself and delegating a task to someone else.&nbsp;</p>



 AI as exoskeleton for work 



<p>The shift to the stochastic mindset shows how the impactful productivity gains from AI will actually be achieved. By making it easier to access and synthesize information, workers will consume and produce&nbsp; much more information. OpenEvidence, Harvey and Dust are examples of products that take the friction out of accessing and making use of relevant information in the context of doctors, lawyers and knowledge workers more generally.</p>



<p>AI expands information through generalization. But it also reduces by summarizing information. In the AI age, there is uncertainty in exactly the message being delivered in exchange for speed and leverage. The quantity of information itself requires probabilistic approaches to manage and infer simplifications.</p>
 



Age of AI (Circa 2023)<br>



 
<p>AI tools provide drafts or suggestions, not definitive answers. They will improve—but always to the point of some probability. Those reading—especially the quantum and stats enthusiasts—will be quick to assert that everything is probabilistic. Fair. But the history of computing has been one darn near determinism. AI is reaching a threshold of scale where being probabilistic is more efficient than being deterministic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What this means for us as workers will be seismic. Our tools imitate us and then we imitate them. If our predominant model of a machine becomes stochastic—embracing randomness—our minds will follow suit. We will adopt a more questioning stance toward the data at hand, realizing it is infused with randomness. Perhaps most importantly, the stochastic mindset can accommodate change and is adapted specifically for change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you’re a founder or a knowledge worker or a student, your future prospects will have a lot to do with how well you adapt to change. Engaging with more uncertain outputs from AI systems, workers will need to strengthen their critical thinking skills. This is not just a short term adaptation resulting from the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate. Our demands on these systems will continue to outstrip their abilities, and for some use cases may become more variable over time, not less. As Ilya Sutskever said about AI reasoning systems in his recent talk at <a href="https://youtu.be/WQQdd6qGxNs?si=pQIZXBZUZDokdiqd&amp;t=867">NeurIps 2024</a>, “the more it reasons the more unpredictable it becomes.”</p>



<p>Dust is an example of a platform making custom agents accessible to non-technical workers. They aim to build “horizontal sandboxes” where workers can create their own agents, assistants and tools. Over time, teams will manage AI agents. As Jensen Huang put it at his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/k82RwXqZHY8?si=6rkGcRuNHoGW41jq&amp;t=2374">CES Keynote</a> this month, “IT teams will become HR departments of AI.” These systems are the record of management and action. Companies like Factory will enable management of coding agents, XBOW will be the management of cybersecurity agents and Rox will provide management of selling agents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of thinking about AI purely in terms of how much opex it will save companies, the stochastic mindset focuses our attention on AI as a power assist—an exoskeleton for work.</p>



 Adapting to 21st century realities 



<p>We can see the stochastic mindset as an evolutionary and adaptive response to the reality of the world in the 21st century. Humanity is faced with increasing levels of social, political, economic and environmental uncertainty. The accelerating speed of change (models/robot/rockets keep getting better/faster/cheaper) also means accelerating volatility.</p>



<p>Fast iteration and execution favors small teams with AI superpowers. The stochastic mindset is also the builder mindset: iterative, experimental, skeptical and data-driven. An intriguing detail that Gabriel reports is that the patterns of usage of Dust within organizations becomes a heat map for identifying builders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stochastic mindset is also the scientific mindset: forming hypotheses and seeking to prove or disprove them. Promoters of AGI and superintelligence (including <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/training-data-harmonic/">Vlad Tenev</a> at <a href="https://harmonic.fun/">Harmonic</a>) have science firmly in their sights. But the bigger consequence of the diffusion of stochastic AI systems may turn out to be the increasing prevalence of scientific thinking among humans.</p>



 Founders need the stochastic mindset 



<p>When people say that product-market fit is as much art as science they are perhaps thinking of science in deterministic terms. Founders have a stochastic learning problem that they confront every day: the changing needs of their customers in a changing world.</p>



<p>Among other things, contemporary founders need the stochastic mindset to take advantage of assumed but unpredictable improvements in AI models. Their teams need to plan product roadmaps in anticipation of what may be possible soon. Founders also now need to engage with research in an open-ended way—uncertainty can also be opportunity.</p>



<p>Part of the stochastic mindset is the ability to understand constraints. Any process has to run in a limited time. Compute resources are limited and so is communication within a given system. All of these factors lead to non-determinism, but the <a href="https://youtu.be/SpP7L6kaTf8?si=2ipcDT_vdYK4YfWX&amp;t=263">constraints on human cognition</a> are notoriously more stringent than those of machines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, by developing their own stochastic approach, founders can solve their customers’ problems too. By infusing the stochastic mindset into their products, founders can help users take advantage of these new capabilities:</p>



 
 Help workers become builders 



 Help students become researchers 



 Help consumers make good choices among complex offerings 



 Help everyone learn to consume AI services productively 
 



 Giving humans more time to think 



<p>A central problem in making AI agents reliable is endowing them with the right guardrails, but their unpredictable nature is also a feature, not just a bug.</p>



<p>Indeed, one of the big takeaways from the story of AlphaGo turned out to be its effect on human Go players. A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2214840120#sec-1">2023 paper</a> on the effect of superhuman artificial intelligence on human decision-making concluded that the novelty in moves by human Go players increased significantly after AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol. As Garry Kaspirov put it, “I was the first knowledge worker whose job was threatened by a machine.” That was back in 1996. Yet the game of chess is far from a relic of the past, it has wider adoption than ever and new techniques. AI is used both as a sparring partner and a coach.</p>



<p>The stochastic mindset is not actually a new way of thinking—though the adoption of AI tools is about to make it much more prevalent. Less line workers and more creative artists and strategic managers. Less programming and more teaching. The stochastic mindset will help make us all more comfortable at a higher level of abstraction. From there we can see AI as both an executor of our intentions and as a teacher. In a world where nothing is certain, adaptability becomes even more valuable, allowing us to navigate through the unpredictable and embrace new possibilities with self-determination and creativity.</p>

<p>In January 2023, Yaron Singer woke up in a suburban Las Vegas Airbnb with the feeling that things were finally on the upswing for his company, Robust Intelligence. The startup was gaining traction as one of the world’s top AI security firms, having developed the industry’s first AI firewall—a model engine that exposed AI safety failures and inaccuracies, protecting AI technology from malicious external threats, and also from making critical mistakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singer believed he was crossing T’s and dotting I’s away from landing one of his biggest clients yet: A leading consulting and systems integration company looking to ink a seven figure, multi-year deal. To celebrate, he was treating his team to a performance of Cirque Du Soleil’s ‘O’ that evening as part of their company offsite. Unfortunately, those death-defying, aquatic acrobatics wouldn’t be the day’s only brush with mortality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emerging from his room, Singer got a call from the managing director of AI for the consulting company—to tie up loose ends, he assumed. Instead, the manager shared the news that their CEO had just returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos where one new technology had dominated the conversation: Large Language Models (LLMs). AI was heading in a new direction—from predictive to generative—and the CEO was worried that Robust’s offerings were no longer relevant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singer quickly realized that this wasn’t about losing one client, this was about potentially losing every client. And yet, in spite of the existential threat this posed to his business, underneath it all Singer felt stirrings of excitement. He had been anticipating an AI watershed moment like this all the way back since his graduate studies at UC Berkeley. If LLMs were about to change the world, Robust Intelligence had the potential to play a meaningful role as a safeguard for the technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now in order to make that happen, Singer and his team needed to adapt their offerings. And they needed to do it quickly.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Singer is the youngest in an Israeli family of academics where everyone—Mom, Dad and sister—have earned PhDs in computer science. There was something of an unspoken expectation that Singer would follow in his family’s well-trodden path, so much so that Singer remembers asking his mother at age six if he too had to get a PhD when he got older. (She laughed and said no. He remembers not being convinced.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>His ambivalence about following in his family’s scholarly footsteps remained until he had an epiphany about academia’s appeal as an undergraduate. “I learned about all these beautiful constructs and systems all the way from math, to theory, to computer science,” Singer says. “To imagine that I could make an everlasting contribution to one of those fields—there’s nothing like it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singer enrolled in a PhD in computer science at UC Berkeley, which is where he first grew curious about startup culture. “I was doing this work on algorithms but what I wanted to do was apply it to the real world,” Singer says. “As an academic, nobody would talk to me, and I needed data. So the only way I could think of was to start a company, implement my algorithm and collect a lot of data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>His company, BIDWAVE, used machine learning and algorithms to determine how users should be compensated for posting ads on social media. But once the system was built, he kept getting wrong answers, revealing a very inconvenient truth about AI: “Everywhere that we have algorithmic decision-making that is taking AI input is extremely vulnerable,” Singer says. The algorithms, he concluded, were in trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singer uses the example of Google Maps: You put in your destination and it finds the fastest route. It does this in two steps: the first relies on machine learning predictions about how long it will take to get to each location, and then once it has that information, it runs an algorithm. “The problem is that the times from one street to another—they’re not the real times, they’re predictions by some AI model, but the algorithm treats that as the truth,” Singer says. If the machine learning models are not exact—“and they’re never exact”—they undermine the quality of the algorithms making decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As he dug in further, Singer saw that there wasn’t just a hole in the market for a product that could keep businesses safe from these issues—there was no market at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meromit Singer, Yaron’s wife, a computational biologist who also completed her PhD in computer science at UC Berkeley, puts her husband’s insight plainly. “He was really the first to realize how dangerous it can be to have all these companies running their machine learning and assuming that the parameters are correct—but they’re not completely correct,” she says. “There’s some error there. And then what guarantees do you have and what vulnerabilities do you have?”</p>



<p>For some, stumbling upon this realization would have been enough to drop out of grad school and immediately pivot into startup mode, but Singer still felt the pull of the ivory tower—this time to the East Coast to teach at Harvard. Ironically, thousands of miles from Silicon Valley, Harvard is where he wound up meeting his future cofounder, Kojin Oshiba, an undergraduate seated in the front row of his graduate seminar.</p>
 







 
<blockquote>
<p>“As an academic, nobody would talk to me, and I needed data. So the only way I could think of was to start a company, implement my algorithm and collect a lot of data.”&nbsp;</p>
Yaron Singer</blockquote>



<p>While Singer was brought up in a household dedicated to computer science, Oshiba was raised in Tokyo by two serious bibliophiles: His father was a librarian and his mother worked in a bookstore. (In fact, Oshiba’s first name comes from the novel, The Wayfarer—which translates in Japanese as Kōjin—after his mother completed her thesis on the book.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>For all of the ways their childhoods were different, Oshiba and Singer shared one very specific experience in common: Both are considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid">Third Culture Kids</a>, a term coined by the American sociologist Ruth Useem which defines the experience of expatriate children who spend their formative years outside of their passport country. Singer had spent part of his childhood living in Colorado where his father was on a teaching sabbatical, while Oshiba spent three years in Canada where his father worked in the East Asian studies department at the University of Montreal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move to Montreal got off to a rocky start. “I went there and I spoke zero English, so I struggled quite a bit for the first year,” Oshiba says. “But after three years I came back, and from there onwards, I felt like I didn’t exactly fit into the Japanese society.” Having had a taste of the wider outside world, Oshiba wanted more—he decided to attend university in America at Harvard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the novelist Graham Greene famously wrote, “There is always one moment in childhood where the door opens and lets the future in.” For Oshiba, this was when he received special permission to take Singer’s graduate seminar and found himself in the front row, staring at the man who would eventually become his cofounder of a company valued at almost a half-billion dollars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singer first took note of Oshiba when Oshiba led an impressive workshop on TensorFlow, the open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Shortly thereafter, Singer and Oshiba began to co-write and publish papers. For his part, Oshiba always felt that Singer respected him as a true collaborator in spite of their gap in experience. “I felt like I was working on a problem with someone who’s obviously very smart and who’s accomplished a lot in his life, but it wasn’t like ‘Kojin, go and implement this.’” Oshiba says. “It was very much incubating ideas together and ‘what do you think? And why don’t we do this?’”</p>



<p>On his end, Singer was coming around to the notion of a life outside of academia. He had been granted tenure early, and with this goal achieved, realized how eager he was to see the practical applications of his research. The time felt right to build a company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of the semester, Singer invited Oshiba into his office to ask him if he wanted to co-found a startup. Oshiba was equally excited by the prospect of collaboration, wherever that might take them. “Before asking any details,” Oshiba remembers, “I said, yes.” Partnership confirmed, Singer and Oshiba were just left with the question of what exactly they wanted to co-found.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>The pair kept coming back to the inconvenient truth about algorithms Singer had stumbled upon years ago at Berkeley—that AIs were fallible, resulting in vulnerabilities and inaccuracies in any algorithms that rely upon them. This led them to a simple, novel concern about AI security: “AI and machine learning, they’re glorified algorithms—like algorithms on steroids,” Oshiba says. “So the activity of identifying limitations in algorithms is identifying limitations in AI.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They set out creating a series of axioms they believed gave their company a purpose: the first, that AI would continue grow at an an exponential pace; the second, that with everything they knew about AI, there was no responsible way to grow the field without developing a way to secure it; and third, the corollary of these would lead the AI security market to eventually evolve into a multi-billion dollar market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was nearing the end of 2019 when Singer created a pitch-cum-pilot program for JP Morgan Chase that revealed the weaknesses in the bank’s use of predictive AI. But Chase turned them down after an engineer on their team concluded there was currently no need for a product like theirs.&nbsp;</p>
 







 
<blockquote>
<p>“AI and machine learning, they’re glorified algorithms—like algorithms on steroids. So the activity of identifying limitations in algorithms is identifying limitations in AI.”</p>
Kojin Oshiba</blockquote>



<p>Around the same time, Singer went to San Francisco to meet with investors, including Bill Coughran, a partner at Sequoia Capital who had been a VP of Engineering at Google. If anyone was going to get the importance of their idea, Singer hoped it would be Bill. “Coming from his role at Google, I felt like Bill knew more about AI than I did,” says Singer, “He didn’t need to be convinced about our assertions that AI will be eating the world, and that it’s a vulnerable technology.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singer was right. Coughran not only became Robust’s first investor, but he also introduced Singer to Chase’s head of AI and Quantum Security, who recognized that even though there might not be an immediate need for an AI firewall, there would be far sooner than most were expecting. In February 2020, he told Singer that he’d have the budget to kick off a program in six months. One month later, Covid-19 shut down the world.</p>



<p>Now, in addition to getting his company off the ground, Singer was also learning how to run it fully remotely, trying to land his first customers in a market besieged by high interest rates and inflation. Finally, in September of 2020, Robust Intelligence landed the first sale of their AI firewall product to Expedia after a cold outreach on LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expedia’s VP of data science was sold on the promise of how Robust’s product could be used for quality assurance, perhaps even more than its value as a security tool. At the time, he had a lot of PhDs in his organization who were terrific researchers but lacked coding expertise, and he believed Robust’s technology could help identify the issues in the models they were building. The only problem—Robust still didn’t actually have a product. They’d used Figma to create a mock-up of the product that looked real. Expedia was willing to partner with Robust despite their product’s nascency because there was simply nothing else like it in the market. “I was like, ‘Shit, now we have to make this work,’” Oshiba remembers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expedia had given Robust sample data that allowed them to test their technology, but not enough to get it working at scale. This left Robust hoping for something that few other startups ever would: a lengthy contract process so that their engineers had runway to perfect the firewall.</p>



<p>At the time, Expedia’s AI models were predictive, or discriminative in nature. They would show a consumer the cost of a hotel or flight, and the prediction of whether or not they would purchase the room or the ticket was AI driven. Robust’s firewall needed to analyze the accuracy of Expedia’s AI’s predictions, while also testing it for vulnerabilities. Thanks to an intensive push, the fledgling startup looked like it was on track to deliver a functional product by the time the contract was signed, but three months before their planned delivery to Expedia they hit another snag. Seven of Robust’s twelve staff members left the company, discouraged by the fact that they’d only managed to win a single customer a year and a half in.</p>



<p>Other founders might have thrown in the towel after this setback, but Singer knew in his core that the AI revolution was just on the horizon. At a picnic table near Robust’s San Francisco office, Singer sat down with Oshiba to confirm whether or not they wanted to recommit to their vision for the company, or if they were going to return money to investors. Both remained all-in.</p>



<p>So with a ‘streamlined’ team of just five employees, Robust Intelligence pushed forward and managed to ship to Expedia on time. Chase soon returned from their pandemic reticence, and then other customers followed suit, including Deloitte, Intuit, the US Government and a certain consulting and systems integration firm who were interested in inking a seven-figure deal. Singer decided it was time to take the team to Vegas to celebrate.</p>

<p>The fateful Vegas phone call finally confirmed the AI inflection point Singer had been waiting for. AI’s ubiquity—and a corresponding uptick in desire to keep it secure—had finally arrived. Up until that point, Robust had been securing predictive AI, like the work they did for Expedia. ChatGPT (and LLMs more broadly) didn’t predict, they generated—creating images and text based on prompts issued by a user. According to Singer, this ultimately deepened AI’s security risks in profound ways. “The leap to extracting personal medical records or tax information is short,” Singer says. “The privacy breach is unprecedented.”</p>



<p>This threat also created an unprecedented opportunity for Robust, assuming they could figure out how to update their offerings fast enough to keep the company afloat. “All the customers were on hold because they weren’t going to be putting any money on non-generative AI and they didn’t know what their product roadmap was going to look like,” Singer says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He proposed a tiger team of two engineers that Oshiba would lead, with the goal of having a working generative AI Firewall prototype within six weeks. Then they would implement a constant six week release cycle, adding more and more test cases, protection mechanisms (and staff) with every new iteration. Within six months, the entire company was focused on building the guardrails that could keep LLMs safe for companies to implement.</p>



<p>Singer met their first paying generative AI customer, a Fortune 100 company, at a Cisco conference where they had been invited to speak after word got out about their latest AI firewall. The company signed on for a pilot, which revealed major vulnerabilities in their system. It also led to a discovery: Companies that were deploying generative AI applications were often fine-tuning existing foundational models in an effort to improve accuracy and cost effectiveness, but in the process, they were exposing those models to new security risks. After Robust presented their findings, the company immediately extended their contract.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On December 27th, 2023, The New York Times further corroborated Robust’s value proposition. They sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, alleging that their published work had been used to train chatbots. In 2024, Robust was invited to advise on the lawsuit, and helped to demonstrate the simplicity with which LLMs can be trained on copyrighted materials from the internet, which in turn can make that content accessible to a tech-savvy bad actor. “What our team discovered is that anyone can actually extract complete articles from models like ChatGPT,” Singer says. “Which shows that not only can someone with malicious intent get access to copyrighted material through these models, but that they can also access the data that was used to train these models, which then becomes a huge privacy concern.”</p>



<p>Around the same time, President Biden signed the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence</a>, a growing awareness of what Signer had known for the better part of the last decade: In order to harness the power of AI, you first need to understand its risks and how to keep it secure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robust Intelligence began 2024 very differently than 2023. Instead of losing a major client and having to change their entire product and technology, they were approached with a new opportunity.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Despite their increasing success, Singer could see that LLMs were scaling faster than his company possibly could. In order to have the impact he aspired to, he would have to partner with a larger company. So in the summer of 2024, after receiving three other offers, Singer accepted Cisco’s $400M bid to acquire Robust Intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He views Cisco as precisely the kind of company that can give Robust the necessary support and infrastructure to secure an ever-expanding AI landscape. That infrastructure, powered by a workforce of twenty-five thousand people, creates a step change in terms of Robust’s reach and opportunity. “AI is now being put at the front of Cisco’s focus,” Singer says. “And Robust Intelligence now has the opportunity to lead the charge.”</p>



<p>They are already seeing the returns of this partnership, landing new clients like BMW, who came to Robust for help securing their AI-powered concept car, Dee. This is a security challenge on a completely different scale than, say, securing a travel platform trying to predict if a customer will buy a ticket. As the founding team puts it, “the initial problems we were focused on were these small errors that AI models make that were bad for business but not the end of the world. But a car crashing into a wall—or even companies who are using AI to decide whether to hire someone or not—these really impact people’s lives.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the man who once dreamed of what it would feel like to make a lasting impact in his field (albeit, originally in a more theoretical realm), Singer can’t help but be compelled by Cisco’s centrality in the technology landscape. “Cisco runs the internet, and if every AI application that is running through the internet can be secured through a Robust Intelligence AI firewall, what bigger impact could we have on the world?” he says, adding, “this is the definition of the dream.”&nbsp;</p>
