<p>More than a hundred million people have now had The GPT Moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the moment you realize the earth is moving beneath your feet. The tectonic plates of technology are shifting, and your world is changing in a fundamental way. You begin to dream. You imagine the impact this will have on your life. You begin to play. You start small, but quickly you’re pushing the limits of the machine, feeding it more and more context for increasingly sophisticated queries. You begin to work. With superhuman recall and reasoning at your fingertips, you’re more productive than you’ve ever been. You don’t know how you lived without this. Your heart is filled with joy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is when the second moment strikes. The Uh-Oh Moment. This is the moment you get an email from Compliance. Compliance would like to provide you with a copy of the new AI Usage Policy. It turns out you are a repeat offender. You instinctively move to ask ChatGPT if this policy is retroactive, but quickly realize that this may be yet another violation. Your heart rate increases. You are now sweating. How are you going to get your job done without GPT models? How is your company going to compete? Fear and panic overwhelm you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Relax. Gabe and Winston have your back. Long before you had your GPT Moment, they had theirs. And they’ve been thinking about how to help you ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gabe Pereyra and Winston Weinberg are the founders of <a href="https://www.harvey.ai/">Harvey</a>. Harvey unlocks the power of LLMs at work.</p>



<p>Last year, Harvey became the first company built on top of GPT-4, and ever since then they’ve been making it work for work. Need a custom model? They’re on it. Data segregation? They’re on it. Enterprise security and compliance? They’re on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gabe comes from the bleeding edge of AI research. Winston comes from blue-chip securities and antitrust litigation. Together, they understand both the problem (rote cognitive labor) and the solution (large language models). And experience aside, they are forces of nature—not to mention a true delight to work with.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harvey is starting with the legal market, which is <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/global-legal-services-market">$300Bn+</a> in the U.S. alone. Legal work is the ultimate text-in, text-out business—a bull’s-eye for language models—and Harvey has already begun to make an impact. Harvey helps legal teams find leverage in time-consuming tasks like contract analysis, due diligence and more, allowing them to focus on client relationships and strategic work that truly moves the needle. In February, <a href="https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/news-and-insights/news/ao-announces-exclusive-launch-partnership-with-harvey">Allen &amp; Overy</a> became the first announced enterprise customer. In March, <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-announces-strategic-alliance-with-harvey-positioning-pwcs-legal-business-solutions-at-the-forefront-of-legal-generative-ai.html">PwC</a> announced it was coming on board. More than 15,000 law firms are on the waiting list today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gabe, Winston and their team are running hard to make these early believers successful, and they now have the full force of Sequoia behind them. Today we are thrilled to share that we’ve led Harvey’s Series A.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harvey is the first and best instantiation of a new breed of company: the AI super app. Harvey is in the business of giving people superpowers. First, lawyers. Next, professional services. Eventually, all of knowledge work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at Sequoia are delighted to be in business with Gabe, Winston and the entire team at Harvey. We look forward to helping them unlock the power of LLMs at work and, in doing so, usher in a new era of superhuman productivity.</p>

  Consensus 2023’s main theme will be the convergence of traditional finance and DeFi. CEO Oliver Gale shares his guide to the event.

<p>The imminent convergence of traditional finance and DeFi has created a need to build the foundations to support a shared ecosystem. As the incumbents start to adapt, new technology promises to disrupt the standard models. As the architects of a new financial ecosystem, our responsibility is to build the technical, regulatory, and legal frameworks that support growth and innovation, while safeguarding the true interests of users. This is why, during <a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Consensus 2023,</a> I’m looking forward to participating in the multiple conversations that will arise around this.</p><p>‌‌Here are the main topics that have captured my interest.</p> Setting the Stage for Consensus 2023 <p>Consensus is the world's largest, longest-running and most influential gathering that brings together all sides of crypto, blockchain and Web3 communities. It is often regarded as a prominent event for heavyweight players in the blockchain and crypto industry. If you know where to look, the event agenda itself will reveal critical industry concerns, along with where you might find the most valuable insights.</p><p>‌‌Upon reviewing this year’s, several recurring themes stand out: First and foremost, regulatory compliance is a top concern for everyone. Second, this is predominantly due to an urgency from both the DeFi and TradFi sides to create a clear path for institutions to participate in DeFi.</p><p>‌‌The aftermath of this tumultuous year in crypto will determine who is fully established and prepared to integrate with the blockchain industry. As an example, the panel, "<a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-crypto-is-still-inevitable-65?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Crypto is (Still) Inevitable</a>," by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanselkis?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ryan Selkis</a>, CEO of <a href="https://messari.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Messari</a> –a leading DeFi data analytics firm– will delve into the arguments for and against crypto’s proposed solutions. Messari's research reports and data have provided strong guidance for builders, investors, and stakeholders within Web3, and Selkis' talk will likely offer a data-driven analysis of the evolution of DeFi.</p><p>‌‌Another topic of conversation that will doubtlessly be present everywhere is characterized as “government overreach." The topic is gaining traction as the discontent from the sector against the regulatory angles pursued by governments grows. On that note, former U.S. CFTC Chairman <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/About/Commissioners/JChristopherGiancarlo/index.htm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">J. Christopher Giancarlo</a> (who advocated for a "do no harm" approach to crypto regulation) is set to provide a starting point to discuss the future of money and the value of sovereign and non-sovereign digital currencies.</p> Innovating Compliance and Regulations <p>‌‌One topic I’m particularly interested in Consensus 2023, is the role of compliant-friendly data protection solutions.</p><p>‌‌<a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Consumers still require privacy in their transactions</a>, and privacy is a major trust driver in technology. As privacy-unfriendly CBDC solutions loom in the horizon and the global macroeconomic landscape shifts, Zero-Knowledge technology is naturally emerging as a way to preserve user privacy while retaining compliance, allowing parties to prove the authenticity of information without revealing the information itself.</p><p>‌‌<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/04/19/zero-knowledge-proofs-use-cases-for-businesses/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ZK technology</a> can be leveraged for many other use cases, such as blockchain scalability and (as stated) privacy, but I suspect the most interesting conversations will revolve around its use for compliance. The US and other jurisdictions have already taken note of this potential use case, and the ball is now on the DeFi industry’s court to propose and educate regulators on solutions to adopt it.</p> Consensus 2023 And Institutional Capital <p>As institutions find their way into DeFi, some conversations also will naturally begin to shift towards the approach they should follow once in.</p><p>‌‌The Consensus 2023 panel "<a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-where-does-tradfi-go-from-herea-recalibrating-the-risks-and-opportunities-34?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Where Does TradFi Go From Here? Recalibrating the Risks and Opportunities</a>" will aim to provide insights that can guide institutional investors on how they can ensure their investments in cryptocurrencies align with their risk appetite and investment objectives. Dawn Harflinger, Matt Halstead, and Dan Tapiero will spearhead this talk, alongside moderator Joe Marenda, Global Head of Digital Assets Investing at Cambridge Associates. As experienced investors who have effectively managed and allocated billions of dollars in capital, I'm interested in hearing the perspectives they've gained through navigating the present investment landscape.</p> Collaborating for a Unified Future <p>‌‌As the industry continues to evolve, early adopters who establish strong networks and relationships will find themselves at the forefront of shaping the future of finance. The successful integration of traditional finance and DeFi requires not only a technically secure infrastructure and self-governing identity solutions but also direct engagement and collaboration among all stakeholders and participants.</p><p>‌‌As we navigate through a tumultuous year and the end of a seemingly long crypto winter, we stand at a crossroads. The decisions we make now will pave the way for a much-needed wave of adoption. It is often said that bear markets are the breeding ground for builders, and witnessing the evolution of conferences like Consensus from their early days only reinforces this notion.</p><p>‌‌By fostering open dialogue, embracing innovation, and working together, we can create a unified ecosystem that is both accessible and secure. I look forward to coming together, sharing ideas, and forge the connections necessary to drive the industry forward, ultimately shaping the future of finance for the better.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a chain-agnostic privacy layer that allows users to access DeFi privately and compliantly. Its users can execute transactions and deploy assets across DeFi. Panther’s <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/cryptographic-primitives">zero-knowledge primitives</a> are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p>Users access Panther’s privacy by depositing assets from different chains into <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/multi-asset-shielded-pools">Multi-Assed Shielded Pools</a> (MASPs or simply <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools">Shielded Pools</a>). Shielded Pools exist in different chains, interconnected by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/zbridges">zBridges</a>. Using <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors">DeFi Adaptors</a>, users can also deploy their assets into DeFi dApps/Protocols, or they can transact with and swap them privately within MASPs.Since Panther’s privacy is enabled by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/cryptographic-primitives">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, users can disclose any part or the whole of their transaction history to anyone at will. They can also choose to withdraw their assets from MASPs into stealth addresses.

 Part 1: Intentional product design around multi-wallet user experiences <p>At <a href="http://privy.io">Privy</a>, we build simple tools to help you onboard and engage your users in web3. In this series, we break down some of the work it takes to create simple experiences with state of the art tooling in&nbsp;web3.</p><p>We spend a lot of time thinking about the user experience surrounding user activation, and in particular connecting wallets to&nbsp;apps.</p><blockquote>Wallets enable true self-custody, but often at the cost of confusing UX.</blockquote><p>To that end, Privy strives to make wallet flows more intuitive for end users, and easier to manage for developers.</p><p>In this post, we’ll see that there is a lot of state complexity in this domain: users can enter the connection flow from many different states, and the wallet can be disconnected or switched from outside of the app&nbsp;context!</p><p>Let’s dive into a concrete example and see how Privy solves for it carefully. At a high-level, our heuristics are:</p>  Wallets integrations should work, independently of what state the user comes in&nbsp;with.  Wallets integrations should account for state changes within the wallet&nbsp;client.  Wallet integrations should provide UIs to help the user understand what to do to get to a desired state, when necessary.  <p>Today we’re going to zoom into a particularly subtle issue around MetaMask connections in a multi-wallet world, that behaves differently based on the user having zero, one or more accounts connected in MetaMask, and also which is the primary selected&nbsp;one.</p>The privy SDK allows multiple wallets to be linked to one&nbsp;user Down the rabbithole <p>First, let’s define some terms and some context. The Privy Auth SDK allows users to link multiple wallets to their user account. This is a very useful feature that customers love, but it comes with a slew of subtle edge cases we need to handle carefully.</p><p>Why is it so subtle? Like a lot of hard programming problems, it’s due to non-trivial state. Wallets can&nbsp;be:</p>  Connected. The official documentation defines it (<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193">EIP-1193</a>) as follows: “The Provider is said to be “connected” when it can service RPC requests to at least one&nbsp;chain.”  Linked. This means authenticated in the privy SDK. With wallets, it means the user has actually signed a message (using <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361">EIP-4361</a>: SIWE).  Active. This is a concept of the Privy SDK. This is the wallet which the developer wants to use to take an on-chain action (like signing, sending ETH, or performing a transaction).  <p>Likewise, we should distinguish between</p>  Wallet addresses. The actual public address for an account on-chain. For instance 0x1dA4FDf7029bDf8ff11f28141a659f6563940642 or pushix.eth.  Wallet clients. The software provider helping users manage their keys, typically what people mean by “wallet”, for instance MetaMask, Phantom or Coinbase&nbsp;wallet.  <p>In addition to the above SDK state (connected-linked-active), wallet clients can have their own wallet state. Most of them, like shown in MetaMask in the below image, have a “primary” selected wallet at any given&nbsp;time.</p>MetaMask’s “selected” wallet<p>A given wallet address (e.g. pushix.eth) can be provided by different wallet clients — by importing the seed phrase — for example by both MetaMask or Coinbase wallet, each of which has subtle differences! The relationship between clients and addresses is therefore many-to-many. If this is still confusing, go check out <a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@nichochar/blockchain-accounts">this short explanation</a> on wallets and external accounts.</p><p>We can start to see the state complexity appear! Wallets can be linked but not connected, connected but not linked, both, active or not, across different clients,&nbsp;etc…</p> Sweating the&nbsp;details <p>Authentication in a multi-modal world (email, phone, wallets) can be tricky business, but is the only way to build rich and engaging experiences, so it’s worth the pain. Let’s shed some light on this by taking an example user story: let’s imagine we’re building an NFT marketplace app which allows users to link wallets together to display the user’s aggregate NFT gallery, but also allows users to mint or purchase NFTs to one of their connected wallets.</p><p>Session 1</p>  User signs up with address1 with the wallet client&nbsp;MetaMask  User links a phone, to take advantage of Privy’s mobile SMS login flows and log in on their phone later (where they do not have MetaMask installed)  The app encourages the user to link more wallets, for a richer gallery profile -&gt; user links address2 with&nbsp;MetaMask   Session 2   User is on mobile, uses their phone number to login, shows off their gallery to a friend on the go. This experience doesn’t involve their&nbsp;wallet.   Session 3   User is on Desktop again, has used SMS to login again, and wants to perform an on-chain action (purchase a sweet new NFT). This requires a wallet to be not only linked to their account (which is already the case), but also connected to the current&nbsp;app.  The developer was intentional here, and wants to connect a specific wallet: address1, not any wallet (maybe because of some on-chain properties of that wallet: it is on a whitelist which allows it to perform a gated transaction).  They call Privy’s setActiveWallet(address1) function, which ensures that the user will connect that specific address and return an ethers or web3 provider to handle the transaction logic.  <p>OK, now that we have this story in place, let’s look at some nuanced state combinations which can happen, and how Privy handles them with&nbsp;care.</p> Case 1: Target address is connected to the site and selected in the wallet&nbsp;client. <p>The happy path! The user’s metamask is already connected to the site, and is also the selected wallet in metamask, this means that eth_requestAccounts returns this address, and sending transactions through window.ethereum will forward to that&nbsp;one.</p><p>This is the easy case! And this is what happens in a non-multi-wallet world most of the time. This just works, so we’ll keep looking at harder&nbsp;ones.</p> Case 2: Target address is connected to the site, but not selected in the wallet&nbsp;client. <p>The user’s metamask is connected to the site, but with the wrong address. So the developer is calling setActive(address1) but the user has address2 as the “selected” wallet in metamask. In this case, Privy’s SDK will nudge the user to switch the wallet in MetaMask, and MetaMask’s UI is quite helpful and intuitive.</p>MetaMask makes it easy to connect another address if at least one is already connected<p>In this case, since MetaMask’s UI is acceptable, so Privy simply gives the user a helpful hint and they can do the switch on their own. This is surprisingly manageable for people that have multiple MetaMask addresses, probably because they are in the habit of switching them like this&nbsp;already.</p> Case 3: Target address is not connected to the&nbsp;site. <p>The user’s metamask has no addresses connected to the current site. This could happen for a multitude of reasons, first of which is that users can choose to disconnect sites independently, at any time, from MetaMask directly (we love user control, this is a good&nbsp;thing!).</p><p>Unlike in case 2, MetaMask does not do a good job of connecting an address to the site from the extension, if no address is connected. The user has to know about an obscure flow, shown&nbsp;below:</p>This mysterious flow to connect from the MetaMask client directly when no wallet is connected is&nbsp;*hard*<p>In practice, little to no one knows about this flow, meaning users are unable to connect to the&nbsp;site.</p><p>Privy adds a <a href="https://littlebigdetails.com/">little big detail</a> for this case, and only this one, which gives the user the option to open the account picker and select the intended address1 and connect it. See&nbsp;below:</p>This will only show up in this specific&nbsp;case<p>Privy goes further to make sure that the user indeed connects address1 and not another one, and gives the user feedback to help them through if they didn’t. This is to compensate for the lack of more powerful APIs in MetaMask: they don’t give the option to connect address1 directly, but only open the account picker, so the user can choose which account to connect. Sometimes, it is great to give the user the choice, but other times — like in the example above where we seek to specifically connect address because of its on-chain properties — developers want more control. See the flow&nbsp;below</p>What if the user gets it wrong and selects another wallet than the intended one from the developer?Privy to the&nbsp;rescue!<p>This example shows but one, small and rare edge case, that a good connector (like Privy) can optimize and make more usable. There are many more such examples of sweating the details in Privy. Privy’s mission is to make onboarding to web3 easier for all users, meeting them where they are in their web3&nbsp;journey.</p><p>As we saw in this post, there is a lot more nuanced complexity that needs to be handled than meets the eye when it comes to web3 connection &amp; authentication flows.</p><p>To be clear, wallets are a core piece of infrastructure and as such, should be treated with care and built around standards (and great work is being done here by the likes of CASA, Spruce and others). Nonetheless, our users’ lives should be simple, regardless of how they connect to the applications we&nbsp;build.</p><blockquote>It’s easy to only think about the happy path and ignore rarer ones that degrade user experience.</blockquote><p>Privy spends a great deal of time optimizing for these and making them as usable as possible for end users, no matter where they are in their web3 journey. Progressive onboarding means meeting users where they are, and often that means smoothing out the UX of these edge case&nbsp;flows.</p><p>You can play around with this yourself at <a href="https://demo.privy.io">https://demo.privy.io</a></p><p>If you are building an awesome web3 product and want to focus on your business domain, not the long and complex tail of web3 Auth edge cases like this one, Privy is here to help!

							<p></p>
<p><a href="https://rkyv.org">Rkyv</a> is a data format and (de)serialization framework for Rust that “implements total zero-copy deserialization, which guarantees that no data is copied during deserialization and no work is done to deserialize data. It achieves this by structuring its encoded representation so that it is the same as the in-memory representation of the source type.” (Source: <a href="https://rkyv.org/zero-copy-deserialization.html#total-zero-copy">rkyv.org</a>)</p>
<p>Zebra and zcashd currently provide JSON-RPC methods that accept/return<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON"> JSON</a>-encoded Zcash consensus-serialized data for historical and compatibility reasons. Where there isn’t a Zcash consensus serialization, RPCs serialize data in internal zcashd formats before it is JSON-encoded. JSON is widely-supported, flexible, and human-readable, but lacks type-checking and is relatively slow to encode/decode.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6313">PR #6313</a>, a “rkyv-serialization” feature was added to Zebra with a new “rkyv_listen_addr” config field for starting a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/datacake-rpc">datacake</a> RPC server that accepts/returns data in the rkyv format.</p>
<p>The datacake RPC methods route to the same RpcImpl and GetBlockTemplateRpcImpl methods provided by Zebra’s JSON-RPC server, except they use the rkyv data format for quicker transformations to and from Zebra’s internal in-memory representation of the source type. Clients calling RPC methods from a Rust environment can import the request/response types paired with message handlers from zebra-rpc and let the Rust compiler check correct usage.</p>
<p>Rkyv <a href="https://github.com/djkoloski/rust_serialization_benchmark">performs very well in benchmarks</a>, (de)serializing over 100x faster than serde_json, and appears to be the most usable, versatile crate for zero-copy deserialization. Validating data with bytecheck can make a big difference, this could be optional if Zebra supports rkyv in the future.</p>
<p>Clients calling RPC methods from a Rust environment can reap the performance benefits from a data format that matches Zebra’s internal in-memory representation of source types. Clients in other languages can also use Zebra’s Rust libraries to deserialize rkyv RPCs.</p>
<p>There are also other excellent frameworks for serializing data (e.g. protobufs, flatbuffers) with better support for other programming languages. Ideally Zebra could expose its RPC methods via multiple encodings and protocols in the future by decoding/encoding request data according to ‘Content-Type’/‘Accept’ headers so clients can call methods from whatever environment they’re already using or which best meet their needs. A GraphQL server that exchanges JSON data may also be nice for making it easier to get started developing with Zebra.</p>

<p>San Francisco, California, USA – <a href="http://www.xrsi.org">XR Safety Initiative(XRSI)</a>, a global leader in privacy, safety, and security in immersive and emerging technologies, today announces its strong support for the Kids PRIVACY Act, recently reintroduced by the U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor (FL14). The legislation aims to update the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and implement more robust protections to keep children and teenagers safe online while holding Big Tech companies accountable for their surveillance and targeting of young users.</p>



<p>“Children are spending more time online than ever before, and it’s time that Congress address the evolving online landscape, especially the tracking and data gathering that has vastly outpaced online privacy protections for kids,” said Rep. Castor. “I’m proud to reintroduce my Kids PRIVACY Act, endorsed by parents, safety advocates and pediatricians to update COPPA, protect children online, and hold Big Tech accountable. Parents and families deserve a 21st century privacy law that can contend with a 21st century internet. Companies continue to knowingly target kids, and it is past time they are penalized for violating privacy protections. Let’s come to the table, Democrats and Republicans, to strengthen protections for our youngest neighbors and bring these safeguards into modern day.”</p>



<p>Kavya Pearlman, Founder and CEO of XR Safety Initiative, stated, “In this age of rapid technological advancement, it is crucial to ensure the privacy and safety of our children and teenagers. We commend Rep. Castor for her unwavering commitment to protecting young people in the digital world. The Kids PRIVACY Act is a vital step toward ensuring that the best interests of children and teenagers are at the forefront of service design and that their privacy rights are respected.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The Kids PRIVACY Act expands privacy protections for children and teenagers by:</p>



 
 Banning Companies from Providing Targeted Advertisements to Children and Teenagers: Prohibits companies from targeting children and teenagers based on their personal information and behavior. 



 Best Interests of Children and Teenagers: Requires an operator to make the best interests of children and teenagers a primary design consideration when designing its service. 



 Requiring Opt-In Consent for all Individuals Under 18: Companies must obtain specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent before collecting, retaining, selling, sharing, or using a young consumer or child’s personal information. 



 Creating a Right to Access, Correct, and Delete Personal Information: Companies must provide individuals the opportunity to access, correct, or delete their personal information at any time. 



 Protecting Additional Types of Information: Expands the type of information explicitly covered to include physical characteristics, biometric information, health information, education information, contents of messages and calls, browsing and search history, geolocation information, and latent audio or visual recordings. 



 Requiring User-Friendly Privacy Policies: Companies must make publicly available privacy policies that are clear, easily understood, and written in plain and concise language. 



 Creating a Protected Class of “Teenagers” Ages 13-17: For the first time in statute, the bill provides protection for teenagers 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it. 



 Expands Coverage of Companies: Applies to all sites likely to be accessed by children and teens, not just child-directed services. 



 Limiting Disclosure to Third Parties: The bill prohibits companies from sharing personal information without consent. Furthermore, it creates additional duties companies must comply with before disclosing any personal information with third parties. 



 Requiring Reasonable Data Security Policies, Practices, and Procedures: Requires companies to have a written security policy, point of contact for information security management and processes to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities. 



 Prohibiting Industry Self-Regulation: Repeals dangerous safe harbor provisions that allow for lax enforcement and rubber stamping of potentially unlawful practices. 



 Strengthening FTC Enforcement: Raises the maximum allowable civil penalty per violation by 50 percent and allows the FTC to pursue punitive damages. Also establishes a Youth Privacy and Marketing Division at the FTC. 



 Providing for Parental Enforcement: Parents will be able to bring civil actions to help enforce the bill and any resulting regulations. 



 Banning Forced Arbitration: In a much-needed reversal of current law, companies will no longer be able force their consumers to waive their right to sue.

 Introducing Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) — The Revolutionary Layer 0/1 Protocol Launches its Most Anticipated Mainnet&nbsp;Upgrade  After years of hard work and dedication, on the fifth anniversary, the worldwide Verus community is excited to announce the launch of the highly anticipated mainnet upgrade on May 21. The Public Blockchains as a Service release marks a major milestone for Verus and the entire cryptocurrency industry.  ⏱️ PBaaS activation: block height 2,546,600 (Sunday 21 May&nbsp;2023) <p>Upgrade to this release or a later version v1.0.0-x, before MAY 21, 2023 to stay reliably connected to mainnet. <a href="http://www.verus.io/wallet">Download here</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>Testnet release will allow you to connect to the new testnet, which we see as a core development platform and staging area for the Verus PBaaS network and have no plans to reset in any foreseeable future.</p><p>Read the release notes on GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CLI</a> 🔗 and <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.0">GUI</a>&nbsp;🔗</p> Turning the Crypto Industry on its&nbsp;Head <p>The wide cryptocurrency industry will see how much better Verus PBaaS is as a solution for true decentralization in cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, on-chain P2P exchange, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, scale, or just about any of the challenges people have on crypto platforms today. In fact, as we prepare for activation of this protocol that enables so many new use cases for crypto, not to mention easy onboarding when entrepreneurs discover how to really leverage VerusIDs, PBaaS is so far beyond what people are experiencing on any crypto platform today that it has been easy to dismiss our community as describing the impossible.</p><p>Once PBaaS is live on mainnet and people can actually use all of this themselves, along with every project, chain and currency on the PBaaS network and EVERY ERC20 or ERC721 on Ethereum or even bridged to Ethereum, the truth of Verus will be self-evident, and those who build on Verus will more easily build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs that do not need business deals, permission, or any centralized infrastructure to connect services and users, enabling everyone to communicate in provable, private, or public ways that always include bidirectional, secure commerce of all&nbsp;kinds.</p> Core Capabilities <p>The core capabilities of this release include (lots to learn to understand it all, but here’s a partial&nbsp;list):</p> Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP) — Layer 0 Multichain and Inter-chain Protocol <p>To our knowledge, the VIP protocol is the only fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology available on any network that is based on cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. From what we’ve been able to learn about LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, Thorchain or others, VIP is different from (though closest in some ways to LayerZero), superior to, and more decentralized than all other cross-chain protocols we have seen. We can of course get into any level of discussion on the topic, but expect more descriptions and educational material to follow, now that the protocol was originally conceived of 5 years ago, and has been developed and tested/hardened for&nbsp;years.</p> VerusID Content Multimaps — Unlimited Provable Data for Every&nbsp;VerusID <p>Of course this upgrade retains all of the groundbreaking capabilities already available with VerusID, including multisig options, separate revocation and recovery authorities for maximum security to prevent theft of identity or funds, and the ability to timelock your ID, enabling you to even thwart attempts to access your funds after someone compromised your secret&nbsp;keys.</p><p>With the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs also gain a powerful new capability that amounts to an unlimited, rent-free indexed database for every VerusID on every blockchain of the PBaaS network. This data can be encrypted or published in the clear and used for any purpose or application, whether social networking, voting, oracles, publishing any information, various forms of provable attestations, ratings, and much, much more. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. We don’t believe anything else even comes close, and with the recent rise of AI, it feels great to have this come together as a core original goal at a very appropriate and important time in&nbsp;history.</p> Permissionless Chain, Token, and Liquidity Basket Currency&nbsp;Launches <p>Whether you are looking to crowdfund an effort in a manner much like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, sell identities to which you expect to add value or that are sub-IDs of a very cool root ID, or launch an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with all of the Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1, Verus is probably the best platform for you. In fact, as we were planning for the next testnet and wanted to have our own version of DAI to use in the bridge, since we want only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge, we used a command to launch a token on the old testnet, exported it and all its supply to Ethereum’s Goerli on the existing bridge, and that will be the DAI proxy/simulant that we will use on the new testnet. It saved us all some time, proving that Verus PBaaS will also be the easiest, most efficient way to launch even an Ethereum ERC20, whether that ERC20 represents a token, DeFi basket, or even another PBaaS blockchain</p><p>Verus enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched&nbsp;it.</p><p>All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus&nbsp;network.</p><p>Verus also enables any ID owner to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners, stakers, and liquidity providers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.</p> Decentralized Ethereum&nbsp;Bridge <p>Shortly after PBaaS activates on mainnet, the Ethereum bridge will launch as a decentralized gateway and 1:1 provably mapped currency called “vETH” on the Verus network, also available to all PBaaS chains. The Ethereum bridge will also include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will have the following functions:</p>  Auto conversion of fees from Verus &lt;-&gt; Ethereum when sending cross chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket  Permissionless ability to register *.vETH IDs, which in addition to the normal sub-ID capability of creating a single token that has control over the ID and can be exported to Ethereum as an automatic ERC721 NFT, can alternately be used to create a “mapped currency”, which can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting it to the vETH bridge. Only Verus root IDs, and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a&nbsp;gateway.  Decentralized, fair bridge launch. The vETH bridge will launch as other currencies, chains, and gateways can launch, including the bridge converter. When the bridge launches, the contracts will have a surplus of Verus that comes from the fees paid to launch the gateway. In the protocol, that surplus is first used to solve the chicken and egg problem of none of one currency on the other chain. The contracts will cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches, the liquidity basket becomes active, and the bridge recognizes that launch. Once that happens, the remainder of ½ the fees (5000 VRSC) that are left over from the launch and did not go to miners and stakers or pay Verus fees for people sending from Ethereum.   The Verus Fee Pool and&nbsp;Rewards <p>Another technology and solution unique to Verus, the Verus Fee Pool technology goes live with PBaaS. What this means is that as people use the cross-chain, DeFi, or purchase/register IDs on the network, the miner or staker will put all fees into the on-chain “fee pool”, and then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This gives everyone incentive to still prioritize transactions based on fees, while preventing validators from gaming the fee system by washing fees-in vs. fees-out or working to reorg/rewind to capture a particularly juicy block reward. Instead, this technology aligns all validator incentives with the health/proper operation of the network and creates a circular on-chain economy that can last well beyond block&nbsp;rewards.</p> To know more about Verus PBaaS capabilities <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-announces-new-multicurrency-multichain-defi-protocols-and-immediate-public-availability-of-f1868f259ce5">read this article</a>&nbsp;🔗  A Historic Move&nbsp;Forward <p>For those who actually understand the challenges actual users have in crypto today, this release represents a historic move forward in public cryptographic networks and credibly and actually neutral infrastructure for society-wide human and AI collaboration and learning. As a community, this version really does realize the vision laid out in the original <a href="https://verus.io/papers/VerusVision.pdf">Verus Vision Paper</a>, and at the same time provides much more than was described there. We are a community of individuals, and it is only because that is what we are that we have all arrived here together. The rest of the world is stuck on their Munchausen’s protocols, trying to figure out how to share the front-running and back-running spoils taken from users, but Verus activation gives them a better path&nbsp;forward.</p><p>As a community, we do not promise, we describe a shared vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases described in the first vision paper together, it is time for each of us to also consider what we might personally want to build or be part of building over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Read the release notes on GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CLI</a> 🔗 and <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.0">GUI</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>Thanks to the incredible combined efforts of so many people in the community ranging from development, companies and projects joining and their open contributions (<a href="https://www.valu.earth">Valu/Arkeytyp</a>, <a href="https://chips.cash">CHIPS</a>, vDEX, <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert</a>, <a href="https://cragslist.hopto.org">cragslist</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joefromthehills/status/1635769270708649988?s=20">Electricty Supply Board of Ireland</a> and more) to community members supporting users to helping educate others who can contribute as well, we have run these protocols now for years as we’ve improved them, and all of these capabilities will go live on the Verus mainnet May 21, 2023, with the activation expected targeting block 2,546,600.</p> Join the community.

 👉 Trend + tips: Token design, beyond tokenomics <p>Guy Wuollet et al</p><p>“Tokens” are a hot-button topic, capturing mindshare not just for those in crypto but for anyone interested in art, design, economics, gaming, math, psychology, and more. And while tokens have been described as everything from a “<a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef">breakthrough in open network design</a>” to a “<a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?lang=en">new digital primitive (analogous to the website</a>)”, we can generally define tokens as: an internet-native unit of value.&nbsp;Importantly, tokens represent not just monetary value — but also social, reputational, and many other forms of value. </p><p>Tokens can be used to coordinate and organize people beyond a purely economic context. That’s why the term “tokenomics” — token + economics — for describing the study and design of tokens is too limited. We need another term to designate “the study of “ tokens (“tokenology” perhaps?) for how to coordinate people, organizations, and/or computation towards a common goal through the use of cryptography and mechanism design.<br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/beyond-tokenomics-tokenology/">read more</a></p><p>Okay; so if tokens are a powerful new primitive that can be defined in many ways — allowing for a very rich design space — it would be great to have <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_roughgarden/status/1522995114062360576?lang=en">the modern equivalent</a> of (what computer scientists refer to as) “the Dragon Book”! The Dragon Book helped turn the impossibly messy, big computer science problem of the 1950s — that is, of compiler design — into a more well-solved problem that could be tackled in stages, by applying rigorous principles at each stage.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s too early to produce such a definitive text on tokens, but some of early token design principles are already becoming clear. And while effective token models will have design elements unique to their specific objectives, most flawed token designs do share a number of common pitfalls. So here’s a list of instructive tips our team has observed, to help builders avoid the most common failure modes:<br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/designing-tokens-sanity-checks-principles-guidance/">read more</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/guywuolletjr/status/1649546737726398465?s=46&amp;t=m_MyW3EHf_hr6YPWeAdbGA">share on Twitter</a> / <a href="https://warpcast.com/guy/0x71889ahttps://warpcast.com/guy/0x71889a">share on Farcaster</a></p><p>related:</p>  <p>▶️ watch: “<a href="https://youtu.be/GOkxDvq_8zQ">Token Design: Mental models, capabilities, and emerging design spaces</a>” (2022) by Eddy Lazzarin</p>  <p>📖 read: “<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/the-web3-playbook-using-token-incentives-to-bootstrap-new-networks/">The web3 Playbook: Using token incentives to bootstrap new networks</a>” (2021) by Chris Dixon&nbsp;</p>  <p>see also: 📖 “<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/reputation-based-systems/">A novel framework for reputation-based tokens</a>” (2021) by Jad Esber and Scott Kominers, on how reputation systems present an opportunity for platforms to recognize (and thus incentivize) participants’ meaningful contributions, including content creation, moderation, community building, and gameplay. </p> 📐Code + theme: More client diversity through open source <p>Noah Citron et al</p><p>A recurring theme in our (and more importantly, the broader crypto community’s) open source efforts is making sure networks have no single point of failure. This helps makes decentralized networks more robust, more secure, and far more resilient than their centralized counterparts. But in practice, we often see potentially vulnerable points of centralization — whether due to specific aspects (like <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-helios-ethereum-light-client/">centralized remote procedure calls</a>), or a lack of independently developed clients.&nbsp;</p><p>Client diversity, in particular, is critical for <a href="https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1553323168521228289">rollups</a>; client diversity is needed on both the execution and consensus sides, but most of the development so far has been focused on execution clients. That’s why we *just released* <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-magi-a-new-rollup-client-for-optimism/">Magi</a> — a fast OP Stack rollup client written in Rust — which acts as the consensus in the traditional execution/ consensus split of Ethereum by feeding new blocks to the execution client, in order to advance the chain. Magi aims to be an independently developed, drop-in replacement for op-node, adding to the rollup’s client diversity; and encouraging greater safety and liveliness throughout the OP Stack via Rust. </p><p>But it also helps bring more contributors into the ecosystem, simply by broadening the developer base with clients in other languages...&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-magi-a-new-rollup-client-for-optimism/">read more</a><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-magi-a-new-rollup-client-for-optimism/"><br></a><a href="https://github.com/a16z/magi">see code base</a><a href="https://github.com/a16z/magi"><br></a><a href="https://twitter.com/eddylazzarin/status/1648703454813241350?s=20">share on Twitter</a> / <a href="https://warpcast.com/ncitron/0x865a57">share on Farcaster</a></p><p>see also: 🎧 “<a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/programming-languages-smart-contract-programming-evolutions">Programming languages &amp; crypto</a>”, with Sam Blackshear, Noah Citron, Eddy Lazzarin, and Sonal Chokshi (2023).

<p>We often take data storage for granted, but the rise of centralised storing facilities (i.e. AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) hangs over like Damocles’ sword. When it comes to blockchains, full nodes store that network’s complete data history. Even if storage costs are set to decrease as technology evolves, so do blockchains accumulate more data over time. An interesting solution would be to create a decentralised backup for blockchain data and Arweave is a prime candidate for it. There is but a missing link represented by uploading and validating different blockchains’ data. This is where KYVE steps in, offering a decentralised validating solution to verify uploaded blockchain data and even retrieve it from Arweave, on demand. This also extends to off-chain data, opening new possibilities for data availability and scalability.</p><p>We were joined by John Letey, founder and CTO of KYVE Network, to discuss the challenges and use cases of decentralised data storage and how blockchain interoperability could benefit from it.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  John’s background  Why KYVE migrated to a Cosmos app-chain  High-level explanation of KYVE  KYVE’s data pools and data streams  How KYVE connects to Arweave  Validating uploaded blockchain data  How Arweave works  KYVE v.2  How slashing is handled  KYVE use cases  Future roadmap  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/johnletey">John Letey on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/KYVENetwork">KYVE Network on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://www.kyve.network/">KYVE Network</a>  <a href="https://arweave.org/">Arweave</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p></p> Horizen EON brings EVM compatibility to the Horizen ecosystem and offers more opportunities for developers and web3 end users.&nbsp; 



 



 TL;DR 



 
 We are thrilled to announce today the launch of <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> (Ethereum Open Network), our first public proof-of-stake and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible smart contracting sidechain, on permanent public testnet <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/status/gobi">Gobi</a>.&nbsp; 
 Horizen partners with Immunefi to launch Gobi Bug Bounty Program to offer up to $75,000 in bounties 
 Gobi Testnet is supported by a network of products, integrations and tools that ensures the rich capability and user-friendliness for EON developers and end users, starting on day one.  
 Gobi Testnet has many improvements and new features since the previous testnets, it is the final beta stage before the EON mainnet activation later this year. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About Horizen EON and What Makes it Different? 
<p>While Ethereum has been driving broad adoption of DeFi ecosystems and smart contracts, Horizen has been developing its cross-chain protocol and horizontal scaling solution, <a href="https://horizen.io/zendoo">Zendoo</a>, that will allow a wider adoption of blockchain technology with full customization at the protocol level. </p>
<p>With the addition of EON, the first of many smart contracting sidechains on Horizen, Horizen is opening up its ecosystem to more opportunities for efficient development and usage of a wide range of dApps and services than ever before. Solidity developers will be able to deploy custom logic to the blockchain to enable continuous innovation without changing the protocol. </p>
<p>Coupling smart contracts with the custom blockchain nature of Zendoo and an intra-ecosystem secure bridging protocol, Horizen now offers a market-leading solution to drive the industry forward – a permissionless, interoperable, customizable sidechain network.</p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Horizen_EON_how-it-works.jpg"></a> 


 



 
  
  



 
<blockquote>
<p>“The launch of EON opens our doors to the Ethereum developer community and invites them to explore the vast possibilities that Horizen offers. </p>



<p>As we enter the final testnet phase, we’re eager to harness not just the existing Ethereum DeFi infrastructure but also connect it with the dynamic and interconnected Horizen ecosystem. This presents a unique opportunity to receive valuable feedback from both our longstanding users and new members, which will enable us to refine our offerings and create an even more seamless and user-friendly experience for all.”</p>
Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs</blockquote>
 
 



 Horizen Partners with Immunefi to Launch Gobi Bug Bounty Program to Offer Up To $75,000 in Bounties 



<p>Aiming to strengthen the security of the EON platform, accompanied with the Gobi testnet launch of EON, Horizen also partners with Immunefi to launch a bug bounty program of up to $75,000 in bounties for reporting vulnerabilities.</p>



 
  
  



 
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m proud of our team’s hard work building out the tech behind our public EVM. Our focus is on optimizing the advantages of smart contracts within the Horizen ecosystem by providing a smooth development process and user experience through a suite of tools and a range of integrations on EON. </p>



<p>In addition to our team’s efforts, we rely on the wider community to ensure the security of our platform. Therefore, we invite developers to participate in our Gobi bug bounty program to help us improve EON’s security.”</p>
Zain Cheng, CTO of Horizen Labs</blockquote>
 
 



 
  
  



 
<blockquote>
<p>“Immunefi is excited to collaborate with Horizen in launching their bug bounty program. This partnership showcases our shared commitment to security and excellence, empowering us to build a robust and trusted blockchain ecosystem together.” </p>
Mitchell Amador, CEO of Immunefi</blockquote>

You can find guides on <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/docs/">EON documentation</a>. Join the #eon developer community on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord</a> for support and discussion with other developers.</p>
<p>Important information for Gobi testers: Smart contracts previously deployed on Dune Testnet and/or Yuma Testnet have to be redeployed on Gobi.&nbsp;</p>

 About Gobi Testnet 


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ZBF_Gobi-eon-roadmap.jpg"></a> 


<p>Prior to the launch of Gobi testnet, EON has been run on the invite-only testnet Dune and temporary public testnet Yuma. </p>
<p>Gobi Testnet is a permanent public testing environment for EON, with many improvements and new features added, it is the final beta stage before the EON mainnet activation later this year.&nbsp;</p>


 
 


 
 Non-ceasing sidechains 
 
<p>The Horizen mainchain verifies each sidechain and ensures its integrity.&nbsp; Non-ceasing sidechains makes the verification process more flexible and frictionless without compromising the security of the system.</p>
 
 Key rotation circuit 
 
<p>A SNARK-based security enhancement that gives a higher level of security and will allow for increased decentralization over time.</p>
 
 Secure key management 
 
<p>A security enhancement that gives the ability to sign transactions and certificates using keys that are not stored locally, that are instead in a separate trusted execution environment&nbsp;</p>
 
 Local EON client for building dapps&nbsp; 
 
<p>This can improve the dapp development process by allowing developers to test and iterate dapps more quickly locally before deploying on chain. Instructions is available on <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/docs/develop_and_deploy_smart_contracts/local_build_and_deploy">EON documentation</a></p>
 
 Websocket support 
 
<p>An alternative way of getting data, more suitable for dapps running a local client. Websocket creates a channel between server and client, and is ideal to receive notifications or new blocks as they arrive.</p>
 
 On-demand autoscaling RPC nodes 
 
<p>For improved scalability and user experience. Autoscaling allows the network to automatically increase the nodes as demand increases.</p>

<p>The Nym Rust SDK is now available, meaning devs can more easily integrate with the mixnet! The Nym mixnet puts the most advanced network privacy protections in the hands of developers to extend to their&nbsp;users.</p><p>When you integrate with the mixnet, you are offering your users protection for their IP addresses, as well as ensuring their network traffic is shielded from AI-driven metadata surveillance and large scale traffic analysis. In short, integrate with the mixnet to ensure your apps have default network level privacy, as it should&nbsp;be!</p><p>This is a pre-release, meaning it is not available on crates.io quite yet, but you can still import it from GitHub, so <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/sdk/rust.html">try it&nbsp;out</a>!</p> What is an SDK useful&nbsp;for? <p>The Nym SDKs make it far easier for developers to integrate mixnet functionality into applications by being able to import Nym clients as dependencies, just like any other dependency or a crypto library. What this means in practice is that clients can connect to and communicate with the mixnet as part of the app process, instead of having to run as a separate process alongside it. This makes for both far smoother development and user experiences.</p><p>What does this mean for people wanting to integrate with Nym? It means it’s now easier to integrate Nym mixnet functionality into your development environment. You will be able to build or integrate your web apps (with the already released Typescript SDK) and now also Rust applications. You no longer need to run a client as a separate process on your machine. And the SDKs provide far more intuitive interfaces with which to interact with the mixnet, meaning you can focus on the logic of your own app instead of constructing messages to send through the&nbsp;mixnet.</p> Which SDKs are available for&nbsp;Nym? <p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk/v/1.1.4">TypeScript SDK</a> is available and was announced in a previous <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-sdk-powerful-privacy-served-directly-to-your-browser-15c0919bdfbf">blog post</a>. This SDK allows users to import the Nym Webassembly client into browser-based application frontends, and has been updated and now has an example with parcel as a&nbsp;bundler.</p>  Coming soon: for NodeJS environment so you can use it in server environments as well as persistent identities / key&nbsp;storage.  <p>The <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/sdk/rust.html">Rust SDK</a> (pre-release) allows developers to embed either a Websocket or Socks5 client into applications to communicate with the mixnet. You can find examples&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/sdk/rust.html">here</a>.</p>  Coming soon: Nym Rust SDK tutorial!   Future SDK&nbsp;updates <p>Right now both SDKs allow devs to interact with the mixnet: send and receive messages, and create clients (the Rust SDK allows for persistent client identities / keypairs, the TS SDK will in a subsequent release). But there are many other features that will be supported once these are rolled out across the mixnet!

  zSwap is the very first use case for Panther’s DeFi Adaptors and one of Panther’s v1 most important features. Here’s how it works.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In our latest <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-monthly-update-january-2023/">monthly update</a>, we shared the user interface for zSwap, the very first use case for Panther’s DeFi Adaptors… and one of the most important features of Panther’s v1.<br></p><p>zSwap allows users to execute swaps on most liquid DEXs with a high degree of privacy. As such, it is the first piece of Panther’s plan to enable private access to DeFi from multiple fronts.<br></p><p>Let’s take a look at how it all works.<br></p> But first, what are DeFi Adaptors?<br> <p>One key component that will help realize Panther’s vision of private DeFi access is to develop plugins that are specific to existing protocols and connect them to Panther Pools (Panther’s private Multi-Asset Shielded Pools). This overall solution is referred to as DeFi Adaptors.<br></p><p>Each plugin enables zAssets (assets shielded in a Panther Pool) to interact with DeFi protocols by passing relevant values and function types, resulting in a seamless transaction flow while maximizing the benefits of both protocols for the user. Thanks to this system, users gain access to Panther’s zero-knowledge privacy without having to let go of the underlying security of the blockchain networks Panther is deployed on.<br></p><p>Panther’s catalog of DeFi Adaptors will be ever-expanding to interact with a broad range of DeFi dApps and protocols, starting with some of the ecosystem’s most popular applications –DEXs, NFT marketplaces, and lending/borrowing protocols. Each of these different interaction types will have a dedicated Adaptor and, as you will see below, the DeFi Adaptor dedicated to swapping assets through DEXs is called zSwap.</p>Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pools connect to DeFi dApps through custom plugins. The overall solution is what we refer to as “DeFi Adaptors.”<p>Since Panther’s vision is to give users the ability to access DeFi with full privacy, Adaptors play a key role in enabling them to break the on-chain link between their assets and their DeFi activity. Like Panther Pools, DeFi Adaptors will be debuted in Polygon at the release of Panther’s v1. If you want to learn more about zAssets and Panther Pools, please see this article.<br><br></p> How zSwap enables private swaps on popular DEXs <br> zSwap’s user interface.‌ ‌<p>The first use case for DeFi Adaptors, zSwap, is designed to facilitate swap transaction flow towards some of the most widely used protocols in the Polygon DeFi ecosystem –<a href="https://quickswap.exchange/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Quickswap</a>, <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap v3</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve</a>. This functionality is found within the “Swap” tab in Panther’s decentralized application (dApp).<br></p><p>zSwap features a user interface similar to those of the DEXs mentioned above for a familiar user experience. It also allows users to dictate the token IDs for the assets they want to sell/buy from a list of accepted assets (see below), enabling them to choose the specific swap pair they wish to trade. Users can also input the amount of the sell token they wish to trade, and the zSwap function will query an exchange rate based on these inputs and provide users with up-to-date values. This ensures that users can make informed decisions about their trades and optimize their transactions for the best possible outcome.<br></p><p>zSwap’s goal is to cater to a wide range of user types, including retail users, institutions, and market makers. At v1, zSwap will support the interaction with three different platforms, with the ability to highlight the best platform or “route” for users to conduct their swaps, allowing them to swap tokens at the most favorable rates and incur smaller fees.<br></p> Economic optimization of swapping opportunities<br> <p>zSwap uses advanced algorithms to identify the optimal routing path for the trade execution while allowing the user to choose other sub-optimal options if that is their preference. It provides an optimized user experience by automatically defaulting to the platform with the least price impact based on the trade variables that the user is wishing to execute. <br></p><p>Additionally, zSwap displays a calculation of the difference between the best available opportunity and the rest of them in terms of the price impact of each DEX (e.g. a trade could feature a 2% impact in Curve as opposed to a 0.3% on in Uniswap). In the future, zSwap might be expanded to support more DEX integrations to allow further diversity of asset flow and access to deeper liquidity.</p>zSwap screen, featuring the routing functionalities. How zSwap enables user privacy in DeFi <p>The ability for users to swap assets privately serves a double purpose: <br></p>  Allowing users to trade between all whitelisted assets available using the platforms above.  Contributing to the privacy that Pools provide to users holding assets within them. In other words, no one can link assets within the pool to specific users since they have the ability to swap assets and trade with one another within it, even if deposits/withdraws to the Pool itself are viewable by observers.<br><br>  Comparing Panther’s privacy to a typical transparent L1 blockchain when swapping assets.<p>The Panther DAO can propose assets for whitelisting at any time since whitelisting an asset requires a manual configuration. For the protocol’s first release, Panther will roll with the following assets:<br><br>Stablecoins:<br></p>  USDC  USDT  DAI  <p>Other tokens:</p>  wETH  wBTC  MATIC  CRV  LINK  <p>These tokens represent the largest DEX flow on Polygon and, as such, can aid Panther’s goal of bootstrapping its privacy through user activity. Further integrations can then be leveraged as activations on their own and help the protocol’s organic growth by engaging the communities associated with them.</p> User path<br> <p>The following scenario may help you understand how zSwap works in a practical setting.<br></p>  Alice wants to swap her ETH for USDC. As a privacy-conscious user, she already holds her ETH as zETH within Panther Protocol (ETH deposited into a Panther Pool). This grants her access to the privacy-preserving functionalities of zSwap. Alice then proceeds to the Swap page on the Panther dApp’s interface.  Alice navigates to the left side of the UI and chooses the selling token and an amount based on her historical deposits (for example, zETH). She then chooses the receivable token (for example, zUSDC.  zSwap automatically calculates the exchange rate between the sellable and receivable asset (e.g. 1750 zUSDC per 1 zETH) according to real-time market data from DEXs.  zSwap will automatically display the best swapping route identified, as well as the details of the swap. Alice can choose to expand the list of DEX routing options to compare the costs of using a different DEX and select it if she decides to do so.  After Alice finds a preferred option among all the DEX options available, she executes the transaction by pressing the Swap button.  Once her transaction successfully goes through, the newly deposited asset (in our example, USDC) is delivered to Alice as a zUSDC. Alice also gets rewarded for conducting a transaction on zSwap through Privacy Reward Points (PRPs), which reward users for increasing the anonymity rate of the Panther ecosystem. Should there be an issue that causes the transaction to fail at any step of the way, Alice’s asset balance would remain unchanged.   About Panther <p>Panther is a chain-agnostic privacy layer that allows users to access DeFi privately and compliantly. Its users can execute transactions and deploy assets across DeFi. Panther’s <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/cryptographic-primitives">zero-knowledge primitives</a> are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p>Users access Panther’s privacy by depositing assets from different chains into <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/multi-asset-shielded-pools">Multi-Assed Shielded Pools</a> (MASPs or simply <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools">Shielded Pools</a>). Shielded Pools exist in different chains, interconnected by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/zbridges">zBridges</a>. Using <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors">DeFi Adaptors</a>, users can also deploy their assets into DeFi dApps/Protocols, or they can transact with and swap them privately within MASPs.Since Panther’s privacy is enabled by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/cryptographic-primitives">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, users can disclose any part or the whole of their transaction history to anyone at will. They can also choose to withdraw their assets from MASPs into stealth addresses.

<p>We’re back with all new editions of this newsletter, beginning with our just-released 2023 <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/series/state-of-crypto/">State of Crypto</a>. </p> 1. Data &amp; pulse checks: On the State of Crypto 2023&nbsp; <p>Daren Matsuoka, Eddy Lazzarin, Robert Hackett and Stephanie Zinn</p><p>It’s easy for a casual observer to overlook rapid progress in the crypto industry, especially given the noise of media headlines and fleeting price movements. But our State of Crypto report 2023 tracks the data, indicators, and signals that matter — revealing a steady cycle of development, product launches, and ongoing innovation. And this year, we also introduced the State of Crypto Index, a tool to track the health of the crypto industry from a technological, rather than financial, perspective. </p><p>The index represents the weighted average monthly growth of 14 industry metrics — also displaying, in a single chart, the rate of “innovation” and “adoption” of web3 — that offers a more nuanced measure for the state of crypto.&nbsp; The tool is also interactive, so anyone can tweak the parameters to form their own data views.</p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/state-of-crypto-report-2023/">see this post for 7 takeaways &amp; 55+ slides</a><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/stateofcrypto/">&nbsp;</a></p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/stateofcrypto/">explore the interactive index &amp; indicators</a></p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/QYgslufMJ4s">watch this video for a slide walk-through &amp; live discussion</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/state-of-crypto-trends-data-index-2023">listen to this new episode</a></p>  <p>…share on <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1645778427402928129">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7051548230962073600/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x5b3f2f">Farcaster</a>.</p> 2. Latest trends: applying zero knowledge to machine learning; minting NFTs in ‘waves’ to better build community <p>Elena Burger; Scott Duke Kominers and 1337 Skulls Sers</p><p>In past editions, we’ve shared a lot about <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/zero-knowledge-canon/">zero knowledge</a>, foundational technologies that hold the keys to blockchain scalability, represent the future of privacy-preserving applications, and more. But zero-knowledge proofs can also be useful in providing checks-and-balances on machine learning models and AI. Recently, there have been notable efforts in putting larger and more complex models on-chain — leveraging the ability of zero-knowledge proofs to succinctly represent and verify programs. <br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/checks-and-balances-machine-learning-and-zero-knowledge-proofs/">read more<br></a><a href="https://twitter.com/VirtualElena/status/1643648433100836864">share</a></p><p>In an NFT project, the mint largely determines who the community is and how they (and the broader market) view the project going forward. Since brands and projects need a secure mechanism that draws participation from the people they initially want, we review a new minting strategy called a “wave mint”, in which members of different NFT communities are invited to mint in a series of waves gradually expanding outwards. The wave mint design leverages people’s on-chain data and reputation to select for holders who are well matched to a project’s culture and goals; drives attention and energy to the project; and avoids common problems with “free” mints, like <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/nft-sales-market-clearing-gas-wars-auction-mechanism-design-for-builders/">gas wars</a> and bots.<br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/a-new-nft-launch-strategy-the-wave-mint/">learn more</a>&nbsp; <br><a href="https://twitter.com/skominers/status/1644044669142069253">share</a>&nbsp;</p> 3.

<p>Another major milestone in the Ethereum ecosystem was achieved yesterday with the Shanghai upgrade, or <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/03/08/goerli-shapella-announcement">Shapella</a>. This upgrade allows validators to withdraw ETH that have been staked (and the rewards earned from staking) from as far back as December 2020 — over $26 billion worth of ETH is potentially becoming&nbsp;liquid.</p><p>Now, the ideal outcome of such an event would be that some of this liquidity would go towards boosting decentralisation by encouraging more people to operate and stake on validators in underrepresented areas. At present, the vast majority of validators are run on AWS and in <a href="https://ethernodes.org/countries">US and&nbsp;Europe</a>.</p><p>Decentralisation is one of the core principles of Web3 and for good reasons: it can ensure censorship resistance and reliability of service globally. But decentralisation is not feasible unless we realise another core principle in Web3, namely privacy. Decentralised infrastructures require a high intensity of coordination between actors. If this takes place in open networks or through trusted third parties, this exposes the infrastructure — and importantly, those who run it — to a range of&nbsp;attacks.</p> Why Ethereum isn’t privacy-preserving <p>The Ethereum ecosystem achieved a monumental transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus algorithms last year. But with the move to POS, new privacy issues became evident and the very core of the blockchain, covered in an earlier <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/congratulations-on-the-merge-now-to-cure-the-hangover-with-a-strong-dose-of-privacy-c4b0c8eb46ea">blogpost</a>.</p><p>In summary, with the move to POS, validators need to coordinate on who creates the next block in the blockchain, which means more traffic between validators. This traffic can be analysed, compromising validator privacy opening the infrastructure up to attacks, from MEV Bots and DDoS attacks to targeted censorship. At this year’s ETHDenver, <a href="https://medium.com/nymtech/ethereum-was-never-designed-with-privacy-in-mind-d45039e5c692">privacy-focused discussions were at the forefront and on the main stage</a>, which signifies that the community strongly recognises the importance of privacy in the ecosystem.</p><p>In February 2023, <a href="https://decrypt.co/119370/ethereum-validators-hit-500000-ahead-scheduled-shanghai-upgrade">Ethereum hit the milestone of 500K validators</a>. This means that the consequences of the lack of validator privacy is only growing. In addition, <a href="https://metamask.io/news/latest/meta-mask-introduces-liquid-staking-in-dapp-for-an-easy-and-convenient-way-to-stake-eth/">Metamask recently launched a new staking functionality</a>, allowing users to stake their ETH using liquid staking protocols. If this leads to more people staking as well as more people running validators, it will exacerbate the privacy issues. And staking and operating from home for instance, could even entail people leaking their home IP addresses. Essentially, this is the same as someone finding out where you live, uncovering your salary slip, and then attaching it to your front door for all to&nbsp;see.</p> Deep privacy integrations for networked public&nbsp;goods <p>The good news is that as an industry we are making huge progress both when it comes to decentralisation and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The industry relies on a set of core public good technologies, and <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> is one of them. The Libp2p module has been nothing less than groundbreaking for decentralised networking. Developed by <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol labs</a>, it is a modular peer-to-peer networking framework that can run on across different network protocols. And this p2p networking framework is used in major blockchain ecosystems from IPFS, to Ethereum and Polkadot.</p><p>This is a huge win for decentralisation, but what about privacy? Libp2p is encrypted which is great, however, the patterns of communication running through the network remain exposed. And this can be almost more revealing than the content itself. This is where a mixnet such as the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym mixnet</a> comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>Nym <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-and-chainsafe-bring-enhanced-privacy-to-over-half-a-million-ethereum-validators-9792cbdedebd">recently partnered</a> with leading blockchain R&amp;D firm <a href="https://chainsafe.io/">Chainsafe</a> to build a <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/rust-libp2p-nym">Nym Libp2p module</a> for the Rust implementation of Libp2p. Clients and networking libraries such as Lighthouse (maintained by Chainsafe) can privacy-enhance traffic by sending it through the mixnet, shielding information that could doxx them from prying machine learning scraping. Solving the privacy problem at the core of major Web3 public goods can have a major impact across several ecosystems and more specifically, resolve the privacy issues for Ethereum validators, preventing the leaking of their IP addresses and metadata.</p><p>All new Ethereum validators should include this Nym integration module as part of their standard “starter&nbsp;pack”!</p> Privacy is your&nbsp;right <p>Everyone has their own reasons for wanting privacy. At the very least, leaking your home address on a blockchain is scary! And allowing people to see your personal ETH balance is unnecessary and making yourself vulnerable to attacks is dangerous.</p><p>A fully decentralised network needs network layer privacy for it to provide the benefits that are envisioned as part of the core principles of Web3. The industry is making progress when it comes to decentralisation and privacy, it is now time to put it into&nbsp;action.</p><p>Links</p>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/">Download Nym&nbsp;wallet</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/nodes/setup-guides.html">Run a mix&nbsp;node</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">Nym staking</a>  <p>Resources</p>  <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Mixnet explorer</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/">Nym docs</a>  <p>Languages</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@M.Quin/nym-libp2p-ethereumun-gizlilik-krizi-kamu-mallar%C4%B1yla-nas%C4%B1l-%C3%A7%C3%B6z%C3%BCl%C3%BCr-6bb2c777a8a2">Turkish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/nym-libp2p-comment-r%C3%A9soudre-la-crise-de-confidentialit%C3%A9-dethereum-avec-des-biens-publics-869f999804be">French</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/nym-libp2p-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%83-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-ethereum-%D1%81-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%89%D1%8C%D1%8E-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85-%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B3-5d939a0fb218">Russian</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-libp2p-how-to-solve-the-ethereum-privacy-crisis-with-public-goods-e2a4972bdf1c">Nym + Libp2p: how to solve the Ethereum privacy crisis with public goods</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have taken the world by storm in recent years. They have already shown to be usable for way more than their initial use cases in art. As a brand, you might be wondering if you should get in on the action and start using NFTs to represent and promote your products or services. Let’s take a look at why your brand should leverage NFTs and how various industries are already leveraging NFTs.</p>



 Why Your Brand Should Leverage NFTs 



<p>From shaking up the art world to tokenising real estate to improving customer loyalty programs. NFTs are widely usable, but most use cases rely on the general benefits of using NFTs. Here are a few reasons why your brand should leverage NFTs:</p>



 
 NFTs provide ownership and authenticity 



 NFTs can drive engagement and loyalty 



 NFTs can increase brand visibility and reach 



 NFTs can generate new revenue streams 
 



 Providing ownership and authenticity 



<p>One of the biggest benefits of NFTs is that they provide a unique, verifiable way for consumers to own and collect digital items. With an NFT, you can prove ownership and authenticity of a digital asset. Regardless of whether it is a piece of art, a virtual collectible, or even a digital product or service. This can be especially appealing to collectors and fans who value the exclusivity and rarity of certain items.</p>



<p>And with recent advances in technology, the thin line between the digital and physical world is also getting increasingly thinner. With <a href="https://beincrypto.com/top-luxury-fashion-brands-double-down-nfts-despite-2022-crypto-fallout/">luxury brands already using NFTs to combat counterfeit products and create digital </a>twins of physical products and liquor producers using <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2022/12/01/nfts-debut-with-interactive-gin-whiskey-and-fine-wine-projects-revolutionizing-the-spirits-industry/?sh=31c7553f7160">NFTs to guarantee the provenance of their products.</a></p>



 Driving engagement and loyalty 



<p>By using NFTs, you can create a sense of exclusivity and community among your most devoted fans and customers. For example, you could offer limited edition NFTs that are only available to a select group of loyal customers or fans. This can help drive engagement and loyalty. People will feel more invested in your brand if they have a unique and exclusive item that represents it.</p>



 Increasing brand visibility and reach 



<p>Using NFTs can also be a great way to increase the visibility and reach of your brand. By creating and promoting NFTs that are related to your products or services, you can tap into the growing community of NFT collectors and enthusiasts and expose your brand to a new audience.</p>



 Generating new revenue streams 



<p>NFTs can also be a useful way to generate new revenue streams for your brand. By selling NFTs related to your products or services, you can create a new avenue for revenue. This can be especially appealing in the digital world, where traditional ownership models can be more challenging.</p>



 The Risks and Pitfalls of Using NFTs 



<p>While everything seems to be in favour of the usage of NFTs, as with everything, there are also some risks and pitfalls that should be considered when using NFTs. The two foremost risks and pitfalls of using NFTs are fraudulent NFTs and the high volatility of NFT values.</p>



 Fraudulent NFTs 



<p>One risk of using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is the potential for fraud or misrepresentation. Since NFTs are often used to represent unique or rare items, it is possible for unscrupulous individuals to create fake or altered NFTs and sell them as genuine. This can result in significant financial losses for buyers who believe they are purchasing a valuable or authentic item.</p>



 High volatility of NFT values 



<p>Another potential pitfall of using NFTs is the volatility of their value. The value of NFTs can fluctuate significantly over time.  The indicated can depend on a variety of factors. Such include market demand, the perceived value of the underlying item, and the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. This means that the value of an NFT may increase or decrease significantly in a short period of time, leading to potential financial losses for holders.</p>



<p>Depending on how your brand uses NFTs, these risks/pitfalls do not have to be significant, though. A platform on which your NFTs could be bought/sold/attained could automatically filter out fake NFTs already, for example. Or if the value of your NFTs is tied to a certain physical asset or service, the value of the corresponding NFT tends to be less volatile. Nevertheless, it is good to be mindful of these risks and pitfalls.</p>



 NFTs in the ‘Real World’ 



<p>Before concluding the article, let’s take a look at some examples of how NFTs are being used in various industries. Examples are the hospitality industry, gaming industry, and politics!</p>



 NFTs in the hospitality industry 



<p>A loyalty program uses NFTs as a way to reward and engage customers. For example, a business could create an NFT that represents a certain level of loyalty, and offer it to customers who reach that level. Customers could then redeem the NFT for rewards, such as discounts, exclusive products, or early access to events. NFTs can also be used as a way to create a sense of community or exclusivity among customers, as they may be able to purchase and trade NFTs with each other.</p>







<p>Customers can also use NFTs as a way to offer unique experiences or rewards. For example, a hotel chain could create an NFT that represents an exclusive VIP package, which includes perks such as private check-in, room upgrades, and access to a special lounge. Customers could purchase the NFT and redeem it for the VIP package during their stay. NFTs could also be used to represent unique experiences. Namely, a private dinner with the chef or a guided tour of the city, which could be bought and sold by travellers. In this way, NFTs can provide a way for hotels and other hospitality businesses to offer highly coveted, one-of-a-kind experiences to customers.</p>



<p>For more information about NFTs in the hospitality industry read our article <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-hotels-customer-loyalty/">here!</a></p>



 NFTs for gaming 



<p>NFTs might be used in a variety of ways within the gaming industry. They can be used to represent in-game items or currency, such as weapons or armour, which can be bought and sold within a game. NFTs are brought into play to grant access to exclusive content, such as special levels or events. Additionally, game developers can use NFTs to create a sense of scarcity around certain in-game items, making them more valuable and sought-after by players.</p>



<p>Additionally, the creation of metaverses could prove to be another new realm of gaming. NFTs can really thrive by providing an easy way to own and trade items/property within the metaverse.</p>



 NFTs for politics 



<p>In the political realm, NFTs can be put to use as a tool for fundraising or campaigning. For example, a political candidate could create an NFT that represents a specific policy stance or campaign promise, and sell it to supporters as a way to fund their campaign. NFTs could also be used to represent digital collectibles related to political events or figures. These could be bought and sold by collectors. Additionally, NFTs could be used as a way to engage supporters and create a sense of community, as supporters could trade and collect NFTs related to the campaign or candidate. More information can be found <a href="https://zaisan.io/nfts-politics/">here.</a></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, NFTs can be a powerful tool for brands looking to increase ownership, authenticity, engagement, reach, and revenue in the digital world. If you’re considering using NFTs as part of your marketing strategy, it’s worth exploring the possibilities and seeing how they might fit into your overall branding and business goals.</p>

<p>San Francisco (USA), April 11th, 2023 – <a href="http://www.xrsi.org">XR Safety Initiative(XRSI)</a>, a 501(c)(3) global non-profit <a href="https://www.standardsportal.org/usa_en/sdo/xrsi.aspx">Standards Developing Organization (SDO)</a> promoting privacy, safety, security, and ethics in immersive and emerging technologies, is pleased to provide an update on its ongoing partnership with The Metaverse Standards Forum. Since joining as a Principal Member last year, XRSI has been working diligently to support the development of interoperability standards while providing privacy, safety, security, and ethics oversight for an open Metaverse.</p>



<p>XRSI’s founder and CEO, Kavya Pearlman, serves as the co-chair for the Forum’s Privacy, Cybersecurity &amp; Identity Exploratory Group, bringing her subject matter expertise and representing XRSI alongside Dr Louis Rosenberg, Chief Scientist at Responsible Metaverse Alliance and XRSI Global Technology Adviser. Their leadership in the group reinforces the need for strong privacy and security measures in the rapidly evolving Metaverse landscape.</p>



<p><a href="https://metaverse-standards.org/">The Metaverse Standards Forum</a>, hosted by the Khronos Group, brings together leading standards organizations and companies for industry-wide cooperation on identifying interoperability standards essential to building the open metaverse. Principal Members include Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Adobe, Google, Unity, HTC, and the World Web Consortium.</p>



<p>The Forum focuses on pragmatic, action-based projects such as implementation prototyping, hackathons, plugfests, and open-source tooling to accelerate the testing and adoption of standards, while also developing consistent terminology and deployment guidelines. This approach enables the Forum to coordinate requirements and resources to foster the creation and evolution of standards within standards organizations working in relevant domains.</p>



<p>Neil Trevett, President of the Khronos Group and chair of Metaverse Standards Forum, expressed his enthusiasm for XRSI’s involvement, stating, “We are truly excited to have Kavya Pearlman and XRSI join and co-chair the Privacy, Cybersecurity &amp; Identity Exploratory Group. Their expertise and commitment to privacy and security will be invaluable in shaping the future of the Metaverse. It’s an honor to work alongside such dedicated and knowledgeable professionals who are passionate about creating a safe and inclusive digital environment for everyone.“</p>



<p>Ensuring safety, privacy, and trust is vital for the successful digital transformation journey of governments, organizations, and individuals alike. In line with its mission, XRSI has recently published a standard definition of the Metaverse to provide a comprehensive understanding and foster collaborative efforts. According to XRSI, the Metaverse is “a network of interconnected virtual worlds with the following key characteristics: Presence, Persistence, Immersion, and Interoperability.” The full definition can be found here: <a href="https://xrsi.org/definition/the-metaverse">https://xrsi.org/definition/the-metaverse</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>XRSI calls on all key stakeholders, including privacy professionals, cybersecurity experts, security organizations, policymakers, technologists, and researchers, to join the Forum and the Privacy, Cybersecurity &amp; Identity (PCI) group to contribute to the development of robust standards for the Metaverse. Open standards enable consistency across multiple Metaverse implementations, and XRSI will contribute its knowledge to the overall Metaverse standards being worked on by The Metaverse Standards Forum and its members.</p>



<p>Let’s join forces to shape the next iteration of the internet. The future of the Metaverse needs every stakeholder to play their part, ensuring a safe, secure, and inclusive digital environment for all. By collaborating and sharing our collective expertise, we can pave the way for a Metaverse that not only revolutionizes the way we interact and connect but also upholds the highest standards of privacy, security, and ethics. Together, we can build a Metaverse that respects user rights, fosters innovation, and creates opportunities for everyone, regardless of their background or location. Join XRSI, the Metaverse Standards Forum, and other forward-thinking organizations in this mission to make the Metaverse a better, safer, and more inclusive space for generations to come.</p>

  Generative AI Is Exploding. These Are The Most Important Trends To Know  <p>This year’s AI 50 list shows the dominance of this transformative type of artificial intelligence, which could reshape work as we know it.</p>  <p>By Konstantine Buhler</p><p>Published April 11, 2023</p>  



 
<p>When we launched the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/">AI 50</a> almost five years ago, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/09/17/meritech-capital-konstantine-buhler-ai-decoded-evaluating-artificial-intelligence-startups/?sh=7238de797b78">I wrote</a>, “Although artificial general intelligence (AGI)… gets a lot of attention in film, that field is a long way off.” Today, that sci-fi future feels much closer.</p>



<p>The biggest change has been the rise of generative AI, and particularly the use of transformers (a type of neural network) for everything from text and image generation to protein folding and computational chemistry. Generative AI was in the background on last year’s list but in the foreground now.</p>



 The History of Generative AI 



<p>Generative AI, which refers to AI that creates an output on demand, is not new. The famous ELIZA chatbot in the 1960s enabled users to type in questions for a simulated therapist, but the chatbot’s seemingly novel answers were actually based on a rules-based lookup table. A major leap was Google researcher Ian Goodfellow’s generative adversarial networks (GANs) from 2014 that generated plausible low resolution images by pitting two networks against each other in a zero sum game. Over the coming years the blurry faces became more photorealistic but GANs remained difficult to train and scale.</p>



<p>In 2017, another group at Google released the famous Transformers paper, “Attention Is All You Need,” to improve the performance of text translation. In this case, attention refers to mechanisms that provide context based on the position of words in text, which vary from language to language. The researchers observed that the best performing models all have these attention mechanisms, and proposed to do away with other means of gleaning patterns from text in favor of attention.</p>



<p>The eventual implications for both performance and training efficiency turned out to be huge. Instead of processing a string of text word by word, as previous natural language methods had, transformers can analyze an entire string all at once. This allows transformer models to be trained in parallel, making much larger models viable, such as the generative pretrained transformers, the GPTs, that now power ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot and Microsoft’s newly revived Bing. These models were trained on very large collections of human language, and are known as Large Language Models (LLMs).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although transformers are effective for computer vision applications, another method called latent (or stable) diffusion now produces some of the most stunning high-resolution images through products from startups Stability and Midjourney. These diffusion models marry the best elements of GANs and transformers. The smaller size and open source availability of some of these models has made them a fount of innovation for people who want to experiment.</p>
 



<p> </p>







 
 Four trends in this year’s list 



<p>Generative AI Infrastructure: OpenAI made a big splash last year with the launch of ChatGPT and again this year with the launch of GPT-4, but their big bet on scale and a technique called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is only one of many directions LLMs are taking. Anthropic and their chatbot Claude use a different approach called Reinforcement Learning Constitutional AI (RL-CAI). The CAI part encodes a set of human-friendly principles designed to limit abuse and hallucination in the outputs. Meanwhile Inflection, a secretive startup founded by DeepMind’s Mustafa Suleyman and Greylock’s Reid Hoffman, is focusing on consumer applications.</p>



<p>And these are just the high-profile entrants on the closed source side. In the world of open source, Hugging Face has become the go-to platform for developers that want to train their own models or fine-tune existing ones. Along with Stability’s open source offerings, Hugging Face also hosts recent state of the art models like Facebook’s LLaMA and Stanford’s Alpaca.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Predictive Infrastructure: During the Gold Rush many individual prospectors went bust, but the people selling the picks and shovels made out just fine. This is why investors often focus on novel infrastructure companies during technology shifts. AI in its many forms is about prediction, so let’s call this new category predictive infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The largest of these infrastructure companies host the massive amounts of data needed for enterprise AI applications in a format that facilitates all sorts of data pipelines. Databricks has distinguished itself from Snowflake, a notable incumbent in the space, by being specifically designed for the needs of AI/ML data teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because data labeling, cleaning and other processes are so critical to model training, there are now four companies in this bucket on this year’s list: Coactive, Scale, Snorkel and Surge, up from just one last year (Scale). Two other new entrants to the AI 50, MosaicML and Weights &amp; Biases, specifically help AI practitioners train and fine-tune models. Arize and Hugging Face also make it easy to deploy models at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generative AI Applications: Midjourney and Stable Diffusion benefited from their virality on social media, planting generative AI in the center of popular culture. Then ChatGPT captured the world’s attention and became the fastest product to attain 100 million users. While Google played catch up with its Bard chatbot, Neeva became the first generative AI-native search engine.</p>



<p>Since LLMs were primarily designed to generate text, generative writing apps are a fast-growing category. Two of these applications are on this year’s list: Jasper, which uses GPT-4 to help marketing copywriters, and Writer, which has trained its own proprietary model and is focused on enterprise use cases. As language models have become more capable, they are able to handle more complex applications, like legal text. Harvey is using GPT-4 to do associate level legal work at law and other professional services firms, while Ironclad has automated many contract processes for in-house legal teams.</p>



<p>Generative AI is inherently creative, so it’s natural to see a lot of innovation in other creative fields. Runway generates, edits and applies effects to video that met the quality bar for the Oscar-winning team behind Everything Everywhere All at Once. Descript focuses on both podcast and video workflows, using generative AI to make the editing process less laborious. ChatGPT, Bing and Bard are general purpose chatbots, but crafting bespoke chatbots is a nascent creative space powered by Character.AI, founded by one of the authors of the original Transformer paper, Noam Shazeer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making Powerpoint decks is as close as many people get to being creative at work, but new generative AI apps like Tome make it easy to design beautiful presentations that bring your ideas to life with only text prompts. Another take on work productivity comes from Adept, which has built an action model, ACT-1, that’s trained on how people interact with their computers. Its goal is to eventually automate some of the searching, clicking and scrolling you have to do now to get tasks done.</p>



<p>Predictive AI applications: Another useful way to use AI’s predictive power is to detect anomalies and then find ways to mitigate them. Abnormal Security, for instance, analyzes a company’s cloud email environment to identify phishing attempts and other threats and remove malicious emails. On the medical front, Viz.ai quickly surfaces patient imaging that should be reviewed by a specialist, and coordinates the care team to improve outcomes for patients with stroke and other time-sensitive conditions.</p>



 On AI’s horizon 



<p>By the time next year’s list rolls out, I believe generative AI and LLMs will still be dominant. But the landscape is changing quickly and there are big opportunities for companies that can move with it. Here are three things to look out for in the coming year:</p>



 
 The Infrastructure layer is very “fat,” with the biggest companies currently in the space offering models and cloud services. This will change as companies building applications learn how to capture value. 



 LLM usage will mature with some companies strongly favoring buying AI models from cloud APIs and others just as passionately wanting to build their own. Many have predicted that startups will graduate from APIs to their own smaller, more efficient models as they grow. Companies with large and unique data stores will see clear advantages to training their own models as moats. Bloomberg’s recent announcement of their bespoke LLM, which is focused on financial language processing, is a great case in point. 



 The fast but far-sighted will survive as this wave of AI unleashes massive societal changes. The ability to adapt, pivot and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities will be key. Because this technology has huge potential to transform work, the only constant will be change.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Generative AI has turned many assumptions on their head. In the early days we thought AI would replace manual work, but robotics turned out to be harder than some parts of cognitive knowledge work. And, equally surprising, the approximate nature of generative models makes them better than expected at creative work and less than completely trustworthy on rote, mechanical tasks.&nbsp;<br>Achieving artificial general intelligence, that futuristic self-learning system that some fear could threaten humanity, is still a moving target. But there can be no doubt that the progress of large language models over the past year has been transformative—and their applications increasingly general. We’re seeing new use cases every day that demonstrate how AI will change <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-for-work-perspective/">the way we work</a>, create and play.</p>

<p>On Saturday 18th March, the Zcash Foundation (ZF) co-hosted its first-ever <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcon-voices/">Zcon Voices</a> event.&nbsp; Zcon Voices: Brazil was held at the Museu do Amanhã in Rio de Janeiro, and welcomed 60+ attendees from across the great country of Brazil. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12GQtO1ULyCzPMblTQrRtRaWRmXcHTRky?usp=sharing">View the event photo album</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1640115789557641216?s=20">this video</a> for a glimpse of the day.</p>



<p>ZF’s event series, Zcon Voices, aims to provide a platform for regional-specific conversation and education about strong use cases for Zcash and financial privacy. Zcon Vozes Brasil was contextualized and organized by our amazing Zcash Brazil team and was presented mainly in Portuguese, with a few Spanish-speaking presenters as well. The event focused on current opportunities in the cryptography and privacy world and challenges in these areas specific to Brazil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Zcash Brazil team was led by former global ambassador <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/u/michae2xl/summary">Michae2xl</a> and, together with ZF staff, executed a professional, thoughtful, and inspiring event (this event was in addition to Zcash Brazil’s <a href="https://zcashgrants.org/gallery/25215916-53ea-4041-a3b2-6d00c487917d/34622050/">ZCG grant</a>). This collaboration created a safe place for open dialogue and fostered thought-provoking discussions. For example, Zcon Vozes Brasil speaker João (Pizza Jay) said, “Privacy loves company” while talking to friends and attendees at lunch.&nbsp; Michael wrote, “…The Zcash Foundation has been instrumental in creating a medium for the community to come together and discuss the latest developments in the Zcash space and privacy.”</p>



<p>The event’s success was due to the speakers’ contributions as well. The content varied from privacy in centralized and decentralized exchanges and DAOs to the flaws with the governance of cryptography. Speakers kept the audience engaged and motivated—so much so, positive conversations and questions were heard throughout the breaks and cocktail reception and rippled into <a href="https://twitter.com/MP_Lustosa/status/1638224375999610881?s=20">social media outlets afterward</a>. In addition, we were privileged to have Brazil’s-own Isabela Fernandes, Executive Director of Tor, close out the one-day conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With support from the AV Club, ZF provided AV equipment and instruction, enabling the event to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Bu77m6IDACk?feature=share">live-streamed and translated</a>. To learn more about the details of the Zcon Voices live stream, you can check out the most recent <a href="https://youtu.be/5j8qMop7IsI">ZF A/V Club Meetup</a>, where they broke down the setup. This donated equipment will be used for future events Team Zcash Brazil will host, in cities like Rio and São Paulo, enabling the team to share their local events with the world.</p>



<p>Finally, ZF would like to thank the organizers, speakers, attendees, and vendors who helped make this event a huge success and strengthened the credibility of Zcash.</p>



<p>Zcash Brazil team leader, Michae2xl, reflected, “This Zcon Vozes Brasil event brings a lot of significant values post-event.&nbsp; For example, it brings credibility, more voice, and more doors open to collaborating with speakers, other projects, and spaces. ”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The energy from Zcon Voices Brazil caused a sound wave heard in Brazil and across the world!</p>

<p>Today we’re pleased to formally announce a new partnership with <a href="https://bonfida.org/">Bonfida</a>, the creators of Solana Name Service (SNS), to enable native resolution of SNS names in the Brave browser and Wallet.&nbsp;</p>

 Solana Name Service: An identity system for the Web3 era 
<p>SNS is an identity system aimed at making the use of Web3 more natural for the general public. SNS names are like usernames, Web domains, and email addresses all wrapped into one. The idea behind SNS is to map a public Solana address (like VapRHFYaeTo2NY1m2o9QV8yY8E6yCqBECtYAgHUyQjb) to a human-readable name (like david.sol)—making it easier to use crypto in daily life. SNS names are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that, once purchased and stored in a self-custody wallet like Brave Wallet, are entirely owned and controlled by the buyer.</p>

 Uses of SNS in Brave Browser and Wallet 
<p>SNS support in Brave is available today on all platforms of Brave across desktop, iOS, and Android (version 1.49). The integration of SNS into Brave provides users with a simplified experience for sending and receiving Solana (SOL) and SPL tokens. With SNS names mapped to Solana addresses, users can now send and receive crypto using easy-to-remember names, making it easy to identify and organize their personal wallets. This reduces the risk of mistyped addresses and accidental loss of funds. To send crypto with SNS, simply type in the .sol address of the person or organization you wish to send funds to. If the domain has been mapped to an address, Brave Wallet will automatically fill it in below the name.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>In addition to simplifying transactions in Brave Wallet, the integration of SNS into Brave also allows users to visit decentralized SNS domains in the Brave browser. Visiting a .sol domain is as easy as visiting any standard .com or .org site. This opens up new possibilities for hosting censorship-resistant websites that are more resilient than traditional Web 2.0 sites—but still just as accessible. By <a href="https://docs.bonfida.org/collection/using-sns/resolving-websites-with-sns">hosting content on IPFS</a>, which is also supported natively in Brave, websites can be more robust against censorship.</p>

 Getting an SNS name 


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>SNS names can be purchased from Bonfida directly, or on secondary marketplaces like <a href="https://magiceden.io/">Magic Eden</a>. Whether you use your SNS name to point to a website, more easily transact with crypto, or to create and access profiles on decentralized social media platforms, SNS provides a simple and straightforward solution. To date, Bonfida has sold over 220,000 domains, integrated with 60 partners, and has plans to expand the reach of SNS to other blockchains.</p>

 Learn more about crypto DNS in Brave and Brave Wallet 
<p>The addition of SNS builds upon Brave’s existing crypto-DNS strategy outlined in an <a>earlier blog post</a>, which details principles we commit to following while resolving domain names, and expands on the types of crypto domains supported in Brave.</p>
<p>To learn more about Brave Wallet, visit <a>brave.com/wallet/</a>. If you’re already a Brave user, you can get started by selecting Brave Wallet from the main menu, or by clicking the Wallet icon in the navigation bar.</p>

Given the numerous hacks and exploits in the DeFi space, institutions are worried about the potential damage to their brand should they suffer losses as a result of investing in DeFi.<br></p> And yet, enterprise and institutional capital can doubtlessly benefit from DeFi<br> <p>Even if the risks and volatility are high, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-institutional-defi-and-how-can-banks-benefit?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=DeFi%20would%20bring%20the%20execution,can%20be%20realized%20at%20scale.">established capital stands to benefit from DeFi in a myriad of ways</a>. For one, DeFi protocols create a 24/7 access to almost 100% liquid capital as well as access to an array of decentralized and fully democratized financial services. As an example, DeFi protocols have unlocked <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/yield-farming/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">over $5 billion in liquidity pools</a> through <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-yield-farming-the-rocket-fuel-of-defi-explained/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">yield farming</a>, a strategy not available in traditional finance. <br></p><p>Although the potential upside remains high, regulatory ambiguity makes investing in DeFi over a medium to long-term a daunting project. However, there is a possibility to capitalize on the opportunity for growth and innovation. The DeFi ecosystem is growing at an unprecedented rate, new projects are launched every day, there is a growing trend towards privacy and scalability in the blockchain scene and, above all things, these solutions are composable with one another, enabling multiple automation scenarios.<br></p> Decentralized dark pools <br> <p>A middle-of-the-road solution that both DeFi and traditional players (like <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/onyx/documents/Institutional-DeFi-The-Next-Generation-of-Finance.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">JP Morgan</a>) are starting to recognize lies in the zero-knowledge realm.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-dark-pool-trading-platforms.asp?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Decentralized dark pools</a> operated by compliant entities can become the crossing point on the Venn diagram that bridges institutional capital into DeFi. Thanks to the advances in zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, they can ensure security, privacy, and meet all regulatory requirements to become a comprehensive solution.<br></p><p>ZKPs enable data verification without revealing any information about the input or output data. This makes them ideal for ensuring privacy and security in decentralized dark pools, where participants can trade anonymously without revealing their identities or transaction details. Furthermore, these pools can be configured to interact with DeFi protocols to send assets back-and-forth. In other words, institutions can trade crypto and digital assets privately, securely, and without anyone being able to surveil their activity, but retaining the ability to showcase their history to comply with regulations. </p> The advantages of on-chain dark pools<br> <p>Pairing the above with true decentralization and DeFi’s endless composability potential, it is also possible to see an underlying layer of transactions being used by multiple operators. Such a setup can serve many functions, including:</p>  Separating the liability of operators from that of the protocol. In such a case, if any operator were to be deemed irresponsible and its funds blacklisted, users of other operators could continue undisturbed.  Flexibility at an operator level. Different operators with different risk profiles or different target markets could follow different rules. For example, a given operator could provide open access to all users with a certain transaction limit, while others would be KYC-only.  Benefits to users’ privacy regardless of their operator. Perhaps the greatest possibility is that, if the distinction between operators is sufficiently clear while sharing the same protocol, all users will benefit from the same privacy. This can only happen due to zero-knowledge’s other immediate application, blockchain scalability, which continue to showcase the incredible potential of this technology, whether it is for institutional dark pools, zkEVMs, zk-rollups, or other applications.  <p>The promise of decentralized dark pools is the perfect scenario for institutions to onboard into DeFi en masse. Without the limitation of fully public order books and complete access to DeFi’s opportunities and the ability to perform large trades without network congestion and MEV attacks affecting them, growth will become inevitable as enterprise and institutional capital finally finds its way to decentralized finance.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a chain-agnostic privacy layer that allows users to access DeFi privately and compliantly.

<p>AI algorithms are built on the past two decades of intensive mass-surveillance. And yet, when trying out the latest new models like stable diffusion and GPT-4 many of us nevertheless find them to be awesome. So where do we go from&nbsp;here?</p><p>AI is everywhere lately, but has a less famous sibling in the world of digital technology namely cryptography, that can unlock more socially embedded forms of artificial intelligences (yes, in plural) by placing the power to decide in the hands of people. Strong privacy protections holds the keys to truly revolutionising AI from a societal perspective.</p><p>It is time to privacy-pill the AI debate. And it goes a little something like&nbsp;this…</p> 1 Enhancing privacy in&nbsp;AI <p>AI algorithms are essentially statistics on steroids. They calculate statistical probabilities on large data sets, which means they need large volumes of data in order to calculate more accurately what the next word in a sentence might be, the next pixel in an image, the next movement in a moving image and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Where does all this data come from? So far, this huge appetite for data has been mostly fed by decades of digital surveillance. In this sense, AI is a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0263276411417430?journalCode=tcsa">data derivative</a>. In fact, as it is today, AI is a <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/signals-new-president-messaging-apps-long-term-sustainability/">surveillance derivative</a>. From scraping of public LinkedIn and Twitter data, to the far more ethically dubious use of <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300264630/atlas-of-ai/">prison mugshots</a> to train facial recognition algorithms, even supposedly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artist-finds-private-medical-record-photos-in-popular-ai-training-data-set/">private medical records</a> have cropped up in these vast data sets. AI has been built on a digital industry fuelled by involuntary datafication of us&nbsp;all.</p><p>The issue of privacy is starting to crop up in the debates on AI. But there is a danger that advanced cryptography and privacy tech will be used to “privacy wash” otherwise harmful AI. Differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation can help protect sensitive data and maintain individual privacy while still allowing for AI training. This means individual people can maintain their privacy while nevertheless allowing us to develop AI models. However, this raises an important question: is it not still surveillance if your data is read by a&nbsp;machine?</p><p>The answer is yes. Even if an individual’s privacy is protected, when their data is fed to AI algorithms, this can and will contribute to systems of mass surveillance and control. <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/feature/a-relational-theory-of-data-governance">Protecting an individual’s privacy is not enough</a> because their encrypted data can train an AI that could go on to be used to enhance the surveillance and control of others elsewhere.</p><p>But it does not have to be that way. Securing privacy by default across communications is the first step towards tipping the balances of power when it comes to AI. End-to-end encryption, mixnets as well as zero-knowledge proof cryptography all contribute to radically reducing the amount of personal data gathered and sold by unaccountable companies. Strong privacy protections is the first step towards tipping the balances of power in favour of ordinary people, paving the way for meaningful consent and the ability to withdraw&nbsp;it.</p> 2 Paving the way for Consensual AI <p>Consensual AI is a term coined by artists Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst who have been developing tools to make it a reality in practice: with their group <a href="https://spawning.ai/">Spawning</a>, they set up the project “have I been trained” where artists can search large open datasets for their images and request to opt out. This is in partnership with <a href="https://laion.ai/faq">LAION</a>, a non-profit large-scale image datasets.</p><p>In the case of Spawning, the emphasis is on revoking consent after the fact. But going forward, privacy enhancing techniques such as selective disclosure scheme(including <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">zk-nyms</a>), as well as secure federated learning can empower consensual practices in advance, and enable people to securely share data on their own terms. Data can even be processed on distributed devices without leaving their local storage, allowing multiple entities to collaborate on a common goal without sharing sensitive data. Such techniques can pave the way for active, consensual contribution to AIs by ordinary people, communities and groups, rather than being bought and sold in obscure data&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Privacy technologies secure the possibility for meaningful consent in data and AI. There are already a few flourishing projects that are actively working to ensure that the development of AI is an <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/ethics-soc-3">open</a>, consensual and <a href="https://cip.org/s4d">democratic process</a>. But the ability to decide about data is not just about consent, it is also about who gets to determine what kind of AI is being trained in the first&nbsp;place…</p> 3 Enabling sovereignty and decentralisation <p>Data, data sets and AI are not neutral. The creation and recording of data always entails a perspective about what matters in the world, whether and how it should be recorded. A few years ago an important <a href="https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/986506/7/Indigenous_Protocol_and_AI_2020.pdf">position paper</a> on Indigenous AI was published by The Initiative for Indigenous Futures and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR). The authors discuss how AI might serve the specific worldviews and epistemologies of indigenous people from Aotearoa, Australia, North America, and the Pacific. Practical uses included <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/22/1050394/artificial-intelligence-for-the-people/">reviving near-extinct languages and amplifying worldviews</a>. The implications of this Indigenous AI report are relevant for anyone interested in AI. Importantly, it highlights how AIs are in fact plural, in the sense that its real potential is in the many ways data and algorithms can be used to amplify a kaleidoscope of meaning and intelligences.</p><p>OpenAI, in their recent release of GPT-4, compares its capabilities to human capabilities: “while less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.” The US bar exam was one of the benchmarks used to assess the performance of GPT-4. Its training has been heavily weighted towards the English language and US culture, humour, legal framework and habits. In other words a specific culture and set of tasks. There is no universal “artificial intelligence” in competition with a universal “human”. The cultural habit of framing the debate as a competitive race between “humans” and “machines”is a deeply disappointing and destructive habit for a set of technologies that have far more interesting potential — if we just get this right. The real question here is not whether AI works like a human or not, but rather <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/2023-landscape">who it works&nbsp;for</a>.</p><p>The ability to discern what does or does not matter is exactly what makes AI work, and this is a deeply cultural and situated question that should be under the sovereign decisions of the people affected. Cryptographic techniques for enabling effective data governance and verification are therefore essential so that people can actively participate in deciding what should matter or&nbsp;not…</p> 4 Preventing mis/disinformation and deep-fakes <p>Cryptographic proofs and verification techniques can be used to verify the accuracy and source of information. And this becomes increasingly important for enabling sovereignty of knowledge and information by people in the face of a dominant culture. It is also essential for secure verification of information. Chelsea Manning <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-can-be-defeated-with-cryptography-says-chelsea-manning-at-sxsw">recently pointed out in an interview</a> that AI tools are unleashing a whole new set of problems from mis/disinformation and deep-fakes. There are cases where GPT-4 has essentially invented fictions based on entirely unverified datasets (that even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/05/chatgpt-lies/">led to false stories</a> with severe personal consequences). AI models are “dumb” in the sense that they simply draw on data, and are unable to discern or engage with whether something is true and real or&nbsp;not.</p><p>Communities like <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> are already emerging around curating, labelling and sharing open datasets and collaborating on models. Public blockchains can contribute to such efforts by providing untamperable ledgers of verified data&nbsp;, as well as consensus mechanisms for adding the data to the ledger. People can thereby take part in shaping their shared records of truth and have a say in how AI is trained — through whichever governance methods serve them best: new forms of DAOs, guilds or modernized libraries? Because let’s face it, these are collective issues and not something that individual people have time for in their day-to-day lives.</p> 5 Protecting the freedom to be different — the cypherpunk perspective <p>What is at stake in the future of AI is nothing less than the freedom to be different and not subject to a centralised understanding of what matters in the world. In the late 1980s and 1990s the cypherpunk subculture already foresaw a future where the internet would become a vehicle for mass surveillance and centralised control. A less appreciated aspect of this cypherpunk premonition is its positive contribution by advocating for privacy as enabling the possibility to be different.</p><p>The idea of “AGM” or “Singularity” draw on totalitarian fantasies of deferring authority to some centralised machinic intelligence. And these fantasies lead quickly to deranged justifications about why some humans deserve to survive a future with AI and others not. (In fact, computer scientist <a href="https://abebabirhane.com/">Abeba Birhane</a> has <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/ai-weekly-ai-phrenology-is-racist-nonsense-so-of-course-it-doesnt-work/">written extensively</a> about how AI/AGM has revived the racist pseudoscience of phrenology, again repackaging it as scientific and universal claims). Without privacy, the statistical tyranny of AI will turn anomalies into targets, leading to oppressive systems of manipulation and&nbsp;control.</p><p>As it stands, it is impossible to know whether your data is feeding medical research, click-baiting, racist “predictive policing” or drone strikes. The nature of mass surveillance and AI is that it is collective and relational. Your data is calculated in relation to other people’s data in order to find probabilities and norms in ways that are usually quite hard to trace. For this reason, AI has to be addressed collectively and include privacy as the default for all communications. Only then can people make meaningful decisions about how their data should be used. Privacy enhancing tech protects the freedom to be different and can revolutionise AI by decentralising the power to decide on its development — in the process unlocking a kaleidoscope of intelligences.</p>  Tune in to Chelsea’s Manning’s keynote on AI and Privacy — Monday the 10th at <a href="https://www.talent-land.mx/en/home/">TalentLand, Mexico</a>  Join the Nym masterclass on AI and privacy — WebSummit in Rio in May <a href="https://zealy.io/c/nymportugus-6948/">Win&nbsp;tickets</a>!  <p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@M.Quin/gizlilik-teknolojisinin-yapay-zekada-devrim-yaratmas%C4%B1n%C4%B1n-be%C5%9F-yolu-4a27cee772d5">Turkish</a></p> Learn more <p>Watch</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7KVLGIukBEA">Privacy, the big&nbsp;picture</a>  <p>Read</p>  <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-can-be-defeated-with-cryptography-says-chelsea-manning-at-sxsw">AI can be defeated with cryptography</a>  <a href="https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/986506/7/Indigenous_Protocol_and_AI_2020.pdf">Indigenous AI</a>  <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/2023-landscape">AI Now 2023 Landscape report</a>  <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/feature/a-relational-theory-of-data-governance">A relational theory of data governance</a> Viljoen, S.&nbsp;2022  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921000155">Algorithmic Injustice: a relational ethics approach</a> Birhane, A.&nbsp;2021  <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/3992/Raw-Data-Is-an-Oxymoron">Raw data is an oxymoron</a> Gitelman, L.&nbsp;2013   Join the Nym community <p>Join the conversation on Nym community channels:</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p><a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/five-ways-privacy-tech-can-revolutionise-ai-590db82ec0ab">Five ways privacy tech can revolutionise AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      Building the Business of Bloodlines        <p>By Michael Gold</p><p>Photography: KATIE THOMPSON</p><p>Published April 6, 2023</p>        Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe’s breakthroughs prove persistence pays off.      



 
<p>A stubborn streak runs through Anne Wojcicki’s family. She traces this back to her great-grandmother, a talented singer who spent all her money going to the opera in Tsarist St. Petersburg. Wojcicki makes this out to be an all-consuming obsession: nothing could stop Leah Srubinsky from blowing the conjugal nest egg to watch people unload their lungs on stage.</p>



<p>“Her relatives finally said, ‘enough! The only way to stop you is to move to Siberia,’” Wojcicki says during an interview at her hillside home on the outskirts of Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>Pressed on whether her family had really moved all the way to Siberia because of opera, she insists it’s true. “Apparently the only way to control that DNA was total isolation,” she laughs.</p>



<p>As anyone who has taken grade-school biology knows, 23 pairs of chromosomes populate most cells in the human body; DNA and the four letters that comprise it—A, T, G and C—form the building blocks of life. Wojcicki, founder of pioneering DNA testing company 23andMe, sees much of the world—stubbornness included—through the lens of genetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You have genes and you have environment,” Wojcicki says, reclining on her balcony in the casual garb that has long defined her personal style—puffy jacket, workout shorts and Crocs. “Your environment is always going to play a huge influence, but I do believe you’re born in certain ways.”</p>



<p>Wojcicki herself was born in a certain way, with the kind of background that someone who believes in fate could easily see as charting her future in advance. The product of a Polish Catholic father and Russian Jewish mother (she of the opera-loving stock), Wojcicki grew up in a household that respected tradition and prioritized connecting with one’s roots. Stories passed down about the trials her family endured during Europe’s mid-century conflicts fostered her fascination with “what-ifs” and alternate paths her forebears could have taken.</p>



<p>“Most of the people on my father’s side were farmers, but my grandfather was a ‘breakaway child’,” she says. “He managed to get an education and became a judge. Then he entered politics, and eventually became Secretary of the Polish People’s Party. He resisted Communism to the point that he was sent into prison, and later house arrest. While his wife and son—my father—were able to escape and come to America, my grandfather never managed to leave his home country.” While discussing this episode, she emphasizes the “random people” who helped her grandfather obtain an education in his youth, contrasting his lucky break against the zillion possible lives he could have led but didn’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details of this story came to life when Wojcicki visited Poland during a gap year between high school and college, before starting a career that would see her race to the frontiers of DNA-based biotech. 23andMe has, since its founding in 2006, helped more than 13 million people uncover details about their backgrounds and <a href="https://www.dataminingdna.com/who-has-the-largest-dna-database/">amassed</a> the second-largest genetic database of any company in the world. Wojcicki believes that big data can help solve the mysteries of DNA, but in both her Poland experience and a later backpacking trip to old family stomping grounds in Siberia, she connected most deeply with the small things: the sights, sounds and smells that shaped her ancestors.</p>



<p>“I was interested in a level of detail that wasn’t just surface,” she says. “I wanted to imagine myself living in those places.”</p>



<p>The Siberia expedition especially was a trip back in time: Wojcicki rode a train across the steppe, looking to emulate the horseback travel her ancestors had to resort to in order to escape the pogroms that saw countless Russian Jews killed or forced into exile. During this expedition, the voices of her grandparents echoed in her head, their upbringings already half-formed in her mind.</p>



<p>“I find that people, as they get older—especially when they’re closer to dying—start telling stories about their childhoods,” she says. “It was really interesting to see those come to life.”</p>



<p>This episode helped plant the seed for 23andMe’s mission. It occurred during the recession of the early 2000s, when Wojcicki, who had been working as an investor, needed to “totally detox from the Wall Street world.” Ironically, it was her early foray in finance that exposed her to the concept of health as business. Employed by the Wallenbergs, a wealthy Swedish family that ran a startup fund, she worked on their biotech portfolio, dabbling in exotic fields like xenotransplantation—inserting organs from animals (usually pigs) into humans.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I was fascinated by questions of what you’re born with versus what you gain from your experiences.”</p>
anne wojcicki</blockquote>



<p>It was genes, however, that most enthralled her. “I was always super interested in twin studies—looking at how twins raised in different environments differ and overlap in various aspects of their lives,” she says. “I was fascinated by questions of what you’re born with versus what you gain from your experiences.”</p>



<p>In 2006 Wojcicki turned her need to answer these questions into 23andMe. The <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project">mapping</a> of the human genome three years earlier had driven a wave of interest in genetic technology, and Wojcicki’s company grabbed attention instantly when it launched. 23andMe’s early publicity efforts were largely eye-catching gimmicks, such as hosting a celebrity-studded “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2008/sep/18/genetic.testing">spit party</a>” at New York Fashion Week (the company collects its DNA samples from customers’ saliva) and launching a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/11/23andme-zeppelin-hanging-out-above-my-house-creeping-me-out/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN7tCwcP18Gm4dEy7VxL1D-vRT_7DFu6W6T1TWnAfo5cBEtNcDnyjX7Tof57XZji-xsy1WVU7KVctjuUjwQx-Xk15dVSUgJqds624auVUa9kYifPBaVCS0OsL7Yy6WwbCpyQvts2UZzsIG5F8VcLf2Xz1ztjqrx4aE8rzEqxxV4v">blimp</a> over Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>Wojcicki characterizes these stunts as part of a gut-feel visibility blitz that she presided over directly. “I was the marketing department in those days,” she says, describing early advertisements she bought herself that her team still stumbles upon occasionally. Fortunately, she had a personal network seeped in the fast-moving world of Silicon Valley tech to learn from—her sister, Susan, was one of Google’s earliest employees (and served as CEO of YouTube until this year). Her husband at the time was Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder.</p>



<p>“Sergey’s advice at the time was basically to just put things out there and see how people react,” Wojcicki says. This freewheeling attitude also reflected a trademark disdain for corporate stiffness that persists to this day—indeed, during one of our interviews, Wojcicki wears a joke sweatshirt with a boat sailing toward the horizon that says “F*** this, I’m out.”</p>



<p>Not everyone at the company embraced the early marketing approach. The scientists in particular were skeptical about it, wary of undermining the company’s credibility. At the time, the term “DNA” was rapidly entering the marketing lexicon of firms across the corporate spectrum, threatening to cheapen the image of offerings that genuinely did have DNA as their DNA.</p>



<p>“Our scientists would cringe at the idea of doing an infomercial, say,” Wojcicki says, citing the shopping network QVC as an example of a sales channel the company shied away from at first.</p>



<p>23andMe’s offbeat marketing efforts did work initially, helping sell around 1,000 test kits on their first day—an early tsunami which quickly became a trickle as the novelty wore off. Sales soon slowed to a mere handful of kits per day. Facing a still-nascent appetite for genetic technology, Wojcicki and her team doubled down on product development and user experience. Eventually a more mainstream audience caught on, drawn particularly by the prospect of discovering one’s roots, much as Anne had done on those early trips overseas. This helped the company return to a state of relatively steady growth over the next few years.</p>



<p>Indeed, the concept of ancestry continues to play an important role for the company today. It is the thread that connects its early trajectory to Wojcicki’s own sojourns. The connections she made with people in her ancestral homeland underscored how much potential lay in popularizing this kind of self-discovery. “I lived in a dorm when I went to Poland, and people would tell me I look more Polish than most Poles,” Wojcicki says.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I feel like I can’t keep up with all the family that we’ve found.”</p>
Anne Wojcicki</blockquote>



<p>Unsurprisingly for someone who made a career helping millions construct family trees, her own family tree has expanded over the years, encompassing relatives from Australia to South Africa to Argentina. Ten years ago, Wojcicki’s father wrote a book about his own lineage, although no one in the family has been tasked with keeping track of every new addition to the bloodline.</p>



<p>“I feel like I can’t keep up with all the family that we’ve found,” she says, acknowledging that her own company’s product could potentially help her further explore her family tree’s branches and leaves. “It’s almost like there’s a present sitting at the door, but we haven’t opened it yet,” she muses. “In general, though, I’m more interested in expanding the depth, rather than the width of the tree—with making real relationships with the family members I meet.”</p>



<p>For her customers, gaining visibility into their own family backgrounds is a big selling point of 23andMe. (Quirky tidbits like whether they are likely to enjoy cilantro, wake up early, fear public speaking or a number of other traits come included, too.). However, more weighty assessments, such as likelihood of developing Type 2 diabetes and other more serious health conditions, are featured in its most popular service. In the years after its founding, the company expanded the repertoire of genetic conditions it screened for. Helping its customers interpret these results became a guiding principle for Wojcicki and her team.</p>



<p>“You have to take what’s in that raw, scientific brain and translate it to consumers,” she says, describing the late 2000s and early 2010s as a time when the company was starting to hit its stride in both its scientific mission and place in the broader discourse, when the company’s North Star—to help average people gain access to their genetic information, without what Wojcicki sees as heavy-handed intermediation by the medical establishment—was on the rise.</p>







<p>23andMe had defined a new category, becoming synonymous with at-home genetic testing. But along with success came detractors—including influential members of the medical community. To its skeptics, 23andMe was overly casual about revealing medical risk factors to people without giving them access to professionals who could help them handle the information. Some also question to what extent genetic analysis can truly predict diseases. Wojcicki describes attending a dinner in which a medical adviser for George W. Bush “walked out in disgust” after learning about the company’s product, and another instance in which the company was rejected from a convention held by a “major medical society” when it applied for a booth.</p>



<p>“I’ve been surprised by all the controversy that’s followed us,” Wojcicki says. She turns the criticism back to the healthcare industry, contrasting 23andMe’s work of promoting radical transparency with the industry’s habit of collecting patients’ data without any recourse to opt-out. “People should have choice,” she says. “The potential of genetics is really to help people know, ‘hey, here’s what your risks are, and can you actually do anything that mitigates those risks?’ I think there’s an incredible opportunity for that. You need to have the right information and awareness around [your risks], and [we can] help people understand that a probability is not the same as a predetermined outcome.”</p>



<p>Wojcicki has never been shy about the fact that winning over the medical establishment is not her top priority. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, is another matter.</p>



<p>The regulatory status of 23andMe’s genetic tests was always murky in those early years. Consumer genetics was such a new space, and regulators had almost no precedent on which to base rules. Still, the relationship between 23andMe and the FDA started out amicably: Wojcicki counts David Kessler, who served as the agency’s head from 1990–97, as a friend and close advisor. The company maintained open lines of communication with the FDA throughout its rise, even as the agency maintained a relatively hands-off stance.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When it was just a few Silicon Valley nerds buying these kits online, no one cared.”</p>
kathy hibbs</blockquote>



<p>This started to change in 2010, when a rival company began selling genetic tests at Walgreens. As Kathy Hibbs, 23andMe’s head of legal, describes it, this caused a range of power brokers—from lawmakers to regulators—to perk up their ears.</p>



<p>“When it was just a few Silicon Valley nerds buying these kits online, no one cared,” Hibbs says. “When it starts to look like a mass consumer product—that’s when people pay attention.”</p>



<p>Government engagements—including a grilling from US senators—started filling Wojcicki’s calendar. As the highest-profile consumer genetic testing company, 23andMe attracted the brightest spotlight. But the company also proved uniquely willing to place itself under scrutiny. After the FDA announced it would devise a set of rules for how such firms should engage with customers, 23andMe offered to help with the task—a big mistake, in Hibbs’ telling. “In hindsight, the company probably should’ve just stayed quiet.”</p>



<p>This is because it provided an opening for regulators to request ever more copious data from the company and for them to look askance at every perceived slip-up. 23andMe’s rapid growth targets and relatively lean resources during this time meant that fulfilling sales orders took priority over the cumbersome process of filling out regulatory documents. “They didn’t brush off the FDA intentionally,” Hibbs says. “It was more, ‘We’re a small company and have to get ready for the holidays.’”</p>



<p>As the FDA started growing impatient, 23andMe failed to grasp the agency’s increasingly strident tone. “They simply didn’t speak the same language,” Hibbs explains. “Someone should do dramatic readings of the calls from that time—you could have John Lithgow on one side and Glenn Close on the other. They were really talking past each other.”</p>



<p>The FDA’s restraint eventually crumbled. It was Friday, November 22, 2013. 23andMe was flush with optimism: it had recently broken a sales goal and was sitting on over $100 million in venture funding. Wojcicki was at a company offsite when her assistant texted that she’d received a letter from the FDA. Wojcicki immediately had a bad feeling. “Don’t sign for it,” she texted back, preferring for it to languish in a mail storage facility so “I could at least enjoy my weekend,” she says with a laugh.</p>



<p>But Wojcicki was too late. The letter was a strongly-worded order for 23andMe to immediately stop promoting its product. Its intent and tone were crystal clear. “Some of the uses for which [the product] is intended are particularly concerning,” the letter read. “Even after many interactions with 23andMe, we still do not have any assurance that the firm has analytically or clinically validated [the product] for its intended uses. Therefore, 23andMe must immediately discontinue marketing [it] until such time as it receives FDA marketing authorization.”</p>



<p>Wojcicki’s first instinct was to fight. She thought of suing the FDA. Her second instinct was to call everyone she knew who might be able to help. This proved wise: when she spoke with Kessler, the former FDA commissioner, he told her in no uncertain terms that if she defied the order, she would go to jail. Hibbs hedges on this somewhat, but agrees that criminal charges could follow. “It was like a bad breakup letter,” Hibbs says. “Most companies don’t come back from letters like that.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m so used to being the straight-A student—I became obsessed with proving them wrong.”</p>
anne Wojcicki</blockquote>



<p>The insult turned into injury when, in an unusual move, the agency posted the letter on its website the following Monday, attracting widespread media coverage. A sense of crisis swept through the company. Its then-head of communications resigned. But Wojcicki held firm. “They were insinuating that our product was harmful,” she says. “I’m so used to being the straight-A student—I became obsessed with proving them wrong.”</p>



<p>Tapping her personal network, she poached Hibbs from her post at another genetic testing company, tasking her with leading the effort to win FDA approval. The crux of the challenge was proving that consumers could grasp the implications of uncovering facts about their genome without a doctor in the chain of communication. It is a hurdle makers of over-the-counter pills like Tylenol have to overcome every time they market a new product: can shoppers understand how to take the medication? Do they appreciate the risks and know how to minimize them?</p>



<p>No maker of direct-to-consumer DNA tests had ever grappled with these kinds of questions. According to Wojcicki, many of them employ a “doc in the box” model, in which an invisible doctor rubber-stamps the delivery of a genetic report every time an average Jane requests it. This raises cost and inconvenience. Worse yet, it presumes people are incapable of digesting fundamental information about their own genome. Hibbs compares this to the heavy resistance healthcare bigwigs showed toward at-home pregnancy tests when they first emerged. “The medical establishment fought those tests for years,” Hibbs says. “They honestly thought women could not handle receiving this information at home alone. It is ironic that this situation was playing out again even after people fought so hard to let women read their own pregnancy tests.”</p>



<p>The months following the FDA letter were a hectic scramble to collect this user data through comprehension studies—focus groups where people demonstrate their understanding of a medical product. The data has to be collected in a way that satisfies the FDA’s requirements for diversity, rigor and statistical significance. All told, 23andMe surveyed thousands of people across a wide demographic, even as it was losing money and unable to bring in new revenue due to the moratorium on marketing.</p>



<p>Frustration simmered within the company throughout the saga. Wojcicki, however, was determined to see the setback as an opportunity to not just tick regulatory boxes, but to spark a paradigm shift in the relationship between consumers and their medical information. “The average FDA submission of this type is a few hundred pages; ours was over 7,000,” Wojcicki says—a deluge of data that was meant to prod exactly this kind of broader reckoning. Wojcicki now believes that it paved the way for more breakthroughs in data transparency, such as a federal regulation issued in 2014 that requires medical providers to send patients their lab results the same time they send them to the doctor.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m the kind of person who snaps into action in these kinds of situations.”</p>
anne Wojcicki</blockquote>



<p>Ultimately, what might have constituted an existential crisis to a less committed CEO never rattled Wojcicki. “I’m the kind of person who snaps into action in these kinds of situations,” she says. “My only real worry was how long it was going to take.” Indeed, the company spent well over a year in the wilderness: after painstakingly collecting the data in the months after receiving the cease-and-desist letter, it submitted its application to the FDA in June 2014. In February 2015, it received regulatory authorization to market a genetic health test directly to consumers.</p>



<p>“I have a level of stubbornness that’s apparent to anyone who knows me,” Wojcicki says. Roelof Botha, the Sequoia partner who works with 23andMe and helped it go public in 2021, cites this mix of pragmatism and dogged determination among Wojcicki’s best qualities. “She’s unconventional, but she’s also totally unpretentious,” he says. “She has obviously been very successful, and she is just who she is and very comfortable in her own skin—what you see is what you get. And that makes for a very efficient business relationship, because there’s very little pretense, very little bravado. She’s just direct.”</p>



<p>Botha now sees promise in 23andMe’s current mandate to leverage its massive genetic database to develop treatments for illnesses; in 2018 the company entered into a <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-announces-extension-gsk-collaboration-and-update-joint">partnership</a> with British pharmaceuticals giant GSK to discover and develop drugs based on genetic information in 23andMe’s DNA library from customers who agreed it could be used for this purpose. “I look forward to having several blockbuster drugs a decade from now,” Botha says. “That to me is the real vision and potential of the company.”</p>



<p>That 23andMe not only continues to dominate its field but could eventually evolve into a pharmaceuticals powerhouse is a testament to its integrity in an industry where principles and profit sometimes make for uneasy bedfellows. Our conversations take place during the trial of Elizabeth Holmes, of Theranos infamy—a cautionary tale about how wrong things can go in biotech without a commitment to integrity. Many have placed gender at the heart of the Theranos controversy. Wojcicki permits that gender played a role in the scandal but is hesitant to ascribe specific meaning to it. “I have no doubt it would have been different if she was a man, but I don’t know exactly how,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question of gender has followed Wojcicki’s own career since it started. She emphasizes the importance of elevating women in her organization, even agreeing when asked if she would prefer that the next leader of 23andMe—as far off as that might be—is a woman. Equality is her top priority, however, and she acknowledges that the pendulum can swing too far in the opposite direction: in 23andMe’s early days, the company had “too many women,” as Wojcicki puts it. “We reached a point where I was like, ‘I need men to balance it out!’,” she recalls. “Women tend to flock to work with other women, especially when they’re coming from these heavily male-dominated places.”</p>



<p>One place that certainly was not male dominated was Wojcicki’s childhood home, where she and her two sisters enjoyed a relationship with their parents in which the very idea of “dominance” was completely alien. Her mother Esther, a former teacher who recently published a book about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Raise-Successful-People-Lessons/dp/1328974863">raising successful children</a>, frequently writes and speaks about the importance of questioning authority and challenging preconceived notions of who gets to call the shots.</p>



<p>This ethos forms the core of how Wojcicki now leads 23andMe, whose culture she describes as one of cooperation and willingness to participate in non-ego driven pursuits. It is also one where scientific inquisitiveness and a desire to constantly push the boundaries of discovery are more important than always finding the “right” answer.</p>



<p>“We are very much about recognizing interesting problems and coming up with collective solutions. Sometimes I find people with the right DNA for us, who didn’t flourish because they weren’t in the right environment, but who go on to flourish with us.”</p>



<p>Framing her management ethos in terms of those age-old dance partners—DNA and environment—is of a piece with Wojcicki’s overall worldview, one in which genes and circumstances interact to create a whole human being, in which exploring where one factor begins and the other ends is worthy of a category-defining company and mountains of scientific innovation. Yet despite this audacious ambition, the energy in Wojcicki’s voice as she describes her experiences discovering her roots belies a more down-to-earth motivation: the need to simply and deeply comprehend one’s place in the world.</p>



<p>“Going back to see my father’s hometown, to the apartment he lived in, to taste the food he ate…in the back of my mind I was always thinking, ‘what if it was me?’”</p>

<p>The unprecedented speed and success of mRNA vaccines in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the demand for mRNA as a next-generation nucleic acid therapy. Hundreds of ongoing clinical trials are currently testing mRNA across more than 20 disease categories. The current production process, called In Vitro Transcription (IVT), has been successfully scaled up but produces immunostimulatory byproducts such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), is limited to shorter mRNA products and requires expensive reagents, including very pure DNA plasmids and proprietary enzymes to catalyze the reactions. Sensible Bio has developed a proprietary system to produce mRNA in living cells. By leveraging natural internal cellular processes combined with synthetic biology and biomimetic approaches, Sensible’s platform aims to produce longer mRNA, free of immunogenic contaminants (such as dsRNA), while enabling the production of mRNA with natural modifications, all key attributes for mRNA therapeutics — while lowering production costs by an order of magnitude.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>The mRNA therapeutics market exceeded $40 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow to $130 billion by 2030. We believe that Sensible Bio’s mRNA production platform could potentially replace today’s In Vitro Transcription method for many applications, especially in mRNA therapeutics that require longer mRNA and higher doses. While the company’s initial focus will be on manufacturing best-in-class mRNA and partnering with biotech companies developing mRNA therapeutics, over time they could potentially integrate mRNA design and delivery systems, creating an end-to-end mRNA platform.</p><p>We look forward to joining <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslavgasparek/">Miro</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marian-kupculak-34468a85/">Marian</a> and the <a href="https://www.sensible.bio/">Sensible Bio</a> team on their journey.

<p>A recap of our Nym core team at ETHDenver</p><p>Following The Merge in September 2022, the Ethereum network became <a href="https://medium.com/nymtech/congratulations-on-the-merge-now-to-cure-the-hangover-with-a-strong-dose-of-privacy-c4b0c8eb46ea">more vulnerable to validator privacy issues</a>. Two months later, a hefty community push back occurred following revelations that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/24/ethereum-software-firm-consensys-reveals-it-collects-user-data/">user data including wallet addresses was being collected by Consensys</a> through Infura and Metamask.</p><p>The issue of privacy in Web3 became more pressing than ever&nbsp;before.</p><p>Web3 conferences this year to date have had more privacy-focused sessions than in previous years. This year’s ETHDenver continued this trend which is a massive signal that the web3 community is concerned about&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The Nym team was proud to have the opportunity to be front and centre of this privacy discussion drive, alongside other Universal Privacy Alliance (UPA) members. Here’s a quick summary of what went&nbsp;on:</p> UPA Mini Privacy&nbsp;Summit <p>Watch the full summit here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FK_zjOLNWQ&amp;t=288s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FK_zjOLNWQ&amp;t=288s</a></p><p>ETHDenver week kicked off with the UPA mini privacy summit, organised in collaboration with other UPA members — <a href="https://electriccoin.co/">Electric Coin Co.</a>, <a href="https://www.manta.network/">Manta Network</a>, <a href="https://www.orchid.com/">Orchid Protocol</a>, <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Network</a>, <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec Protocol</a>, <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> and <a href="https://mobilecoin.com/">MobileCoin</a>.</p><p>The opening keynote was done by Juan Benet, Founder of Protocol Labs and creator of IPFS on “Modern Orwellian states &amp; How to prevent&nbsp;them”.</p><p>Watch the keynote here: <a href="https://youtu.be/6FK_zjOLNWQ?t=29">https://youtu.be/6FK_zjOLNWQ?t=29</a></p><p>How to beat surveillance capitalism and reclaim your&nbsp;privacy</p><p>Watch the full panel here: <a href="https://youtu.be/6FK_zjOLNWQ?t=4403">https://youtu.be/6FK_zjOLNWQ?t=4403</a></p><p>Nym General Counsel Ahmed Ghappour joined this panel discussion with Electric Coin Co. SVP Growth, Product Strategy and Regulatory Affairs Josh Swihart, Secret Labs CEO Guy Zyskind and Orchid Protocol Head of Product Travis&nbsp;Cannell.</p><p>The discussion was moderated by Nym Head of PR &amp; Communications Candice&nbsp;Teo.</p><p>Inspiring and open insights on the following questions were provided:</p>  How are enterprises getting away with surveillance capitalism? Are we rationalising the situation with resigned cynicism or are we swayed by the propaganda that this is technological inevitability?  Are governments truly motivated to implement preventive measures against surveillance capitalism given the overlapping objectives?  Has surveillance capitalism reached saturation point or will the advent of web3 companies “innovate” it further, causing even more danger to us as a&nbsp;society?  Can tokenisation offer alternative ownership and business models to surveillance capitalism?  What is the fastest route for us to reclaim our privacy? Is it regulation or can we build our way out of it especially with the unprecedented innovation we have seen in our web3&nbsp;space?  What should we stop doing and what should we start&nbsp;doing?  <p>How can developers protect themselves and adhere to regulations?</p><p>Ahmed also later presented a keynote on “Criminal cases in the ecosystem — how can developers protect themselves and adhere to regulations?”. He broke down past cases for everyone and details of regulatory impact including:</p>  Same statues used in civil and criminal&nbsp;arenas  Parallel investigations done across agencies — OFAC, DOJ,&nbsp;SEC  Sufficient-ness of projects compliance program  Tornado Cash — redesignation done and the agency exercising powers against an algorithm  AML programs  How all of us, both developers and government alike, have to do better about understanding the distinction between speech (and the content of speech) and&nbsp;conduct.   Enabling the Nym mixnet with&nbsp;Metamask <p>Watch the full session here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrDVRhrfYT8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrDVRhrfYT8</a></p><p>Watch the demo video here: <a href="https://youtu.be/GQ836n2j0pU">https://youtu.be/GQ836n2j0pU</a></p><p>At the ETHDenver main conference, Nym CEO Harry Halpin presented on “How to stop your wallet from collecting your personal data: Enabling the Nym mixnet with Metamask”, recapping the privacy issues in Ethereum, Nym tools and what developers can do to ensure privacy for and as&nbsp;users:</p>  No existing solution can defend against mass surveillance  Integration components to run app traffic through the Nym&nbsp;mixnet  Nym mixnet&nbsp;clients  Running a Nym proxy to access RPCs like Infura (privately)  Setting up a proxy&nbsp;yourself  Running your own private RPC&nbsp;node  Demo on a Nym integration with Metamask +&nbsp;roadmap  Validator privacy issues in&nbsp;Ethereum  Development of a new libp2p module to enhance validator privacy with Chainsafe   Cosmos on&nbsp;Tap <p>With Nym being chain-agnostic, it is the best way to bring privacy as default to a global level. This means that we need to tool developers in all ecosystems to integrate privacy by design whether they are building apps, wallets or other services.</p><p>Built using Cosmos SDK, Nym is on a mission to drive interchain privacy. We co-organised Cosmos on Tap: A Cosmos pub talk with other Cosmos projects: <a href="https://evmos.org/">Evmos</a>, <a href="https://akash.network/">Akash Network</a>, <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a>, <a href="https://injective.com/">Injective</a> and <a href="https://www.althea.net/">Althea Network</a> to enable Ethereum developers to find out more about the ecosystem.</p><p>Nym CTO Dave Hrycyszyn spoke on the first panel, “Enhancing Cosmos for Developers” alongside Evmos Co-founder Nic Z. and Secret Foundation Tor Bair. The panel was moderated by Althea Network CEO Deborah&nbsp;Simpier.</p><p>The second panel of the evening was “Cosmos: Infrastructure that Scales” with Akash Network CTO Adam Bozanich and Injective Labs CEO Eric Chen, again moderated by Althea Network CEO Deborah&nbsp;Simpier.</p> Privacy is normal at ETHDenver <p>In a conference-first, ETHDenver hosted a privacy special on the main stage on the last day, with a stellar line-up for privacy advocates and experts. Nym CEO Harry Halpin and Nym GC Ahmed Ghappour joined the following sessions:</p><p>Plausible Deniability</p><p>Watch full fireside chat here: <a href="https://youtu.be/i3zgrqijLSI">https://youtu.be/i3zgrqijLSI</a></p><p>This fireside focused on practical considerations for builders in privacy who want to protect their own privacy, maintain a low profile and/or operate pseudonymously. Nym GC Ahmed Ghappour joined Tor Founder Roger Dingledine to discuss tools that such builders should use and best practices to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>One key takeaway from Ahmed is for builders to educate themselves. There is a need to educate the regulator and government generally, but builders should also educate themselves to really understand the difference between content of code versus&nbsp;conduct.</p><p>On the Front&nbsp;Lines</p><p>Watch full panel discussion here: <a href="https://youtu.be/y-2XP-sDRqQ">https://youtu.be/y-2XP-sDRqQ</a></p><p>In one of the most fascinating panel discussions, Nym CEO Harry Halpin joined Aleo CEO Alex Pruden, Polygon zkEVM Technical Lead Jordi Baylina, Filecoin Foundation Associate GC Kurt Ophsahl and two other activists Abdo Al Rayyis and Jarrel James, to share their experiences fighting against authoritarian regimes. This panel of freedom fighters provided practical insights on the actual tools they rely on and how they use them, where those tools could be better and which tools are still&nbsp;lacking.</p><p>Other privacy&nbsp;sessions</p><p>Watch the other insightful, practical and inspiring sessions&nbsp;here:</p>  Keynote by Sherri Davidoff: <a href="https://youtu.be/kTZ0hPPkevo">https://youtu.be/kTZ0hPPkevo</a>  Keynote by Roger Dingledine: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8rdUK1s9tg">https://youtu.be/D8rdUK1s9tg</a>  Fireside chat with Frances Haugen and Leslie Katz <a href="https://youtu.be/HCIvNEZtjKg">https://youtu.be/HCIvNEZtjKg</a>  Panel discussion, “Take a stand”: <a href="https://youtu.be/tv8Fq3FJmwo">https://youtu.be/tv8Fq3FJmwo</a>  Panel discussion, “Privacy by design”: <a href="https://youtu.be/JTHP2hfhf_c">https://youtu.be/JTHP2hfhf_c</a>  Panel discussion, “We almost didn’t get encryption”: <a href="https://youtu.be/iZX40TFq8Ts">https://youtu.be/iZX40TFq8Ts</a>  Panel discussion, “Privacy vs security”: <a href="https://youtu.be/Eba0Xj2vEKU">https://youtu.be/Eba0Xj2vEKU</a>   Privacy should be normal in&nbsp;Ethereum <p>It was incredible to see the recognition and interest of the importance of privacy at ETHDenver this year. With packed out audiences and post-session discussions from builders, we are confident that this momentum will continue beyond Denver. The Ethereum ecosystem has a way to go in becoming privacy-preserving and secure but the mission to change that has already&nbsp;started.</p><p>Major thanks to the ETHDenver team for the opportunities to privacy-enhance ETHDenver and we look forward to seeing the subsequent impact on building privacy by&nbsp;default.</p><p>Useful links</p><p><a href="https://privacyalliance.com/">Universal Privacy Alliance&nbsp;(UPA)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/priv_alliance">UPA Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p><a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/">Blog</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/ethereum-was-never-designed-with-privacy-in-mind-d45039e5c692">“Ethereum was never designed with privacy in mind”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Integration of Nym with Woleet’s platform to advance privacy by default in French&nbsp;tech</p><p>Paris, France — Wednesday, 05 April 2023: Today, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym</a>, the leader in network layer privacy, and <a href="https://www.woleet.io/">Woleet</a>, the proof system for modern companies, have announced a partnership that will benefit thousands of users of Woleet’s file certification tool&nbsp;suite.</p><p>This partnership of two French companies will first launch with an integration of the Nym mixnet with the Woleet platform as a transport layer to enhance the privacy of Woleet users, which include multinational corporations like <a href="https://www.kering.com/en/">Kering</a>, <a href="https://www.danone.com">Danone</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chanel.com/">Chanel</a>.</p><p>Nym COO Alexis Roussel said, “We have been using Woleet’s e-signatory tool as a long term customer. We are very satisfied by the technology used by Woleet. This partnership is an organic extension of ensuring the privacy-preserving tools that we use get the maximum privacy protection which is by using&nbsp;Nym.”</p><p>“Following our <a href="https://nymtech.medium.com/privacy-and-the-future-of-french-tech-81cac26e52c1">recent official launch of Nym France</a> at Paris Blockchain Week, securing a partnership with a prolific French tech company is a step in the right direction and validates our decision to invest in France.” adds&nbsp;Alexis.</p><p>Woleet Founder &amp; CEO Gilles Cadignan said, “One of the biggest advantages of using Woleet compared to other competitors in the digital trust space, has always been privacy. Thanks to cryptography we are able to protect enterprise data without accessing their actual content.”</p><p>“With this partnership with Nym, Woleet aims to push forward towards even more privacy for our users, having in mind the ultimate goal of empowering users with more control over their sensitive data,” he&nbsp;adds.</p><p>A second, larger, integration will explore the use of Nym’s anonymous credentials system, <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">zk-nyms</a>, in <a href="https://doc.woleet.io/docs/woleetid-server">Woleet’s ID server</a>. This will allow users to sign documents without leaking unnecessary personal information.</p><p>Both Nym and Woleet have a long-standing reputation for privacy-first in their services, which run on blockchain technology. In particular, Woleet uses the Bitcoin blockchain to timestamp files that are certified by their platform.</p><p>Combining privacy technology with Web3 serves to provide a robust solution that allows users to retain data sovereignty while benefiting from the security and digital tamper-resistance properties of decentralisation. These are all integral to both large corporations and small startups, who have turned fully digital and need to protect their customers.</p><p>Woleet users can expect their services to fully run on the Nym mixnet within the&nbsp;year.</p><p>- END&nbsp;-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance.</p><p>About Woleet</p><p>Woleet is a French startup created in 2016. The goal is to democratize digital security and minimize centralized trust. Woleet provides a new approach to digital trust based on the Bitcoin protocol. With Woleet, all companies are able to create irrefutable and international evidence of electronic signature and time&nbsp;stamp.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Candice Teo, <a href="mailto:candice@nymtech.net">candice@nymtech.net</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-brings-enhanced-privacy-to-woleets-secured-file-certification-platform-635416d79753">Press release: Nym brings enhanced privacy to Woleet’s secured file certification platform</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

    <p>We achieved several major milestones in the development of EON, Horizen’s public EVM-compatible sidechain and smart contracting platform. These milestones include the releases of two separate testnet environments, Dune and Yuma; a new version of Cobalt wallet to support EON testnet functionalities; and other developer tools such as explorers and test token faucet.</p>
<p>Also during Q1, we released three core software upgrades with functionalities to support EON, and <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zend-node-application-disclosure-and-fixes/">fixed a security vulnerability</a> in the ZEND node application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 EON Testnet Environments – Dune and Yuma 
<p>Dune is the pre-alpha and invite-only testnet for EON. It was launched on January 18 and welcomed a small group of 90+ developers to test the platform.<a href="https://yuma.horizen.io"> Yuma</a> is the temporary public testnet for EON that came after Dune. Yuma testnet is public and accessible for anyone to test and try out Horizen’s first public EVM. We were excited to see an even larger influx of developer activities on Yuma, releasing the testnet to a wider pool of testers. Much of their feedback was tremendously helpful in gearing up for our permanent public testnet, Gobi! </p>
<p>Both testnets are important milestones before launching EON to Gobi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yuma testnet is a big upgrade of Dune with key new capabilities and improvements:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Learn more about these new capabilities on Yuma<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-evm-eon-is-now-live-on-yuma-public-testnet/"> here</a>.</p>
 EON Developer Tools and Resources 
<p>We released a set of easy-to-use developer and end-user tools to the EON platform:</p>
 
 <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">EON App</a> with support for <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/cross-chain-transactions/#backward-transfers">backward transfer</a>&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://faucet.horizen.io">Test token faucet&nbsp;</a> 
 <a href="https://horizen.io/wallets/cobalt">Cobalt wallet</a> with built-in testnet faucet and other EVM support 
 <a href="https://yuma.horizen.io">Testnet status dashboards</a> 
 <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/docs">EON documentation</a> 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhZisbhyYIXI4IPY072Q6HDDLi1hAYAp_">EON tutorials</a> 
 
 EON Partnership and Integrations 
<p></p>
<p>In addition to the tools built-in-house, the EON platform is integrated with supported by popular 3rd party tools and products that provide developers and users a streamlined and easy user experience.&nbsp;</p>
 
 ThirdWeb: A low-code web3 development platform, offering smart contract libraries and deployments along with a series of SDKs and APIs including connectivity with Shopify. 
 Revoke.Cash: A preventative tool that helps users practice proper wallet hygiene.&nbsp; 
 Chainlist: Chainlist is a list of EVM networks. Users can use the information to connect their wallets and Web3 middleware providers to the appropriate Chain ID and Network ID to connect to the correct chain. 
 BlockScout: The first fully-featured open-source blockchain explorer available for use by any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain 
 Web3.js: Ethereum JavaScript API 
 Remix: The Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) with a GUI for developing smart contracts. 
 Truffle: A popular development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for developing applications on EVM-based blockchains. 
 Hardhat: A popular Ethereum development environment for developers 
 MetaMask: A popular self-custodial wallet that interacts with the Ethereum and EMV-compatible blockchains. 
 
 
 Multichain: A popular cross-chain bridge with high transaction speeds and no-slippage swaps. 
 
<p>More integrations and products are being added to the EON ecosystem.</p>
 What’s Next for EON – Gobi &amp; Mainnet Preview 
<p>With Yuma, we have registered the first non-ceasable sidechain in testnet. We had to fork the mainchain to upgrade ZEND ahead of time. Gobi will be non-ceasable as well and on the official track.</p>
<p>Gobi will be registered with a setup that will be the same as we will have in mainnet.</p>
<p>47 validators will be active in securing the chain, while there will be more nodes to serve our public RPC other than the nodes dedicated to the EON block explorer.</p>
<p>Among the new features Gobi will bring:</p>
 
 Improved performance 
 Websocket support 
 Security improvements 
 Autoscaling RPC nodes based on demand 
 
<p>When the EON chain is up and running, the team will bring the secure enclave for certificate signing as well.</p>
<p>We will also be launching a bug bounty program and developer grant program in the next phases.</p>

					Making zero-knowledge applications Faster		    
     
 


 
         
    <p>There are two industry-significant updates from the <a href="https://horizenlabs.io">Horizen Labs</a> cryptography team:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/323">Poseidon2:</a> The Horizen Labs team has upgraded the default hash function for zero-knowledge (zk) applications by introducing Poseidon2, an enhanced version of Poseidon.</p>
<p>The Poseidon hash function is currently the default choice for zero-knowledge applications such as zkEVMs, zkVMs, Mina, and various applications within Polygon. Poseidon2 can replace any instance of Poseidon in all zero-knowledge applications, bringing faster hashing speeds to all.</p>
<p>RC64, is another new hash function. There are two scenarios where hashes are needed, in&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) everyday (cryptographic) plain computations, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) circuit (re: SNARK) computations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen Labs cryptography team created the new RC64 hash function that works best for both scenarios. If there is a need for both everyday and circuit computations, using RC64 is preferable over Poseidon2.&nbsp;</p>

 ZenIP 42204: Deprecation of Shielded Pools from Horizen Mainchain 
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204</a>&nbsp;proposed the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain.&nbsp;The purpose of ZenIP 42204 is to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risks.&nbsp;It proposes a solution to eliminate technical debt and avoid regulatory threats that can prevent the greater Horizen community from fully and freely participating in our ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenIP 42204 was met with&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/community-survey-results-are-in-for-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">overwhelmingly positive support from the community</a>, when asked if they are in agreement with ZenIP 42204, 75.3% of survey takers are favorable, 12.7% are neutral, and 11.9% are not favorable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the majority of votes and feedback we have received are in agreement with ZenIP 42204, we will be moving forward with this proposal and plan the changes into a future ZEND software release.&nbsp;<a href="https://podcast.horizen.io/episode/2-removal-of-shielded-pools">Episode 2 of our Beyond the Horizen Podcast</a>&nbsp;goes into further detail on ZenIP 42204 and next steps.&nbsp;</p>

 Events 
 ETHDENVER 
<p>Some members of the Horizen team were in Denver this year for the annual ETHDenver event! This was an immensely valuable event for the team, we were able to have numerous excellent conversations and reconnect with partners, both old and new. We noticed that the major narratives of the event were cross-chain communication and interoperability, zero knowledge, and a future of easier/more user-friendly onboarding from both the developer and user sides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to hosting events at ETHDENVER next year!</p>
 PARIS BLOCKCHAIN WEEK SUMMIT 
<p></p>
<p>Members of the team were at Paris Blockchain this year and thoroughly enjoyed attending the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a wide range of panels and talks, but some of our favorites focused on Web3 and its impact on various industries such as sports, gaming, luxury, and more, NFTs and DeFi, educational talks around user security, and a discussion on CBDCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were able to say hello to a few of our partners, as well as friends, overall the event was quite successful! We hope to be in attendance next year as well.</p>

<p>Today, Brave is launching its Self-Serve Ads Program. These new tools allow brands to set up and run advertising for their products and services within the privacy-preserving Brave Ads and Rewards ecosystem. This is an important next step on our roadmap for Brave and the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token</a> (BAT) to provide effective advertising that protects users’ privacy.</p>
<p>The Brave Ads Self-Serve Program allows brands to set up and run ad campaigns in the Brave Browser and Search ecosystem with minimal assistance from the Brave team. Initially, the Brave Ads Self-Serve Program invites brands to run English-language campaigns in <a>countries currently supported by Brave Ads</a>. We plan to introduce support for additional languages over time.</p>
<p>The program is also an opportunity for brands who are new to Brave to join, and provide feedback and to improve our Brave Ads products.</p>
<p>The Self-Serve Program offers the ability for brands to purchase campaigns to run in the Brave Ads Push Notification ad unit. Over time, the team will be introducing Brave News Ads and Brave Search Ads units to self-serve to be available to directly purchase within the platform.</p>
<p>Advertisers participating in the program will also receive beta access to new self-serve features as we introduce them into the system over time, and will have the opportunity to provide direct feedback and have access to our Brave Ads Product and Brave Research teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave’s direct sales team will continue to sell New Tab Takeovers (formerly named Sponsored Images). These assets will not be available within self-serve given the curated image selection and approval process. However, if program participants express interest in purchasing Sponsored Images, they will be connected with our Sales team to help facilitate that process.</p>
<p>A minimum campaign spend of $1,000 USD per month is required to participate in the self-serve program. Advertisers are required to pre-pay, with either BAT or USD.</p>
<p>Advertisers enrolled in the Brave Ads Self-Serve Program are eligible to receive a 50% discount on their first campaign, <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/10800687258637-How-do-I-buy-crypto-with-Brave-Wallet-">if they purchase their campaign with BAT</a>. Additional campaign discounts for purchasing campaigns with BAT will be available throughout the program.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a>Our current advertising policies</a> will apply to brands in the program; human review will remain a part of the process to ensure the safety of Brave’s users, and preserve the integrity of our brand and product.</p>

 Background 
<p>Brave Ads were first launched in early 2019, available to Brave users who opted-in to <a>Brave Rewards</a>, from Brave’s <a href="https://www.investinblockchain.com/brave-browser-surpasses-5-million/">5.5 million monthly active user</a> base at the time. The concept of advertising with privacy was new to most advertisers (and Brave’s ad platform remains a unique offering still in 2023), so Brave Ads were brought to market as a managed service to help educate and learn with our customers. Brave’s teams of sellers, account managers, operations, finance, and engineering work together to bring in customers and deploy their campaigns into the Brave ecosystem. The managed service approach helps Brave provide white glove service with education on Brave and Brave Ads, while keeping an established onboarding and payment process in place that brands are familiar with.</p>
<p>Brave has since grown significantly, with our user base now at 57 million monthly and 21 million daily active users. The Brave Ads platform and offerings have also grown from one ad unit to <a>four ad units</a> across various Brave products that brands can use to communicate their story and grow their customer base. Brave Search ads are also rolling out and will get access to our 23 million daily queries and over 8 billion annualized queries.</p>
<p>Brave Ads campaigns have also been supported in nearly 200 countries with over 7.5 billion ad confirmation events to date, and there have been over 6,600 campaigns since the inception from over 900 advertisers, from mainstream brands such as Ford, PayPal, Toyota, Mastercard, Intel, Chipotle, Crocs, BMW, Keurig, American Express, Budweiser, Walmart, Amazon, and The Home Depot, as well as from crypto giants like Binance, Coinbase, eToro, Ledger, NEAR, and Solana. The time has come for Brave to bring the Brave Ads Self-Serve Program to market, and grow the ecosystem even further.</p>

 Getting Started 
<p>Brands looking to participate in the program can head over to our Brave Ads <a>Self-Serve Program page</a> to learn more, or to complete and submit the form to join the program’s waitlist. The Brave Ads team will be onboarding groups of advertisers from the waitlist, based on available supply across Brave Ads inventory.</p>
<p>We are excited to enter the next phase of the Brave Ads and Rewards ecosystem with the introduction of the Self-Serve Program, as the Ads platform becomes easily accessible to a broader range of global brands and marketers.</p>

Dive into <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1634108708950097921?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">our recent Twitter thread</a> to see the different components and use cases that we plan to roll out in the journey toward v1. <br></p><p>As Q1 2023 is coming to an end, let’s see how we fared in meeting our quarterly goals for it.<br></p> Q1 2023 <p>As we enter Q2, we are thrilled to announce the successful implementation of some key initiatives that mark a significant milestone in our journey toward decentralization and privacy solutions for institutions and retail users alike.<br></p> New website<br> <p>Firstly, our new website is being coded into existence as you read this. And…<br></p>Ta-da! We’re debuting a new image and style for our revamped site.<p>The new site introduces a style, brand, and messaging change. As Product and compliance design are cemented and brought into life, we’re increasingly confident in the utility Panther can and will have for institutions. This look is meant to reflect it. Accordingly, the contents of the website will reflect a more comprehensive look at our Product’s capabilities and use cases.<br></p><p>As per “a chain-agnostic privacy layer,” we believe this term nicely overcomes one of our most complex branding and marketing challenges to date: explaining Panther in a short sentence. “Chain-agnostic” refers to how you will be able to access Panther’s privacy from many different chains, with no preference towards any L1 or L2, while also being able to move between chains. Meanwhile, “privacy layer” refers to how Panther’s ecosystem benefits from a shared privacy set, allowing users of different chains to privately access DeFi while having the right to opt between privacy and transparency, getting in and out of the privacy layer.<br></p><p>We can’t wait for you to see the rest of the changes we’re introducing!<br></p> Improved documentation<br> A sneak peek into our new documentation structure (but there is more!)<p>In addition to the website revamp, we have also finished updates to Panther’s documentation, marking the beginning of a new era where documentation will be a live process with constant updates and growth.<br></p><p>Our updated documentation is more intuitive and user-friendly, with sections dedicated to stakeholders, retail users, and financial institutions. Furthermore, the new documentation covers essential topics such as Panther’s approach to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and zk-SNARKS. We've also updated critical sections on MASPs, fee structures, DeFi adaptors, and cryptographic primitives.<br></p><p>While some sections are still a work in progress, this approach marks a significant departure from our previous static documentation approach and underscores our commitment to continuous improvement. The documentation itself is experiencing its final review and will be live for you to see it soon!<br></p> $ZKP is being listed in MEXC <p></p>PIP-12 on Snapshot<p>In February, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x742a7667af3d6277d88817c8a3d4ec70006575154d36a4a67bcbe4f5e536d1aa">PIP-12</a> was passed with an approval rating of 98.97%. This proposal involved listing <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/token/about?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/MEXC_Global?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">MEXC Global</a>, a well-known and trusted centralized exchange. In light of this, we initiated the listing process.<br></p><p>The MEXC listing is particularly significant as it will allow Panther users to deposit and withdraw ZKP on Polygon, which complements Panther’s v1 release.<br></p><p>Moreover, the Panther DAO sees the decision to list on MEXC as a strategic move to enhance the Panther ecosystem’s liquidity. <br></p><p>On their side, MEXC Global has commenced voting for the listing of $ZKP as part of its pre-launch listing campaign. This process allows users to stake tokens and cast their votes in support of their preferred project, with the chance to get some tokens airdropped to them. MEXC's goal is to identify and promote high-quality projects to its community, and this listing campaign serves as a crucial filter for achieving that objective. The voting period for $ZKP's listing runs from 2023-04-04 at 12:00 to 2023-04-04 at 21:50 (UTC).<br></p>MEXC’s Community Voting for $ZKP on MEXC’s Kickstarter platform is now live. Governance framework development<br> <p>Finally, as part of Phase 2 of our decentralization phase, we have made solid steps towards formalizing a much-awaited governance framework.<br></p><p>The Panther community has settled on appointing a Council as the last step toward formalizing this framework. The Council will have the core responsibility of vetting which DAO proposals are suitable to move into voting by the Panther community i.e., whether they can be objectively beneficial for the project in the long term.<br></p><p>This discussion is still ongoing on <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s Discourse forum</a>, with the community discussing the onboarding process and metrics. Feel free to join it and participate!<br></p> Technology updates<br>  A busy month as we prepare for v1’s Testnet<br> <p>As our Roadmap shows, Q2 2023 will see the release of Panther’s v1 Testnet, and, as such, many things are developing behind the scenes.<br></p><p>Among these milestones are critical components of smart contracts for fees and rewards on v1, which have already been developed and are pending connection to a Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP). &nbsp;Panther is currently clarifying the parameters for rewarding to crystallize the model before v1's MASP is finished. Contracts are almost finalized, and progress is ongoing in the area of data modeling.<br></p><p>On the KYC/KYT integration front, Panther is currently interacting with other specialists in the DeFi ecosystem to build a comprehensive solution to support compliance attestations and disclosures. We’re getting ready for a significant informational release regarding this component that will be core to Panther disrupting the PriFi scene.<br></p><p>Simultaneously, planning for the v1 dApp continues, with major progress on the UI front. This means that the development of the fully-planned dApp is expected to begin soon.<br></p><p>Panther's DeFi Adaptors design has also been solidified and is ready to become a functional interface. Additional UTXO variable functionalities were added to production too, which we will discuss in greater detail in an upcoming article.<br></p><p>By the way, did you see this <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1639324727364681737?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">alpha drop</a> related to Panther’s cryptography research?<br></p>Panther’s SNARK Research paper will be presented in Istanbul this month. v0.5.2 Upgrades and UI Development<br> <p>A DAO proposal is underway to introduce a community deployment of v0.5.2, an upgrade that features several improvements vital to building v1.<br></p><p>Simultaneously, the Panther community is discussing terms for extending the v0.5 Advanced Staking program.<br></p> Ecosystem<br>  Governance <p>Recently, the community shared a DEX liquidity PIP draft and discussed extending the Advanced Staking program for an additional four months. Keep an eye out for a proposal in the near future!<br></p>Panther’s Discourse Forum‌ ‌<p>Remember to head over to <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">the discussion forum</a> if you want to stay up to date and get involved in the Panther ecosystem's governance.<br></p> zSwap <p>For those interested in learning more about Panther's v1, our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ama-transcript-road-to-v1-w-oliver-gale-saif-akhtar/">AMA transcript</a> provides specific details on the zSwap launch, DeFi integrations, and go-to-market strategy.</p>Road to V1 Ask-Me-Anything<p>If you're curious about how zSwap could potentially address one of the biggest concerns for the future development of the Ethereum and Polygon ecosystems, read this <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1631342447933419520?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Thread🧵</a>.<br></p><p>We have also made the full recording of our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ama-transcript-road-to-v1-w-oliver-gale-saif-akhtar/">Road to v1 Ask-Me-Anything</a> available, complete with subtitles!<br></p><p></p> Media and AMAs<br> <p>Last year, Panther became a proud member of the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/r/5254f285?m=eebf5e16-f447-40b1-a284-b2d55b27ee62">Leading Privacy Alliance</a> to help make privacy-first an industry standard.

<p>When it comes to scaling blockchains, there are 2 main types of off-chain solutions: sidechains and L2s (i.e. rollups, state channels). These are all intended to scale monolithic L1 blockchains. However, the core functional layers of a blockchain could also be reinvisioned as customisable building blocks. This idea led to the creation of modular blockchains, which handle execution, consensus and data availability separately from one another, thus considerably increasing throughput.<br>Dymension is a Cosmos modular blockchain hub that acts as settlement layer for RollApps (app-specific chains).</p><p>Sebastien was joined by Barry, Head of Product at Dymension, to discuss the advantages of developing modular blockchains, their scalability and how RollApps integrate in this environment.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Barry’s background  The evolution of scaling solutions &amp; Dymension’s RollApps  The nuances of different types of rollups (L1 vs. L2, Ethereum vs. Cosmos)  The scalability trilemma and modular blockchains  Cosmos’ ICS scaling  The architecture of Dymension and its RDK  How RollApps choose the data availability layer  RollApp interoperability  Incentivising sequencer neutrality  Network roles in Dymension and differences between SDK &amp; RDK  Use cases &amp; limitations of RollApps  Future roadmap  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/shaolin_flow">Barry on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/dymensionXYZ">Dymension on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://dymension.xyz/">Dymension's website</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/TheInterop">The Interop Podcast on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/CelestiaOrg">Celestia on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture.

<p>Bonjour la France! Nym France officially opens at Paris Blockchain Week.</p><p>Nym has reached a new milestone with the official opening of Nym France during last week’s Paris Blockchain Week.</p><p>Nym has had close ties to France for a while now being an alumni of Station F, noted as the world’s largest startup campus. Nym CEO Harry Halpin was a visiting researcher at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris">INRIA Paris</a> where he led the <a href="https://nextleap.eu/">NEXTLEAP project</a> which laid the foundations for what became&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>Nym France is the first company in France to be set up purely in Bitcoin, without a traditional bank account! This is a revolutionary step which sets the pace for Nym’s ambition in the French tech ecosystem.</p><p>The foundation on the discourse of privacy has been built in French tech through projects like <a href="https://www.ledger.com/fr">Ledger</a> and <a href="https://www.arianee.org/">Arianee</a>. Nym’s vision is to further advance and push privacy firmly to the forefront alongside other French tech&nbsp;giants.</p><p>We had a phenomenal line-up of quality panelists, on Nym’s privacy work, web3 and privacy, entrepreneurship and investing in privacy projects.</p><p>Read on for the&nbsp;TL;DR…</p><p>Introduction to Nym&nbsp;France</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/igq_4MHdMwQ?feature=share&amp;t=1562">Watch the keynote</a>&nbsp;(French)</p><p>Nym COO Alexis Roussel opened with an introduction to the Nym mixnet, work done so far in privacy tech, and our vision for&nbsp;France:</p><p>Nym has a history and links with France, meaning an official set-up is the natural next step following our “graduation” from the Station F program. A strategic regional approach allows us to localise our work stream through language, culture and economy. With our headquarters in Switzerland and an office in London, Paris is ideally located as a key connector.</p><p>In establishing a French entity and therefore being in the E.U, there will be an increase in research and development opportunities, strategic partnership opportunities and access to E.U. research grants. All of these will play a key role in advancing privacy by default across the European digital&nbsp;space.</p><p>There is no Web3 without&nbsp;privacy</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/igq_4MHdMwQ?feature=share&amp;t=2624">Watch the full fireside chat</a> (English)</p><p>The highlight of the evening was a fireside chat between Chelsea Manning, famous whistleblower and Nym’s Security Consultant with Nym CSO Jaya Klara Brekke. Moderating the session was Paris Bureau Chief of Bloomberg, Alan&nbsp;Katz.</p><p>An insightful discussion was held&nbsp;on:</p>  Chelsea’s experience and insights on privacy and surveillance  Ensuring digital technologies serve ordinary people with privacy central to&nbsp;it  The effectiveness of&nbsp;GDPR  AI and cryptography  CBDCs and what it means in terms of surveillance  The data of money and who’s going to control&nbsp;it  Next type of data that may be targeted by governments following Tornado cash and the impact on a broader adoption of&nbsp;privacy  <p>Unlocking the value of&nbsp;privacy</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/igq_4MHdMwQ?feature=share&amp;t=5544">Watch full video</a>&nbsp;(French)</p><p>Next was a stellar entrepreneur panel of high profile French web3 projects. Frédéric Montagnon, Chairman and Co-founder of <a href="https://www.arianee.org/">Arianee</a> and Charles Guillemet, CTO of <a href="https://www.ledger.com/fr">Ledger</a> joined Harry Halpin, CEO of Nym, diving into the state of privacy and role of businesses and the right business models for securing&nbsp;privacy:</p>  Why privacy is important  The rise of a highly digitalised life  Data leaks and manipulation of&nbsp;data  Is privacy really a priority or just pure marketing  Capitalism by Big&nbsp;Tech  Surveillance capitalism in free&nbsp;services  Barriers to entry for small/medium businesses  The role of entrepreneurs today  Balancing three parameters: Collective interests, regulatory and&nbsp;clients  <p>Moderated by Gregory Raymond, Co-founder of <a href="https://en.thebigwhale.io/">The Big Whale</a>, France’s top web3 media outlet, the session drew many questions from the interested audience.</p><p>How can Web3 advance&nbsp;privacy?</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/igq_4MHdMwQ?feature=share&amp;t=7954">Watch full fireside chat</a>&nbsp;(French)</p><p>Nym COO Alexis Roussel and Waffle, BD of <a href="https://www.scrtlabs.com/">Secret Labs</a> explored the technical side of privacy and what tools are available today including that of Nym and Secret. The fireside chat was moderated by the one and only Blue Touff, Founder of <a href="https://reflets.info/">Reflets Info</a>, a French investigative and information hacking online media, discussion points&nbsp;include:</p>  Exploring uses cases for privacy in&nbsp;web3  Regulatory issues  Auditable privacy for the&nbsp;user  Breaking cryptography and the Nym&nbsp;network  The role and weakness of&nbsp;VPNs  Data logging in web&nbsp;browsers  Centralised vs decentralised privacy  Transparency in economic transactions  Digital identities  <p>Growing a secure digital ecosystem</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/igq_4MHdMwQ?feature=share&amp;t=9934">Watch the full panel</a> (English)</p><p>The evening’s discussions ended with a dynamic investors panel on investing in privacy preserving projects and how it ensures a secure digital ecosystem that&nbsp;scales.</p><p>On the panel was Luc Jodet, Partner of <a href="https://www.xange.vc/">XAnge</a>, Lior Messika, Founder &amp; Managing Partner of <a href="https://www.edenblock.com/">Eden Block</a>, Michiel Lescrauwaet, Managing Director of <a href="https://tioga.capital/">Tioga Capital Partners</a>, Pierre Husson,Blockchain/Crypto of <a href="https://www.bpifrance.fr/">Bpifrance</a>. The panel was moderated by Fabrice Epelboin, author of the French version of ReadWriteWeb and professor of information warfare at Science Po&nbsp;Paris.</p><p>The panel&nbsp;covered:</p>  How privacy is a larger opportunity that Web3&nbsp;itself  Balancing sovereignty for individuals and profits in the long&nbsp;term  Privacy as an investment: private (VC) and public investment  Backing missionaries and not mercenaries  Pain points across compliance, industries and&nbsp;sectors  How pre-seed/seed funding comes from Europe and then it scales in the&nbsp;US  New market disruptors  Justification of&nbsp;returns  Why B2B non-crypto cybersecurity funding is&nbsp;growing  <p>La vie&nbsp;privée</p><p>Privacy in French “la vie privée” literally translates to “the private life”. Indeed, our lives are now made up of the physical and digital realm, but all too often our integrity in the digital realm is violated.</p><p>The mission of Nym is to enable everyone’s right to privacy and digital integrity as the default. The launch of Nym France opens up further community growth and partnerships in the Francophone region uniting a movement to make privacy the default&nbsp;online.</p><p>“The way we think of privacy when in the physical realm is often seen as being different from privacy in the digital realm. For instance, it isn’t often very seen as controversial to lock your door or close your blinds. Whereas in the digital realm there’s essentially an entire business structure that’s designed around peeking through the blinds.” Chelsea&nbsp;Manning</p>The Nym team in&nbsp;France Useful links <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p><a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/">Blog</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NymFrance">French Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymfrench">French Telegram</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/privacy-and-the-future-of-french-tech-81cac26e52c1">Privacy and the future of French tech</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

They will shape our digital future for the better. Our Nymjas [ambassadors] will be the voice that advocates for privacy, decentralization, and a promising future.</p> Who can join the Nymja Ambassador program? <p>Nym community is incredibly varied — we have activists and hacktivists, privacy experts who have been around for decades and token enthusiasts entirely new to privacy but keen to get in on the next big thing to shape our digital future.

Experienced in either marketing, community management, content creation, or&nbsp;DevRel  You’re passionate about privacy, proactive, supportive, a quick learner and have strong communication skills.  <p>We expect Nymjas to grow and nurture our community, closely follow Nym’s latest news and events, and co-create a fun, supportive and collaborative environment for our ambassador team.</p><p>So at the end of the day, Nymjas could empower our next major milestones from high-speed mixnet &amp; censorship-resistant gateways to privacy-preserving paid usage via zk-nyms and new&nbsp;PEApps!</p> Why join the Nymja Ambassador Program? <p>You will learn and test your knowledge about how privacy could empower web3, mixnets, and cypherpunks, the privacy problems of many of today’s most popular apps as well as the Nym lore and&nbsp;more…</p><p>On initially joining the Ambassador Program, you will become a candidate. This role is an introduction phase where you will learn how the community works, showcase your contributions, see what’s involved, and get to know the other candidates and ambassadors.</p><p>As a candidate, from day one, you will have the chance, very practically, to write the next chapter of Web3 by contributing to the success of Nym. We encourage everyone who thinks that he/she/they could empower Nym to give Nymja program a try. Share your bravest ideas on how to empower global&nbsp;privacy.</p> Benefits   Monthly rewards — receive $NYM for completing specific&nbsp;tasks.

Exclusive access — be the first to know about Nym official releases and upcoming products that will change the future of the internet.   What are the next steps for the way if Nymja &amp; how long would it&nbsp;take? <p>We believe transparency is the key to the Nymja ambassador program’s success. Here’s our&nbsp;vision:</p><p>2023 Nymja ambassador activation plan</p><p>Phase #1: Our team will conduct an internal application review &amp; 1on1s with qualified Nimjas Date: till the end of&nbsp;April</p><p>Phase #2: We will select the first Nymja-candidates for a trial period (incentivised) Date: April-end of&nbsp;May</p><p>Phase #3: Proven candidates will become full Nymjas &amp; oversee Nym global community scalability Date: the beginning of&nbsp;June</p><p>Phase #4: We will scale our Nymja team (recurrent activations)</p><p>Date: September &amp; December&nbsp;2023</p><p>Once committed to privacy — you are on a journey to master the higher state of&nbsp;Nymja.</p><p>If you are ready to begin your personal Nymja journey, <a href="https://nymtech.typeform.com/nymja">complete the application form</a> and be welcomed as a candidate.

<p>Tokenisation is one of the latest web3 trends to emerge. It has taken the world by storm through its relatively simple yet practical use cases in a wide range of industries. In this article, we will explain what it means to tokenise real world assets, the key aspects of tokenising real world assets, the process of tokenising a real world asset, and the benefits and disadvantages of tokenising real world assets.</p>



 Key takeaways  



 
 The tokenisation of real world assets is the process of creating a (fractionalised) digital twin of a physical asset that can be held, bought, and traded on a blockchain. 



 The tokenisation process consists of 3 steps, namely pre-tokenisation step, which refers to all the steps that happen in the real, non-digital, world before the asset is tokenised and put on a chain. The tokenisation step refers to putting all relevant data and data pointers on a blockchain and creating the tokens. And lastly, the post-tokenisation step refers to the distribution of the tokens and the management of the physical asset and tokens. 



 There are 5 key aspects of tokenisation that need to be considered during the process of tokenising and securitising real world assets: technology, secondary markets &amp; liquidity, legal &amp; compliance, custody &amp; settlements, and dispute resolution. 



 The benefits of tokenising real world assets are the fractionalisation of assets, greater liquidity, increased transparency, and lower transaction costs. 



 The disadvantages and possible risks of tokenising real world assets are the fragmentation of ownership, regulatory uncertainty, technical complexity, and counterparty risk. 



 The future of tokenisation is uncertain as there are many challenges ahead before tokenisation can become mainstream but with the right people leading the way tokenisation can become the future of asset management, given the great potential of the tokenisation of real world assets. 
 







<p>Let’s start with what the tokenisation of real world assets actually means!</p>



 What is the tokenisation of real world assets?  



<p>The tokenisation of real world assets refers to the process of creating a (fractionalised) digital twin of a real world asset that can be traded on a blockchain network. The tokenisation process comes with a variety of benefits. Such are the ability to exchange and own the asset in a more secure and transparent manner. But also things like the provenance of the asset, as well as proofs of labor, and more.</p>



<p>The tokenisation of assets also allows them to be divided into smaller parts, making them available to a wider range of investors. Additionally, these assets can easily be traded on global marketplaces increasing their availability to a wide range of investors even further.</p>



<p>Real world asset tokenisation is not limited to certain types of asset classes either. Instead, tokenisation has the potential to benefit a diverse range of asset classes such as tangible assets like real estate, art, precious metals, and luxury goods, as well as intangible assets such as financial instruments, <a href="https://zaisan.io/invoice-financing-tokenisation/">invoices</a>, and carbon credits.</p>



<p>Fractional ownership of properties, for instance, is possible through the tokenisation of real estate, allowing investors to buy and sell small percentages of high-value properties. Similarly, the tokenisation of art can make art investments more accessible to a broader range of investors by allowing them to buy and sell fractions of high-value pieces.</p>



<p>Lastly, tokenisation can potentially solve some of the challenges linked with traditional ownership structures. Tokenisation enables more transparent and efficient ownership structures that can reduce expenses, fraud, and disputes. Smart contracts can also automate many of the processes associated with asset ownership, including transfers, payments, and maintenance.</p>



 How the tokenisation of real world assets works 



<p>Now it’s clear what the tokenisation of real world assets actually means. Let’s take a look at what the process of tokenising a real world asset looks like.<br>In short, the process can be described in 3 main steps, namely the pre-tokenisation, tokenisation, and post-tokenisation steps. Let’s explain this further!</p>



 Pre-tokenisation 



<p>Pre-tokenisation refers to all the steps that happen in the real, non-digital, world before the asset is tokenised and put on a chain. The main parts of this step depend on the type of asset that is being tokenised. It can generally be divided into formalising the value of the asset, verifying ownership of the asset, and ensuring the right processes are in place in order to take care of the maintenance and management of the physical asset, as well as legal processes in case of liquidations, dispute resolutions, and enforcement.</p>



 Tokenisation 



<p>Once the pre-tokenisation step has been completed. It is time to make a digital representation of the asset in the form of tokens. The main part of this step is making sure all relevant information about the asset is either put on a blockchain or pointed to from the blockchain and then creating the tokens of the real world asset.</p>



<p>The connection between relevant data in traditional databases and data on the blockchain is facilitated through the use of (decentralised) oracles in order to ensure all relevant information is accurately represented on the blockchain. These oracles collect data from traditional databases and broadcast it to the blockchain. Furthermore, decentralised oracles do the same but do this collectively in order to reach a consensus on the accuracy and validity of the data being broadcasted to the blockchain.</p>



 Post-tokenisation 



<p>After the previous steps have been completed and the tokenised asset has been created, it’s time to start distributing/selling the tokenised assets. This is typically done through marketplaces or offerings specialised in these kinds of assets. Part of this step is also the perpetual management of both the physical asset and the tokens based on the rules previously set. For something like an art piece this could include the storage of the piece, maintenance of the piece, insurance of the piece, etc., as well as the management of the tokens, including the management of the information about the token.</p>



 Key aspects of the tokenisation of real world assets  



<p>During the tokenisation process the value chain with its stakeholders remains central. Here are 5 key aspects of tokenisation that need to be considered during the process of tokenising and securitising real world assets which all play a role in the success of the whole process. They can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Technology  



 Secondary markets &amp; Liquidity  



 Legal &amp; Compliance  



 Custody &amp; Settlement  



 Dispute resolution  
 



<p>Let’s take a look at each of these aspects!</p>



 1. Technology 



<p>One of the first and foremost aspects of the tokenisation process is the technology aspect. This refers to all the technical questions such as which blockchain will be used, what data standards will be used, if the tokens will be fungible or non-fungible, and more.</p>



<p>The type of blockchain that is best suited for tokenising an asset usually depends on the goals one has in mind when tokenising an asset. Different blockchains have different data standards suited for specific purposes and different marketplaces which facilitate the trading of tokens of real world assets. Additionally, the costs of deploying a tokenised asset on a certain blockchain is of importance. Another key component is smart contract support and the preferred programming language of the smart contracts. And lastly, specific communities on a blockchain can also influence if a tokenised asset is likely to succeed in a certain ecosystem.</p>



<p>All of these considerations combined, along with the decision to go for a certain data standard which determines whether you will end up with a fungible or non-fungible token can be a key determining factor of the success of the tokenised asset.</p>



 2. Secondary markets &amp; Liquidity  



<p>The second aspect to consider during the tokenisation process is the availability of secondary markets and liquidity. This is usually closely related to the choice of blockchain, as most marketplaces tend to support tokens or assets from a single blockchain. Although this is likely to change with a multi-chain future around the corner.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the availability of trusted and proven marketplaces and a community to facilitate the liquidity of the tokens is essential for the success of a tokenised asset.</p>



 3. Legal &amp; Compliance  



<p>The third aspect to consider in the tokenisation process is the regulatory and legal side of things which is relevant at all stages of the process, especially for assets that are deemed to be securities or require other regulatory oversight.</p>



<p>The first part of this is regulatory compliance. Tokenising physical assets usually involves regulatory requirements depending on the jurisdiction in which the asset is located. For example, in the United States, securities laws may apply if the tokens represent ownership in the asset and are sold to investors. Compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations are usually also required either when selling the tokens or when registering on a token marketplace.</p>



<p>The process of issuing tokens should also be carried out in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This includes ensuring that the tokens are not being sold as unregistered securities. And lastly, there may be tax implications when tokenising a real world asset.</p>



 4. Custody &amp; Settlements  



<p>The fourth aspect to consider in the tokenisation process are any custody and settlement requirements. The tokenisation process basically just creates a digital twin of the asset, but for the asset to actually be tokenised various things ought to be considered. For example, it should be ensured that the ownership of the real world asset is actually in the hands of the token holders. And that the party that tokenises the real world asset holds the deeds and titles to prove the ownership of the asset at the time of tokenisation.</p>



<p>But this is of course not the only relevant point related to this aspect of the tokenisation process. Other things like the management of the physical asset needs to be carefully outlined. This refers to things like loans that need to be repaid before an asset can be released, measurements to prevent (and insure against) things like theft, loss, or damage also need to be agreed upon and be put in place, or arrangements regarding the movement, renovation, etc. of an asset.</p>



<p>These aforementioned considerations mostly refer to the management of the physical asset. But for the tokens, there are also various considerations depending on the jurisdiction. There may be restrictions on the transfer of tokens representing ownership of physical assets. For example, in some cases, the transfer of ownership may require the involvement of a licensed broker or agent.</p>



 5. Dispute resolution 



<p>The fifth and final aspect of the tokenisation process is dispute resolution. Even with all arrangements and precautions in place there will always be times where there are misunderstandings and disputes. So how does this work with tokenised real world assets?</p>



<p>When it comes to dispute resolution in the context of tokenised physical assets, the process can vary. This depends on the specific platform or protocol being used to facilitate the tokenisation. In most cases, the smart contract of the tokenised asset outlines the exact rules and agreements related to the token (and real world asset), as well as the process for dispute resolution.</p>



<p>However, another approach is to rely on established legal systems and frameworks to resolve disputes. For example, if a dispute arises between parties involved in a tokenised real estate transaction, traditional real estate laws, and courts could be used to resolve the dispute.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that tokenisation of physical assets is a relatively new technology. There may be some legal grey areas and uncertainties when it comes to dispute resolution. As a result, it’s important for parties involved in tokenised physical asset transactions to seek legal advice and carefully consider the terms and conditions of any smart contracts or agreements before entering into a transaction.</p>



 Benefits of tokenisation of real world assets  



<p>But what exactly are the benefits of tokenising real world assets? Some of these advantages can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Fractionalisation  



 Greater liquidity  



 Increased transparency  



 Lower transaction costs  
 



 1. Fractionalisation 



<p>Tokenisation allows assets to be divided into smaller portions which means that investors can buy and sell fractions of an asset, rather than having to buy the whole asset. For example, instead of buying an entire real estate property, investors can purchase a percentage of ownership in the property. This opens up investment opportunities to a wider range of investors, including those who may not have enough capital to buy an entire asset.</p>



<p>Another benefit of the fractionalisation is that it allows for more flexible ownership structures which can be better tailored to the investors, in turn increasing the appeal of the investment.</p>



<p>Lastly, the fractionalisation of assets can also be beneficial for community building, in the case of valuable art for example. Instead of having a single owner, it becomes a community-owned asset which can increase both the appeal and value of a physical asset. Who wouldn’t want to own part of the Mona Lisa?</p>



 2. Greater liquidity  



<p>Tokenisation makes assets more accessible and tradable on a blockchain, which can increase liquidity. In traditional markets, it can be difficult to find buyers and sellers for certain assets. However, by tokenising an asset and trading it on a blockchain, investors can quickly and easily buy and sell the tokens without needing to go through intermediaries. This can increase the speed and efficiency of transactions, making it easier for investors to enter and exit the market. And unlike traditional asset purchases transactions are instantaneous and seamless.</p>



<p>Furthermore, given that the asset is split up into smaller portions (represented by tokens) the asset becomes an investment opportunity to a wider range of investors, increasing liquidity even further.</p>



<p>It is important to note though that this is not the case for every type of asset depending on the jurisdiction in which the physical asset resides. Token transactions may still be subject to rules and regulations which can make the buying or transfer process equally inefficient as the regular process, and possibly even more cumbersome in some cases.</p>



 3. Increased transparency  



<p>Tokenisation can make it easier to track ownership and movement of assets, as all transactions are recorded on a blockchain. This increases transparency and reduces the risk of fraudulent activity, as ownership of the asset is easily verifiable. Additionally, since all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, it is easier to audit the history of the asset (and tokens). Thus, this can be important for compliance and regulatory purposes.</p>



<p>This can also be beneficial for tracking the provenance of certain assets, as the digital twin can contain the full history of the physical asset.</p>



 4. Lower transaction costs  



<p>Generally speaking, tokenisation can reduce the costs associated with buying, selling, and managing assets. By removing the need for intermediaries like brokers and custodians, tokenisation can significantly reduce transaction fees. Additionally, tokenisation has the potential to make it easier to manage assets. All ownership and transaction data is stored on the blockchain, reducing administrative and legal costs associated with traditional asset management.</p>



<p>It is important to mention however that the tokenisation process can also increase costs if the stakeholders want greater trust and transparency before, during, and after the tokenisation process.</p>



 Disadvantages of tokenisation of real world assets 



<p>As with any novel technology, there are never only advantages. Some of the disadvantages and possible risks of tokenising real world assets can be summed up as follows:</p>



 
 Fragmentation  



 Regulatory uncertainty  



 Technical complexity  



 Counterparty risk  
 



 1. Fragmentation 



<p>While fractionalisation can be seen as a benefit, it can also lead to the fragmentation of ownership. The more diversified the ownership of an asset becomes, the more difficult it will be to reach consensus on decisions related to the asset which can possibly lead to conflicts between token holders, which consecutively could impact the value of the asset.</p>



 2. Regulatory uncertainty  



<p>As the use of tokenisation is relatively nascent, there is still regulatory uncertainty surrounding it. This can create challenges for both investors and issuers alike, as they may be unsure about how to comply with regulations, and which regulations apply to tokenisation exactly.</p>



<p>Furthermore, new regulations surrounding tokenisation could also pose new threats and hurdles to the overall tokenisation process.</p>



 3. Technical complexity  



<p>Tokenisation requires technical knowledge to implement. It can prove to be a barrier for everyday asset owners looking to tokenise their assets. But a steep learning curve is not the only possible barrier. A lack of understanding of all the aspects of the technological side can lead to poorly designed and written smart contracts. In turn, this opens the door to hackers and cyberattacks.</p>



<p>Furthermore, given the technical complexity of using this kind of technology token holders of lower technical proficiency may be more susceptible to falling for new forms of scams and hacks.</p>



 4. Counterparty risk 



<p>While tokenisation can reduce the need for intermediaries, it can also create new forms of counterparty risk. As is the case with any type of marketplace or exchange, if the tokens are held on that marketplace or exchange, you do not control the funds yourself. If one of these exchanges goes bankrupt or gets hacked, it can become difficult to recover the investments on that marketplace or exchange.</p>



<p>While this can of course be mitigated by taking the tokens out of the platform, history has shown that many people still prefer the convenience of keeping their tokens on an exchange, despite the possible risks. Furthermore, if organisations want to manage their tokenised assets themselves they might require specific roles and functions to manage the relevant wallets which hold the tokens.</p>



 Fractional ownership: the future?  



<p>The tokenisation of real world assets has clear benefits and opens up many new opportunities. However, on the flip side, there are also many challenges ahead. As with any nascent technology, it remains to be seen whether tokenisation will become the norm for ownership of various types of real world assets or just a small technological sidestep with little impact.</p>



<p>For tokenisation to become the norm, pioneers will need to pave the way for others. There will need to be major developments in terms of technology, marketplaces, regulations, and more before tokenisation can become mainstream. Nonetheless, with the clear benefits in mind and the constantly growing interest in web3 technologies , the future seems bright for tokenisation.</p>

<p>It is <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">that time again folks</a>! The mixnet token economic parameters are being updated to take into account the recent&nbsp;vest.</p><p>The vest means there are now more NYM tokens in circulation, thereby increasing the total available staking supply. This requires a new target staking supply and, of particular interest to stakers and mix node operators, this means the stake saturation point increases to 929k&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Here is a quick overview:</p> New parameters   Circulating supply: 394 million&nbsp;NYM  Locked token that can be staked: 52 million&nbsp;NYM  Max staking supply: 446 million&nbsp;NYM  Target staking supply: 223&nbsp;million  Mix node stake saturation point: 929k&nbsp;NYM  <p>For those wondering what lies behind these numbers and why the parameters change, here is a little&nbsp;recap…</p> Why do Nym token economic parameters change? <p>With every new vest, a tranche of tokens are released and become part of the circulating supply. This means the tokens that are available to be staked on mix nodes increase, changing the token economic parameters.</p><p>With the latest vest, the total circulating supply has increased to 394million and the locked tokens that are available to be staked are 52million. This gives a total of 446million that in theory could be&nbsp;staked.</p><p>Taking into account current levels of staking, we set the target to 50% of the available staking supply of 446 million NYM, leading to a current target staking supply of 223million. The target staking supply determines the mix node stake saturation point.</p><p>Mix nodes have a stake saturation point, which is the amount of stake that maximises the node’s rewards. This parameter is found by dividing the target staking supply by the number of rewarded nodes per epoch (currently 240&nbsp;nodes).</p><p>With these new parameters, the APY of well-performing nodes with high levels of staking is slightly above&nbsp;20%.</p><p>The next update to this parameter will take place in June after the next quarterly vest.</p><p>Join the Nym community of stakers and mix node operators</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> // <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //&nbsp;<a href="http://@nymproject">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-economics-quarterly-parameter-update-e85b6c929b37">Nym token economics: quarterly parameter update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, data storage is a crucial component for all applications, regardless of their scope or complexity. While traditional Web2 offers a wealth of storage options tailored to various use cases, such as SQL, NoSQL, Filestorage, S3, and FTP, the transition to Web3 demands a similar expansion of storage infrastructure to accommodate its unique requirements.</p><p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> has emerged as the de-facto standard for storing data in Web3, with its decentralized file storage protocol being ideal for images, videos, and static content. However, IPFS was never designed to handle personal data, and thus, a more suitable solution is necessary.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/data-storage">Verida DbStore</a>, the first “self-sovereign” database infrastructure for Web3, which promises to revolutionize how data is managed by offering users guaranteed ownership, the speed and performance of traditional databases, and the ability to permanently delete their data. As a new decentralized infrastructure and architecture, Verida DbStore is specifically designed for rapid access to highly changing, structured personal data with encryption as a fundamental aspect of the protocol.</p><p>Let’s delve into the intricacies of IPFS and Verida DbStore, comparing their architecture, security, performance, storage types, and suitability for handling personally identifiable information (PII).</p>At a glance: IPFS vs Verida&nbsp;DbStore Architecture <p>IPFS consists of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of block storage nodes, where each node is responsible for data identified by its unique hash. Users can retrieve data from any node, which collaborates with other nodes to locate and return the requested information.</p>IPFS consists of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of block storage&nbsp;nodes<p>On the other hand, Verida is a P2P network of database storage nodes, each responsible for a user-specific queryable database. Data on the network is identified by the owner and database name. To retrieve data, users look up the database storage nodes associated with a user and request the data from one or more nodes. Data is replicated across multiple nodes based on geographical and user preferences.</p>With Verida, a user can use their private key to sign, encrypt and access their&nbsp;data Type of&nbsp;storage <p>IPFS stores unstructured blobs of data such as images, videos or&nbsp;PDFs.</p><p>Verida stores structured data in a document database that can be queried, indexed and replicated.</p> Security <p>IPFS lacks native authentication or encryption, making all stored data publicly accessible without permissions or security restrictions, akin to a globally distributed hard drive with universal read&nbsp;access.</p><p>In contrast, Verida incorporates end-to-end encryption as a fundamental aspect of its protocol. All data requires authorization for access and a decryption key, ensuring security on par with traditional database infrastructure. Verida also offers flexible permission configuration for each user database, allowing control over read, write, update, and delete permissions.</p> Performance <p>IPFS, inspired by torrenting technology, uses distributed hash tables to find content across nodes. While this allows for fast read responses when data is cached locally, it leads to significant latency in discovering new data, resulting in unpredictable and slow response times. This latency issue makes IPFS unsuitable for dynamically changing data without additional protocols.</p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ipfs-measurements/">Real world data from Cloudflare showing an average response time of 44.4 seconds for newly created content on&nbsp;IPFS.</a><p>In contrast, Verida is designed for sub-second reads and writes. Although there’s some initial overhead in discovering a user’s database, once connected, data transfer occurs via a P2P socket connection. This makes Verida ideal for applications requiring “web2-like” performance, where interactions are primarily “app-to-user” or “user-to-user.”</p> Suitable for&nbsp;PII <p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes sensitive data like health records, names, addresses, and financial records that are legally protected in most countries. Regulations dictate the storage, transfer, and user rights concerning PII.</p><p>IPFS, a globally decentralized network, is unsuitable for storing PII because it offers no control over data storage or replication, nor guarantees data deletion, which is necessary for compliance with the “right to be forgotten” in many jurisdictions.</p><p>Verida DbStore, also a globally decentralized network, allows users to control where their data is stored. By default, the <a href="https://www.verida.io/">Verida Wallet </a>selects <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/infrastructure/storage-node">storage nodes</a> in the user’s country or region, ensuring regulatory compliance. Users can change these nodes or host their own for greater self-sovereignty. They can also delete their data from storage nodes, delete their identity and data entirely, and exercise their “right to be forgotten.” Verida combines the advantages of decentralization with regulatory compliance.</p>The <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk">Verida Client SDK</a> is designed to empower user’s to control where their data is&nbsp;stored. IPFS as a base&nbsp;layer <p>Numerous projects are developing decentralized database infrastructure for Web3 using IPFS, including Textile, Ceramic, and Web5. At first glance, this approach may appear logical, as IPFS serves as the filesystem for Web3 and could potentially be transformed into a queryable database. However, this strategy proves to be impractical.</p><p>This approach is similar to constructing a permissioned, encrypted MySQL on a public S3 bucket. This would be slow and vulnerable to security threats, making it an undesirable option. While some projects incorporate an encryption layer over IPFS, the eventual breaking of current encryption would leave the data exposed, as it is both public and permanently accessible. In contrast, Verida safeguards encrypted data through authentication and authorization layers, adhering to industry best practices for protecting sensitive information.</p><p>To address these issues, some projects introduce additional server-side infrastructure on top of IPFS, forming new “storage networks.” However, if extra infrastructure is necessary, it would be more efficient to build on a foundation designed as a database from the outset, rather than relying on an ill-suited base technology like&nbsp;IPFS.</p><p>It is essential to note that IPFS is suitable for various use cases, such as storing immutable public records, NFT images or videos, or whitepaper PDFs. However, it is not an ideal choice for personal data storage, which necessitates a more fitting alternative.</p> Verida’s approach <p>At Verida, we’ve adopted a groundbreaking approach by creating nodes that are not based on IPFS, but rather on well-established database technology that supports authorization, permissions, and decentralized identity standards. This innovative strategy combines the best of both worlds: the reliability of battle-tested, industry-leading database technology and seamless integration with emerging decentralized identity standards through our provided <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk">SDKs</a> and server components.</p><p>In a world where users can own their personal data, it’s critical to provide a mechanism to share encrypted data with third parties. The Verida protocol leverages encrypted data replication which is facilitated by peer-to-peer database synchronization at the protocol&nbsp;level.</p><p>This standards based architecture allows for the addition of various storage engines, making Verida DbStore the first of many decentralized storage solutions expected to emerge over the next decade. This forward-thinking infrastructure ensures that we stay ahead in the evolution of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>We invite you to explore Verida DbStore through the <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/databases">interactive tutorial</a> in our <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">developer documentation</a> and join us on our mission to empower users with self-sovereign identity and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Together, we can shape the future of Web3 and unlock its full potential.</p> Want to learn&nbsp;more?

<p></p><p>Communities play an important role in any blockchain and crypto projects. Community members became project ambassadors and were the first to spread the word about these new revolutionary technologies. In this article, see how Horizen leverages its community thanks to its ambassador program.</p>



 Blockchain and crypto projects rely on their communities.&nbsp; 



<p>It is due to the precursory character of these technologies. They are too avant-garde for the mainstream media and too complicated for the general public. It took communities to be able to take an interest in emerging projects and to promote them more widely.</p>



<p>Take bitcoin, for example. One of its strengths is drawn from its original community, the cypherpunks. These are the best cryptographers in the world who helped the bitcoin technology emerge and have given it credit, as well as shedding light on revolutionary technology.</p>



 What is a (crypto) community? 



<p>Suppose we have a look at the definition of community. In that case, we find:</p>



 
 a unified body of individuals: such as the people with common interests living in a particular area 



 &nbsp;a group of people with a common characteristic or interest living together within a larger society 



 a body of persons of common and especially professional interests scattered through a larger society 
 



<p>(source: <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community</a>)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto communities were born with people with shared crypto and freedom interests, living on the internet. They are linked by a shared policy (e.g., decentralization, banking freedom, currency sovereignty) but are still part of a larger society. Everybody can join the ownership by owning cryptos! And that’s the beautiful thing about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we know that the emergence of crypto and blockchain technologies is due to their communities, how do we use this strength by being a blockchain project?</p>



<p>The answer is with Horizen and its Zenvangelists!</p>



 The Horizen Ambassador Program 



<p>The Zenvangelists are active members form the Horizen community who are dedicated to contributing to and growing with Horizen. </p>



<p>&nbsp;Zenvangelists are web3 believers from all walks of life who are passionate about Horizen. Anybody can become a Zenvangelist, as long as they are:</p>



 
 A part of the Horizen community. 



 Interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general 



 Always willing to help other members of the community 



 Eager to contribute to the growth of the Horizen community  



 Want to be committed to continuous learning and education 



 Be a self-starter (autonomous, self-taught, in short: passionate) 
 



<p>How do we empower our Zenvangelists?</p>



 
 We are always available for guidance and support 
 



 
 We hold monthly meetings where they can discuss community matters and share ideas with the Horizen team and leadership 



 Zenvangelists have exclusive early access to new Horizen product and service releases before the public 



 We help Zenvangelists grow their personal network and reach, improve their skill sets, and provide event opportunities to represent Horizen.   



 We reward Zenvangelists for their effort in many ways, including swagkit, ZEN rewards, free event participations etc. 
 



 Some are Legends! 



<p>They are OGs, community, and project backbones or have joined us recently but have shown exceptional activity: let me introduce you to the Legend Zenvangelists.</p>



<p>Let me introduce you to our Zenvangelists: <a href="https://twitter.com/mahnoor089">Mahnoor,</a> our daily task moderator, <a href="https://twitter.com/pvmihalache">PVM</a>, our party organizer, <a href="https://twitter.com/DeFiFUDDestroy">DeFi-Money-Printer</a>, our livestream host, <a href="https://twitter.com/paragism_">Paragism</a>, our technical writer and <a href="https://twitter.com/xgarreau">Xavier</a>, our technologies tester and community teacher.&nbsp;</p>

															Why Horizen?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;In short, I chose Horizen because of its strong community, its innovative vision, and its potential to make a real difference in the world.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;Mainly because of the privacy focus, constant development, and great potential. The innovating sidechains were giving new tools to developers, with $ZEN powering the future of DeFi, Play2Earn games, DApps, Web3, and NFT projects</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;What first garnered my interest in crypto, as many like to joke about being “in it for the tech” was truly my growing interest in GPU mining. I’d tried to mine Ethereum at the time and had been failing with graphics drivers and related issues, so I found that ZEC was comparably profitable at the time and was easy to set up and get going.</p>
<p>When I found that Horizen would have the same algorithm and supply of coins, I saw opportunity at being an early supporter. The passion of the team at an early stage and to this day has always been something that stands out to me.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;Horizen looked like a big project and has since grown even bigger. There are 3 companies, a doxxed team, a news website, a blog, the academy, an open GitHub, the Horizen Early Adopter’s Program, and the HDE (Horizen Developer Environment). There are tools for the community: Discord, Twitter accounts, and Telegram channels … It even has a meme coin^^</p>
<p>There was a lot of work to build the Zendoo protocol, and since it was released, a new era has started, with Tokenmint and EON. I hope many sidechains will be added to the ecosystem in the coming months/years.</p>
<p>Paragism:&nbsp;The strong ethos of privacy attracted me initially. I also found Horizen very dedicated to bringing new innovations with its research-driven culture and strives to push technological boundaries. This blockchain project keeps delivering back-to-back developments with continuous R&amp;D regarding various vital parameters to achieve high scalability and extendibility.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;The project has a clear vision, excellent leadership, a capable team, unique technology, and major industry partners. Horizen ticks all the boxes, and with Horizen EON launching, we will soon see Horizen carve out its market fit.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;At the end of 2017, while preparing for my own business, I wanted to learn more about the blockchain area. At that time, I found the ZenCash homepage and sent a direct email to send a proposal saying that I would like to work while learning.</p>
<p>We also asked for consent by presenting an article on zencash’s forum, which is now unused.</p>
<p>At the same time, I conducted various communication, such as sharing many conversations and Korean market research.</p>
<p>Based on that, I joined the current Horizen, and I strongly agree with the direction we are heading now, the role as a platform, and the cultivation of an ecosystem that focuses on practically necessary privacy such as Data-Privacy.</p>
<p>I first announced the launch of Horizen Korea at ZenCon0, and since then I have made preliminary contact with many partners for Horizen Korea in Korea.</p>
<p>Now that we are almost ready to announce the business outline and official launch, we will soon be able to meet Horizen Korea, which is taking on various challenges as much as the Korean community members expect of Horizen.</p>
<p>Guan:&nbsp;Because the project has a sustainable funding model and cool graphic designs. Horizen is an inclusive ecosystem where everyone is rewarded for their contributions.</p>

															For how long have you been in the Horizen community? Share your journey in crypto communities?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;I’ve been actively involved in the crypto ecosystem since 2019, and I’ve been passionate about the potential of blockchain technology to transform the way we live and work. Since then, I’ve been exploring different projects and communities in the space, and I was excited to join the Horizen team in late 2021.</p>
<p>As someone who has always been interested in the intersection of technology and finance, I was drawn to Horizen’s vision of a decentralized, privacy-focused ecosystem that empowers individuals to control their assets and data. I’ve been impressed by the team’s commitment to innovation and dedication to building a community-driven platform that can make a difference in people’s lives.</p>
<p>As a tracker of daily task submissions, I’ve had the opportunity to engage with Horizen users daily and see firsthand their enthusiasm and passion for the project. I’m honored to be part of such a vibrant and dynamic community, and I’m excited to see what the future holds for Horizen and the wider crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;I joined the Zenvangelists in May 2021. I was expanding my reach into the Cryptoverse and was happy I could join the community. I was enhancing my blockchain knowledge, and Horizen was one of the chains that impressed me.</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;I’ve been involved with Horizen since early 2017 very near the launch of the project when I first heard about it being supported on the first ever exchange for Horizen, Bittrex, which happened to be the first alt-coin exchange I had used in my crypto journey.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;I don’t remember when I first heard about Bitcoin, but at the time, I thought it was cooler to search for Alien life running SETI or help research with Folding@home than to mine cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>I saw all this crash in 2018 and thought the ecosystem had turned to silly speculation.</p>
<p>But, after a while, during the bear market, I started looking into the ecosystem again and saw great people building interesting projects. I bought some cryptos and read a lot of whitepapers.</p>
<p>I started a website. The first tutorials I wrote were about Bitgreen and Zelcash (now Flux) configuration.</p>
<p>In 2020, I started looking into masternodes and Horizen was one of my first ones. A Secure Node was cheap, and the APY was very good before the halving.</p>
<p>I started to dig deeper into Horizen with the public release of Zendoo on the testnet, tested it on a VPS, completed some HDE tasks, and therefore wrote some articles.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;Horizen was one of the first coins I bought when I started my crypto journey in 2017. I wasn’t active in the community then, but I used to lurk on Telegram. I was always impressed by how accessible the team was, and Rob was always in the chat, answering questions and engaging with the community.&nbsp; His passion was infectious. During the 2018/19 bear market, I became more involved in the community. I tried to help where I could, such as live streaming the weekly team meetings, amplifying Horizen news through HorizenClips, and doing some end-of-year and zendoo launch community Livestream events.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;I learned about Bitcoin from the end of 2015 and started mining with my computer at home. I didn’t get as much volume as the current Bitcoin whales, but I started to pay more attention to the technology called blockchain rather than profit.</p>
<p>Technically, it came out earlier, but the technology that was almost dead came back to the world through an example of Bitcoin, and since then, as new technologies such as Ethereum’s smart contracts have been introduced, the blockchain industry has begun to draw attention.</p>
<p>These days, diversity that can be utilized within the blockchain industry, such as NFT, is possible, but in the past, there were many people who took a business approach with a conceptual nature as a simple payment method. In it, I was obsessed with the thought of whether it would be right for someone to look into my wallet address, even though it is a wallet address made up of addresses that are very long and difficult for people to memorize.</p>
<p>From this point of view, even in terms of a simple payment method, we can see the importance of privacy.</p>

															Do you have something to say to those who want to join the Zenvangelist program or any crypto community?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;For those interested in joining the Zenvangelist program or any other crypto community, I would say: go for it! Being part of a community is a great way to learn, grow, and contribute to a larger cause. It’s an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals, share your knowledge and experience, and make a difference.</p>
<p>My advice would be to start by getting involved in the community in whatever way feels most comfortable to you. This could mean joining a Discord group, participating in social media discussions, attending meetups or events, or contributing to open-source projects. Whatever you choose, be sure to stay engaged, be respectful, and be open-minded. Everyone in the community is there to learn and grow; working together can achieve great things.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t be afraid to take on leadership roles and responsibilities within the community. Whether becoming a Zenvangelist, organizing an event, or contributing to a project, stepping up and taking action is the best way to make a real impact and show dedication to the cause. So, if you’re passionate about crypto and blockchain, I encourage you to get involved and join a community today.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;The Zenvangelist Program, like the majority of crypto communities, empowers the users. You bring your skills, work with others, and learn. Being part of a strong, vibrant, and fun community will bring more knowledge than many courses.</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;For any community members whether new or old my greatest advice to give would be to never underestimate the impact you may have on the communities and projects you are involved in, and in many cases opportunities will arise and those passionate community members certainly stand out of the crowd (and if not make sure you let yourself be heard in a constructive manner) a little effort goes a long way when we all work together to build something greater than one team or project can build alone.</p>
<p>Paragism:&nbsp;Horizen community is rich in resources. It will enable you to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual growth of the ecosystem. The sense of togetherness is profound and enjoyable here.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;Joining a crypto community is still the best way to learn about the ecosystem and a project.</p>
<p>The more you speak with people, meet others, and share what you know, the more your knowledge and comprehension grow. That’s a win-win. You become better and help others understand our ecosystem.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;I say jump in! The Zenvangelist program is great because you can tailor it to suit your own unique talents! It is also a great way for you to get to know the team and community better, and it can help open lots of doors if you are pursuing a career in crypto.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;Sure! In the Korean community, there are many valuable members who play many roles. For example, AstarZen is directly producing PFP NFTs for node operators in our Korean community. Needless to say, Ken is also the spiritual pillar of our Korean community.</p>
<p>Guan:&nbsp;We are an honest and lovely community with many interesting and smart people! Come on and join us, You won’t regret it!</p>

															How does it feel to be named Legend Zenvangelist?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor: Being recognized as a Legend Zenvangelist within the Horizen community is amazing. Being acknowledged for my contributions and dedication is an honor.</p>
<p>I believe it helps promote the project, impart my wisdom and experience, and assist in adopting and engaging new users.</p>
<p>However, having the title of Legend Zenvangelist carries more obligations than just a title. It entails continuing to be involved and active in the community, sharing my knowledge and suggestions, and assisting in determining the project’s direction. It entails setting an example for others and motivating them to get involved and change the world.</p>
<p>Overall, being recognized as a Legend Zenvangelist is humbling, and it inspires me to keep putting in the effort and helping the Horizen community. I’m happy to be a part of this thriving ecosystem and eager to see what we can accomplish together.</p>
<p>PVM: I feel proud to be named a Legend Zenvangelist but still humble. It’s a title that makes me feel appreciated and the reason to keep working as hard as I did until now. Now I have to lead by example and maintain high standards</p>
<p>DeFi: It’s an honor to be recognized as Legend Zenvagelist, and my pleasure to see where the Horizen Ecosystem has come from, to where it is now, and being a part of where it is going. I truly believe the greater market is largely unaware of the constant building going on throughout the years and could be near the precipice of true recognition as a DeFi, Smart Contract platform – being secured by the largest node network and hybrid Proof of Work network structure under the hood.</p>
<p>Paragism: It is a matter of pride. Horizen community has empowered me to bring positive changes. I am grateful that my involvement and work have been recognised.</p>
<p>Xavier: That’s a funny bonus, but honestly, being called a legend wasn’t part of the plan when I joined the Zenvangeslists^^</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp; I feel a little undeserving because I have been pretty quiet in the community lately as I have been busy launching a new business in Seoul. But Horizen is definitely my favourite project!</p>
<p>Jonghun: I am delighted to hear that I have been selected among the valued Zenvangelists for more diverse endeavors. I am happy that I will work harder in the future with Horizen Korea as my new starting point, but I accept it with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Guan: I feel so honored to be a Legend Zenvangelist, spreading Horizen is a significant thing in such a very early stage!&nbsp; I also meet a lot of super cool ZEN-frens from all over the world. It’s a fantastic journey in my life!</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Mahnoor, thank you so much for being here every day for the community. You were even here during your maternity leave to help the fellowship. Where do you find this constant energy to be present in the community?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I believe that the crypto and blockchain space has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about money, data, and identity, and I’m committed to doing my part to help bring about that change. Whether it’s through tracking daily task submissions, answering questions in Discord groups, or participating in social media discussions, I always try to be available and responsive to community members.</p>
<p>Of course, there are times when it can be challenging to balance community involvement with other responsibilities, such as family or work. But ultimately, I believe that being present for the community is an important part of my role, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute in any way I can.</p>
<p>Overall, my energy and enthusiasm for the Horizen community comes from my belief in its potential and my passion for the work that we’re doing. I’m honored to be a part of this dynamic and innovative ecosystem, and I look forward to continuing to contribute in any way I can.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: PVM, you are our event Zenvangelist and an excellent writer. So tell us, what is the best: hosting or participating in the party?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: Hosting parties and events is fun, and taking part is even better. My friends tell me to make “PVM Entertainment and Leisure” a real thing, as the events I create are always top of the crop!</p>
<p>This is what I love to do … to create events that suit every crypto user, from NFT lovers to Crypt edges. I constantly think about new party activities and themes and ways to reward the participants with memories and good vibes”</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: DeFi, you are the new Horizen community voice. You have great skills in hosting and green screen management. What came first, the desire to play with editing software or to talk about the Horizen project entertainingly?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: AI would say my desire in content, editing, and feeling though I have an above average understanding of many concepts that others may benefit from all to tie in together, but to answer which came first, it was the tinkering around while bringing some creativity to the mix – I’d been doing so since the Windows XP era on Windows Movie Maker… Although the quality and effort was poor at best, I always try to make incremental improvements over time (even if it means two steps forwards, one step back at times).</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Paragism, what is different in the Horizen community?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: The Horizen community gives a sense of belonging. All ideas are welcomed and we get to see plenty of expressions. The community members also get to learn new things and hone their skills.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Xavier, you are the always-willing-to-try-tech-things-guy among the Zenvangelists. You make great tutorials and create love, hug, and cakes in our tokenization platform and EVM. Where does this genuine willingness to share come from?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I love tech. I love to learn new technologies. I started coding at 7 and never stopped learning different flavors of basic (Turbo) pascal, c, c++, java, SQL, HTML, javascript, php, tcl, … and systems administration.</p>
<p>I’ve been sharing my knowledge since 98, I think. It was one of my end of studies projects to write a website generator in java (v1.0.2) and use it to generate a website. The website was called Alaide (that means“help needed” in French). It was a collection of tutorials about HTML 3.2, CGI programming, and java.</p>
<p>I then wrote articles for the French Linux magazine for several years, mainly about Linux development.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time browsing the apache forums and community websites like “léa Linux” or “le site du zéro.”</p>
<p>Nowadays, I work as a freelance sysadmin and developer and help my customers understand and face their tech problems. I’m still writing tutorials, helping people on Twitter and Discord, testing things, and helping people in their crypto journey.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Jonghun, you’re more than the Korean community backbone; you made it to the Horizen team! What made you stay at Horizen through the years?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I have had various experiences within the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>I helped launch a global exchange in Korea and played the role of COO, and I am advising on various projects.</p>
<p>Unlike many projects, Horizen always develops by clarifying the vision set in the beginning, responding to the market, and knowing how to adapt.</p>
<p>From a currency with a simple privacy function, now as a platform, we are expanding the ecosystem for various projects. Of course, we are preparing to support the use of the Privacy function where it is actually needed, rather than abandoning it.</p>
<p>In the Korean community, not only me but Ken and so many people are moving together.</p>
<p>Maybe not just community members, but each of them speaks a lot about Horizen’s development direction in a really logical and passionate way.</p>
<p>There was also strong support from the community about removing the shield pool from the main chain this time. When voting on this, members of the Korean community debated day and night.</p>
<p>In addition to my vision for Horizen, Horizen, with such a passionate community, will keep everyone in the future.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Guan, You are an OG who did much for the Horizen community. What made you stay through the years?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: The team always knows how to push things forward. the project’s core cross-chain protocol Zendoo solves scalability that can massively help many web2 businesses into web3.</p>

<p>Horizen inspired artwork from Zenvangelist <a href="https://twitter.com/S1DARTA0">Sidarta0</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>“I love the sleeping astronaut. A lot. But also <a href="https://sidarta.in/product/topsy-turvy-drawing/">Topsy Turvy</a>, one of the first artworks that got people from Horizen further interested in letting me have art on their products. I still have the original; it blows my mind that no one has ever bought it. I love the colors and the weird randomness. It was created in the flow. One of my favorites. Because I still remember the process. It was a fun piece to do. And also very hard to do again.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>Last but not least, special thanks to Psyrax, JC, our Legend Zenvangelist SupportMan, who is always available to assist the community with any node/mining-related questions. You’re the backbone of our Discord server, essential to the community. So, thank you!</p>

 Why release a transparency report? 



<p>Electric Coin Co. is committed to openness and transparency — as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital currency, and in support of our mission to empower people with economic freedom. This transparency report details company income, expenses, and use of funds during Q3 2022.</p>



<p>Key takeaways</p>



 
 Bootstrap received coins at a value below the ECC operating-expense level for Q3 2022. During this time, Bootstrap received coins at an average of $461,000 a month (at the Q3 average ZEC price, $60, for each of the three months’ distribution dates), and Bootstrap and ECC incurred average monthly expenses of approximately $766,000.&nbsp; 



 At the end of Q3 2022, Bootstrap and ECC collectively held approximately $3.0M in USD and approximately 116.9K ZEC.&nbsp; 



 As of March 16, 2023, the company held approximately $1.3M in USD and approximately 110K ZEC.&nbsp;

							<p>We could start this post by saying that our motivation to create a Zebra package for Arch Linux was that Arch enjoys the highest average rating of any Linux distribution on <a href="https://distrowatch.com/index.php?dataspan=score">DistroWatch</a>. However, the truth is that one of our engineers uses Arch (btw.), and he thought it would be handy to have Zebra packaged.</p><p>Packages in the official Arch repositories contain compiled binaries signed by their maintainers. The Arch developers maintain essential packages, and so-called trusted users maintain the rest. In addition to the official repositories, the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">Arch User Repository</a> (AUR) lets anyone from the Arch community share their own package. The difference is that AUR packages do not contain binaries but a script that pulls, builds, and installs the software for the user. Arch users are encouraged to inspect the script’s content before executing it.</p><p>Zebra is currently packaged in the AUR. The <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zebrad">package</a> prepares dependencies, pulls Zebra’s source code from GitHub, and builds and installs the same binary as the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/zfnd/zebra">Docker image</a>.</p><p>AUR users can vote for a package to increase its popularity, and trusted users can adopt popular packages and promote them to the official repositories. As the ArchWiki says, “a good number of new packages that enter the official repositories start in the AUR”. The original zcashd node already has an official package, and Zebra will hopefully follow. So if you are, by the way, using Arch, feel free to install the zebrad package and let us know how it went on our Discord, or on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/technology/zebra/46">Zcash Community Forums</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Electric Coin Co. (ECC) has been working since June to resolve Zcash wallet performance issues that are affecting users of third-party apps Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable.* All three of these mobile wallets utilize the ECC SDK.</p>



<p>Our engineers have made progress, however, work remains —&nbsp;including further updates to zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet — to fully restore good user experience in the impacted apps.</p>



<p>Solving these issues is our No. 1 priority, even taking precedence over our long term roadmap. Internally, we are calling this “Emergency Mode.”&nbsp;</p>



 The syncing problem 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented some wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. (The current wallet sync process requires scanning the entire blockchain before funds are available to be spent.) If a wallet won’t sync, a user can’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>



 What we’ve done so far 



<p>Within weeks of identifying the problem, ECC released two updates to zcashd that resolved full node issues, and work was underway on the SDKs. In October, we released zcashd 5.3.0 to fix out-of-memory issues, but further public releases specifically relevant to these syncing issues were delayed, as ECC engineers were pulled off task to build zcashd 5.3.3 and 5.4.2 — critical updates that remediated vulnerabilities inherited from Bitcoin Core.</p>



<p>Here’s a summary of what we’ve done, so far, to address wallet performance issues:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Released zcashd 5.1.0 and 5.2.0 in July to address performance in full nodes 



 Released zcashd 5.3.0 to fix a number of intermittent out-of-memory issues 



 Completed most of the code updates and testing for zcashd 5.5.0, which implements fee changes. Note: users should have the ability to spend funds without a full wallet sync upon the release of zcashd 5.6.0. 



 Completed a portion of the back-end work required to support the next release of the iOS and Android SDKs, which will include the first phase of an improved sync capability. 
 



 Exiting Emergency Mode 



<p>Our top priority is ensuring users can access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, so we’re building updates that will allow users to receive and spend new incoming funds faster,** and we’re implementing features that provide visibility on syncing progress.</p>



<p>Only after these capabilities are delivered —&nbsp;and when we’re confident that wallets are not being impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior —&nbsp;will we consider exiting Emergency Mode and widening our focus to include other initiatives.</p>



<p>The table below represents an estimated release schedule to address the wallet syncing issues. Each release is slated for delivery within a half-month window to allow for dozens of inherent dependencies. Interim releases may occur based on specific requirements or dependencies throughout this process. Version numbers listed may also change based on emergency or other unplanned impacts.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that after these releases are made available, third-party developers may need a number of days or weeks to implement and test.</p>



DateReleaseDetailsFirst half of April 2023zcashd 5.5.0A transaction-fee structure change based on overall size (inputs/outputs) and frequency of transactions (ZIP-317) will make attempts to spam or flood the network with txs much more expensive and unlikely. Mobile wallet users sending regular single recipient transactions will not be affected by this change.<br><br>Fund availability improvement will provide the ability to spend funds before a wallet is fully synchronized.&nbsp;<br><br>While this release will have no immediate positive effect on the wallet user experience, this is a necessary step toward exiting emergency mode.Second half of April 2023lightwalletd 0.5Partners currently running lightwalletd servers will need to apply this update to allow the future SDK capabilities to properly function and deliver an improved user experience via the mobile wallets.<br><br>Supports future zcash 5.6.0 update.Second half of AprilECC prototype walletThis initial version of the app is being developed with a minimum feature set as a test platform to validate current Zcash functionality and serve as a prototype for future feature development.<br><br>Initial distribution will be limited with a broader product launch later in 2023.Second half of May 2023zcashd 5.6.0DAGSync capability, which will enable fast sync and scanning of the blockchain<br><br>Users will not see the changes to the UX until the SDK update 0.6 (outlined below) goes out.Second half of May 2023Mobile SDK updates 0.6 (iOS &amp; Android)This update will include support for third-party app access to fund availability and improved sync capabilities.<br><br>Once this update is live, it will be up to the individual wallet developers to integrate the new features into their application, which will enable users to access their funds without issues and improve the overall Zcash user experience. This will end the emergency mode.



<p></p>



 



 



<p>* Based on community feedback, Ywallet has been working well and appears to be unaffected by high transaction load on the network.</p>



<p>** The speed benchmark we’ve set for downgrading from emergency mode is that a typical Zcash user can receive and spend funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in one hour. This is not a perfect measurement (use cases can vary wildly), nor is it our end goal (we know a great user experience demands more), but we believe it’s important to set a reference goal for internal and community alignment. Future speed improvements will be planned once the critical issues are resolved.</p>

   Alfredo Garcia describes a new Zebra feature to store Zcash block data in an elasticsearch database, which allows us to use Kibana to explore and visualize the data.

							<p>The Zcash blockchain history is big and rich—any block explorer application can just call RPC methods from a zcashd node and present the data in the desired way. Data analysis is hard in this context, on the one hand, you can just do what a specific application will allow you to do, or on the other hand if you need different visualization you have to create your own app.</p><p>As an alternative, we can export and index all block (header and transaction) data fields into an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">elasticsearch</a> database and use <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana/">Kibana</a> as a front end to do some analysis.</p><p>The possibilities of data visualization are huge with Kibana and all we need to do to create them is to feed an elasticsearch database with valid JSON block data.</p><p>When the elasticsearch feature is enabled, each block is sent from Zebra into elasticsearch; this is in addition to saving the block in the internal rocksdb database. We can then guarantee Zebra’s correct ongoing functionality and storage in the desired external database at the cost of more hard drive storage and a longer synchronization time.</p><p>Once the data has been inserted into the database, the Kibana part is easy. It may be able to provide many answers to existential questions our community deserves to know, for example:</p>  How many Orchard transactions have we had since its introduction? (Adoption)  How many shielded coinbase transactions have we had since its introduction? (Adoption)  How many Sprout transactions did we have in the last X period? (Deprecation)  How many transactions per block have we had on average since the start of the blockchain? (Information)  Which hours of the day are more transactions executed? (User distribution)  What is the average size of a block or transaction? (Parameters)  What is the distribution between Orchard, Sapling, Sprout and transparent transactions? (Information)  And many, many others.  						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
																														 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							The Zebra elasticsearch feature has only been tested on Testnet so far. Here is a guide on how to set it up; it is pretty easy.

What I think is needed next:
 
 	 Deploy the Mainnet in the cloud 
 	 Setup Kibana for listening to an external IP address. Optionally attach a domain name to it. 
 	 Create and share Kibana usernames and passwords between people interested in creating visualizations 
 	 Create dashboards with Zcash data 
 	 Share links to visualization in forums, twitter, news, etc. (external users do not need Kibana access to see shared visualizations)

<p>Scientific research &amp; publishing are gruelling tasks that extend outside the scope of science itself. Centralised publications abound in archaic practices that span from submitting a paper to getting it peer-reviewed and finally published, process which may take even up to years. In addition, research requires funding from very early stages of pursuing an idea, all the way to its finality (i.e. clinical trial or real-life applications). In TradSci (traditional science), funding is usually obtained once progress has already been achieved or when a startup has been formed.<br>DeSci (decentralised science) sets out to change this paradigm by funding early stage research via DAOs. When it comes to scientific publications, peer reviewing is also decentralised and incentivised, considerably speeding up the process. Moreover, contributions can be clearly retraced, avoiding false claims over IP, and the research itself becomes much more easily accessible and disseminated.</p><p>We were joined by Vincent Weisser &amp; Laurence Ion, stewards of Vita DAO, to discuss the advantages of DeSci in general, and the progress of longevity research in particular.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Vincent’s background and his interest in longevity  Laurence’s background and his interest in biotech  The purpose of DeSci  Which science branch is better suited for DeSci  How DeSci fixes contribution acknowledgement &amp; incentive misalignment  From research idea to startup via DeSci funding  $VITA token utility  Accelerating scientific publishing via DeSci  How IP is attributed in a DeSci setting  Project review and governance in Vita DAO  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentweisser">Vincent Weisser</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/longevion">Laurence Ion</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/vita_dao">Vita DAO</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/molecule_dao">Molecule DAO</a>  <a href="https://www.vitadao.com/projects">Vita DAO projects</a>  <a href="https://www.molecule.to/">Molecule</a>  <a href="https://www.bio.xyz/">Bio DAO launchpad</a>  <a href="https://www.longevityprize.com/">The Longevity Prize</a>  <a href="https://longevity.review/">The Longevity Decentralized Review</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst &amp; Meher Roy.

 zk-nyms are here — a major milestone towards a market-ready mixnet <p>We recently <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-unveils-zero-knowledge-anonymous-credentials-zk-nyms-at-sxsw-6d56bd31802a">announced zk-nyms</a> to the world. zk-nyms are a cryptographic system that allows people to pay and use for services without leaking unnecessary personal information. This is an important milestone for the Nym mixnet and the following VPN example illustrates perfectly why…</p><p>VPNs are one of the more known and used privacy tools around, and if you are using one, you will probably be using a credit card to pay for it. That means the VPN provider has your card details, name and address. Furthermore, VPNs act as a trusted proxy, so even if they shield your IP and browsing history, they themselves know all the websites you are accessing!</p><p>To put it bluntly, your VPN provider now has your identity and full browsing history. And to make matters worse, some “free” VPNs even embed third-party trackers to gather your data and sell it on others (<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/vpns-tor-i2p-how-does-nym-compare-8576824617b8">read&nbsp;more</a>).</p><p>So let’s get into what zk-nyms can do to solve&nbsp;this!</p> Introducing zk-nyms <p>The very first use-case of zk-nyms is now out in the world: bandwidth credentials for the mixnet! By using zk-nyms, people can prove they have the right to use the mixnet for privacy, without revealing their wallet address, payment amount, balance or any other information.</p><p>We don’t want your payment details, your name, transaction number or any other information about you. All we need to know is whether you (or the app you are running) have the right credentials to use the mixnet. In fact, that should be the norm for any digital service that you&nbsp;use!</p><p>We have just launched a sandbox where people can test spending bandwidth credentials with a gateway (<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/bandwidth-credentials.html">using CLI</a>). We invite devs and gateway operators to come and <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/bandwidth-credentials.html">try it&nbsp;out</a>!</p> Pay, but not with your&nbsp;privacy! <p>The Nym mixnet protects you online — not just the IP address and content, but even the metadata and patterns of communication. The mixnet is decentralised and trustless, meaning there is no part of the infrastructure that holds any data about you or your traffic. And that has to be the case for payments&nbsp;too.</p><p>The mixnet is currently free of charge, but there will eventually be a small fee to ensure <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-token-d55ffd3d397a?source=collection_archive---------0-----------------------">operators are compensated fairly</a>. Today’s digital services are incentivised towards surveillance. From Facebook and social media more generally to free email and VPN services, they provide a service at a low cost to attract users and then make up the rest by selling people’s&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Nym mixnet includes token economics to ensure that the infrastructure operators are incentivised to provide privacy, not surveillance. And now with zk-nyms, we are one step closer to a paid mixnet service that is fully secure and does not leak any additional information.</p> What next for&nbsp;zk-nyms? <p>Bandwidth credentials is just the first practical use-case for what we see as blazing a new innovation pathway for our online lives. In the physical world, most of us are not under constant observation. Most of us are not subject to continuous micro analysis by unknown organisations, determining who you are, where you belong and what you are likely to do next. In the physical world, you get to choose what you share about yourself, when and with whom. Unfortunately that is not currently the case&nbsp;online.</p><p>zk-nyms intends to make this possible in the digital world too. You will be able to selectively reveal your information to build trusted and secure relationships without leaking unnecessary personal information to third parties. Specific use-cases include privacy preserving KYC, private payments, access control, age verification as well as a generic privacy preserving single-sign on!</p><p>You are not a number in a database. Your identity should not be imposed by companies and agencies using a tightening net of proliferating profiling algorithms. Digital systems should primarily serve people, not the other way around and the ability to selectively determine what you reveal and to&nbsp;who.</p> Features of&nbsp;zk-nyms <p>You may be seeing the words ‘zero knowledge’ and ‘private credentials’ bouncing around a lot these days and be wondering: what makes zk-nyms different from other credentials and zk-magic? The main advantage of zk-nyms is that we are decentralised, and have threshold-issuance, meaning that we avoid a centralised point of trust to issue us the credentials! To wrap up here is a quick overview of the features of&nbsp;zk-nyms…</p> Cryptographic <p>As the name hints at, zk-nyms make use of several cryptographic primitives, including zero-knowledge proofs, blind signatures and commitment schemes, and are an extension of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07344">Coconut credential scheme</a>. Zero knowledge has become quite the hype lately, so there are plenty of guides out there for those who want to deep-dive, but suffice to say that this bit of cryptographic magic allows people to cryptographically prove something without having to reveal the evidence. (A more in depth post comparing zk-nyms with zk-snarks, starks and other zero knowledge hype, coming&nbsp;soon!)</p> Decentralised <p>A unique feature of zk-nym is that it is decentralised. This means that there is no single authority that holds your credentials. Instead they are issued by a decentralised validator set. For some of you readers, this might raise alarm bells regarding potentially malicious validators, but we have good news for&nbsp;you…</p> Threshold issuance <p>…because zk-nym makes use of threshold issuance, meaning validators only hold a share of the key that signs the credential! Having a threshold issuance has a similar byzantine-fault tolerance as other validator bases schemes, i.e., we not only distribute trust but also avoid crush of the system in case some validators go offline or are malicious.</p> Unlinkable <p>Unlinkability means that the issuance of your credential and your subsequent showing of it is unlikable. This means that even if validators collude with the service to which you show your credential, they cannot learn any additional information. Furthermore, a property of blind issuance means that even if all the validators colluded, they would not be able to piece together the private attribute of your credential.</p> Selective disclosure <p>The power is now firmly back in your hands to selectively disclose information about yourself as and when you need&nbsp;to.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@M.Quin/zk-nyms-burada-piyasaya-haz%C4%B1r-bir-mixnet-yolunda-%C3%B6nemli-bir-kilometre-ta%C5%9F%C4%B1-2b6388695653">Turkish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/zk-nyms-ya-est%C3%A1-aqu%C3%AD-un-hito-importante-hacia-una-mixnet-preparada-para-el-mercado-fd182329addf">Spanish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymportugues/zk-nyms-est%C3%A3o-aqui-um-marco-importante-em-dire%C3%A7%C3%A3o-a-uma-rede-de-mixagem-pronta-para-o-mercado-33297c488080">Portuguse</a></p> Learn more <p>Try: zk-nyms for <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/bandwidth-credentials.html">bandwidth credentials CLI&nbsp;sandbox</a></p><p>Blogpost: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/vpns-tor-i2p-how-does-nym-compare-8576824617b8">VPNs, Tor, I2P — how does Nym&nbsp;compare?</a></p><p>Paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07344.pdf">Coconut credentials scheme</a></p><p>Paper: <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/011">Security Analysis of&nbsp;Coconut</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">zk-nyms are here — a major milestone towards a market-ready mixnet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Partnering with Hex: Data Collaboration Made Easy  <p>Barry, Caitlin, Glen and their team are building a collaborative workspace for the modern data stack—where delivering insights is seamless. </p>  <p>By Matt Miller and Michelle Bailhe Fradin</p><p>Published March 23, 2023</p>  



 
<p>Data is the competitive advantage of the 21st century. Without access to the right information, businesses are unable to make the quick decisions they need to survive—and any dream of AI is off the table. The good news is that the wave of the cloud has brought with it a whole set of new companies and technologies to collect and break down more information than we ever could have imagined, including cloud data warehouses, real-time data and integration, efficient data loading, transactional cloud databases, transformation and metrics. These products and others like them are giving us better information than ever before and the companies behind them have created more than $100B of market cap in the process.</p>



<p>The irony, though, is that atop this modern data stack, teams are still forced to use kludgy, decades-old analytics tools to actually make all of that data useful and deliver insights to users. But these are the types of opportunities we love at Sequoia: when a shift in the competitive landscape creates a clear opening for an enduring company to emerge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we are thrilled to embrace just such an opportunity and announce our partnership with <a href="https://hex.tech/">Hex</a>. We believe the platform that co-founders Barry McCardel, Caitlin Colgrove and Glen Takahashi and their team are creating has the potential to transform how businesses work together—in modern languages, with modern infrastructure. Hex starts its journey with data scientists, offering them the best way to collaborate on notebooks and work together to deliver insights. It ends with an analytics platform that empowers both business users and data analysts to quickly find the answers they need to do their jobs.</p>



<p>We learned about Hex through our partnerships with Snowflake and dbt, where customers were raving about their experiences with the product. People tell us they love the collaborative experience it offers and the ease it gives them in accessing the information they need. For some customers, Hex is already being used not only by data scientists, but the whole company.</p>



<p>When we first met Barry, Caitlin and Glen, they weren’t raising money. We are thankful to them for nonetheless being patient with our interest—and for seeing value in the opportunity to partner with us. We are excited to put Team Sequoia behind Hex, and we look forward to seeing them accomplish their dream of making data an easy and collaborative experience for everyone. By doing so, they will rightfully claim their spot as the crown jewel atop the modern data stack that is changing our world.</p>

      Developer Tools 2.0          
	By Charlie Curnin, Josephine Chen, and Stephanie Zhan	 



Illustration: Tyler Comrie



Published March 22, 2023
        Generative AI stands to change how work happens in one industry after another. But software engineering’s transformation isn’t done yet.        



 
<p>Copilot has caught lightning in a bottle. GitHub’s AI-powered companion for developers, suggesting the code you might want to write next, is a hit in more ways than one. It’s beloved by engineers, attracting more than <a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/">a million</a> within about a year and delivering a substantial boost in productivity. (Even if you’re a <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1608895189078380544">top engineer</a>, it might write half your code or more.) It also stands to become a commercial blockbuster. Charging $10-19 per seat per month, Copilot could grow to generate $1 billion or more in annual revenue among GitHub’s <a href="https://github.blog/2023-01-25-100-million-developers-and-counting/">100 million users</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Copilot’s success has set off a gold rush. Founders have raced to bring the power of large language models to all kinds of other industries, building tools to help professionals write, code, design and create media. There’s “Copilot for lawyers,” “Copilot for doctors” and “Copilot for designers,” and many more “Copilot for X”’s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are all exciting directions. We think <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">generative AI</a> stands to transform <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyatweetybird/status/1628446962742874112">one industry after another</a>, making all kinds of professionals <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-for-work-perspective/">more effective at work</a> and delighting waves of consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there’s a lot more to do for developers. Copilot, which leverages OpenAI’s model Codex, may be just the opening salvo in AI’s transformation of how software engineers work. Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">predicted</a> in 2017 that neural networks would create a new generation of software, “Software 2.0,” and we may see the same reinvention of the tooling that helps people make software—a “Developer Tools 2.0.”</p>



<p>There are many opportunities here. Some founders are iterating on the in-editor, get-help-while-you’re-coding experience Copilot popularized, trying different interaction patterns or different models. Think of Replit’s <a href="https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter">Ghostwriter</a>, Soucegraph’s <a href="https://twitter.com/sourcegraph/status/1618719148087070721">Cody</a>, <a href="https://www.tabnine.com/">TabNine</a> and others.</p>



<p>Many other opportunities lie further afield. You might target work engineers do beyond writing code, like debugging and documentation—or other work engineering orgs do, like incident response. You might think of value props other than “write code faster,” like “write code that’s more performant or more secure.” You might throw out the plugin form factor and rebuild an entire application. You might focus on personas other than the software engineer, like the data scientist who needs a boost writing in notebooks (see: <a href="https://hex.tech/magic/">Hex</a>), or the data analyst toiling away writing SQL queries. There’s a wide waterfront of opportunities to explore and many places to hook into developers’ workflows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building legendary companies to enable this won’t be easy. Copilot faces <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446821/microsoft-openai-github-copilot-class-action-lawsuit-ai-copyright-violation-training-data">legal scrutiny</a> over concerns related to <a href="https://githubcopilotlitigation.com/pdf/06823/1-0-github_complaint.pdf">software piracy</a>. Microsoft, the incumbent with control over both GitHub and VS Code, enjoys significant distribution advantages. Many founders have started building with LLMs, making many opportunities competitive. GitHub itself just announced plans to offer broader AI functionality through a brand-new version of Copilot, powered by GPT-4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in our view, there’s a massive opportunity for AI to transform software engineering, and it’s a matter of who, not if. We think important ingredients in who prevails will be focusing on developer experience, providing net-new capabilities, and making strategic choices around how to land and expand in developers’ workflows. Success here can mean rewriting how engineering happens—and having a chance at building a generational company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today we’re happy to announce a new partnership with Transak, whose developer integration toolkit will enable the purchase of crypto assets directly within Brave Wallet. Transak offers Brave Wallet users access to over 50 new tokens across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum—giving self-custodial wallet users more options to buy and deposit their preferred tokens.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to be integrating Transak to Brave Wallet to give our users more choice in what crypto they buy and how they choose to buy it,” said Brian Bondy, co-founder and CTO at Brave.</p>
<p>“Brave browser has always been on the forefront of supporting Web3 and is enabling so many users to securely interact with the ecosystem. Therefore, we are very proud to be supporting Brave Wallet in its mission to onboard more and more users to Web3. Our integration will enable these users to easily buy crypto via their locally supported payment methods and deposit directly to their Brave Wallet,” said Sami Start, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Transak.</p>
<p>In addition to Visa and Mastercard, Transak offers a wide variety of payment methods—Apple Pay, Google Pay, UPI, Mobi Kwik, AstroPay, and Maya—which greatly expands coverage to more customers around the world. For a full list of payment options by region, see <a href="https://transak.notion.site/On-Ramp-Payment-Methods-Fees-Other-Details-b0761634feed4b338a69f4f186d906a5">Transak’s documentation</a>, and for a guide on how to buy crypto with Brave Wallet, check out Brave’s <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/10800687258637-How-do-I-buy-crypto-with-Brave-Wallet-">support center.</a></p>

 Using Transak to buy crypto in Brave Wallet 


    
    

    


    


    
    

 
 Open the Brave browser, and then open Brave Wallet.
 
 You can either visit brave://wallet, click the wallet icon in the address bar, or select Wallet from the browser options menu. 
 
 
 Select “Buy” in the wallet panel or wallet page. 
 Select a network in the “All Networks” dropdown menu, and then search your desired token. 
 Pick Transak from the list of available on-ramp partners. 
 Follow the steps to complete the purchase with Transak. 
 
<p>Brave Wallet enables Brave users to store, manage, grow, and swap their crypto portfolio across multiple blockchains from a single wallet. Unlike most crypto wallets, Brave Wallet is browser-native, meaning it doesn’t require any additional downloads or extensions, helping reduce security risks and reliance on extra CPU and memory. Users can transact with thousands of crypto assets with superior safety and performance, as well as connect with other wallets and Web3 DApps.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>On November 6, 2019, the Electric Coin Company (ECC) signed an <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Trademark-Agreement-ZF_ECC_notarized-pages-and-signed.pdf">agreement</a> with the Zcash Foundation (“ZF” or “Foundation”) to donate the worldwide trademark rights for registered Zcash logos and word marks. This donation is subject to a number of ongoing enforcement and performance obligations that ZF must undertake and maintain in order to remain in compliance with the agreement. The obligations include:</p><p>“Foundation will have the right, at its own expense, to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the trademark applications and registrations included in the Trademark Rights and the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of any new or additional U.S. and non-U.S. trademark applications and registrations for the Trademark Rights […] and agrees to take such actions as are necessary to […] maintain in good standing all trademark registrations”</p><p>In addition to the registration and enforcement requirements in the ECC/ZF agreement, ZF must also comply with trademark laws and regulations in fifteen countries/jurisdictions (including the European Union as one entity), with more likely to follow in the future. This is a significant undertaking by ZF as trademark related activities require both external and internal resources in order to ensure proper enforcement and maintenance of the registered marks.&nbsp;</p><p>Why is trademark enforcement important? In addition to ZF’s required actions under the ECC donation agreement and required actions under all registration jurisdictions, enforcement is important in order to:</p>  Identify official sources of information, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent or incorrect information.  Identify official apps and services, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent activities.  Protect the reputation of Zcash, its associated entities, and the Zcash community.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>How does ZF monitor trademark usage and how is enforcement initiated? ZF utilizes a multi-faceted approach:</p>  We work with multiple trademark lawyers to inform and lead our worldwide registration and enforcement efforts. These efforts include monitoring trademark registrars worldwide to ensure we are disputing potential infringements as early in the registration or renewal processes as possible.  We subscribe to multiple “watch services” that monitor apps, social media usernames, domain name registrations, and other online services. When a trademark violation is identified, we take immediate action to notify the offending party and resolve the violation.   <p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of our enforcement partners identifies Zcash trademark violations with a focus on social media and apps. Through only this one partner, since November 2021, we have flagged 793 incidents and we have successfully enforced 602 infringements, with 78 enforcements currently pending. In addition, we have 8 “major” incidents underway (which may include URLs, apps, social media, and/or trademark registrations) in cooperation with law firms in six countries.</p><p>Enforcement actions can be lengthy (and costly) processes with opportunities for both ZF and the alleged offender to respond and counter-respond multiple times prior to a final resolution.</p><p>ZF will include trademark action tracking statistics, beginning with the Q1 2023 report, to further increase transparency related to our trademark enforcement actions and progress.&nbsp;</p><p>What can you do to help keep current and future Zcash community members safe from scams and misinformation?</p>  Become familiar with ZF’s <a href="https://zfnd.org/trademark-policy/">trademark policy</a>.&nbsp;  If you create, or have created, a project that requires trademark usage approval and you haven’t requested approval yet, please do so <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BTlMl98PCJ8ZwPWDcNd4xprRHtjSbdCj5navaOuPjWY/viewform?edit_requested=true">via this form</a>.&nbsp;  If you create, or have created, a project that does not require trademark usage approval (because it is informational or otherwise isn’t required by the policy), please ensure your project is clearly marked as an unofficial source to avoid confusion.&nbsp;  Report suspected trademark violations <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uXLdYuSxCMuzk4HZULg-J78rrnOE0qey9P8rQHX_LVg/viewform?edit_requested=true">via this form</a>.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>ZF appreciates your assistance and cooperation as we strive to keep the Zcash community informed, safe from scams and misinformation, and presenting a unified and clear message across all online platforms.&nbsp;</p>

 Building games of imperfect information with Aztec’s Noir&nbsp;language <p>Noir was conceived of as an open-source, universal zero knowledge language. It was always meant to make the experience of developing in zero-knowledge much more accessible, by:</p>  having simple to read syntax that’s easy to reason&nbsp;about  abstracting away cryptographic concepts and security considerations  incorporating cryptographic libraries for commonly used crypto primitives  <p>So when we heard about the <a href="https://mach34.space/">Mach34</a> team and their work on BattleZips — a Battleship clone relying on zero-knowledge — we knew we had to work together.</p><p>We met the Mach34 team after they placed at the ETHDenver 2022 hackathon with a Circom-written version of the classic Hasbro game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a>.</p><p>Shortly after we released <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge-ff43f38d86d9">Noir</a>, they expressed interest in rewriting Battlezips, providing us feedback, and creating a tutorial series on writing zk circuits and programs in&nbsp;Noir.</p><blockquote>📺 Watch the BattleZips-Noir YouTube series&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25_FzjlG7ZU&amp;list=PLabpoAlaCBY3SM6xHmZCOhPHlmLB4EY6H&amp;ab_channel=AztecNetwork">here</a>.</blockquote><p>We provided them an Aztec Grant in late 2022, and they were off to the races, culminating in showcasing the Noir-powered Battlezips running in the browser at our sponsored game night at ETHDenver 2023.</p><blockquote>🚢 Play Battlezips <a href="https://battlezips.com/">in your&nbsp;browser</a>.</blockquote><p>Here’s an unabridged conversation with Mach34 on their experience building on Noir and what developers can expect building on the universal zk language.</p> A Noir-ish conversation with&nbsp;Mach34  Q: Tell us about BattleZips. How does the game use zero-knowledge cryptography? <blockquote>A: BattleZips is a zero-knowledge implementation of the popular board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a> that uses proofs to shield ship positions. While this is by no means an original idea for a zero-knowledge application, Battleships was chosen as it is a simple but complete example of integrating arbitrary business logic in zero knowledge circuits.</blockquote><blockquote>By settling zero knowledge proofs in smart contracts, we can create novel digital and economic interactions that make the existing role of Information Escrow by third parties obsolete. BattleZips helped us understand how to apply zero knowledge proofs, and we hope the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25_FzjlG7ZU&amp;list=PLabpoAlaCBY3SM6xHmZCOhPHlmLB4EY6H&amp;ab_channel=AztecNetwork">BattleZips-Noir course</a> gives you the same advantages!</blockquote> Q: What inspired you to start Mach 34 and develop BattleZips? Why explore&nbsp;Noir? <blockquote>A: BattleZips marked the beginning of our journey into zero-knowledge cryptography and expanded our horizon on where this technology could be applied in real world use&nbsp;cases.</blockquote><blockquote>This is one of the factors that lead us to creating Mach 34. Mach 34 is a Web3 and ZK Software Consultancy. We chose to focus on mastering the web3 tech stack for the sake of expertise rather than a specific application. This enables us to explore any industry ripe for decentralization, growing our overall experience with the enterprise of&nbsp;web3.</blockquote><blockquote>Corporations and governments alike habitually abuse the authoritative topology of web2 networks; as Web3/ ZK Consultants, we have the means and the desire to help innovators usurp centralized processes and give sovereignty in cyberspace back to the&nbsp;users.</blockquote><blockquote>It is crucial that we stay up to date with the latest trends in this fast developing space to ensure we provide superior expertise to clients. Our prior experience writing proofs demonstrated to us that there is a significant variation between the different tools that exist, how rapidly they can be applied to an engineering problem, and what they accomplish. This led us to explore Noir upon its official release and see how it differentiated itself from pre-existing alternatives.</blockquote> Q: How did you find the ease of usability of Noir compared to other zero-knowledge domain specific languages you’ve worked&nbsp;with? <blockquote>A: Prior to Noir we used the Circom language and the Halo 2 proving system written in Rust. Proceeding from a first look at the Noir documentation to writing circuits was a fairly quick and straightforward process.</blockquote><blockquote>We thought that Noir lived up to most of what it promised in its introductory <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge-ff43f38d86d9">medium post</a>. If one were to begin learning Noir without wanting to get bogged down in learning the inner workings of ZK and how circuits translate to proofs then they could certainly do so. It does a good job of abstracting away from the more complex aspects of the&nbsp;topic.</blockquote><blockquote>One thing that could improve the developer experience is ensuring that the nargo command-line tool and the Aztec NPM packages compile the same Noir version. This is an issue we ran into mid way through the development process that resulted in a refactor to ensure we could test our circuits with the Aztec NPM packages.</blockquote> Q: As a full-stack development shop, how has the process of incorporating zk-cryptography changed the way you approach software development projects? <blockquote>A: Our interest in zero-knowledge cryptography was one of the driving factors for starting Mach 34. Historically and to this day, one of the most sought after skills in the web3 space is the ability to write smart contracts.</blockquote><blockquote>Similarly as the past few years have shown, we believe enabling privacy and scalability in web3 applications is only going to become more and sought after and ultimately a necessity. In anticipation of this we have positioned ourselves at Mach 34 to have the skills and expertise necessary to help companies engineer ZK solutions.</blockquote> Q: What kind of impact do you think Noir and other zero-knowledge domain specific languages will have on the broader software development community? Where do you see the industry&nbsp;going? <blockquote>A: Noir and other ZK DSLs play a pivotal role in the proliferation of zero-knowledge cryptography by abstracting away from the underlying cryptographic principles.</blockquote><blockquote>As history shows, abstraction is absolutely necessary for any technology to become widely adopted. If engineers were never able to design high level programming languages from low-level opcodes then we would have far fewer and less effective software developers than we do&nbsp;today.</blockquote><blockquote>Once the complexity and thought is removed from the underlying components that make zero-knowledge cryptography possible in the first place, engineers have more time to think about applications that would benefit from ZK. It looks like we are about to enter an exciting phase where we will start to see more examples of the technology applied to real world use&nbsp;cases.</blockquote> Q: What advice would you give to developers who are interested in learning more about zero-knowledge cryptography and how to use it in their projects? <blockquote>A: This is definitely an exciting space to get involved in given it is still very much in its infancy. It is poised to solve issues related to privacy and scalability in public blockchains, as well as contexts out of web3 where there is currently a lack of much needed&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>This being said, resources for learning are still sparse and those that exist often have a technical complexity that can make them hard to digest. It can take quite a bit of patience and perseverance to become acclimated to this space but it is well worth the effort given that you are one of the individuals pioneering the ecosystem.</blockquote><blockquote>If you are a developer that has an interest in getting started in ZK then I think reading some high-level introductory materials would be a good starting&nbsp;point.</blockquote><blockquote>After a basic understanding is gained on the topic then exploring a DSL like Circom or Noir to write a simple circuit would be a beneficial next&nbsp;step.</blockquote><blockquote>Once it becomes clearer to you what can be accomplished and what tools are at your disposal then really the limit is what you can ideate. The cool thing is that there is still so much room for novel innovation that it could very well be the case no one has thought of your idea yet. Don’t sit idle and wait for things to develop further! Now is a great time to jump&nbsp;in!</blockquote> Q: Are there any upcoming projects at Mach 34 that you can share with us that utilize zero-knowledge cryptography or other cutting-edge technologies? <blockquote>A: Mach 34 has been researching and working towards constructing a “Zero-Knowledge State Channel”. While rollups offer fantastic scalability, we were put off by the need for a sequencer. Furthermore, aside from Aztec Connect and a few others, ZK Rollups do not have any private state. Thus, we began to explore how state channels might be repurposed with zero knowledge.</blockquote><blockquote>To open a ZK State Channel, parties will agree on the terms of the execution (like a smart contract). The channel initialization dictates what steps can be taken next, and by whom. Rather than posting every transaction on-chain, a state object is recursively built off-chain.</blockquote><blockquote>While previous state channel constructions had optimistic trust assumptions, we can leverage ZK to perform verifiable computations that have instant, trustless finality. Once a state channel has reached an end condition, the entire state execution is notarized by posting the state channel proof on-chain for all nodes to verify in zero knowledge.</blockquote><blockquote>This final proof further employs zero knowledge to hide most of the intermediate state; only pre-determined derived metrics or public outputs are made publicly available on-chain.</blockquote><blockquote>This has many interesting use-cases; we plan to demonstrate how this construction is useful for credit scoring by adding ELO scores to the State Channel version of BattleZips. This provides a verifiable metric that scores the performance of an individual without revealing any of their in-game&nbsp;moves.</blockquote><blockquote>We envision countless use-cases for ZK State Channels across all segments of web3. Undoubtedly, there are use-cases that we haven’t thought of. For this reason, all of our work on ZK State Channels is free and open source. While we intend to utilize the infrastructure for profit, we want to make sure that all possibilities are explored in service of the best possible future for web3 developers and&nbsp;users.</blockquote> Q: What are some use cases you’re excited&nbsp;for? <blockquote>A: One area of exciting potential outside of blockchain is how zero-knowledge can transform personal identification.</blockquote><blockquote>When providing personal ID, the majority of the time more information is conveyed than necessary. Proving one is of a legal drinking age need only confirm the person is above 21 years of age, yet sharing the ID divulges information such as street address and&nbsp;name.</blockquote><blockquote>Using zero knowledge proofs conceivably one could prove they are at least 21 without having to provide additional information. Another example is having to provide a social security number in a KYC process. Leaking a SSN number can have catastrophic consequences so one would prefer this is done as infrequently as possible. With ZK proofs instead one could prove they bear a SSN number without needing to reveal exactly what theirs&nbsp;is.</blockquote> Explore the BattleZips project <p>We’re thrilled that the <a href="https://mach34.space">Mach34</a> team have done such a deep and candid dive into Noir’s capabilities, and their feedback has been invaluable.</p><p>For developers interested in building on Noir, check out their well-documented BattleZips repo.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/BattleZips/BattleZips">🚢 Explore the BattleZips Github repo and codebase</a>.</blockquote> Build on&nbsp;Noir <p>Interested in building zero-knowledge applications on Noir — or contributing to the open-source project?</p>  Get started in our docs&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">here</a>.

 The Ironic Bearishness of using VEIL as Cash 

<p></p>

<p>I and many others are long-time proponents of using both Veil and Bitcoin as cash. A discussion has arisen in the Veil community of people sponsoring developers working on specific development projects, although this is applicable to any Veil Project role.</p>

<p>One commented that as we are “Veiliens” we would surely prefer all remuneration to be done using Veil. This should communicate our preference for and support of Veil as a currency, and certainly it is superior as a privacy coin, but there are some factors that unexpectedly, or ironically, as some would put it, work the opposite!</p>

<p>Let’s suppose that we are paying a developer who has no other source of income, not even welfare. So we know that he has to pay for food or he will starve, and for computer resources too. While some might suppose that any Veil that gets sold for food must have been bought. Buying and selling pressure should cancel each other out, but this is not going to be the case.</p>

<p>Let’s consider that this Veil is not being bought at the exact same time as the same amounts are being sold, in fact, as a Veilien you already have a bag of it, but we also believe that Veil needs to recover 100 to 1000 times its current value, so we will consider the demand and supply and market sentiment dynamics as they are after a 99.9% drop in the value.</p>

<p>Certainly, if Veil had continued its rise in 2019 from its regular trading in the five to seven thousand satoshi range, with a little-known all time high of ten or twenty thousand sats, Veil would certainly be trading comfortably in the multi-dollar range. 20,000 satoshis today, at the time of writing is $5.63. Well, if you are prepared to pay someone 100,000 Veil for some work, valued at $338.20 today, with a Veil price of 12 sats (since increased before posting this article), knowing that those one hundred thousand Veil should be worth TWENTY BITCOIN, or USD$564,236.20, and with a $100,000 Bitcoin, TWO MILLION DOLLARS, you would not want to part with that Veil knowing that they will be DUMPED on the market and probably not even get the $300 dollars worth of work you are expecting!</p>

<p>We see therefore that the Veilien above, by allowing those 100,000 Veil to be dumped on a weak market is not only communicating that they don’t think Veil should regain its all time high, but his or her action will only further depress the market.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that no Veil team member is receiving 100,000 Veil in a month for their work. So, let’s consider the opposite approach. Paying with a currency that has established value and a highly liquid market. That might be Bitcoin itself, or if the sponsor and the sponsored developer live in the same country, it might be their shared national fiat currency.</p>

<p>Before that, let’s consider a managed approach to using Veil as an incentive. The sponsor has the Veil already, as should be expected for a Veilien believer, so he pays the developer, and at the same time places buy orders for the full amount that the developer will need to sell for his or her essential needs. However low the sponsor places his buy orders is the maximum extractable value that the developer can likely instantly gain from the market, BUT there might be other sellers, and the developer might not manage to sell all of the sponsorship before the sponsor’s BIDs are all taken. So, the sponsor needs to bid for a greater amount of Veil or the value transfer from the sponsor to the developer may fail. This has inefficiencies, as the sponsor has to budget more than the value the developer will gain from the transaction, and both will have to play the market, distracting both from developing Veil.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the fiat sponsorship approach, much as we instinctively abhor and avoid fiat currencies. Assuming the sponsor and the sponsored both are able to use the given fiat currency, not at all certain these days, so long as there are no transaction fees, and no interference from banking or government agencies, the full value of the sponsorship will be enjoyed by the beneficiary of that sponsorship, and they will be able to put their full efforts into the necessary developments they have been hired to do. At the same time, the sponsor, a faithful Veilien, can hold on to their (more) valuable (to them) Veil, to be used when the product of the development work has been able to make Veil more popular. Furthermore, the developer seeing how they are improving the ecosystem, may be motivated to budget some percentage of their earnings, from the sponsorship or from other income, into buying some Veil for themselves! This will be Veil that does not get dumped on the market.</p>

<p>Now, I’m still in favour of using Veil, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and so on, as cash, it is necessary, when you expect a long term price recovery, to replace any amount that has been used for spending, knowing that when you spend what was, and should once again be, ten thousand dollars, but only receive five hundred dollars of value for it, if you really believe that, you will replace it the same day, as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p>Please join our Veil community. We hope you become a “Veilien” and see the merit in sponsoring a developer for the RingCT staking project, or for other projects within the Veil ecosystem, or sponsor or become a marketer. Don’t be too shy to attach your business name to the sponsorship, for example: “Bill’s Bicycle Boutique, sponsor of Sato’s She, Veil RingCT staking developer!”</p>

<p>[ Please note that this approach assumes that the current coin price is as a result of a deep bear market. It is highly likely that the opposite approach would be most popular in the heights of a bull market, where anyone wants to get their hands on the currency as a high priority. ]</p>

  Partnering with Turnkey: Crypto Private Key Infrastructure  <p>Sam, Bryce and Jack are giving builders the protections they deserve—with an accessible, self-serve API.</p>  <p>By Alfred Lin</p><p>Published March 21, 2023</p>  



 
<p>Throughout the ups and downs of crypto financial markets, one thing has remained the same: builders are still building. The number of <a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report">active developers</a> contributing to open-source projects continues to climb, and is now more than 300% of what it was in 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the crypto developer stack takes shape, custody is, of course, a core pillar—but many custody products were originally designed to support buy-and-hold financial use cases, not the development of new products. While existing enterprise custody solutions are helping larger organizations scale, developers have their own unique set of circumstances, and in their search for self-serve solutions, too often encounter long sales cycles, large annual minimums, and delays in support for new chains and tokens. Many developers simply give up on the API dream and settle for integrating existing solutions that don’t fully meet their needs.</p>



<p>Sam McInvgale, Bryce Ferguson and Jack Kearney met while building Coinbase’s innovative Custody product, and have seen these challenges firsthand. They were determined to give developers the custody infrastructure necessary to make building in crypto easier. The result is <a href="https://www.turnkey.io/">Turnkey</a>, a private key management platform offering the same advanced security protections major financial institutions demand, but designed just for developers. Sam, Bryce, Jack and their team have built an accessible, easy to use, API-first product that helps users self-custody their crypto via secure enclaves, a deterministic operating system and a custom language for managing permissions. Developers can go from sign-up to signing a transaction in minutes, not months—and generate thousands of wallets programmatically across chains.</p>



<p>We first met the Turnkey team through Bryce, a Sequoia Scout whose passion for all things crypto we knew well. When he introduced us to Sam and Jack, we quickly realized this was a company with three co-founders who would each be backable on their own.&nbsp; They now are leading an expert team with years of experience securing billions of dollars of crypto across Coinbase, BitGo and Polychain. We are grateful for the opportunity to partner with them and lead Turnkey’s seed round.<br><br>Now, they are <a href="mailto:hello@turnkey.io">expanding that team</a> and launching a <a href="http://www.turnkey.io">closed beta</a> of their platform, and we encourage anyone building in crypto to give it a try. Today’s launch is an exciting step toward the future of the crypto developer stack, and we can’t wait to see how Turnkey empowers the next generation of builders.</p>

  Partnering with Tavus: AI-Personalized Videos  <p>In a video-first world, how do you create customized outreach that scales? Hassaan and Quinn are using AI to crack the code.</p>  <p>By Stephanie Zhan</p><p>Published March 20, 2023</p>  



Tavus co-founders Hassaan Raza and Quinn Favret



 
<p>We live in a world where sales emails often seem too impersonal, where many marketing materials are filled with stock content, and where the efficacy of traditional performance marketing has declined severely. Audience engagement has become a scarce and valuable resource—and capturing attention has become an increasingly acute challenge. Customers want only the content most relevant to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tavus co-founders Hassaan Raza and Quinn Favret knew this pain all too well. By experimenting at their previous company, they discovered that personalized videos that touched on the specific needs and desires of each customer received far higher click-through and response rates compared to content meant for the masses. And so they labored away, creating hundreds of clips for their customers during overnight recording marathons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But they knew there had to be a better way. How could you build a workflow tool that would empower business professionals to create personalized videos, but without needing to manually record each and every one?</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">Tavus</a>: a platform that can build a personalized AI version of any sales or marketing professional. A rep starts by completing a 15-minute&nbsp; recording to train their personalized AI, then records a single template for each set of videos they want to create. Using a simple yet powerful text editor, designing individual videos for every customer is as easy as typing up a script, with unlimited variables for personalization to address their specific needs—and voilà! Tavus automatically creates clips with pixel-perfect videos of you that replicate your facial expressions and voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I first tried the product in late 2021, the night after meeting Hassaan and Quinn. It was in alpha at the time, but even then, it felt like magic. We were delighted to partner with them at the beginning of their journey, and to lead their seed round. They are a special pair, with vision, grit, customer obsession, and a creative lens through which to redefine the way sales and marketing should be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, just 18 months later, Tavus creates video on par in quality with anything you would create manually—and makes it a whole lot easier and faster! Even better, Tavus integrates into a company’s programmatic workflows: if a lead submits a form from your website, for example, they can automatically receive a customized Tavus video follow-up instead of a standard email. Already, these customers are seeing results—including 10x higher engagement and 300% increases in response rates, all while reps report saving 10+ hours per week.&nbsp;<br><br>AI is reshaping every industry, and sales and marketing tools are no exception. We’re excited to be working with the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tavus-io/jobs/">growing Tavus team</a> to supercharge the work of the next generation of sales and marketing professionals. Come check it out here: <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">tavus.io</a>.</p>

   Hester Peirce is one of five SEC Commissioners. She's been a Commissioner since 2018, with her term ending in 2025. Peirce, a previous podcast guest of Bankless, consistently makes first principles statements and is known to often dissent for her colleagues on crypto-related actions…we talk about that in today’s episode. These are a couple of many reasons why we enjoy her and her guidance so much.

As with all L2 rollups, sequencer decentralisation remains a pressing issue that needs to be solved.</p><p>We were joined by Jordi Baylina (tech lead) &amp; David Schwartz (CTO) from Polygon's zkEVM, to discuss the relationship between Polygon's multiple zk rollups, their use cases, as well as network statistics for zk-EVM.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The relationship between Polygon and zkEVM  The differences between Polygon’s multiple zk rollups  Network participant roles in zkEVM  Transaction submission stages  Sequencer decentralisation  Transaction costs  Use cases for different zk rollups  Open-sourceness, decentralisation and the licensing of zkEVM’s prover  The decentralised identity project (DID)  Roadmap after main-net launch  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://epicenter.tv/episodes/486">Polygon zkEVM – From Circuits to Mainnet – Part 1</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jbaylina">Jordi Baylina on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsrz">David Schwartz on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonZK">Polygon zkEVM on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

      Vijaye Raji Wants You to Think Impact        <p>By Paul Boutin</p><p>Photography: MERON MENGHISTAB</p><p>Published March 16, 2023</p>        After 20 years working with the powerful tools used inside Microsoft and Facebook, Statsig’s CEO is building versions that can help every company deliver measurable real-world results.      



 
<p>“It takes a special courage to say look, I understand where the data is going, but we’re going the other way,” Vijaye Raji tells me with contagious cheer. The statement might seem against Raji’s interests given that his startup, Statsig, founded in 2021, builds testing and validation tools designed to give organizations the rich real-world data they need to make product decisions.</p>



<p>The more you learn about Raji’s life, however, the more it makes sense that his product isn’t going to tell you what decisions to make. In a 20-year career, he’s learned to defy conventional wisdom and make his own decisions—most recently leaving a post leading thousands of engineers to found an 8-person startup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Sequoia partner Mike Vernal’s words, “Vijaye is the most impactful engineer that I’ve ever worked with. He’s incredibly pragmatic and punctual and just a get-shit-done kind of person. If I could have just one engineer on anything, that would be Vijaye.”</p>



<p>Raji is clearly confident but not overly eager to talk about himself. He’d rather explain at length that organizations often make decisions without the data they really need. Or they look at limited-scope data, which leads to short-term focus while missing the big picture. Or (there are so many ways to fail!) they’ll go overboard the other way and let the numbers decide everything against their better sense.</p>



<p>“Data is always optimizing locally,” he says. “Follow it and you’re climbing to the highest local ground. To get to much higher ground, you may need to go through a dip first.” Collecting data from a wider area, with more local details, is like getting the best possible map of uncharted waters ahead. “You need to have product sense and apply it to the data,” he cautions. But first, you need the data.</p>



<p>With Statsig, Raji wants to give other organizations the breadth and depth of data enjoyed by tech giants.&nbsp; He thinks this will let them make better decisions and choose new directions, informed by real-world data about their customers’ behavior.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Vijaye is the most impactful engineer that I’ve ever worked with.… If I could have just one engineer on anything, that would be Vijaye.”</p>
mike vernal</blockquote>



<p>As a boy in Puducherry, India, young Vijaye took an interest in programming at age 12. A computer was beyond his family’s budget, so he did his coding on a machine at the local library. Once, he convinced the librarian to lock him in overnight so he could pull an all-nighter.</p>



<p>Despite his enthusiasm for tech, Raji was cautious about leaving his family behind. When it came time for college, he attended nearby Pondicherry University rather than one of the top IT schools from which many Indian-born engineers in Silicon Valley have graduated. “I got into a bunch of colleges that were outside my town,” he says, “but I didn’t want to go far from family. My dad was working abroad, so my mom definitely loved for me to stay close. But it was a big decision—there are better colleges that I had to give up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time he graduated, Raji’s father had returned home. Vijaye felt OK to take a job 500 miles away in Hyderabad. Before long, Indian outsourcing giant Wipro tapped him to relocate to Finland for Nokia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having never traveled far, Vijaye says he had to learn a lot that others took for granted: “I had never flown on a plane before. I had to learn how to fasten my seat belt.” In Finland, he quickly learned that spicy food and a meat-free diet were still an anomaly at the time. Then there was Finland’s weather: “I moved there in spring, and when November came I didn’t know what hit me.” Puducherry, on the Bay of Bengal, rarely dips below 70 degrees in winter. Yet, he says, he enjoyed discovering new ways of living and came to appreciate them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After two winters in Finland, Raji got an offer from Microsoft in Seattle. Wipro was paying him $2,600 per year—good for India at the time—but Microsoft’s offer letter promised a $72,000 annual salary. The still unworldly Raji believed that, of course, the number was a ridiculous typo.</p>



<p>Once his friends had convinced him it wasn’t, he was all in to relocate halfway around the world for a company he admired. “I had learned to program on QBasic, and then Visual Basic and Visual C++, all thanks to Microsoft,” he says. “It was like a dream when I got that offer.”</p>



<p>He didn’t know it, but he would work for Microsoft for nearly a decade. He stayed longer than he’d have preferred, to avoid the risk of losing his visa should he leave. “I was stuck in green-card hell for 9.5 years,” he quips. “There was a running joke that the fastest way to get a green card was to get married, have a kid in the U.S., and when that kid is 18 years old, they can sponsor you for your green card.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not that he hated his job. Raji worked on critical projects including the Windows Application Framework, SQL Server Modeling Language, Microsoft TV and Visual Studio, which grew into the VS Code application that millions of programmers worldwide are using today. As a side project, he created the Small Basic programming language designed to appeal to beginners.</p>



<p>Four years in, he met local high-school teacher Ashley Lauren. When they eventually married in 2009, Ashley sponsored him for his green card, which he obtained a snappy three months later. He says now, “Microsoft wasn’t bad, but I was ready to go.”</p>

<p>Sequoia partner Mike Vernal had worked at Microsoft in those same years and then moved to Facebook. When Raji, whom he hadn’t met, arrived at Facebook later, Vernal says other ex-Microsoft coworkers told him to pounce to get Vijaye on his team. What they didn’t tell Mike was to make sure he was early. At that point, Raji had no patience for people who don’t show up on time. He passed on joining Vernal’s group, but the two became friends over time.</p>



<p>Raji hadn’t planned to stay at Facebook a full decade either, but they kept promoting him. He joined Facebook’s Seattle campus when it was an office with a dozen people, and ended up leading the operation as it grew to 6,500 people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, he says, a startup seemed the one big thing he hadn’t done: “I’ve done engineering. I’ve done large orgs, I’ve made decisions on where to invest in real estate to house 20,000 planned Facebook employees in Seattle. I’ve done commerce, I’ve done ads, I’ve done gaming, I’ve done entertainment.</p>



<p>“It was time for something new. For that, there’s nothing better or bigger than starting your own company and making it successful. And what I’m doing now is data infrastructure, something completely different from everything I’ve worked on before.”</p>



<p>To be clear, both Raji and Vernal—who had left Facebook to become a partner at Sequoia—toyed with several startup ideas in the late 2010s. When they eventually converged in early 2019 on the idea for Statsig, Raji made plans to wrap up his role at Facebook, when he was still head of Facebook Seattle and also of Facebook Gaming.</p>



<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself—by then only two levels up on the org chart—pinged Raji on Messenger (they had chatted often) with a counter-offer: the head of the company’s Entertainment group was taking the place of another departing executive. To Zuckerberg, Vijaye seemed the obvious choice to step up from managing not only gaming but video, music, movies, sports and who knows what next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entertainment was a major part of Facebook’s future. Even Raji agreed it could be a tough year for Facebook if anyone else took the job. “Organizations are very resilient,” he says, “nothing ever breaks because somebody leaves… but, I felt a sense of obligation. I committed to another 18 months.”</p>



<p>Finally, nearly two years later in February 2021, Raji handed in his Facebook badge to start Statsig.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Raji says that what he experienced at Facebook was a builder-centric culture that most companies just don’t have from the top down. “Decisions were all data-driven,” he says. “No more debates in conference rooms. Products are built quickly, validated with testing, and the successful ones survive while the unsuccessful are discarded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook engineers can do this because the entire company uses the same set of infrastructure tools. It doesn’t just make work more efficient, it enables a cultural shift. Facebook engineers don’t measure themselves by ship goals—“I shipped two features this year”—but by performance results: “I shipped a feature that boosted engagement by 2.5 percent.”</p>



<p>Statsig is the latest of several companies like Honeycomb and <a href="https://www.scuba.io/">Scuba.io</a> that were founded by Facebook alumni looking to bring these tools and the culture they enable to as many other companies as possible—a chance to have an impact on the way software is built at any company, maybe even as an industry.</p>



<p>“So far, we’ve built our own versions of a half dozen of Facebook’s tools,” he says. “We’re adding more every few weeks.” For example, Statsig’s <a href="https://blog.statsig.com/introducing-pulse-b38f25790d09">Pulse</a> is a powerful tool for internal A/B testing based on Facebook’s Deltoid. It’s the kind of super tool that big companies like Uber and Spotify can afford to build for themselves, but most startups can’t. Raji is certain that Statsig will empower a foundational cultural shift among customers—from ship goals to metric goals. For non-engineers: It’s not what you build, but what’s your impact?</p>



<p>“What amazed me off the bat with Statsig was the strength and breadth of user-love that the team has garnered,” shares Dannie Herzberg, a Sequoia partner.&nbsp; “Join their Slack community and you’ll see prospects and customers from early-stage startups all the way to enterprise companies sharing their enthusiasm for the product and celebrating new features as they’re launched.”</p>



<p>For Raji and several Facebook colleagues who jumped ship to join him, starting Statsig meant suddenly downshifting to work with eight people instead of eighty thousand, having to learn the partner ecosystem, having to learn to manage a startup business P&amp;L, and so much else they’d been able to leave to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like most startup teams, they found this exhausting and also exhilarating. But as Statsig sailed off on its own, Raji looked back to Facebook’s shores and realized he’d missed the chance to take something valuable with him: “As the head of Entertainment I had access to the world-class sales team and world-class marketing team, and never once bothered to learn that. Now I kick myself: If only I could go back and spend quality time with the sales leaders, the marketing leaders, the business leaders. I had the opportunity.”</p>



 Delivering impact 



<p>Regrets aside, Raji has a track record of identifying projects and companies where he can have an impact on the outside world. What does he look for?</p>



 
 A unique perspective. A credible vision that isn’t shared by the majority. “If an idea and its value proposition is super-obvious to you, but not so obvious to others, that’s an idea worth exploring.” 



 A short time from plan to product. “The implementation of a minimum viable product should take weeks or months, not years. You don’t want to be developing in a vacuum for too long. Take it to potential customers as soon as possible.” Many startups have gone heads-down for nearly a year, only to emerge with a product that isn’t what the market wants at all. 



 VCs getting excited. “Venture capital investors have a broad line of sight into the market. They can quickly spot if something solves a real pain point.” Few ideas are 100% novel. They’ve seen similar ventures crash, so they perk up when they see one with an approach that could avoid known roadblocks. 
 



<p>Raji is indeed known for being reliably punctual, and impatient with those who aren’t. Contrary to popular tech-industry myth, you don’t win by simply working all waking hours, but by developing good time management. Vijaye keeps a well-honed startup parent schedule: A tightly managed workday, followed by never missing playtime with his children after office hours. Then, after they’re tucked in, you can count on him to respond to critical messages later in the evening.</p>



<p>More important, he says, is not letting your first win or two convince you that you’re always right. He’s seen successful people presume that they have superior insight and use their past success—coupled with either undeniable charisma or a bulldozer persona—to get their way contrary to evidence and objections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Statsig is meant to be a set of tools to keep that from happening, by letting more organizations develop a nimble culture of real-world testing and measurement to drive decisions. “A lot of companies debate the merits of ideas in a conference room,” he says. “Every idea has its merits. The way you understand which one’s working and which one’s not working is actually putting it out to the people that use the product. You don’t have heated debates. If the customers like it, the numbers go up. If they don’t, the numbers go down.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m never attached to a decision that I make,” he concludes. “If there’s new data or evidence that proves that I’m wrong … well, I’m wrong.”</p>
