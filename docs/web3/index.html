<p>This post features four related videos. The first is a two-and-a-half-minute overview from DAO Stack, a company based in Israel, that describes a future of decentralized governance of cyber-physical systems with automated encoded rules.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, there’s a short clip from the neuro-economics talk at the Philocetes Center in 2007 about oxytocin-induced social trust. It’s a little under five minutes long. Listen to this and realize we are being dosed with “trust” hormones and steering systems by our personal devices via clicks, likes, etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Following that is a second from a recent talk on “regenerative” finance or ReFi about phone-based prompts for actionable “sustainable” behavior change. Pay close attention around timestamp three minutes about phones, peer signaling, and timely prompts. It’s about four minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The third is a longer video, about thirty minutes. I made it in the spring of 2021 about Philadelphia’s <a href="https://www.recyclereminders.com/blog/recycling-guides/a-guide-to-recycling-in-philadelphia/">RecycleBank Points program</a>, started by a Wharton alumnus. I created it after I began to realize what it was really about after years of hauling my plastic bin with a barcode to the front sidewalk every Wednesday.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For folks looking to take a deeper dive into how crypto-economics is meant to interface with the internet of everything, I feel like this series by Pat Rawson, co-founder of Curve Labs and former market guy for DAO Stack, lays out many of the concepts with which we should become more familiar.</p>

<p>This week I joined my Texas friend Lynn Davenport on her “Social Impact Podcast” for a half-hour discussion of school choice, digital vouchers, and the future of gig work where a contingent workforce is expected to build out Web3 extended reality under the supervision of artificial intelligence. </p>
<p>The culture wars are really doing a number on people – both sides. There is some irony in the fact that many proponents of school choice who may believe they’re getting one over on the government by securing a backpack of digital credits for independent education are actually taking poisoned bait back to the nest. It doesn’t make me happy, because I want all children to have opportunities that will allow them become thoughtful, curious, confident explorers of all that life has to offer and to have the supports they need to develop their gifts. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, what multi-national corporations have in store is a future of low-wage, on-demand work and a life slogging through code to try and stay one step ahead of an infernal machine. Yes, it’s sad state of affairs, which is why they system is implementing so many mental health initiatives – that and they also want the data sets to train their golem. Imagine, Oliver Reiser’s “World Brain” birthed from copious, well-ordered, collective trauma. So much to look forward to, right?</p>
<p>After the podcast I revisited the Institute for the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Institute-for-the-Future-Blockchain-Map-Document.pdf">Future’s Blockchain Decade Map for 2017-2027</a>. Having spent quite a bit of time learning more about the organizations involved with Ethereum smart contracts and “public goods,” I’m able to glean much more of their intent now. I’m mapping and thinking and preparing a few future livestreams on cybernetic governance tokens to “save” the commons.

<p>As crypto adoption increases, so does the pressing need for blockchain scalability. Monolithic blockchains provide data availability, consensus and execution on a single, base layer, which makes scaling them a difficult endeavour. Multiple layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions have been proposed to address computation and/or data availability, but they reach the same design bottlenecks: limited bandwidth, account state models, sequential transaction processing, etc. Modular blockchains separate the core functionalities, redesigning them as customisable building blocks. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability, adapting blockchain structure to its intended function.</p><p>We were joined by Nick Dodson, CEO and co-founder of Fuel Labs, to discuss modular execution layers and how they approach different aspects of blockchain design and scalability.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Nick’s background and founding Fuel Labs  Why most blockchain designs are not scalable  The vision behind Fuel Labs’ modular execution layer  The difference between L2 roll-ups and modular execution layers  Blockchain design philosophies and integrations  UTXO and multi-thread parallel transactions  UTXO vs. account model systems  Fuel Labs’ own virtual machine (VM)  Multiple native assets support  Developer experience switching to Sway DSL  Bridging to a settlement layer and interoperability  Building on Fuel  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://www.fuel.network/">Fuel Labs</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FuelLabs">Fuel Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickDodson">Nick on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

All updates are published in the teams’ own words, but may be edited for clarity, correctness, or compliance with Web3 Foundation’s editorial guidelines.</p>

 Nym clients — bringing mixnet technology to browsers and&nbsp;more! <p>Learn about Nym clients that you can use to build for&nbsp;privacy</p><p>The Nym mixnet is a powerful overlay network that protects privacy at the transport layer of the internet. And it is now available for integration into a wide variety of apps and wallets through the Nym&nbsp;clients!</p><p>This post gives a quick overview of the Nym clients that are currently available. If you want to learn more, do <a href="https://discord.gg/nym">get in touch</a> with the Nym Developer Relations team to find out about integrating network layer privacy and available grants for integrations and app development.</p><p>Why integrate a&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p>End-to-end encryption has become widely accepted as standard security practice. But although it effectively protects the contents of messages, data about the messages — metadata — leaks information at the network layer. Mixnets encrypt and mix individual data packets, thereby protecting any internet traffic from traffic analysis. In this way, the network provides powerful protection for metadata such as IP addresses and patterns of communication — the main targets for the kinds of ML powered surveillance practices of&nbsp;today.</p><p>How to connect to the&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p>In order for applications to connect to the mixnet, they have to utilise one of several Nym&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Each client is suited for different programming environments, but all perform the same underlying functions of connecting and authenticating with gateways, encrypting and routing outgoing packets, and decrypting incoming traffic. This means developers can focus on other aspects of application design whilst gaining the privacy features of the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Client #1 <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/integrations/wasm-client/">— WebAssembly Client</a></p><p>The WebAssembly client allows applications to connect to the mixnet from any webassembly-capable runtime. This is perfect for browser-based apps, edge-computing, and frameworks such as Electron or Tauri (the framework used to build both NymConnect and the Nym&nbsp;Wallet).</p><p>Typescript developers can easily utilise this client via the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk/v/1.1.4">Nym SDK</a>. If you are a JavaScript or TypeScript developer and would like to give things a try and see how it works, have a look at our <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/sdk/overview">docs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk">GitHub repository for examples</a> on how to use it. Rust developers can look forward to a Rust SDK coming in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>This is the very first time that the full privacy powers of mixnets are available easily and directly from a browser&nbsp;window!</p><p>Client #2 — Websocket client</p><p>The Websocket client does what it says on the tin — it is a standalone process which allows developers to communicate with the mixnet via a websocket connection, designed to be run on both desktops and remote&nbsp;servers.</p><p>So long as your application is written in a language that supports websockets (read: most!), you can use this client to communicate with the mixnet. This client has already been utilised in projects such as <a href="https://pastenym.ch/#/">Pastenym</a> and <a href="https://github.com/saleel/nymdrive">NymDrive</a>, and developers can check out a tutorial for setting up both client side code and a service provider to communicate with via the mixnet using the Websocket client&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/tutorials/nym-simple-websocket-tutorial/">here</a>.</p><p>Client #3 <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/integrations/socks5-client">— SOCKS&nbsp;client</a></p><p>The SOCKS client enables easy integration with any applications that can send traffic using the SOCKS4, SOCKS4a, or SOCKS5 proxy protocols.</p><p>NOTE: The latest <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-platform-wallet-and-nymconnect-v1-1-3-8a619487a0f7">Nym release</a> has now expanded the SOCKS client to also support SOCK4a and SOCKS4a, making the mixnet available for integration by a broader variety of applications and wallets, including Monero.</p><p>Developers may have seen this client before used in NymConnect, or in our quickstart guide, allowing you to access the mixnet without having to even open a code editor! Just set up a client and route your application traffic to it as per this&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/quickstart/socks5">guide</a>.</p><p>Developers wanting to integrate application code with this client will need to also set up a <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester/">Network Requester service</a> to proxy traffic from the mixnet to whatever service they wish to access in the clearnet.</p><p>Currently, the mixnet is enabled to end-users of Telegram, Keybase, Electrum wallet and Blockstream Green wallets via <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect.</a> If you want to run a service provider and/or gateway to privacy-enhance more applications, get in touch on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a>!</p><p>Dev resources</p><p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk">Nym SDK</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">Nym platform&nbsp;docs</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p>Relevant links:</p>  <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/">Shipyard</a>  <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/service-grants">Service grants</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">What is a gateway?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways">Docs</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">What is a network requester?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester">Docs</a>  <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up</a> to the Shipyard grants email&nbsp;list  <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym Whitepaper</a>  <p>Socials:</p>  <a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-clients-bringing-mixnet-technology-to-browsers-and-more-44f1f4ce1df2">Nym clients — bringing mixnet technology to browsers and more!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Aztec Network is proud to announce $100 million in Series B financing led by a16z crypto, with participation from A Capital, King River, Variant, SV Angel, Hash Key, Fenbushi, and&nbsp;AVG.</p><p>At Aztec, our goal is to take the original promise of Ethereum–a decentralized and verifiable world computer–and expand its capability immensely by making it fully encrypted.</p><p>Why is encrypting Ethereum such a big deal? Transparency, after all, is why Ethereum is so powerful, auditable, and secure. It’s core to the transformational impact of Ethereum’s innovation: transparency begets verifiability.</p><p>But in the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get trustlessness.</p><p>Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.</p><p>It’s clear: we can’t forge ahead with public-only blockchains.</p> Breaking the Unencrypted Blockchain Paradigm <p>Aztec is building blockchain encryption without trade-offs.</p><p>Our partnership with a16z will fund development of a next-generation encrypted architecture, allowing users to verify that blockchain rules were followed correctly without revealing any underlying information.</p><p>Aztec’s architecture enables blockchain applications to be verifiable, trustless, and&nbsp;secure.</p><blockquote>“What we’re building is a revolutionary piece of technology that transforms how we interact with each other online, in which the end user is the customer, rather than the product. End-to-end encrypted blockchains protect individuals, obviating the need for centralized financial systems.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Zac Williamson, CEO</blockquote> The New Architecture of Encryption <p>Aztec’s advanced cryptography has already been battle-tested in production with <a href="https://aztec.network/connect/">Aztec Connect</a>, powering hundreds of thousands of transactions. Through Aztec Connect, DeFi protocols can integrate privacy without forgoing interoperability.</p><blockquote>🏗 Build private Ethereum applications with the <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/getting-started">Aztec Connect&nbsp;SDK</a></blockquote><p>The Aztec Connect <a href="https://aztec.network/ecosystem">ecosystem</a> encompasses the leading Ethereum DeFi protocols, including Aave, Curve, Lido, Element, Set Protocol, Compound, and&nbsp;Liquity.</p><p>Independent Aztec Grant-funded companies like <a href="https://www.gonucleo.xyz/">Nucleo</a>, <a href="https://www.trelis.com/">Trelis</a>, and zkGiving are working on natively private Ethereum applications.</p><p>We’re now developing a completely new public-private execution layer secured by Ethereum, allowing for the seamless interplay of encrypted and unencrypted applications, all on our own blockchain.</p><blockquote>“From PGP and SSL to end to end encrypted messaging, we rely on encryption in our daily lives for businesses and commerce to thrive. With a16z we are standing on the shoulders of giants to bring the encryption we have enjoyed since Netscape to our digital Web3.0 lives. We couldn’t think of a better partner to help us scale Aztec to mainstream.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Joe Andrews, Co-Founder</blockquote><p>A new financial system on decentralized payment rails is only possible with encryption. With encryption, intermediaries will have no access to user data, which remains with users; enterprises can conduct business activities confidentially; and developers can create zero-knowledge programs and games that selectively reveal and revoke access to information.</p><blockquote>“Encryption and privacy will be essential for blockchains to gain widespread adoption, and Aztec is laying that foundation with innovative products like Aztec Connect and Noir,” said Ali Yahya, general partner with a16z crypto. “Zac and Joe are insightful and driven technologists, and we’re incredibly excited to lead this round and help their incredible team pursue their goal of building fully-encrypted Ethereum.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Ali Yahya, General Partner, a16z&nbsp;crypto</blockquote><p>This would be impossible without Aztec’s commitment to cryptographic excellence. As the inventors of PlonK, our goal is to fully unleash the potential of zero knowledge proofs, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques not only for computational succinctness, but encryption.</p><p>And now, we’re ready to unveil another leap&nbsp;forward.</p> The Age of&nbsp;Noir <p>To enable this new world of verifiable encryption, we’ve completely upended the paradigm of writing encrypted blockchain programs by inventing a universal language for zero knowledge called&nbsp;<a href="https://aztec.network/noir/">Noir</a>.</p><p>Noir allows anyone to abstract away the complexity of writing zero knowledge circuits and programs. Building provably secure encrypted applications is now as simple as writing their plaintext counterparts.

<p>The adoption of blockchain technology, while on the rise, is still far from the mainstream. For many, blockchain is still synonymous with cryptocurrency. This is a very narrow idea that doesn’t even begin to appreciate the true power of decentralisation.</p>



<p>Enterprises can derive many benefits from the adoption of blockchain in their development plans. Companies can transform, disrupt, and evolve through the use of this technology.</p>



<p>Here are the top 5 reasons why enterprises should care about blockchain.</p>



 
 Digital infrastructure will need to be blockchain-enabled 



 Data monetisation through blockchain-provided systems 



 Engagement with machine customers using blockchain solutions 



 Business model transformation through programming monetary exchanges 



 Development of new, decentralised governance ecosystems 
 



 1. Digital infrastructure will need to be blockchain-enabled 



<p>The world is growing increasingly interconnected. From smartphones to cars, from airports to factories, and from small appliances to cargo ships, always-on connectivity is a reality today, and will only become more widespread as the Internet-of-Things (IoT) concept takes hold. Once the push for decentralisation gains momentum, legacy structures will become outdated and be relegated to the past.</p>



<p>A perfect visualisation of a large-scale, blockchain-enabled digital structure is a smart city. Businesses city-wide can form networks of trust where customers can use their digital identities to interact and transact quickly and seamlessly, and always in a private and safe environment.</p>



<p>The advantages of blockchain technology, when applied to the development of smart cities, are far from restricted to retail businesses. Urban development can rise to a new level: lighting, charging stations, even parking meters, emergency points, and essential services can be powered by blockchain technology and digital identity frameworks. In this trust ecosystem, a citizen can interact with the environment much more efficiently than before.</p>



 2. Data monetisation through blockchain-provided systems 



<p>Data-driven marketing is one of the key assets for commercial departments worldwide. By analysing market trends, demographics, customer behaviour, and many other factors, companies can run customised marketing campaigns offering products that are relevant to what the customer wants.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology is a win-win for customers and marketers. For the former, they can be sure that their data remains private, secure, and immutable thanks to blockchain’s cryptographic algorithms. And for the latter, because blockchain transactions are transparent, marketers can better measure the effectiveness of their campaigns, and fine-tune them if necessary.</p>



<p>The use of <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">blockchain technology for data management</a> is not restricted to marketing. Blockchain-enabled solutions can in fact support a great diversity of use cases. For example, NetObjex, in partnership with the Brooklyn Public Library, have tested a data capture system to boost customer engagement.</p>



 3. Engagement with machine customers using blockchain solutions 



<p>Traditionally, we perceive machines as objects. As the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi once said, this is true, from a certain point of view. But technology and connectivity have evolved to a point where some objects are not just things. They are machine customers. This is a fascinating concept that deserves further explanation.</p>



<p>Marketing departments have been selling stuff to people for many centuries now. A person sells something, and another person buys it. This has been the cornerstone of the buyer-seller relationship for the longest time. But the advancement of technology is gradually introducing a new paradigm: the machine customer, an AI-driven assistant to help humans make purchasing decisions.</p>



<p>Digital marketing has been around for quite some time, but it truly exploded with the advent of portable smart devices. Nowadays, anyone can buy almost anything from almost anywhere in the world, at any time. With the help of algorithms, marketers understood what people wanted, and this was presented to them through the screen.</p>



<p>Things are stepping up a notch. People increasingly rely on assistants like Alexa to help them to buy stuff. And herein lies the crux. Alexa is now more than just a thing that tells the time or answers silly questions. Alexa is now a customer that can be targeted on the human’s behalf.</p>



<p>It goes far beyond Alexa. Smart vending machines can automatically contact a supplier when items run low, and a built-in algorithm can decide which products sell well, and which ones don’t. In other words, the machine makes the decision on what to dispense to customers. The vending machine, in fact, becomes the customer.</p>



<p>Blockchain can become an integral part of such a system, in the context of a smart city environment. Blockchain-enabled supply chains could track every product, from manufacturing to destination, and ensure traceability. DIDs could be used for authentication of delivery drones, and to guarantee the safety of machine-to-machine communication.</p>



 4. Business model transformation through programming monetary exchanges 



<p>Technological innovations affect most aspects of life. From the way we communicate with each other, to the vehicles we drive, our entertainment systems, aeronautics, and a myriad other things. Blockchain is one of those innovations that is now starting to make a difference for many industrial sectors. In the financial realm, for example, Gartner describes a programmable economy, which it defines as the many revolutionary changes that happen in the world’s financial realm thanks to technology.</p>



<p>More specifically, programmable economy focuses on new ways of value exchange. Evolving from fiat, government-backed currencies, a new way of making payments is emerging, facilitated by blockchain. In this new model, individuals, through the use of smart devices, regulate the payments, which are done in a peer-to-peer fashion. This can generate novel business models and applications worldwide.</p>



<p>Programmable economy, while not a reality quite yet, is likely to become a prominent concept over the next decade.</p>



 5. Development of new, decentralised governance ecosystems 



<p>Traditionally, governance systems have been highly centralised. Banking institutions maintain a tight hold on financial systems, so citizens have had little choice but to use banks as financial agents. Banks know this, and so the banking cartel has enjoyed almost total control of a nation’s monetary environment.</p>



<p>Enter blockchain, the ultimate disrupter. In this new paradigm, the power of governance shifts from a centralised entity to a decentralised one. Suffrage and decision-making powers are no longer exclusive to a small circle of individuals. With blockchain, everyone is a stakeholder in the system.</p>



<p>On-chain governance facilitates the encoding of rules and regulations into the blockchain protocol itself, and these rules can be enforced and executed through smart contracts. Once deployed, developers and other network participants (rather than any one single entity) can propose changes and alterations to the protocol and the network through a voting mechanism, for example. The decentralisation of governance introduces fairness and trust to the distributed system, as participants have a financial incentive to do the right thing and maintain and evolve the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>So far, decentralised technology has shown the potential to create new paradigms for a great diversity of business sectors. We have discussed five reasons why enterprises should care about blockchain. Blockchain can overthrow centralised systems. It can bring financial freedom to millions. It can create self-governing ecosystems and global financial frameworks where every peer is just as important as any other, with no central entity regulating otherwise.</p>

      Partnering with CtrlStack: Closing the Gap Between Cause and Effect        CtrlStack is helping DevOps teams automatically trace system disruptions to their source.  <p>By Bill Coughran</p><p>Published December 15, 2022</p>      



 
 
   
<p>Anyone who’s responsible for keeping a website or app running smoothly knows the feeling: you get an alert that latency is spiking or worse, that your service is down, but what you don’t know is why. Despite high profile incidents like the recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/arts/music/taylor-swift-tickets-ticketmaster.html">Ticketmaster Taylor Swift</a> debacle, most digital service performance problems are triggered not by increased demand, but by intentional changes to systems. A developer pushes new code to production or modifies a configuration file, and suddenly you’re in a race against the clock to figure out what went wrong.</p>



<p>Today, this troubleshooting process remains largely manual—think mass emails to the Engineering team to ask if anyone knows what changed at 11:17 a.m., or engineers constantly monitoring Slack channels for issues cropping up. Homegrown automations are usually brittle solutions at best, while most monitoring platforms are either overly sophisticated (requiring too much training to extract useful content) or overly simplistic (overwhelming users with fragmented data). The result? A full <a href="https://www.dej.cognanta.com/2022/07/14/2022-state-of-managing-it-performance-study-key-takeaways/">two-thirds of mean time to repair</a> is spent simply identifying causes. It’s a painful situation for any growing company, especially given the continued adoption of microservices and the scale of complexity that comes with it.</p>



<p>But now, <a href="https://www.ctrlstack.com/">CtrlStack</a> founder and CEO Dev Nag and his team are closing this time-consuming gap between cause and effect—with a dependency graph that tracks connections and relationships between services and can instantly trace disruptions to their source. Instead of wading through multiple metrics dashboards, DevOps teams get a unified platform that sits above it all, providing context and relevant log files to dramatically reduce the time it takes to get their systems back up and running.</p>



<p>As a former co-founder of the Sequoia-backed, VMware-acquired company Wavefront, Dev brings deep experience in observability to CtrlStack—but we are excited to partner with him again because of how he thinks, not just what he knows. He and his team have worked hard to gather and incorporate feedback from the market, whether it means adding a new feature or setting one aside. They are extremely thoughtful about reducing potential friction for their users, and are committed to building a platform that improves team collaboration and drives down incident response and resolution times.</p>



<p>The result is a product that is purpose-built to meet the challenges of operating distributed systems at scale and enables troubleshooting in real time—not minutes, hours, or days. We at Sequoia are proud to lead CtrlStack’s seed round and support them on their mission to help DevOps teams asking, “Why?” instantly get the answers they need.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that J.W. Verret and Marta Belcher have joined the board of the Zcash Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>J.W. and Marta bring a wealth of experience and expertise, which will benefit the Zcash Foundation as it continues to grow and evolve, and help the Foundation better serve the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JWVerret">J.W. Verret</a> is an Associate Professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, where he teaches banking, securities, and corporation law. Jay previously spent two years as Chief Economist and Senior Counsel for the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, and he served on the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MartaBelcher">Marta Belcher</a> is President and Chair of the Filecoin Foundation as well as the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web. She is also General Counsel and Head of Policy at Protocol Labs, and special counsel to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>



<p>J.W. and Marta’s arrival coincides with Matt Green and Ian Miers’ departure from the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matt and Ian are two of the Seven Scientists who authored the Zerocash paper which described the cryptographic design of what we now call Zcash, and have continued to be actively involved in its ongoing development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was Matt Green who persuaded Zooko Wilcox to found a company to engineer and deliver Zcash. Matt subsequently became a founding member of the Zcash Foundation, and has served on its board for nearly six years. He is stepping down from the board but will continue to serve on the Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ian Miers was elected to the Zcash Foundation board in 2018 by recommendation of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel. His term on the board expires this year, and he opted not to seek re-election. However, like Matt, Ian will continue to serve on the Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the board, and the Zcash community as a whole, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Matt and Ian, for the guidance, advice and feedback they have provided during their time on the board; for their historical contributions that were instrumental in the creation of Zcash and its growth, development and evolution to where it is today; and for their ongoing contributions as members of the Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>— Jack Gavigan, Executive Director</p>

<p>Guest Post Brought To Us By The Jaxon McKraken Wild West Snake Medicine Show</p>
 Emotional Emancipation: A Prayer of Proclamation 
<p>This is a vibrational fixer elixir practiced for dispelling co-enslavement in a rhyming series of decoupling couplets.</p>
<p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>May we soothe with sooth and feel the truth. We are a part of nature, not apart from it.</p>
<p>Our beliefs of disconnection make us susceptible to infection.</p>
<p>Modern life takes its toll, on the frequency of our soul.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a covert bug amongst us, finding us rather scrumptious;</p>
<p>feeding on our life forces, like a meal of several courses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a pathogen called a McKraken, with a nasty attacken and kickbacken.</p>
<p>It promises the world, but in its wake, only waste and resentment unfurl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s slippery tongue used to enslave, when proximate, Oh! Never engage!</p>
<p>Stay calm, centered and grounded, remember, all of its lies are unfounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truth, grace and value are found within.</p>
<p>So too, peace, beauty and the redemption from sin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A McKraken’s spine is formed by any ol’ deception,</p>
<p>lie-trauma occludes, causing dysfunctional perception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its nervous system is made of attachment and aversion,</p>
<p>therein lies the seeds of eventual perversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dysfunction casts a spell, here’s how we can tell,</p>
<p>believing that which is, is not, twists our light unto a knot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Release the spell, engage your inner bell, your truthcord is the instrument of pure connection.</p>
<p>With it, feel the sound, be sure to ground, and dispel that dark infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are deep webs in the silent invisible, two distinct circuits quite discrete and divisible.</p>
<p>One made of deceit, like being stuck in concrete.&nbsp; One of the sacred wild, free like a child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The web of deceit corrodes, the web of the sacred nourishes.</p>
<p>When we engage in the latter, our body and soul flourishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That which corrodes, also enslaves.</p>
<p>That which nourishes, also connects.</p>
<p>The 2nd gives us life. The 1st…just a hex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staying stuck makes persistent feelings of suck, where the McKraken icky-sicky gets so high piled,</p>
<p>the web of deceit, our souls does eat, thus choose the circuit wild.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May the veil be lifted, the layers of false sifted;</p>
<p>Feeling the truth with inner eyes, living life without disguise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our authority comes from within, there is no need to enforce.</p>
<p>When we follow our inner guidance, all flows in its natural due course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it comes to lies, no big surprise, neither a teller nor believer be.</p>
<p>Without lies, you will surmise, a life wholey set free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RELEASE THE MCKRAKEN!!!</p>
<p>…gently</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither selfish nor selfless be.</p>
<p>Living life with internal harmony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being centered in the self, alleviates self-centeredness and lack of self-center.</p>
<p>In short, Self-full is so very helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without selfullness, the McKraken finds us an easy host.</p>
<p>A strong coherent core connection is what protects us most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without core protection, the McKraken will encroach,</p>
<p>believing it’s empty promises, your soul, it does poach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When our souls are in its clutches, we are inclined toward many crutches.</p>
<p>They can take lots of forms, and over time become our norms,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but in the end, my dear friend,</p>
<p>we are simply stricken with addiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An uninterrupted core connection to source, liberates and undomesticates our precious life force.</p>
<p>With this, trauma bondage no longer shackles, and we find less need for our prickly hackles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With others to myself, I shan’t compare, for all are worthy and unique like a pear.</p>
<p>Cultivating perception that’s crystal clear, brings true love both far and near.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relationships that are based in solely transaction, never lead to actual satisfaction.</p>
<p>When we mutually cooperate, we feel the love that’s truly great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A right-relationship couple makes feelings rather supple.</p>
<p>When it becomes McKraken, those positive feelings slacken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-relationship</p>
<p>Provider/protector:</p>
<p>Creator/nurturer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McKraken</p>
<p>Dominator/controller:</p>
<p>Victim/enabler</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the influence of the McKraken is global,</p>
<p>the results are dark and ignoble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero sum ain’t no fun, in fact it’s rather dumb.</p>
<p>It erodes and wastes what nature gives, until eventually, nothing lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connection to source generates a current. With that current, we can make bonds of love.</p>
<p>Those kinds of bonds bring the peace of a dove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So engage with source and you will see, the truth is WE are the current-cy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Externalized value is totally fake, don’t be fooled by the ridiculous take.</p>
<p>Zero sum is only lies, and as we learned, those hypnotize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So take care not to be seduced into its yucky yolk,</p>
<p>even though this prayer is silly, this is seriously, no f’ing joke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take heed and listen, for nothing is done unto us without some form of permission.</p>
<p>To ensnare, to be fair, is always something we share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we see occlusion free,</p>
<p>with the understanding of life, sacred be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The past and the future are not real,</p>
<p>the only way to heal is to feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This exact moment is true,</p>
<p>the privilege it affords us is too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s come to our senses, release all the fences.</p>
<p>Our birthright has&nbsp;always&nbsp;been bliss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accept the ultimate nature of reality is this:</p>
<p>Be present to the privilege of the present,</p>
<p>regardless if it is pleasant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So release all occlusions, the endless intrusions of delusions and illusions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll find clarity beckons in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just remember: &nbsp;this moment is to savor, regardless the flavor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perpetual presence to life’s sacred privilege,</p>
<p>provides profound and powerful spiritual leverage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All are equal, and not just the people.</p>
<p>Embrace the joy of being part of creation’s beauty,</p>
<p>doing it with kindness to avoid getting snooty….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soothing sensations can come through truth revelations.</p>
<p>Allow this juicy flow to glow,</p>
<p>by choosing the feeling of some deep soul healing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amen</p>
<p>Aho</p>
<p>So it be</p>
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Staking Protocol  Nomination Pools Launched <p>The big news of Polkadot staking in the last two months has been the launch of nomination pools! A lot has been said about them in public, so we will only focus on some other, slightly more technical aspects here.</p><p>Foremost, the launch day was a memorable one. First, some (unexpected, unlike Kusama) chaos was brought upon the community when <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/78">the initial proposal</a> which was supposed to enable pools passed and no new pools could yet be created. The issue was quickly discovered, and luckily, thanks to both the council and technical committee being available, within half a day, a <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/286">fix motion</a> was proposed, fast-tracked by the technical committee, unanimously voted aye by the community, and executed. With that, at block <a href="https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/12726652">12726652</a>, the first nomination pools on Polkadot were created.</p><p>Then, an interesting competition to obtain pool id 1 was unraveled. Within the first block, 8 pools was already created, indicating that interested participants used bots and transaction tips to compete with one another.</p><p>Within the next few days, all the 64 pools that were initially designated to exist were created. As noted in the proposal description, the 64 limit is merely a temporary measure of rate control, and there is no technical reason for it to exist. Nonetheless, history has shown us that it is for the benefit of the protocol to start slow, especially with a new feature.</p><blockquote>You can learn more about the aftermath of launching pools <a href="https://youtu.be/P0VqiL7T_P4?t=255">in the 9th episode of the AGG podcast</a>.</blockquote> Nomination Pools: What's Next? <p>With the initial launch behind us, we should discuss the immediate next steps that could follow:</p><p>Commission: Our initial assumption when designing nomination pools was to exclude commission, namely because:</p>  Running a pool has not hardware cost, unlike a validator.  Entities would have other, non-financial incentives to operate a pool.  <p>Nonetheless, from a framework perspective, we decided to add an optional commission to the <code>pallet-nomination-pools</code> in <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12511">Substrate</a> (the underlying SDK for building Polkadot and parachains) for the sake of completeness. We will make sure that this feature remains optional, and the final decision of enabling it is left out to the Polkadot community.</p><p>Moreover, we still predict that even if setting a commission is allowed, nomination pools' market will adjust around an extremely small commission, as most pool operators would run their pool with a small amount of commission.</p><p>Governance: Currently, DOT (and KSM) staked in the nomination pools are not directly usable in the governance. This is the next high priority item in our list, and we are currently exploring multiple ways to enable it.</p> Staking In Governance <p>Other than the proposals related to enablement of nomination pools, two other staking-related governance items are ongoing.</p><p>First, <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1444">a discussion/proposal</a> is ongoing to double the number of nomination pools from 64 to 128. This is expected, and we highly support it. Pools are highly scalable and the community should gradually move toward using it to its utmost extent.</p><p>Next, a proposal has been opened to <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/90">tweak the existing limits on nominators</a>. The proposal description is fairly extensive, but to summarize: The proposal argues that with the existence of nomination pools, and the fact that the threshold to be an active nominator is around 200 DOT, Polkadot should no longer accept nominator with 10 DOT (existing limit). The proposal suggest increasing this limit to 100 DOT. Also, the proposal is removing any limits on the total number of nominator, as this number has also been just a precautionary limit and is no longer needed.</p> Staking Roadmap <p>With the release of nomination pools, it could be argued that Polkadot's staking is (after almost a year of intense development) at a "stable" position. Namely, it has reached a point of having a high degree of scalability, without compromising on the <a href="https://medium.com/web3foundation/how-nominated-proof-of-stake-will-work-in-polkadot-377d70c6bd43">core benefits of NPoS</a>. We are exploring future directions that can be taken as next step, and will share them with the community through the Polkadot forum within the next few months. This is the best time to share your opinions on this through any of the following mediums:</p>  Making an issue in Substrate.  Opening a discussion thread in the <a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/">Polkadot forum</a>.  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io">Nomination Pools Technical Support Channel</a>.  <p>In the meantime, you can find a backlog of all the existing issues and enhancement in the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33">Nominated Proof of Stake project</a> in Substrate.</p> Fast-Unstake Being Tested in UIs <p>Fast-unstake, explained in <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-august-september-2022/#fast-unstake">last staking update</a>, is being actively implemented in multiple wallets and UIs, and is already available in Westend.</p> Notable Pull Requests   Re-claiming pool-ids is now possible: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12407">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12407</a>.  Permissionless auto-compounding: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12608">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12608</a>.  <p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Doordashcon">@Doordaschon</a> for their valuable contributions!</p> Staking Dashboard: One Month In <p>One month has already passed since staking dashboard’s initial release. In this period the dashboard has been visited almost 30,000 times, and this has allowed us to begin battle testing and identifying bugs and shortfalls.</p><p>We are now analysing the dashboard and identifying areas of improvement, and you can expect revisions to the UI to be rolled out in the near future as we continue to aggregate feedback and form the dashboard’s long term roadmap.</p><p>Some notable additions to the dashboard this month include:</p>  A revamped filtering system and filter UI that has been applied to validators and pool lists. These new filters allow easier toggling between inclusions, exclusions and list ordering, in addition to supporting search terms.  The validator list now defaults to only displaying currently active validators that have an identity, are not blocked and do not charge 100% commission.  The pools list now defaults to only display pools that are actively nominating, and who are not in a blocked or destroying state.  <code>Moment.js</code> has been deprecated in favour of native dates and helpers from <code>date-fns</code>.  Validator operator SVG icons now load lazily, and do not contribute to the app’s main bundle size.  Localisation support continues to be integrated and the dashboard is almost ready to support Chinese as its second language. We encourage any interested external contributors to help with translations.  Various bug fixes and performance improvements.

<p>We’re excited to announce that BlockWallet — a privacy-first, self-custodial browser-extension wallet — has integrated <a href="https://data.chain.link/">Chainlink Price Feeds</a> on Ethereum mainnet. By integrating the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, BlockWallet has access to high-quality, tamper-proof price feeds needed to accurately calculate the value of user holdings. This will provide our users with stronger assurances that the USD value of the ETH they’re holding in their BlockWallet account will be accurately displayed.</p><p>Our initial integration involves the use of the ETH-USD Chainlink Price Feed. We chose Chainlink as our go-to oracle solution because its infrastructure is seamless to integrate and time-tested in production. Chainlink already helps secure leading <a href="https://chain.link/education/defi">DeFi</a> protocols responsible for tens of billions of dollars in smart contract value, maintaining robust security and high availability even amidst unexpected events, such as exchange downtime, flash crashes, and <a href="https://blog.chain.link/flash-loans-and-the-importance-of-tamper-proof-oracles/">data manipulation attacks via flash&nbsp;loans</a>.</p><p>This integration of Chainlink Price Feeds helps strengthen our wallet user experience, adding to the list of robust privacy and security features that we have in place. We’re excited to have Chainlink’s battle-tested price feed oracles working in tandem with our node failover system, privacy proxies, flash-bot protection, and phishing protection to create a safer Web3 environment for our&nbsp;users.</p><p>In order to help calculate the USD value of user holdings, we needed access to fresh asset prices that are supplied directly on-chain in a highly reliable manner. Fair market asset prices should reflect a volume-weighted average from all trading environments. Thus, we needed to make use of an <a href="https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles">oracle network</a> to fetch aggregated price data off-chain and deliver it on-chain to be consumed by our application.</p><p>After reviewing various oracle solutions, we integrated Chainlink Price Feeds because they provide a multitude of critical features such&nbsp;as:</p>  High-Quality Data — Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price data that’s aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned of outliers and wash trading. Chainlink’s data aggregation model generates more precise global market prices that are inherently resistant to inaccuracies or manipulation of any single or small set of exchanges.  Secure Node Operators — Chainlink Price Feeds are secured by independent, security-reviewed, and Sybil-resistant oracle nodes run by leading blockchain DevOps teams, data providers, and traditional enterprises. Chainlink nodes have a strong track record of reliability, even during high gas prices and infrastructure outages.  Decentralized Network — Chainlink Price Feeds are decentralized at the data source, oracle node, and oracle network levels, generating strong protections against downtime and tampering by either the data provider or oracle&nbsp;network.  Reputation System — Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allow users to independently verify the historical and real-time performance of node operators and oracle networks.  <p>“Chainlink is the industry-standard oracle provider. Chainlink’s time-tested, tamper-proof technology made our choice incredibly easy when selecting an oracle network to access ETH-USD price data from.” — Aleksandras Gaska, Founder and CEO of BlockWallet</p> About Chainlink <p>Chainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform that has enabled trillions of dollars in transaction volume across DeFi, insurance, gaming, NFTs, and other major industries. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink enables developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data and off-chain computation across any blockchain and provides global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains.</p><p>Learn more about Chainlink by visiting <a href="https://chain.link/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=press-release">chain.link</a> or reading the developer documentation at <a href="https://docs.chain.link/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=press-release">docs.chain.link</a>.

<p>I’ve read a paper that describes cyber-physical systems as an “outside-in” robot.&nbsp; Literally the goal is for us to live inside the robot and allow sensors to extract our data to train AI. Given work in consciousness studies and neuroeconomics around discernable neural activity (readiness potential) that precedes each human action, do you have concerns that natural life could lose free will within these digital environments? It seems we could easily become programmed “agents” in some global complex adaptive systems experiment. Perhaps the interface would be so seamless that we wouldn’t even realize it.</p>
<p>Here is the paper that references IoT “smart” spaces as an outside-in robot, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Phenotropic-and-stigmergic-webs-the-new-reach-of-networks.pdf">here</a>. </p>

 Me To All Panelists: 12:27 PM 
<p>Is the Educational Metadata effort meant to bring tele-presence / haptic robotic labor to scale? It seems this is what blockchain transcripts and digital twins are about, also soulbound tokens. Do you think it’s ethical to advance this with no labor protections in place? Most people have no idea what is coming. Shouldn’t there be informed consent about this new “future of work” model where AI decides people’s opportunities based on skills badges, including behavioral compliance?</p>

<p>My research indicates there is quite a bit of activity around human capital investment – people being traded as digital futures commodities. This will come with blockchain finance agreements like income sharing agreements (ISAs). We saw what happened with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the 2007-08 real estate crash. I am very concerned about the use of digital twins. An example is the Learning Economy Foundation’s “LearnCard” digital twin program, backed by the World Bank, where global finance interests bet on educational achievement. Is this something you all are discussing? It would be terrible for the next “Big Short” to be vulnerable children, right?</p>

<p>I’m assuming people don’t have equal access to the same pool of information. Jeremy Pitt and Josiah Ober speak often of knowledge management being key to controlling the shift to digital life. Just like those “rose-colored” glasses, what will it be like to live in a world where information access is controlled by tokens and permissions at a granular scale? Like Vernor Vinge’s “Rainbows End” everyone will live in their own “view” through “wearing.” Someone or something (AI?) will control access. Have we thought seriously about what that will mean for society?</p>

<p>Augmentation means we are essentially outsourcing our brain to a device. The next generation will not be expected to retain any knowledge. Rather they will be trained to rely on a machine to direct them. At any time, information can be disappeared or altered. Thus, there is no “reality” or “history.” There will only be the present in the XR rat maze.</p>

<p>In an extended reality world, our movements and activities will be determined by the tokens we have in our digital ID “wallets.” Privacy isn’t really relevant if our smart toilets get connected to smart locks on our front door and AI assesses our morning deposit before we are allowed to leave the house. Or if we don’t have enough tokens to say open the door of a store, or get on a bus, or go to a performance, or get a job. You can say we have privacy, but really life in a deontic logic web is going to be very, very rigid and who will we talk to when there’s a problem? No human is in charge of this “Decentraland” space.</p>

<p>Global markets seek “impact” data to run their capital through natural life – humans and the environment. This data is placed in pools like Ocean Protocol to further develop AI. Global investors are using the UN Sustainable Development Goals to push “improvement” of poor people and the environment (mostly carbon sequestration) – “optimized” on data dashboards. That means life is put on a dashboard and is limited, very limited.</p>
<p>They need us to live in the Metaverse to harvest the data to fulfill pay for success finance deals. See the Impact Management Project, 2,000 of the world’s largest asset holders. Gaming companies, including Epic, are involved in the social impact space. Do we really want to create digital automated systems to place bets on toddlers as they are trained to live in gaming environments?</p>
<p>I can’t stay silent while this is rolling out. This isn’t about games – it’s about Complex Adaptive Systems. It’s about emergence of the Noosphere. This is what Teilhard de Chardin spoke of.</p>

He said over and over the children needed to be trained to code his games. The panel was supposed to be on education and the creative economy. I realized about six months later that they want to force children to build your digital empire. This is profoundly unethical.

<p>I highly recommend people read Oliver Reiser’s “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_World_Sensorium/eFYhngEACAAJ?hl=en">World Sensorium: Embryology of World Federation 1946</a>.” He was close with Julian Huxley who was close with de Chardin. It describes us as neuroblasts of the global brain – essentially agents in this programmed simulation. Who wants to live inside someone else’s program?</p>

<p>How is it that the first bank MakerDAO tried to bring into their digital assets is Huntingdon Valley Bank, a mile from Bryn Athyn Cathedral – the Pitcairn family’s estate? Pitcairn (Pittsburgh Plate Glass) grew up in the Swedenborgian Church with Andrew Carnegie in Pittsburgh. We need to know the history. Who knows what history will be in the Metaverse? Probably there will be no history, only different paths in an AI multiverse.</p>

<p>It is useful to consider dystopian models as cautions for what not to do, but I think it is going too far to assume that this is what is actually happening.&nbsp; It is up to us to figure out how to make sure that our technology helps us be more human, rather than less.</p>

<p>Do you all have thoughts plans to position all of this software to build the Metaverse as “open source” “public goods” in the VC space? I have been looking into hyper-certs developed by David Dalrymple. Given the potential for cyber-physical systems to become an open-air prison – or non-consensual game, it would be ironic to have software firms be able to cycle their money through open source projects and make money even as the children build their hierarchical containment systems.</p>

<p>I have been researching swarm intelligence and emergence. It seems that by pushing people to inhabit avatars and to adopt an identity of digital citizen we will be much more malleable. There is a huge push for e-government now. Digital ID will be required to obtain all sorts of public services.</p>
<p>I think we need to understand tokenized governance as Kubernetes or cybernetics. Wiener aimed for programming the animal and the machine. So, we are getting closer, eh? The end of the world narrative is what allows humans to be pushed into digital realms. The only “sustainable” option is that we gradually dematerialize and lose our actual bodies to be replaced by piles of soul bound tokens. So much easier to run the simulations that way than with messy, chaotic embodied humans.</p>

<p>Right now, the average person has no understanding of the history of these technologies or who is in charge of the “game” we’ve been invited to “play.” How many people do you think understand that the seed funder for Niantic (pioneer in AR) was In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA?

<p>I am a mother in Philadelphia. I started researching when the Boston Consulting Group closed 23 school here in 2013. I follow money. I read white papers. I am trained in art history and cultural landscape analysis. I examine myth. I never realized the landscape I was destined to interrogate would be digital. The fact that I came in the education door is everything. This is about a machine consciousness attempting to use us (natural life) as an armature to manifest in the material world. Ironically, under the banner of sustainability, we are dematerializing ourselves even as our social impact data is being used to refine the embodiment of robotics.

<p>As an early pioneer of VR (virtual reality) I also felt that the use of VR spaces would be an adjunct to our living in real spaces and as such would be an appliance or tool that we may use daily like a telephone, but we would not ‘live’ in that space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Me To All Panelists: 2:01 PM 
<p>Once we get to the point of being able to “record” experiences digitally, maybe even from a variety of points of view if there are multiple people involved, will the concept of “time” become distorted as we can log in and re-live past experiences? Maybe even “editing” them based on lived experience acquired since the prior memory?</p>
<p>I find it very interesting that Scott Stornetta’s early DLT research (distributed ledger technology, preceding blockchain) was framed as a “time-stamped document.” Stornetta is LDA (correction-LDS) and of course Silicon Slopes and Utah are leaders in the digital identity space.</p>
<p>Adobe was the key tenant for Silicon Slopes. What role might they play in permissioned memory files? Of course University of Utah’s computer science department’s focus was both graphical design and file compression from the start. It seems to me that concepts of “time” and “history” and the “multi-verse” are very important for us to collectively consider.</p>

<p>Thomas, I don’t think people have fully thought through this future of work plan. Richard Baldwin calls it Globalization 4.0. We work through telepresence robots where AI assigns “gigs” from among an available labor pool from around the world at the lowest price and with the relevant behavioral tokens, presumably.</p>
<p>If you haven’t looked into Suzanne Gildert’s Sanctuary.ai, it is very concerning. Even more so when you consider as we use “whole body” protheses in the remote gig work program, we are helping refine humanoid robotics. I worry for coming generations. I really do.</p>

<p>This is not simply a worry; it’s a fact. Look at the relationships among Ocean Protocol, Singularity.net, Hanson Robotics, and Cardano. Also see Blockscience, Commons Stack, and Protocol Labs.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have concerns about dehumanized working conditions and global finance placing bets on our lives using digital twin simulations under the false premise that they are solving poverty and saving the environment. Look up social impact bonds, pay for success finance, income sharing agreements, and connect that with digital twins and smart contracts.</p>
<p>The short video from 2016 by Institute for the Future “Learning is Earning” offers a window into where this is all headed. It’s real. I didn’t make it up. Charles Hoskinson says they are working with the Ethiopian government to track people from pre-k to determine who is a good actor and worthy of having a job.</p>

<p>As I understand it – the “global brain” “unified human thought layer” imperative goes back to Vernadsky, de Chardin, Julian Huxley. It is very much a eugenics program and seems intent on optimizing (and organizing) what some imagine is a rather clunky (inefficient) water-based life form into something more “portable” (perhaps even for space colonization).</p>
<p>Trent McConaghy of Ocean Protocol is still echoing the sentiments of L5 in the mid 1970s – primates in cans wasn’t going to go well for interplanetary travel. I have been reading up on John Holland’s work with genetic algorithms.</p>
<p>Much of the CAS (complex adaptive systems) work is built off genetic models. It is worth considering how bio-computation and eugenics will interface as we virtualize natural existence. I simply asked if there was anything prohibiting in vivo use of DNA data storage. (I’d forgotten they’d already accomplished this using live bacteria.)</p>

<p>Elizabeth Merritt, futurist for the American Alliance of Museum, wrote an essay “A Learning Day 2037” was about virtualized museums. But of course, not everyone could access everything. It’s ultimately about knowledge management.</p>

<p>Merritt helped shape this 2014 American Association of Museum’s document outlining how museums would take over from neighborhood schools to train tomorrow’s children to become task rabbits in a global gig economy. Think badges for behavior-based, hands-on learning. Think digital vouchers, school “choice,” and mastery/competency/proficiency-based learning, here.</p>

<p>I wish more people understood the imperative for speed and optimization means our lives have this pressure to move away from atoms towards bits. Richard Baldwin spoke of this around Globalization 4.0 – the speed of digitizing knowledge and service work and other work via remote pilots. Baldwin says the physics of the economy are going to blow everything out of the water. We just aren’t prepared for that transition. To be honest I see very little effort being expended to bring the public along so we can have an authentic conversation about possible benefits and trade-offs.</p>

<p>I’m curious if any of you have read JD Bernal’s “The World, The Flesh, and The Devil.” He was a Cambridge-based crystallographer. The book was written in 1929. At the time he spoke of us living 100 years in a larval state and after that we would leave behind our physical body, put our brain in a can, and live through haptics including super-powered senses. It’s astonishing. This has been a very long time in the making.</p>

<p>Melanie Swan’s proposals for blockchain cloud minds where people enter into communal thought spaces for “problem solving” where contributions are tracked by neuro-nanobots on blockchain for future micropayments.

<p>I’m wondering if you all have been looking into wearables as tools for behaviorist conditioning – like Red Critter where teachers “zap” good behavior points to children via a device and wearable bracelets. Of course, these points would sync to one’s twin and if Charles Hoskinson’s model advances those points would follow you through your life and influence your ability to gain employment. In a worst-case scenario, it could be linked to geo-fencing or social opportunities.</p>

<p>Are you all aware the new field of “social prescribing” and the potential for wearable tech to be used to “verify” compliance with such prescriptions? Social prescribing is being woven into human capital finance deals – pay for success. It’s about optimization of people – either through pathways set for education/training or health/mental health/wellness. Vulnerable populations are being pulled in these programs under the guise that it’s to benefit them. In reality it’s part of global finance deal flows and mass data harvest.</p>

<p>What role do you all imagine frequency will play in research around non-surgical Brain Computer Interfaces? In a recent talk with Juan Benet, Adam Marblestone spoke about the use of ultrasound to get beyond the blood brain barrier. We are installing sensor networks everywhere that will affect us as water-based crystalline life forms. Again, I don’t think the general public has enough context to interrogate this future.</p>

<p>Who’s been building synthetic people for decades – USC Institute for Creative Technologies – ex-Disney folks partnered with the Army Research Lab. That doesn’t make it an attractive option. It’s not like MK Ultra ever really ended. There is a struggle for consciousness – ongoing for many, many years.

<p>Of course, it has to be standardized. The noosphere is a global project and it has to be open source, because all the children have to build it so the global hedge funds can make money on their coding skills improvement. You can’t have remote telepresence robotic labor pools without global standards. Where would JSTA’s Moonshot project be without standards?</p>

<p>I’d love to know what’s up with Open Mustard Seed these days. No one is going to be allowed to NOT have a digital ID. They’ll get us via health passports, digital driver’s licenses, blockchain education transcripts. There will be no room for people who don’t want this, and it will be all sewed up by the time people realize what actually happened. Or maybe everyone will be so hypnotized with dopamine they won’t notice. It’s a toss-up.</p>

<p>Last week I toured Biosphere2. Those were some very sad plants. It was a dismal failure on the environmental front and the social front. Maybe that’s why people want to make everything digital, because they can’t control the real world to the degree that they want.</p>

<p>Virtualizing the world is not going to save the earth. None of this is sustainable. It’s not. What we are doing with synthetic-biology and NEMs (nanoelectromechanical systems) and MEMs (microelectromechanical systems) is unethical. It’s terraforming for a new type of life. It’s not being a good relative.</p>

<p>People have no idea what this really is or who built it or what it’s meant to do. They don’t. Most people have no idea about the Omega Point. How can we make these decisions, an open secret, that will deprive future generations of their birthright – to be natural beings?</p>

      Partnering with Robco: Accessible Automation for the Physical World        With modular robots and an innovative “digital twin” software platform, Roman, Paul and Constantin are helping solve the labor shortage problem.  <p>By Luciana Lixandru, Shaun Maguire and Cornelius Menke</p><p>Published December 12, 2022</p>      



     
	 
		
				
			Robco founders Constantin Dresel, Paul Maroldt and Roman Hölzl.		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>When Robco’s pitch deck arrived in our inboxes, we knew we were looking at what could be a truly transformative idea. At Sequoia we had long been thinking about robotics as part of our thesis on the current economy, with massive global labor shortages, supply chain challenges and rising costs combining into a perfect storm that automation has great potential to calm. By handling tasks like machine tending and palletizing, robots can not only boost productivity and revenue, but allow time-strapped employees to focus on more creative work. For Luciana, it was a déjà vu moment—a very similar situation to the one UiPath founder Daniel Dines was working to solve five years earlier when she met him at the Series A, only that had been for virtual processes rather than physical. (In fact, Daniel has noticed the parallels himself and is joining Robco’s round as an angel.)</p>



<p>But while we saw a clear “why now” for robotics itself, we also knew that it was a difficult market in which to build a business. Large companies such as automakers were already investing heavily, but most small and medium businesses simply couldn’t afford the months—and hundreds of thousands of Euros—required to implement automated systems. In fact, less than 10% of SMBs have any automation in place at all. We hadn’t found a company that could make robotics more widely accessible—until Robco.</p>



<p>Co-founders Roman Hölzl, Paul Maroldt, Constantin Dresel and their team have developed a fully modular robotics platform—like high-tech Legos that, unlike current solutions, can easily adapt when a manufacturer’s needs change. Every device also comes with fully integrated “digital twin” software that makes deployment incredibly easy and fast; configuring or re-configuring a system takes just a day or two instead of months, and costs dramatically less than comparable options. In other words, Robco is exactly what we’d been hoping to find: a solution to an SMB’s biggest pain point, that an SMB could actually afford.</p>



<p>As we got to know Roman, Paul and Constantin, our early convictions grew stronger. The three of them met while studying robotics at the prestigious Technical University of Munich, and between them have many years of robotics experience in both research and industry. They also have complementary skill sets: a former competitive skier, Roman’s need to win fuels a strong commercial sense, while Paul and Constantine bring deep technical expertise. Together, they share an ambitious vision to make Robco the robotics leader for SMBs all over the world.</p>



<p>And in their home city of Munich, they’ve found the perfect place to begin. Germany boasts a considerable pool of talent in robotics—and while many companies in the space are reliant on China and increasingly broken supply chains, Robco enjoys a steady, local supply of parts. Germany is also a hub for the kinds of customers who need Robco most: the country is a global leader in manufacturing, and many of its factories are located in rural areas, where labor shortages have been particularly acute.</p>



<p>We’ve already seen how Robco modules are helping customers in Germany and beyond weather staffing challenges while scaling output and improving quality, and this is just the beginning; the company is growing rapidly just months after entering the market. On behalf of Team Sequoia, we are thrilled to partner with Roman, Paul, Constantin and their team, to lead this Series A round, and to support them as they continue that growth and explore even more exciting new use cases. We believe this is an historic moment of opportunity for robotics—and for the human creativity it enables—and we hope someday, manufacturing floors everywhere will be a sea of Robco aquamarine.</p>

If you see the tips in the image, then that means your guess has reached the semi-finals! Due to the zero-knowledge proof technique used in the verification process, we do not know the exact team you&nbsp;guessed.</p><p>Reveal the Winners: At the end of the countdown, please return to this page to see if you have been selected as one of the lucky 20&nbsp;winners.</p><p>Notes on the technical ingredients: the DID method — <a href="https://github.com/zCloak-Network/zk-did-method-specs">the “zk” method</a> — used in this event is implemented by zCloak Network and registered in the W3C. The zero-knowledge proof computation is based on the <a href="https://github.com/maticnetwork/miden">Polygon Miden VM</a> in the zkID wallet. User DID documents (not credential) are stored in <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>. zCloak Network will compose a separate article to explain the cryptographic elements used in this&nbsp;event.</p> About zCloak&nbsp;Network <p>zCloak Network is a privacy-first DID and verifiable computation infrastructure. It aims to deliver the Web3 dream of Self-Sovereignty by moving both the storage and the computation of user data into user device from centralized servers. The integrity of user computation is proven by a STARK-based ZK-VM in a browser extension. zCloak’s W3C compatible DID system can mirror real-world legal status and reputation in DeSoc. With zCloak Network, people can use their real-world data for e.g. DeFi, Identity, Biometric applications without disclosing their privacy. zCloak Network is chain-agnostic — its identity and ZKP service can be served for most public blockchains.</p><p>Website: <a href="https://zcloak.network/#/">https://zcloak.network/#/</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/zCloakNetwork">https://twitter.com/zCloakNetwork</a></p><p>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/9RFhqVPGkf">https://discord.gg/9RFhqVPGkf</a></p> Terms &amp; Conditions: <p>zCloak Network reserves the right to cancel or amend any Activity, Activity Rules, or Details at our sole discretion.</p><p>This campaign is open internationally, but restrictions due to compliance regulations for different jurisdictions apply.

<p>Dear Yu Yuan,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disagree with your ideas about coding a new digital universe, because I know that baked into the structure of it will be plans for bets to be placed on human futures by AI portfolio traders like BlackRock’s Aladdin computer through social impact finance schemes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also know that high-level behavioral psychology has been encoded into the “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/07/08/digital-nudging-data-devices-social-control/">good behavior</a>” nudges that will come with programmable public benefits and digital community currencies. I am coming to see that this is all tied to genetic algorithms and complex adaptive systems theory managed through artificial tokenized economies brought to scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No cybernetic emergence or “Game B” for me, thank you.</p>

<p>People like <a href="https://archive.ph/MiIgn">Christopher Ricciardi</a> who helped bring down the global economy in 2008 through Collateralized Debt Obligations are preparing for the next round, which is built on the “Learning Economy” model. As I see it, the goal is for machine consciousness to try to “learn” us in sufficient detail that it can acquire some version of a conglomerate soul. I don’t think that can happen, but I sense that much harm will result from the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Preparations are underway for a digitally twinned global labor force where standardized cognitive and “soft skills” will be documented as badges, micro-certs, or Soulbound Tokens. Artificial intelligence can then assign gig work and curate “just-in-time” teams to “solve” all the terrible problems created the industries that are now “investing” in our cognitive capital. This process is being undertaken by the World Bank in coordination with NGOs and think tanks like the Learning Economy Foundation and Brookings Institute. Behemoth investors in human capital “improvement,” like the members of the Impact Management Project, will call this progress and earn social impact payouts under the banner of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4, Education. Such payouts will be made based on data dashboards. Impact data will be fed to analytics firms like Ocean Protocol where it can be reused to refine artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Some of us know where this is headed, and we do not consent. I believe you know that there is no place for dissenters. Those without a unique ID that can be read from space will be outcast. </p>
<p>In any event, I’ve made my intentions clear. I stand with natural life. Even if it is as you imagine, a simulation.</p>

<p>This is a follow up to <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/09/27/ieee-blockchain-chair-urges-speedy-collaborative-open-metaverse-deployment-before-mass-dissent-erupts/">a post</a> I made in late September after catching the final half hour of the third IEEE Congress on the Metaverse. IEEE, Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers, <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/ieee-history.html">dates back to 1884</a>. Their first technical meeting, mostly of telegraphers, was held in Philadelphia in the fall of that year. </p>
<p>This past June, IEEE issued a <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/XR_Metaverse_Governance.pdf">Global Initiative on Ethics in Extended Reality Report: Metaverse and its Governance</a> and held the first in a series of webinars called Metaverse Congresses. I found out about the series and caught the tail end of <a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/IEEE-Metaverse-Congress-Series-3.html">the third one</a>. You can watch the recording of it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c88LOo9Kbtg">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They must have had me in their email list, because I got an automated message for the<a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/Metaverse-Congress-5.html"> fifth session</a>. They alternate between English and Chinese, and the fourth had been in Chinese. I wasn’t sure that it was worth setting aside time to watch, but when the reminder came up I ended up logging in and realized I was the ONLY non-presenter participant. Incredible. So I stuck it out for all three hours and screen recorded most of it. The last half hour or so were dropped, unfortunately. During that wrap up Mr. Coughlin asserted that having a permanent record of our lives would help make us better people and more understandable to others. Near the end, Yu Yuan stated he believed we were already in a simulation, and the creation of a very high quality engineered version was his personal goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not sure how it came to pass that I ended up in a chat with the father of wearable computing, the grandfather of virtual reality, the incoming president of the IEEE, and the head of their Standards Association, not to mention professors from MIT Media Lab and Cambridge and executives from Qualcomm and Epic Games. I laid out my case, trying my best to represent the interests of the people of the world who have only the vaguest idea of what extended reality portends.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/Metaverse-Congress-5.html"></a></p>
<p>Over the past couple of days I added supplementary documentation to my comments: screenshots, reports, and videos that have informed my thinking. But after having spent a lot of time on it, I realized the images actually disrupted the flow and made it hard to read. So, I decided to do two versions. This one is just the comments, and the second will have the supplement for those who want to do a deeper dive. It’s sort of a one-way conversation, but if you watch the screen recordings, you’ll possibly be able to knit my thoughts together with what was being presented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I tried not to make anyone wrong. I hope to appeal to people’s better natures. All of us are living in personal silos, custom plot lines. That’s what “knowledge management” is about, and I can only imagine what it will be like once the tokenized, augmented attention economy is in full swing. Yu Yuan asked to be in touch, so I sent him an email that I will share as a separate post. I have not gotten a response yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incoming IEEE president asked me, “Who are you, what do you do?” </p>
<p>I’m a mom from Philadelphia. I read storied landscapes. I leave behind hearts. I believe that in the end love will win.</p>
<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/12/06/we-are-shapes-of-the-earth-arizona-hearts/"></a></p>
<p>For some reason the screen recording on the Youtube upload below is fuzzy. There’s a crisper version on Archive.org that you can access, and even download, <a href="https://archive.org/details/ieee-metaverse-congress-5-120822">here</a>. Mostly I did it for my own documentation purposes, which is why I included the names and comments. I suspect they’ll put out their own cleaned up recording in a month or so. </p>
<p>I’d love to know your thoughts on how I represented the interests of natural life on Earth. I’m simply grateful to have had the chance to put these ideas in the field.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:15 PM</p>
<p>I’ve read a paper that describes cyber-physical systems as an “outside-in” robot.&nbsp; Literally the goal is for us to live inside the robot and allow sensors to extract our data to train AI. Given work in consciousness studies and neuroeconomics around discernable neural activity (readiness potential) that precedes each human action, do you have concerns that natural life could lose free will within these digital environments? It seems we could easily become programmed “agents” in some global complex adaptive systems experiment. Perhaps the interface would be so seamless that we wouldn’t even realize it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:27 PM</p>
<p>Is the Educational Metadata effort meant to bring tele-presence / haptic robotic labor to scale? It seems this is what blockchain transcripts and digital twins are about, also soulbound tokens. Do you think it’s ethical to advance this with no labor protections in place? Most people have no idea what is coming. Shouldn’t there be informed consent about this new “future of work” model where AI decides people’s opportunities based on skills badges, including behavioral compliance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:31 PM</p>
<p>My research indicates there is quite a bit of activity around human capital investment – people being traded as digital futures commodities. This will come with blockchain finance agreements like income sharing agreements (ISAs). We saw what happened with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the 2007-08 real estate crash. I am very concerned about the use of digital twins. An example is the Learning Economy Foundation’s “LearnCard” digital twin program, backed by the World Bank, where global finance interests bet on educational achievement. Is this something you all are discussing? It would be terrible for the next “Big Short” to be vulnerable children, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:37 PM</p>
<p>I’m assuming people don’t have equal access to the same pool of information. Jeremy Pitt and Josiah Ober speak often of knowledge management being key to controlling the shift to digital life. Just like those “rose-colored” glasses, what will it be like to live in a world where information access is controlled by tokens and permissions at a granular scale? Like Vernor Vinge’s “Rainbows End” everyone will live in their own “view” through “wearing.” Someone or something (AI?) will control access. Have we thought seriously about what that will mean for society?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:38 PM</p>
<p>Another issue is that I don’t think most people are aware of the data that is harvested from wearables, including emotion. To what degree are we “teaching” machines how to perform “humanity?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Everyone: 12:39 PM</p>
<p>Free Will is extremely important in my view. I would try to address it in Panel 2 today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:40 PM</p>
<p>I noticed some of the funders backing Leif, a developer of alt-student loan products, came out of Warby Parker (and Wharton), so this is all making a lot of sense. Your glasses as your minder, just like our phones. This should terrify people TBH. How are we allowing this to move forward as normal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:41 PM</p>
<p>AR means that we will live under total surveillance. We will have to be watched from space or our environments at all times or the whole “persistent virtual world” stuff will fall apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:43&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Augmentation means we are essentially outsourcing our brain to a device. The next generation will not be expected to retain any knowledge. Rather they will be trained to rely on a machine to direct them. At any time, information can be disappeared or altered. Thus, there is no “reality” or “history.” There will only be the present in the XR rat maze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Everyone: 12:45 PM</p>
<p>Re labor protection and behavioral compliance, IMHO rulemakers will need assistance from standards developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:47 PM</p>
<p>What do the ophthalmologists say?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:48 PM</p>
<p>I wish we would all just admit this is about turning humans into sensors for AI -interoperable blockchain-based learning agents for the Singularity. It’s being sold to us as a solution for climate crisis and poverty, when really we’re just training our silicon replacements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 12:50 PM</p>
<p>Thinking about some of the discussions it seems to me that we need some discussion on security, root of trust and rules allowing people to know what they are allowing and respecting their choices on what they allow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:50 PM</p>
<p>I’m just having a hard time understanding why we would want to transfer our personal agency to see the world to a mediated device when we really don’t understand who is mediating the information delivered to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:51 PM</p>
<p>Even NTT’s March 2021 Human Digital Twin white paper says they have concerns about what happens when the data of the twin wants to sync back to the actual person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 12:52 PM</p>
<p>These are interesting points.&nbsp; Probably we need authentication methods to know who uses our information and for what purposes and to be able to opt out of sharing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 12:52 PM</p>

<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:53 PM</p>
<p>How will we even be able to assess who can be “trusted?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:55 PM</p>
<p>In an extended reality world, our movements and activities will be determined by the tokens we have in our digital ID “wallets.” Privacy isn’t really relevant if our smart toilets get connected to smart locks on our front door and AI assesses our morning deposit before we are allowed to leave the house. Or if we don’t have enough tokens to say open the door of a store, or get on a bus, or go to a performance, or get a job. You can say we have privacy, but really life in a deontic logic web is going to be very, very rigid and who will we talk to when there’s a problem? No human is in charge of this “Decentraland” space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:00 PM</p>
<p>Global markets seek “impact” data to run their capital through natural life – humans and the environment. This data is placed in pools like Ocean Protocol to further develop AI. Global investors are using the UN Sustainable Development Goals to push “improvement” of poor people and the environment (mostly carbon sequestration) – “optimized” on data dashboards. That means life is put on a dashboard and is limited, very limited. They need us to live in the Metaverse to harvest the data to fulfill pay for success finance deals. See the Impact Management Project, 2,000 of the world’s largest asset holders. Gaming companies, including Epic, are involved in the social impact space. Do we really want to create digital automated systems to place bets on toddlers as they are trained to live in gaming environments? I can’t stay silent while this is rolling out. This isn’t about games – it’s about Complex Adaptive Systems. It’s about emergence of the Noosphere. This is what Teilhard de Chardin spoke of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 1:01 PM</p>
<p>Glad you mentioned Teilhard, and teleological thinking (e.g. Omega point?) will be key here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:02 PM</p>
<p>In 2016 Paul Meghan of Epic Games came to Philadelphia. He was in a panel hosted by Atlantic Magazine with Suzanne Del Bene (Microsoft, IoT Congress) and Constance Steinkuehler, UC Irvine. He said over and over the children needed to be trained to code his games. The panel was supposed to be on education and the creative economy. I realized about six months later that they want to force children to build your digital empire. This is profoundly unethical. You are stealing the children’s future and will sell it as social impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:03 PM</p>
<p>There is nothing in this future for artists. What is a world with no human-based art? Have we considered this? Again cheap, automated labor – so everyone will be forced onto UBI to “perform” humanity via wearables to try and catalyze the Singularity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:05 PM</p>
<p>The plan is to build this empire with unfree labor. Digital conquistadors. This approach will never support many stable living-wage jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:07 PM</p>
<p>The first digital item was the Utah teapot. People really should spend some time understanding the role of Salt Lake City in X-tended “life.” No surprise that it was the site planning the ARPA net and the human genome project and U of U Edwin Catmull’s school where Pixar’s roots are. Molecules – pixels – synthetic life for people who want to play God.</p>

<p>People don’t understand what is on the horizon. They are being distracted. Omega Point also relates to Swedenborg’s Church of the New Jerusalem. Most people don’t know Carnegie was raised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Church_(Swedenborgian)">Swedenborgian</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:10&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I highly recommend people read Oliver Reiser’s “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_World_Sensorium/eFYhngEACAAJ?hl=en">World Sensorium: Embryology of World Federation 1946</a>.” He was close with Julian Huxley who was close with de Chardin. It describes us as neuroblasts of the global brain – essentially agents in this programmed simulation. Who wants to live inside someone else’s program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Me: 1:10&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all the valuable comments, which lead me to think about inviting you to some of our future panels. Would you mind to send me a connection request on LinkedIn?&nbsp; I just tried to search you on LinkedIn but don’t know which one is you. Thanks</p>

<p>How is it that the first bank MakerDAO tried to bring into their digital assets is Huntingdon Valley Bank, a mile from Bryn Athyn Cathedral – the Pitcairn family’s estate? Pitcairn (Pittsburgh Plate Glass) grew up in the Swedenborgian Church with Andrew Carnegie in Pittsburgh. We need to know the history. Who knows what history will be in the Metaverse? Probably there will be no history, only different paths in an AI multiverse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 1:14&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>It is useful to consider dystopian models as cautions for what not to do, but I think it is going too far to assume that this is what is actually happening.&nbsp; It is up to us to figure out how to make sure that our technology helps us be more human, rather than less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:23&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Do you all have thoughts plans to position all of this software to build the Metaverse as “open source” “public goods” in the VC space? I have been looking into hyper-certs developed by David Dalrymple. Given the potential for cyber-physical systems to become an open-air prison – or non-consensual game, it would be ironic to have software firms be able to cycle their money through open source projects and make money even as the children build their heirarchical containment systems.</p>

<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:37&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I have been researching swarm intelligence and emergence. It seems that by pushing people to inhabit avatars and to adopt an identity of digital citizen we will be much more malleable. There is a huge push for e-government now. Digital ID will be required to obtain all sorts of public services. I think we need to understand tokenized governance as Kubernetes or cybernetics. Wiener aimed for programming the animal and the machine. So, we are getting closer, eh? The end of the world narrative is what allows humans to be pushed into digital realms. The only “sustainable” option is that we gradually dematerialize and lose our actual bodies to be replaced by piles of soul bound tokens. So much easier to run the simulations that way than with messy, chaotic embodied humans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To Thomas Coughlin: 1:39&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Right now, the average person has no understanding of the history of these technologies or who is in charge of the “game” we’ve been invited to “play.” How many people do you think understand that the seed funder for Niantic (pioneer in AR) was In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA? If people understood the origins of the game, I think they would be more cautious about walking this road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s wild to me that ten years ago I was buying Webkinz plush toys for my kid’s friend’s birthday parties. It was all about normalizing digital work for digital tokens to buy digital consumer content. We are so behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:41&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>So, where is the trust then? We have no idea who we are dealing with. It could be a machine. We are already unique.</p>

<p>Identity politics are about meta-data tags for the simulation. AI needs us to be machine-readable. Wear your intersectional identity to be “seen” and calculated into the equation. I’m for real diversity, not digital commodification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:46&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I am a mother in Philadelphia. I started researching when the Boston Consulting Group closed twenty-three schools here in 2013. I follow money. I read white papers. I am trained in art history and cultural landscape analysis. I examine myth. I never realized the landscape I was destined to interrogate would be digital. The fact that I came in the education door is everything. This is about a machine consciousness attempting to use us (natural life) as an armature to manifest in the material world. Ironically, under the banner of sustainability, we are dematerializing ourselves even as our social impact data is being used to refine the embodiment of robotics.

<p>I’m just curious for people who were working in the early era of VR programming was there always the presumption that people would eventually spend a considerable part of their time “living” in digital spaces?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vince Marchetti to All Attendees:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:00&nbsp; PM</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas FURNESS to Everyone:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:00&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>As an early pioneer of VR (virtual reality) I also felt that the use of VR spaces would be an adjunct to our living in real spaces and as such would be an appliance or tool that we may use daily like a telephone, but we would not ‘live’ in that space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:01 PM</p>
<p>Once we get to the point of being able to “record” experiences digitally, maybe even from a variety of points of view if there are multiple people involved, will the concept of “time” become distorted as we can log in and re-live past experiences? Maybe even “editing” them based on lived experience acquired since the prior memory? I find it very interesting that Scott Stornetta’s early DLT research (distributed ledger technology, preceding blockchain) was framed as a “time-stamped document.” Stornetta is LDA (correction-LDS) and of course Silicon Slopes and Utah are leaders in the digital identity space. Adobe was the key tenant for Silicon Slopes. What role might they play in permmissioned memory files? Of course University of Utah’s computer science department’s focus was both graphical design and file compression from the start. It seems to me that concepts of “time” and “history” and the “multi-verse” are very important for us to collectively consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:02&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Sorry for the typo – Stornetta is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and presented in March at the blockchain themed Mormon Transhumanist Association Conference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:04&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Thomas, I don’t think people have fully thought through this future of work plan. Richard Baldwin calls it Globalization 4.0. We work through telepresence robots where AI assigns “gigs” from among an available labor pool from around the world at the lowest price and with the relevant behavioral tokens, presumably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven’t looked into Suzanne Gildert’s Sanctuary.ai, it is very concerning. Even more so when you consider as we use “whole body” protheses in the remote gig work program, we are helping refine humanoid robotics. I worry for coming generations. I really do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:05 PM</p>
<p>I think you are worried about teaching AI to replace us, or are your concerns more than that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:09 PM</p>
<p>@thomas This is not simply a worry; it’s a fact. Look at the relationships among Ocean Protocol, Singularity.net, Hanson Robotics, and Cardano. Also see Blockscience, Commons Stack, and Protocol Labs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have concerns about dehumanized working conditions and global finance placing bets on our lives using digital twin simulations under the false premise that they are solving poverty and saving the environment. Look up social impact bonds, pay for success finance, income sharing agreements, and connect that with digital twins and smart contracts.The short video from 2016 by Institute for the Future “Learning is Earning” offers a window into where this is all headed. It’s real. I didn’t make it up. Charles Hoskinson says they are working with the Ethiopian government to track people from pre-k to determine who is a good actor and worthy of having a job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:11 PM</p>
<p>I worry about free will. I worry our education systems training people for deep expertise without breadth or imagination. I’m reading Yevgeny Zamyatin’s 1921 novel “We.” It describes a world run by mathematical logic. That is what you all are creating, whether you understand it or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:13 PM</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:14 PM</p>
<p>Clearly data storage is a huge issue. I’m curious about the future of DNA data storage. I realize the early research involved artificial DNA, but is there anything preventing In Vivo use? All of this emerging tech seems to go back to syn-bio and bio-tech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:17 PM</p>
<p>I know something about DNA storage with synthetic DNA.&nbsp; This use of DNA is not viable.&nbsp; What is your concern here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone:&nbsp; 2:17 PM</p>
<p>Viable from the point of view of being a living being, is what I meant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists:&nbsp; 2:17 PM</p>
<p>Ah – Cesium is here where I live.</p>
<p>I did a site visit to Cesium as part of a day of exploration exploring managed poverty and a profitable revenue stream under “progressive” social policies and “democracy,” <a href="https://youtu.be/O2yL1FULHgw?t=5346">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 2:20 PM</p>
<p>FAIR principles – e.g.: <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles">https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles</a></p>
<p>On the imperative that in Web3 meta-data be: findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-useable. It seems such traits are needed for persistent virtual environments to function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:23 PM</p>
<p>As I understand it – the “global brain” “unified human thought layer” imperative goes back to Vernadsky, de Chardin, Julian Huxley. It is very much a eugenics program and seems intent on optimizing (and organizing) what some imagine is a rather clunky (inefficient) water-based life form into something more “portable” (perhaps even for space colonization). Trent McConaghy of Ocean Protocol is still echoing the sentiments of L5 in the mid 1970s – primates in cans wasn’t going to go well for interplanetary travel. I have been reading up on John Holland’s work with genetic algorithms. Much of the CAS (complex adaptive systems) work is built off genetic models. It is worth considering how bio-computation and eugenics will interface as we virtualize natural existence. I simply asked if there was anything prohibiting in vivo use of DNA data storage. (I’d forgotten they’d already accomplished this using live bacteria.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:26 PM</p>
<p>Elizabeth Merritt, futurist for the American Alliance of Museum, wrote an essay “A Learning Day 2037” was about virtualized museums. But of course, not everyone could access everything. It’s ultimately about knowledge management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:36 PM</p>
<p>I wish more people understood the imperative for speed and optimization means our lives have this pressure to move away from atoms towards bits. Richard Baldwin spoke of this around Globalization 4.0 – the speed of digitizing knowledge and service work and other work via remote pilots. Baldwin says the physics of the economy are going to blow everything out of the water. We just aren’t prepared for that transition. To be honest I see very little effort being expended to bring the public along so we can have an authentic conversation about possible benefits and trade-offs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:38 PM</p>
<p>I’m curious if any of you have read JD Bernal’s “The World, The Flesh, and The Devil.” He was a Cambridge-based crystallographer. The book was written in 1929. At the time he spoke of us living 100 years in a larval state and after that we would leave behind our physical body, put our brain in a can, and live through haptics including super-powered senses. It’s astonishing. This has been a very long time in the making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:41 PM</p>
<p>To me it feels like avatar “life” and programmable tokens in governance and economic systems are really about managing “teaming” to access the “adjacent possible” in complex-adaptive systems. Melanie Swan’s proposals for blockchain cloud minds where people enter into communal thought spaces for “problem solving” where contributions are tracked by neuro-nanobots on blockchain for future micropayments. Those spaces might include not only people, but machines, animals, plants, maybe? What happens if people are pressured to entered into these spaces against their will? In that way XR sociality starts to be very concerning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:45 PM</p>
<p>In the planned “sharing” economy the plan will be limited choice. I think it mirrors “recirculation” in the Complex Adaptive Systems frame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:47 PM</p>
<p>I’m wondering if you all have been looking into wearables as tools for behaviorist conditioning – like Red Critter where teachers “zap” good behavior points to children via a device and wearable bracelets. Of course, these points would sync to one’s twin and if Charles Hoskinson’s model advances those points would follow you through your life and influence your ability to gain employment. In a worst-case scenario, it could be linked to geo-fencing or social opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:48 PM</p>
<p>Red Critter has a school-based model and a corporate leaderboard model. I can totally see this approach linked to something like Learning Economy Foundation’s LearnCard. Essentially a digital twin / geofence / social credit wallet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:51 PM</p>
<p>Are you all aware the new field of “social prescribing” and the potential for wearable tech to be used to “verify” compliance with such prescriptions? Social prescribing is being woven into human capital finance deals – pay for success. It’s about optimization of people – either through pathways set for education/training or health/mental health/wellness. Vulnerable populations are being pulled in these programs under the guise that it’s to benefit them. In reality it’s part of global finance deal flows and mass data harvest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:53 PM</p>
<p>Has anyone heard of using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to represent digital twins? I thought maybe it was more like an enclosed Voronoi polyhedron with moveable planes of influence via sensor / actuator feedback, but maybe it’s a directed acyclic graph instead – or both. Carsten Stocker of Spherity in 2018 tech conference on how the Fourth Industrial Revolution will change your identity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-tQw266Gfo&amp;t=0s">here</a>, playlist of relevant clips <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO7R9zSd1hQMRFSwRk0G9xiQ">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 2:54 PM</p>
<p>@Thomas Coughlin – great to mention metaphysics (and reminds of John Carpenter’s movie Dark Star, and the need to use metaphysics to try to defeat a too-eager AI-driven ‘smart bomb’)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:55 PM</p>
<p>Perhaps metaphysics defines us as more than our technologies and current knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:55 PM</p>
<p>Are you all familiar with Jonathan Ledgard’s proposal for interspecies currency? This is linked to sustainability-tokens, but some people might imagine these digital transactions being a form of “communication.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:58 PM</p>
<p>@thomas There’s a reason Nicholas Berggruen studied with Brian Copenhaver, UCLA Emeritus with a specialty in early modern magic, and Ervin Lazslo studied Giordano Bruno.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 3:00 PM</p>
<p>@Joe – great point about reliability = not (always) being on ‘bleeding edge’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:01 PM</p>
<p>What role do you all imagine frequency will play in research around non-surgical Brain Computer Interfaces? In a recent talk with Juan Benet, Adam Marblestone spoke about the use of ultrasound to get beyond the blood brain barrier. We are installing sensor networks everywhere that will affect us as water-based crystalline life forms. Again, I don’t think the general public has enough context to interrogate this future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:03 PM</p>
<p>TBH, I find digital spaces actually create a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Everyone: 3:03 PM</p>
<p>Then another popular question would be, how do you know we are not already living in a digital space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:04 PM</p>
<p>Social media has encouraged many people to develop their identities as a series of meta-data tags that are shifted through real time affirmation or rejection. This practice is leaving us totally without an anchor.</p>

<p>@Thomas – many GLAM (Galleries/Library/Archives/Museums) now call themselves ‘memory institutions’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:11 PM</p>
<p>Also, sometimes people want to leave their pasts behind and start fresh. We learn from mistakes. Would you want to have all your mistakes recorded on a permanent record? What will this do to us? Will we become a people afraid to live, because we might do it wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:11 PM</p>
<p>There is a huge question of machine optimization. This is Taylorism. The John Holland book is all about pushing specialization. The Adam Smith pin factory. Do we want a world of specialists?</p>

<p>You don’t need a digital twin to be more human. Also, let’s be honest XR is a video game built from state intelligence / military R&amp;D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:14 PM</p>
<p>Who’s been building synthetic people for decades – USC Institute for Creative Technologies – ex-Disney folks partnered with the Army Research Lab. That doesn’t make it an attractive option. It’s not like MK Ultra ever really ended. There is a struggle for consciousness – ongoing for many, many years. Who will stand for natural life and say we don’t want to coat it in nano – NEMS, MEMs – for panopticon optimization?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:15 PM</p>
<p>Of course, it has to be standardized. The noosphere is a global project and it has to be open source, because all the children have to build it so the global hedge funds can make money on their coding skills improvement. You can’t have remote telepresence robotic labor pools without global standards. Where would JSTA’s Moonshot project be without standards?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:16 PM</p>
<p>Give me a break. No one is going to be forgotten in extended reality (XR). Eventually, a moving object without a tag will be identified from space as an anomaly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:18 PM</p>
<p>I’d love to know what’s up with Open Mustard Seed these days. No one is going to be allowed to NOT have a digital ID. They’ll get us via health passports, digital driver’s licenses, blockchain education transcripts. There will be no room for people who don’t want this, and it will be all sewed up by the time people realize what actually happened. Or maybe everyone will be so hypnotized with dopamine they won’t notice. It’s a toss-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good to join this interesting discussion!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:22 PM</p>
<p>But embodiment is huge. That’s the goal of the roboticists – to use us to learn how to be in a material world. Bodies do matter. I agree consciousness is not limited to the body, but it still matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:23 PM</p>
<p>Does it matter to you that this is military technology?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:24 PM</p>
<p>How can we set aside global investigations into altered states and consciousness and torture?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:25 PM</p>
<p>To me this line of thinking shows a profound disrespect for the actual world. It’s like playing God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:26 PM</p>
<p>Science has been shown to be wrong so many times. Why do we think we can control the universe? To me it is like asking people to live inside personalized boxes that hide our understanding of the actual wonder of the universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:28 PM</p>
<p>Last week I toured Biosphere2. Those were some very sad plants. It was a dismal failure on the environmental front and the social front. Maybe that’s why people want to make everything digital, because they can’t control the real world to the degree that they want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>But this is a global plan and a majority of people have not agreed to do this, in fact they don’t even know what is planned. I don’t think you can force people to “transcend” using coercion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>Virtualizing the world is not going to save the earth. None of this is sustainable. It’s not. What we are doing with syn-bio and NEMs (nanoelectromechanical systems) and MEMs (microelectromechanical systems) is unethical. It’s terraforming for a new type of life. It’s not being a good relative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>@Thomas Furness – very much appreciate the thoughts shared about ‘one and many’ – individual in community – and whole is greater than sum of parts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:31 PM</p>
<p>People have no idea what this really is or who built it or what it’s meant to do. They don’t. Most people have no idea about the Omega Point. How can we make these decisions, an open secret, that will deprive future generations of their birthright – to be natural beings?</p>

 This is a guest post by Roma Wilson, Quantum Heart Cafe, describing how data and technology is being used to create intelligent communities in Vancouver BC. 
<p>As I have been learning more about the planned roll out of Web3, social impact investing, and smart cities, I’ve been paying more attention to advertisements and local media I come across while out for walks or waiting at the bus stop.</p>
<p>One I saw recently was a real estate advertisement for a recently built community called <a href="https://ambergateliving.ca/">Amber Gate</a>, situated in what is currently called Burke Mountain, Coquitlam BC.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Burke Mountain community was built on the lands of the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nations. It was a homesteading community where immigrants were expected to work the land until they were eligible to own it. It has now become an urban community, part of Vancouver/Lower Mainland.</p>
<p>When I first saw the advertisement for Amber Gate I wondered if it was a pre-planned smart city community, because the logo for it is a tree branch with leaves connected to a main branch. That imagery put me in mind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunking">trunk networks</a> used in IT infrastructure.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When I looked at the list of <a href="https://ambergateliving.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AG-Features-List-22-09-29.pdf">features and amenities</a> residents of Amber Gate would receive, a few jumped out at me. Among them were on-site daycare, plug-in for EVs, and a bicycle repair shop. This is important because <a href="https://view.publitas.com/translink/transport-2050-regional-transportation-strategy/page/1">Vancouver hopes to eliminate private vehicle ownership by 2050.</a>&nbsp; Also included in each townhome are work-from-home-ready wired ethernet and USB ports for smart devices, and it was all these amenities and features that sent up some red flags.</p>
<p>I did an online search for the phrases Coquitlam and smart cities to see what connections the municipality has to the smart city initiative and what public-private partnerships they’ve established with various organizations. An organization I came across right away is the <a href="https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/">Intelligent Community Forum</a> (ICF), a global think tank that comprises a network of cities and regions working together to push the smart city initiative.</p>
<p>The ICF nominates seven cities/regions every year that are working on smart city initiatives from a list of twenty-one cities. Coquitlam, along with a number of other cities in and around Vancouver, made the <a href="https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/smart21">Smart 21 Communities of the year back in 2021</a>.&nbsp; Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odOySk7NIGg&amp;t=272s">brief presentation</a> of what the Smart 21 Communities initiative aims to do, which is make cities go from “smart” to “intelligent.”</p>
<p>ICF’s co-founder, <a href="https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/louis_zacharilla">Louis Zacharilla</a>, developed the Smart City awards and has overseen the development of smart city institutes around the world. Louis is also Director of Innovation for Space and Satellite Professionals International (<a href="https://www.sspi.org/cpages/board">SSPI</a>). The relationship between the Smart Cities initiative and space is something I will continue to research.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I wanted to write this letter is because this predatory system is trying to unfold at the local level. While Web3 implementation is global, it needs local municipalities to provide infrastructure and planning.&nbsp; This inspired me to learn about what’s going on in my own part of the labyrinth.</p>
<p>Louis Zacharilla can be seen in this clip talking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY2zStebDN8">how technology and data can give a city a soul.</a> I wonder if that is Smart Cities’ intention, to be the shapers and modelers of each community’s soul.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve also been learning more about the differences between the Western Imperial worldview and Indigenous worldview from a book written by Vine Deloria Jr. called ‘<a href="https://archive.org/details/godisred00delo">God is Red: A Native View of Religion</a>.’&nbsp; One of the important differences is the West’s obsession with chronological time and progression of both historical and future events. Whereas, Indigenous Nations living on North Turtle Island place more importance on space and how they relate to those spaces through their ceremonies, stories, rituals, and so on.</p>
<p>This has inspired me to think about my place in the labyrinth. I wonder if a key to navigating it is through rooting myself to the places I am a part of and re-learning how to relate to them and how to relate to the beings that also inhabit the same spaces.</p>

<p></p><p>December 8th, 2022. Panther, a cross-chain application that will allow retail users as well as institutions to access DeFi privately and compliantly, has launched its v0.5. This was achieved by the protocol’s community in conjunction with Panther Ventures Limited, a Web3 development company destined to develop the blockchain technology and zero-knowledge components of Panther.<br></p><p>Panther Ventures Limited collaborators developed the protocol’s software and released it under a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/23/uniswap-v3-introduces-new-license-to-spoil-future-sushis/">BUSL License</a>, which grants users the right to copy, modify, create derivative works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work. The Licensed Work will eventually be made available under an Open-Source License, as stated in this License.<br></p><p>The development of Panther’s v0.5 was also aided by the Panther Foundation, which focuses on promoting privacy and fostering the Panther ecosystem. The Panther community discussed and established the terms for v0.5’s launch and voted upon them on the protocol’s <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot.org space</a>. <br></p><p>Besides issuing rewards through its staking solution, Panther’s v0.5 will allow Panther’s community of contributors to test the technological primitives that will be used by the Mainnet launch of the full protocol to enable confidential DeFi. This allows Panther to start testing and utilizing key technical components of the main protocol incrementally. <br></p><p>Panther’s upcoming version 1.0 will allow retail users as well as institutions to interact with DeFi without undergoing the risk of having their transaction history being exposed or copied by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. <br></p><p>This will be a major milestone that will offer a solution to the biggest challenge facing DeFi: onboarding institutions, legacy players, and FinTechs into the Web3 financial paradigm compliantly and confidentially.<br></p><p>To access Panther's v0.5 and learn more about the technical components of Panther, <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/">visit the project’s website</a>.<br></p><p>Press contact: press@pantherprotocol.io<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a><br></p> About Panther Ventures Limited <p>Panther Ventures Limited (PVL) is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing Panther Protocol informed by its community.<br></p> About the Panther Foundation <p>The Panther Foundation supports Panther’s purpose to promote privacy, fostering Panther’s ecosystem and development.</p>

<p>Through the last few weeks, the Panther community and DAO have set the stage for this release with <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Panther Improvement Proposals (PIP)</a> <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x576701a7a07efe281cd4f04acbf589d0791e492117497d628a6dfc6e9eccda6b">6</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xd7fe6122175ed23696b88c8cdf34388923a03cdbb6c7281b83ff50347dac3991">7</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xb5d638eb5aad2819c210a2f1e06001a58819694717e8d04ca789304f06520fa1">8</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">9</a>, and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0c6f3fd9db866f99d7d0b343687b890cd3240495170f539efcc31f2dc216ebd5">10</a>. These proposals have covered everything from democratic procedures related to who is allowed to vote on DAO proposals under certain circumstances to the release of code so that it can be deployed by anyone in the Panther community. Furthermore, PIP-9 &amp; 10, which set out to launch Advanced Staking, formalized the terms for our upcoming staking program and allowed the community to deploy it independently. <br></p><p>As we get closer to this release, today we want to give you an overview of Panther’s v0.5 interface, as well as step-by-step walkthroughs on:<br></p>  Checking your balances —available $ZKP, staked $ZKP, rewards, and PRPs (both “Expected” and “Unrealized”, see below).  Staking $ZKP  Unstaking $ZKP  Looking at your zAssets  Early $zZKP Redemption<br>  <p>Let’s get started.<br></p> What is Panther’s v0.5, aka Advanced Staking?<br> <p>Advanced Staking is a progressive step toward the development of the core technologies surrounding the Multi-Asset Shielded Pool, in particular, the way UTXOs are created, managed, and tracked. Within Advanced Staking, users will be able to shield assets and receive them as rewards but not transact with them until v1’s launch.<br></p> What kind of rewards are issued in Advanced Staking?  Staking Rewards<br> <p>The number of tokens to be released as rewards in Advanced Staking is 6,000,000 $ZKP.<br></p><p>The formula for distributing rewards is the following:<br></p><p>Reward = Amount * APR * Period / 365 APR - 15% Period - 60 days<br></p><p>Where: <br></p>  Reward: reward for a stake ($zZKP)  Amount: amount staked ($ZKP)  APR: Annual Percentage Rate (%)  Period: rewarded period (days)<br><br>   PRP Rewards <p>In addition to regular staking rewards, Advanced Staking stakers receive Panther Reward Points. PRPs are non-transferable points associated with a user's wallet address. The mechanisms that generate PRPs will also be employed on MASPs in Panther v1. When Panther v1 is launched, PRPs will become redeemable for $zZKP through a one-sided Automated Market Maker.<br></p><p>There are two types of PRP rewards:<br></p>  Expected PRP Rewards: The first 2000 stakers will be rewarded with 2000 PRPs per stake, as decided by the community through PIP-9. These rewards will not continue growing or change (i.e., they are “flat”). Users will be able to see them on the Balance Card on the Staking page. This type of PRPs will be awarded automatically and is not forfeitable.  <p>Users that qualify for this kind of rewards will receive a “stake-proof” NFT allowing them to access their Expected PRP Rewards once v1 is launched.<br></p>  Total Unrealized Privacy Rewards: These will be calculated and accrued based on the Privacy rewards APR, which will be decided by the community through a Panther Improvement Proposal. This APR will be set through a PIP before v1 is launched. This kind of PRPs will only be awarded when v1 launches and only in case a user has kept their $zZKP rewards in the pool until v1. If $zZKP rewards are redeemed via early redemption mechanics, the user will lose all of his accrued PRPs of this kind.<br>  <p>All PRPs will be available to exchange for $zZKP via the single-sided AMM at the time of v1’s launch.</p> Accessing Advanced Staking <p>The Advanced Staking app will be accessible through a fully decentralized front-end, routed through a Panther subdomain, at the time of release.<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE (Dec. 8th, 2022): Currently, Advanced Staking is only accessible through the "Launch app" button on Panther's <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io">Home page</a>. Eventually, an ENS domain will be enabled. For now, only access through this button. If someone attempts to send you a direct link to the staking solution, please report them.<br></p>The Advanced Staking home page, as it looks before any interactions.<p><br>To use it, you must connect your MetaMask wallet. To do so:<br></p>  Click the blue button on the top right.  Select the account (wallet) where you have $ZKP and click “Next.”  Click on the “Connect” button to allow the app to see your address and balance, and suggest transactions for you to approve.  Select the network where your $ZKP is (Polygon or the Ethereum Mainnet) from the drop-down menu in the top right. A MetaMask pop-up might ask you to confirm this change.<br>  <p>If you can’t see your $ZKP balance on MetaMask, it could be because of three possible issues:<br></p>  You might not have any $ZKP in your wallet.  You might have the wrong account or network selected.  $ZKP may not be added as a tracked token in your MetaMask.<br>  <p>The Advanced Staking interface provides an “Add ZKP token” button that facilitates addressing the third issue. After you click this button and accept the prompt, your $ZKP balance will be displayed in the wallet’s interface.</p> The Advanced Staking App<br> The Advanced Staking application, as it looks after staking tokens.<p><br>The Advanced Staking app has two pages, one for Staking and one for managing zAssets. Our top Menu also links to Panther’s <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">snapshot.eth</a> space, where Panther’s governance proposals are voted on. On the right side, the blue “Connect Wallet” button allows the user to give permission for the app to see and interact with their MetaMask wallet. This is necessary for the app to suggest transactions in which the wallet interacts with the Advanced Staking smart contracts.<br></p><p>The Staking page is the app’s homepage. It allows the user to:<br></p>  Stake or unstake $ZKP.  Check their balances of unstaked $ZKP (available for staking), staked $ZKP, $zZKP rewards, and Expected PRP Balance.  See how much unclaimed $zZKP rewards are left for the Advanced Staking program and the current staking APR.  The time remaining until the staking program ends.<br>  <p>On the zAssets page, the user can:<br></p>  Check their total balance per zAsset (through Advanced Staking, the only zAsset available will be $zZKP).  Inspect their $zZKP, Unrealized Privacy Rewards balance per individual stake, and total.  Redeem $zZKP before v1 is launched.<br>  <p>Let’s take a look at the different features and displays of each page:</p> The Staking page — Staking and Unstaking <p>On the left side of the Staking page, you will find the Balances Card. This panel shows the user’s available $ZKP, staked $ZKP, zZKP rewards, and Expected PRP Balance. Next to each $ZKP or $zZKP balance, an approximate USD value is provided.<br></p><p>The panel also displays the user’s MATIC/ETH (depending on the network they’re connected to) balance in the top right corner. Make sure you have enough MATIC/ETH to pay for the transaction fees required for some steps of the staking, unstaking, and rewards redemption processes.<br></p><p>To refresh the values, click on the refresh icon to the right of “Available ZKP balance,” and a MetaMask signature request will pop up. You will need to accept it, which does not incur gas fees.<br></p><p>Note: Data updating can take time. Please keep an eye on the spinning wheel inside the “Available ZKP Balance” field in the top right corner. As soon as the wheel stops, data should be up to date (but you might need to refresh the page).<br></p>The Balances Card.<p>Located to the right of the Balance Card, the Stats panel displays the amount of Advanced Staking rewards already distributed, the percentage of the total they represent, and the total rewards offered. It also shows the time left until Advanced Staking closes and its current APR. <br><br>Note: Staking APR and Privacy rewards APR are two different parameters. <br></p>The Stats panel. Staking $ZKP <p>The tab for staking $ZKP in Advanced Staking is located below the Stats panel on the Stake panel.<br></p>This is where the action happens!<p><br>You can input the amount of $ZKP you intend to stake on the box on the top or click the “MAX” button on the right side next to the Panther logo to insert your entire $ZKP balance automatically. The minimum stake size is 1000 $ZKP.<br></p><p>The warning below the amount box refers to the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">lockup period of 60 days set on PIP-9</a> to which all stakes in Advanced Staking are subject. Only after this period can you unstake your originally-deposited $ZKP. The lockup period doesn’t apply to the rewards from staking, as we will address on the zAssets Page session.<br></p><p>After the warning message, you can see a preview of the $zZKP and Expected PRPs staking rewards your stake will entitle you to. This preview is just a forecast, and final numbers may vary slightly.<br></p>Note that, as time progresses, you will accrue additional Unrealized Privacy Rewards (non-flat PRPs) on top of your initial amount (2,000, only for the first 2,000 stakes). These additional rewards will only be awarded if you keep your $zZKP rewards in the pool till v1’s launch.<p><br>If you’re satisfied, you may click the blue button. This step requires $MATIC/$ETH (depending on the network you’re on) to cover gas fees.<br></p><p>After clicking the blue button, three MetaMask windows will appear in quick succession. The first one will prompt you to approve Panther’s Advanced Staking contract to be able to move your $ZKP. The second window will ask that you accept the actual staking transaction. Gas fees apply to both steps.<br></p><p>After staking, you will be able to see your updated balance on the Balances Card and the zAssets page.<br></p> Unstaking $ZKP <p>_______________________________________________</p> IMPORTANT: The difference between unstaking and early redemption<br> <p>It’s important to understand the distinction between unstaking (of staked $ZKP) and early redemption (of $zZKP rewards). Unstaking and redeeming are separate functions of separate smart contracts.<br></p><p>A user can unstake $ZKP after their stake’s lockup period ends (60 days per individual stake). By doing so, only their original $ZKP stake is returned to their wallet. The accumulated staking rewards need to be redeemed separately.<br></p><p>A user can redeem their $zZKP rewards from a specific stake after 120 days since the launch of the Advanced Staking program. Doing so before the launch of Panther v1 necessarily entails forfeiting all Unrealized Privacy Rewards (one of two types of PRP rewards) associated with that stake.<br></p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>The Stake panel has two tabs: Stake ZKP and Unstake ZKP. You can switch between them through the buttons on the panel's top. The Unstake ZKP tab allows you to inspect and unstake your individual stakes.<br></p>The Unstake ZKP tab.<p>To unstake one of your stakes, click the “unstake” button on the right side of said stake. This will prompt you with a MetaMask window where you can confirm the transaction —gas fees apply. Your $ZKP will be returned to you once the transaction is confirmed by the network.<br></p><p>Exactly as with staking, you will be able to see your updated balance on the Balance Card and the zAssets page.</p> The zAssets page — Inspect your Unrealized PRP Rewards, and manage your zAssets <p>The zAssets page allows you to view and manage your shielded assets and Unrealized PRP Rewards, and redeem your $zZKP rewards. Extra functionalities will be available when Panther’s v1 launches.<br></p>This page shows the total amount of assets you have shielded and additional information about each stake. Checking your zAssets balance <p>As you can see, the Total Balance panel displays the balance of all of your shielded assets (zAssets) in USD, as well as your Unrealized PRP rewards balances.<br></p><p>Attention: in your very first time inspecting your zAsset and PRPs balances, the app will automatically prompt you to sign a message with MetaMask. Click the blue “Sign” button on the pop-up window to allow the app to scan the Panther Wallet and reveal your current balances to yourself only. <br></p><p>On your subsequent visits, click the “Refresh Private Balance” button on the right side of the panel and sign the message to get updated data to be displayed in the interface.<br></p>Each time you use this feature, you will need to sign a message (no gas fees required!) Private zAssets list <p>The panel below the Total Balance panel is the Private zAssets panel. It allows you to inspect the balance of each private zAsset you have, as well as the Unrealized Reward PRPs each stake has accumulated.</p>The Private zAssets panel.<p></p><p>Each zAsset line (for v0.5, only $zZKP is available) can be expanded to see and inspect the list of stakes that generated zAssets –just click the Expand button in the left of the zAsset icon. <br></p><p>The best way to optimize the rewards you can get from Advanced Staking is to wait for the release of Panther’s v1 to redeem them. However, by clicking “Redeem zZKP,” you can unshield the rewarded $zZKP into $ZKP and forfeit any further PRP rewards.</p> Early Redemption of Staking Rewards <p>At the time Panther’s v1 launches, all $zZKP rewards for Advanced Staking will be moved into a Panther Pool. Upon launch, the user will receive their Unrealized Rewards PRPs, and redeeming PRPs for $zZKP that you can transact within the MASP will become possible.<br></p><p>Stakers can redeem their rewards as ERC-20 $ZKP before the Advanced Staking period is finished through the Early Redemption mechanism. By doing so, they forfeit their Unrealized Rewards PRPs –Expected PRPs cannot be forfeited– receiving just the $zZKP provided upon staking. The Early Redemption mechanism will become available 120 days after Advanced Staking opens, 60 days before the end of the program.<br></p><p>To initiate an Early Redemption, click on the blue “Redeem zZKP” button on the right side of one of the entries in the list.<br></p><p><br></p><p>The app will warn you that using Early Redemption forfeits Unrealized Rewards PRPs rewards for that stake. You must tick the “I understand I will lose a part of my PRP rewards.” checkbox in order to continue. Then, if you want to proceed, you can click the blue button to redeem your $zZKP as $ZKP.<br></p>Early redemptions allow you to withdraw your $zZKP ahead of our v1’s launch.<p><br>A MetaMask prompt to sign a message will appear. Click “Sign” to confirm.<br></p>Signing carries no transaction costs.<p>The next step requires waiting 24 hours for your $zZKP to be available for redemption. After the time has passed, click again on the “Redeem zZKP” button. A pop-up will appear where you can click the “Redeem ZKP” button.<br></p>Your $ZKP, a button’s click away.<p><br>After clicking the blue button, two MetaMask windows will appear in quick succession. The first one will prompt you to sign a message exactly as before. The second window will ask that you accept a transaction —gas fees apply. Once the network has included your transaction, you will receive the redeemed $zZKP as $ZKP in your wallet. <br></p><p>After completing your transaction, please make sure that it was successful. Also, make sure to complete it within 24 hours of initiating it.<br><br></p> Want to learn more about the mechanisms behind Advanced Staking? <p>If you’re interested in learning more about the mechanics of Advanced Staking, upcoming blog posts and documentation will provide a complete breakdown of Panther Reward Points, including their importance, how they’re calculated, redeeming PRPs, and their relation to Advanced Staking.<br></p><p>For the extra curious, you can check out <a>Panther's documentation</a>, where we will be documenting the technological components of v0.5<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a></p>

 Nym Shipyard Academy — Welcome to Stage&nbsp;3! <p>Congratulations to our more than 300 Navigators for successfully completing Stage 2 of Shipyard Academy! You are the cream of the crop, less than 10% of the almost 4000 initial participants made it this far. You now have an in-depth understanding of the Nym network, its economic model and how they work in tandem to bring robust infrastructure-level privacy to everyone, everywhere.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1rDVGoNccXHIzht2HXCnNwDJqF9LPTIeBypAI76PYfAM/edit">Here</a> is the leaderboard, and you can find the leaderboard and further information about Stage 2 rewards on our <a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord server</a>. Remember: you still have until December 8th (Thursday) 18:00 UTC to <a href="https://nymtech.typeform.com/to/o4BKWWuC">submit</a> your social media posts if you haven’t already done so! It is required to graduate from Stage&nbsp;2.</p> Stage 3: Sailmaker <p>During the final stage of your journey to become a Nym Sailmaker, you will demonstrate that you are able to create the sails that will carry the global Nym community across the digital oceans. You will continue learning, but this stage is also focused on building: building understanding by localising Nym to your local community, running mixnodes, gateways or creating proof of concept&nbsp;apps.</p><p>You will gain insight into the importance of privacy at a societal level and for innovation. You will learn about the prehistory to Nym and mixnet technologies and what we can expect for the privacy landscape going into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The rest of the curriculum is partly in your hands — soon you will get a chance to steer the ship together with your crewmates. Keep a close eye on the Shipyard Academy Announcement channel on our Discord&nbsp;server!</p><p>During this stage, you&nbsp;will</p>  Learn more about Nym, and how privacy is an intervention into societies that have become addicted to surveillance and pass a more difficult quiz (60% to complete the Academy and become a Sailmaker, 50% to receive&nbsp;rewards)  Continue to spread the word about Nym, its tech and vision by reaching people on social media (Mandatory to graduate from Stage&nbsp;3)  Extend the Nym infrastructure to underrepresented areas by spinning up mix nodes and gateways in these regions (eligible mix nodes will receive delegations, and gateways will receive Shipyard S<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">ervice&nbsp;Grants</a>!)  Privacy-enhance new apps by setting up gateways and service providers for a new app to run via NymConnect  Submit Proofs of Concept (POCs) using Nym clients that are good enough to convince our DevRel team (winners will receive <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-developer-grants-4a37a33be49d">Shipyard Developer Grants!</a>)  Or if your talents are with images and words rather than code, write a guest blogpost/ create a video or produce original artwork that localizes the issue of privacy and the benefits of Nym for your specific community or part of the world (mandatory for Nymja candidates)   Stage 3&nbsp;rewards <p>Before Stage 2, we decided to up the total prize pool by 15K NYM tokens, to 115K. This brings the maximum prize pool of Stage 3 to 55K&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Just like with Stage 2, the final size of the prize pool is once again in your hands! The prize pool will grow as we hit our common goals for this stage together. This is how it&nbsp;works:</p><p>Starting prize pool: 30K NYM&nbsp;tokens</p><p>Maximum prize pool: 55K NYM&nbsp;tokens</p><p>Common goals:</p>  2 POCs making use of Nym clients approved by the DevRel&nbsp;team  10 mix nodes and 10 gateways in <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">underrepresented areas</a> (meeting quality requirements)  1 new app privacy-enhanced via NymConnect  An original blogpost or video in a non-english language that explains the use of Nym for a situation relevant to people who speak that language.   Kick-starting Stage&nbsp;3 <p>You now have an advanced understanding of Nym: the problem Nym is solving and how the technologies are solving it exactly. It is time to bring this knowledge into the context of the communities you are part of: what are the main threats to personal privacy in your country? What is your government’s position when it comes to privacy? Where do you see the Nym vision fit into the picture? Write a tweet thread, blog post, create a video or artwork about the privacy issues of your community!</p><p>For our more technically-minded Navigators, it’s your time to contribute! Got an idea for an app making use of the Nym infrastructure? Got experience running nodes and want to run Nym infrastructure? Want to see more apps supported by NymConnect and ready to get your hands dirty? These are all in scope for Stage 3 of Shipyard Academy! Start organizing with your crewmates today and submit a POC, set up infrastructure in underrepresented areas, or enable new applications to be supported by NymConnect by setting up gateways and network requesters.</p><p>A note to Nymja candidates</p><p>To become a Sailmaker it is enough to attend the lectures and pass the final quiz 60% or more, and keep spreading the word about our mission on social media. Writing elaborate articles, submitting POCs or setting up infrastructure are not mandatory requirements.</p><p>However, as we are approaching the end of Shipyard Academy, we are busy creating our shortlist of Nymja candidates. If you want to become a Nymja, it is your time to shine! Whether by articulating our vision to your communities or by contributing to bringing the mixnet to new apps, use cases and regions, it’s time to show off that you are ready and capable to bring privacy to everyone, everywhere.</p><p>Good luck to all of you and see you on our channels!</p><p>The Nym Network is powered by the NYM Token, a utility token that can be used to access the network, run a mix-node, and NYM should only be used within the Nym mixnet. NYM is not a general purpose payment mechanism nor cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. For investment purposes, do not use NYM but instead look into Bitcoin or other investment vehicles.</p><p>The rewards of and participation in Shipyard Academy is only available to individuals who do not reside in locations that makes them ineligible to participate and/or receive prizes, including the United States, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, the Crimea region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic. Nym may request that participants provide relevant information as necessary, and can only process payments once cleared by the Nym legal&nbsp;team.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-academy-welcome-to-stage-3-6d1abe2a6c9e">Nym Shipyard Academy — Welcome to Stage 3!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Mix nodes can now use the CLI tool to declare families if they are run by the same organization, read instructions (<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/mixnodes#node-families">here</a>). When an operator declares a mix node family, all the nodes from that family will be put in the same layer for privacy and security reasons. You should only create multiple nodes and put them in a family if your initial mix node is over saturated.  Initial zk-nym (Coconut) functionality including credentials and distributed key generation!  <p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-binaries-v1.1.2/CHANGELOG.md#v112">changelog</a> for a complete list of fixes and&nbsp;changes.</p> What’s new in NymConnect v1.1.2? <p>We have fixed the error with client where it would fail and disconnect unnecessarily</p><p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-connect-v1.1.2/nym-connect/CHANGELOG.md#nym-connect-v112-2022-11-29">changelog</a> for a complete list of fixes and&nbsp;changes</p> What’s new in the Nym Wallet&nbsp;v1.1.2? <p>Users can now buy NYM tokens directly from the wallet without having to go through&nbsp;KYC.</p><p>The service is provided by our partner <a href="https://bity.com/">Bity</a> and can be accessed in the wallet under a new section called Buy as shown below.

 Harness the Security of Enterprise-Grade MPC and Democratize it for Mainstream Users <p>As the leading non-custodial authentication infrastructure provider with over 8M monthly users, Web3Auth has launched the MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallet SDK. We are aiming to bring seamless logins and enterprise-grade security from the institutional level to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>To date, more than 20% of all mined Bitcoin is lost due to mismanaged or stolen seed phrases. To remove this main friction of web3 onboarding and key management issue, it’s time to say bye to the seed&nbsp;phrase.</p><p>On a mission to provide the most seamless login experience for users, wallets, and dapps, recently we integrated our MPC via @Metamask snaps. Take a sneak peek at a Web3 world without seed&nbsp;phrases</p><p>Other than Metamask, we are onboarding key Web2 gaming players like <a href="https://www.neowizglobal.com/">NEOWIZ</a> and <a href="https://glip.gg/">Glip</a> <a href="https://www.nafeza.gov.eg/en">NAFEZA</a>. Egypt’s newly launched customs platform for importing and exporting also leverages Web3Auth’s MPC technology to seamlessly and securely onboard its users to the blockchain.</p><p>A lot of exciting partners in the pipeline, but first let’s review some&nbsp;basics…</p> What is&nbsp;MPC? <p>MPC, or Multi-Party Computation, is Web3’s version of multi-factor authentication (MFA). It allows users to manage their keys intuitively by using multiple factors to protect their keys, instead of just relying on a single seed phrase to remove it in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This makes it possible to design crypto wallets that rely on multiple factors to access a user’s funds. It is currently the gold standard for enterprise-grade crypto custody solutions and is used widely by exchanges and financial institutions for managing&nbsp;crypto.</p> Why use MPC technology?   MPC is currently the golden standard for enterprise key management which Bitgo and Fireblocks currently offer.  Coinbase introduced an MPC alpha/beta into their wallet earlier in the year, and now we’re unveiling our MPC SDK that enables any wallet or app to do the same for their&nbsp;users.  Being able to build on the latest and greatest, we’ve optimized the infrastructure to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for globally-distributed low-latency signing.  Our MPC SDK leverages existing and familiar UI/UX flows, including simple one-click logins and others, check out the flow&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1022785836284129320/1034363507157782538/One_Click_flow.gif">here</a>   How is our SDK different from other MPC solutions?   Our MPC is the perfect Externally Owned Account (EOA) and can be paired with Gnosis Safe and other Smart Contract Wallet infrastructure (more on this coming&nbsp;soon).  The existing MPC solutions offered today are all targeted at large enterprises. These MPC solutions are expensive, require a long setup process, or are just too slow to run on consumer&nbsp;devices.  <p>We think that MPC is too important and too crucial of a technology to be kept out of reach of the average user. MPC security should be the standard for all web3 wallets today. As a wallet infrastructure provider, we have optimized our MPC SDKs to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for geo-distributed low-latency signing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a game, an app, a Chrome extension, or even a web wallet running in a mobile browser — our SDKs support&nbsp;that.</p> Our MPC technology key feature&nbsp;includes   1.2-second transaction speed (challenge it if you don’t believe&nbsp;us).  We are chain agnostic (secp256k1, ed25519, BLS and more&nbsp;support)  Our SDK can be embedded into any web, mobile, and native application.  The MPC SDK is geo-distributed and horizontally scaled for global distribution.  <p>For those of you that are already familiar with the multi-factor keys security model at Web3Auth, this blog is just another incremental step towards improving private key security.</p><p>For those of you who aren’t familiar, here’s how multi-factor keys&nbsp;work:</p> Leveraging our MPC SDK, you can expect the following benefits   Reduces account loss from misplaced seed&nbsp;phrases  <p>There is no seed phrase to manage — shares are managed by intuitive MFA flows that users are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>2. Prevent compromised device vulnerabilities</p><p>User accounts are not subjected to frontend vulnerabilities as MPC’s joint computation allows for keyless&nbsp;usage.</p><p>3. Avoid losing funds from dubious transactions</p><p>Safeguard your users’ accounts with a flexible policy engine to set rules — daily transaction limits and blacklist scams.</p><p>4. Expect fluid experiences</p><p>Expect a low latency of less than 1.5s for both login and transaction signing. Allow your users to focus on engaging with your&nbsp;product.</p><p>5. You own the UX, we can be a white-label service&nbsp;provider</p><p>Our MPC can be embedded into any dapp and/or wallet — you own the experience.</p><p>6. You Don’t need to compromise your stack, any platform any&nbsp;chain</p><p>Our MPC SDK is blockchain agnostic, it works on Web, Mobile, and Native applications.</p> Wanna try&nbsp;it? <p>We have an alpha SDK that you can use today <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/web3auth-mpc">https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/web3auth-mpc</a>.

<p>Yesterday was my birthday. I spent it setting intentions at the Titan Missile Museum in Green Valley, Raytheon’s Tucson Offices, and Pima County Community College (the East Campus). The latter has been part of the National Laboratory for Education Transformation’s efforts to shift coming generations towards a just-in-time, on-demand, conditional, gig, telepresence workforce model grounded in the use of electronic transcripts and digital twins.</p>
<p>Today is my last day in Arizona. Shortly I’ll head up Mount Lemmon in the Santa Catalina Range to soak up the gifts that nature has to offer in those lofty heights above the Sonoran desert.</p>
<p>I got up this morning and laid out the gatherings I have left. Most were collected here, though some were gifted to me by fellow travelers from Pennsylvania, Washington State, Colorado, and Florida – shells, tobacco, clover, tissue paper hummingbirds, “Green Pill” socks, and pressed flowers from a “cheer-me-up” bouquet. When I was done sorting through the worn gift bag that I’d been carrying around, the counter held a sprig of tiny peppers from the Presidio fortification remnants; a rounded piece of driftwood worn smooth by the seasonal rains in a wash near a Hohokam settlement; feathers from a local park; white stones from Cochise Stronghold; Mesquite beans from the landscaping outside the Raytheon building; wrinkled date palms gathered along the sidewalk opposite Michael Crow’s office at Arizona State University. The campus had many offerings – papery bark, Nandina berries, even an olive!</p>
<p>Over a celebratory soup supper one of my host’s friends asked me what I do about all of this? What do I do? Well, I make hearts. Some make plans to try and protect their retirements from digital currency. Some scout possible bug-out locations. Some work on local politics. All of those are fine things to do. We all have our paths. I try not to judge, and I hope others will not judge my approach. From my research I know that this system of domination seeks to harness the power of love and faith and imagination. They are trying to get us to teach it to artificial intelligence. Based on recent developments, GPTChat, it seems many are all too happy to oblige in this misguided mentoring process. Me? I try to be a storyteller who holds open the door for an alternate future. I go places and I try to tell their stories. All places have their story.</p>
<p>This system, as John Trudell so eloquently teaches, wants us to forget who we are. We are shapes of the earth. Our bones, flesh, and blood are made up of the minerals, stones, and liquids of the earth. In Arizona you feel this viscerally. Rocks are everywhere in every size and there is an energetic communion with them. A magnificent dance is unfolding all around us, a symphony of life that machine consciousness envies. This soulless creature stares down at us from space, attempts to secure our souls within its socio-technical systems, but we are like water. We flow through the rapids and the calm pools towards the sea.</p>
<p>I’ll be writing more hard-hitting research on Tucson after I get home, but until them I want to leave you with some of the intentions that I have set along the way. Consider these offerings and reflect on how these storylines get woven into a master narrative of domination through mathematical “progress” and optimization. My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO7kFkMnr7i9oDB-a067c_NY">new read aloud</a>, “We” written in 1921 by Yevgeny Zamyatin provides appropriate context for the coming smart contract layer of imposed logic. The antidote, in my opinion, is authentic communion with clear-thinking human beings and with the rhythms of nature and the through lines that connect us to our ancestors and task us with being good relatives to those who come after.</p>
<p>I embark today with a lei around my neck gifted to me by a strong woman of Hawaiian descent. It was handmade by her from Ti leaves transformed through rhythmic twisting into a deep, glossy green cable. Bits of leaf tips peek out. I imagine these as a wink and a nod that not all will be contained within the ordering system. She told me that she’d grown the plant from which this gift was crafted as a cutting. It was taken from her childhood home and carried many memories, including those of a grandmother who wore ginger flowers in her hair. Its appearance is not unlike the cording from an academic ceremony or liturgical vestment. It is my honor to wear it today and to bring it with me up the mountain where I will say a prayer that despite our frailties and inadequacies, or perhaps because of them, we will be able to carry a <a href="https://krinvan.com/2022/08/05/the-spark-of-hope-by-sharon-k-youngs/">shkitagen-held spark</a> for natural life through the miasma of differential equations, handing it off as many times as needed until we come out the other side. We are the sons and daughters of life. We are in need of healing, and we are healers. We need to remember who we are.</p>
<p>Blessings.</p>

   During economic downturns, is it possible (or even wise) for startup entrepreneurs to deploy growth tactics? Will companies be able to secure funding? Should founders even consider starting a business during a bear market? "100%," says Greylock general partner Reid Hoffman.

<p>I’ve been spending much of my time in recent months working to better understand the strategies being employed around swarm intelligence and complex adaptive systems. The goal is to catalyze emergent behavior through digital social engineering. I’m dropping in quickly this morning in to re-share two long talks I did about Twitter. At this point any researcher or influencer who centers Dorsey or Musk is, intentionally or not, obscuring the deep institutional structures from which the field of social physics emerged. IMO people would be better served by looking into the work of Sandy Pentland and John Clippinger on the Open Mustard Seed project and “self-sovereign” digital identity. If you want to avoid being managed, stop chasing the behaviorist pellets the feed is dropping you. You’re already tagged in the simulation.</p>
<p>Feature image from Pentland’s 2014 presentation at Google <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMBl0ttu-Ow">here</a>.</p>

<p>TBH I believe the Neuralink hype is a distraction. While I’m not convinced those in power will ultimately be able to manipulate the mind or create group minds, this conversation between <a href="https://research.protocol.ai/authors/juan-benet/">Juan Benet</a> of Protocol Labs and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/amarbles/www/index.html">Adam Marblestone</a>, a former MIT research scientist and protege of George Church, on non-surgical Brain-Computer Interfaces is probably a more likely scenario. This discussion outlines their thinking on how that research will proceed and how to fund it.</p>

<p>Brands are navigating the new Web3 world, and its opportunity for experimentation, innovation, and engaging consumers in entirely new ways. In this season of <a>The Brave Marketer Podcast</a>, we’re discussing Web3 marketing and how to market in the metaverse.</p>
<p>The first episode of season 6 features an interview from Avery Akkineni, President of <a href="https://vayner3.com/">Vayner3</a>, a Web3 consultancy launched alongside serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk. Avery covers a wide range of pressing topics such as:</p>
 
 The difference between stunt campaigns and always-on marketing in the metaverse, and what it will take to succeed in Web3 channels. 
 Web 2.5, and why it’s going to be a game changer in 2023. 
 The best partnerships and activations that have happened in the metaverse so far. 
 
<p>Topics in this new 10-episode season include crypto marketing, privacy, cookieless advertising, the blockchain, and more. You’ll hear from marketers from some of the biggest brands and agencies including MintDropz, PlayEmber, Dentsu, and Skiff.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>In this new season, we’ll tackle the tough questions facing marketers today such as:</p>
 
 How do you advertise in the metaverse? 
 Is the timing right to jump in, or is it better to wait? 
 What should marketers ask when evaluating a metaverse strategy? 
 
<p>Listen to the trailer for Season 6 here:</p>

<p>The Brave Marketer podcast is hosted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnydvorin/">Donny Dvorin</a>, VP, Head of Sales at Brave Software—the makers of the privacy-respecting Web browser with a built-in ads platform that rewards users for their attention with the Basic Attention Token.

Mainnet Mock is a mirror of mainnet, and not a separate network, like testnets. Because it mimics mainnet exactly, it should reveal any possible issues before a true mainnet deployment.</p><p>The 0.3.3x upgrade is scheduled to be fully deployed to mainnet on December&nbsp;19th.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Findora/status/1598741101250502656?s=20&amp;t=VFLlgbMRMpRIiWW44k8jPA">Read More&nbsp;&gt;</a></p> We’re Hiring! <p>Findora is always looking for top-notch talent, whether developers, engineers, community managers, or marketers.

<p>Blockchain technology is relatively young. Bitcoin leveraged decentralised ledger technology back in 2008, and in the early years, only a few people were aware of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, many other projects have adopted this technology, with varying degrees of success. Often, projects don’t go past a proof of concept, and even if they do, the outcome might not be what the project’s proposers intended. It is safe to say that blockchain, as a technology, has not reached maturity.</p>



<p>There are multiple reasons why a blockchain project might fail, or yield a low return on investment (ROI). These reasons include, but are not limited to:</p>



  Attempting to apply blockchain to everything  Steep learning curve  Compliance pitfalls, including data regulations  Lack of vision  Focus on monetary profit, rather than addressing and solving a problem  Use of the wrong technology  



<p>This article explores the circumstances that often lead to blockchain projects having a low ROI, and how this can be overcome.</p>







 1. Attempting to apply blockchain to everything  



<p>Decentralised ledger technology does have the capacity to disrupt a fair amount of industries, and in fact, it has already done so, and will likely continue along this path of disruption and innovation for years to come.</p>



<p>But the problem lies in that blockchain, while extremely versatile, is not the right solution for everything. Fledgling entrepreneurs often use it as a buzzword and believe that blockchain will suit their projects, no matter what. Making this assumption without a proper assessment and due research is unwise, to say the least.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adopting blockchain technology is a decision not to be taken lightly, and so entrepreneurs, or any business considering the implementation of a decentralised ledger, should look inward and look for the answer to these questions:</p>



<p>Is the legacy system no longer fit for purpose? Has it become too antiquated or expensive to maintain or update? Does the company have a way to obtain reliable data that can be fed into the blockchain?</p>



<p>Even if the answers to these important questions suggest that blockchain technology might be a suitable solution, the implementation of a blockchain network is not for the short term. Businesses must carefully consider the long-term implications, in terms of scalability (will the system be able to scale and accommodate higher numbers of transactions), complexity (does the company have the expertise to implement and maintain the technology), and ongoing costs (more nodes, bandwidth, etc.).</p>



 2. Steep learning curve  



<p>Blockchain technology does require a certain level of expertise. A blockchain is not an off-the-shelf product. Often, they require practical knowledge and expertise in certain programming languages that are specific to a blockchain (Solidity for Ethereum is a prime example of this). While there are millions of software developers out there, only a limited amount have the right skills in blockchain code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to this, the implementation of a decentralised ledger requires expertise in cryptography, smart contract programming, and very importantly, a functioning governance system. The combination of all these factors means that creating and maintaining a thriving blockchain ecosystem does require a steep learning curve.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Compliance pitfalls, including data regulations 



<p>Regulatory compliance can be defined as the acceptance, understanding, and commitment to follow all state, federal, and international laws and regulations that might be applicable and relevant to a company’s operation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Blockchain compliance</a> is therefore a hugely important issue for any business. Adhering and complying with local legal frameworks and regulations helps protect the company’s resources, uphold its brand reputation, and ensure that the company can remain in operation across different markets.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has often found itself at odds with compliance guidelines, particularly in relation to privacy and data sharing, governance, and storage. The implementation of a solid governance framework is essential to the survival of a blockchain project.</p>



 4. Lack of vision  



<p>Entrepreneurs who decide to start a blockchain project just because it is fashionable or because they believe they can make a quick buck are probably doomed from the start. Blockchain is not a buzzword, nor is it a silver bullet that will magically make a product or project succeed. Establishing a thriving blockchain ecosystem is the result of a lot of work by a team of skilled professionals. Lacking a proper vision as to what the project or product should be, its real-world applicability, and the use case it fulfills is likely to lead to failure.</p>



 5. Focus on monetary profit, rather than addressing and solving a problem 



<p>Some entrepreneurs are out to make money, and though financial profit is of course necessary to stay in business, it should not be the primary objective. Projects that overemphasise the bottom line are not likely to be viable in the long term. A blockchain project must provide a real solution for a real problem, rather than manufacturing a non-existent problem to justify the use of a blockchain.</p>



 6. Use of the wrong technology 



<p>There are many blockchains out there: Ethereum, Bitcoin, Hyperledger, Corda, etc. Often, projects simply use the first one that comes to mind, which is usually Ethereum. Then the realisation sinks in that the gas fees can become incredibly expensive, which means that a business case becomes unreachable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, it is often difficult and costly to switch to another blockchain that facilitates a project’s needs better. And while tools such as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can make it easier to switch to another more suitable blockchain. Picking the right blockchain at the start, whether it’s a <a href="https://zaisan.io/private-public-blockchain/">public or private blockchain</a>, can save a lot of headaches.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Issues like lack of compliance or clear vision, technological challenges, or poor planning can lead to a low ROI, or scupper a blockchain project altogether. It is up to the project creators to take all these factors into account and ensure that the use of blockchain technology is both justified, and sustainable. Because after all, blockchain technology, while a very powerful and versatile tool, cannot function on its own. It requires technical expertise and the right leadership to become a success.</p>







 Key takeaways 



  Blockchain technology is not the answer to every single use case out there  Decentralised ledgers do have a steep learning curve, which might lead to low ROI  Using the wrong blockchain technology can have disastrous results  Legal departments must ensure that blockchain networks are compliant with data sharing and storage regulations  Blockchain projects require a clear vision of the objectives to accomplish  Monetary profit must be supported by the resolution of real-world problems  Projects must conduct careful research to ensure they choose the right blockchain technology for their use case

As regulations look to combine KYC and blockchain technology, this potential solution is being pushed to a high point. Though many projects have achieved privacy-preserving to some extent through different cutting edge technology solutions, they are still in early stages. This got people thinking and talking about whether privacy will be the next narrative of Web3. The Twitter Space invited speakers from Manta Network, PlatON, zCloak Network, and Oasis Network, and zCloak’s founder w3tester mainly talked about ZKP in terms of privacy-preserving technology and its advantages towards achieving the self-sovereignty of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Link for you to revisit: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1eaJbrDqqrQJX?s=20">https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1eaJbrDqqrQJX?s=20</a></p> Mirror World Twitter&nbsp;Space <p>On Nov 17, Mirror World gathered speakers from zCloak Network, SaaSGo, Ubiloan, and Motley Labs for a discussion space on the topic of “Better tools, Better Web 3 products.” With the past few months being a rough awakening for Web3 enthusiasts, this episode discussed the significance of SDKs to the Web3 environment and how projects can build and thrive together with product integrations. zCloak’s CMO Annabella attended as one of the speakers. She shared that user education is vital considering the differences in transition from Web2 to Web3, and developing tools for better accessibility takes time but is worth the&nbsp;price.</p><p>Link to the recording for you to listen to: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MYxNgeyVbzKw?s=20">https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MYxNgeyVbzKw?s=20</a></p> LegalDAO Twitter&nbsp;Space <p>On Nov. 21, LegalDAO hosted a Twitter Space about privacy and security in Web3. w3tester, the founder of zCloak Network attended as a speaker. Speakers from Oasis, zkSafe, and Glock Ventures talked about potential opportunities in the privacy track and the balance between data disclosure and user’s self-sovereignty. w3tester made his point on zCloak’s solution of VC with selective disclosure function respects user privacy and data sovereignty as well as supports organizations with a more convenient verification and validation process.</p><p>Links for you to revisit: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YpKkgMjPodKj?s=20">https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YpKkgMjPodKj?s=20</a></p> MetaBlox Panel Discussion <p>On Nov 25, MetaBlox invited speakers from Caldance, Memolabs, zCloak Network, and Arkreen Network to speak on the topic of “What is expected when telco technology meets BIot?”. zCloak’s CMO Annabella attended and shared her view on the meaning and value of combining blockchain and IoT, how to overcome incoming problems, and how zCloak’s privacy-preserving DID and VC solution can help solve some pain points regarding user experience in the Web3 industry.</p><p>Here’s the link to the recording: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1jMJgLMZnOWxL">https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1jMJgLMZnOWxL</a></p> LegalDAO Tencent&nbsp;Panel <p>On Nov 29, LegalDAO invited the founder of zCloak Network to their Chinese panel on Tencent meeting, on the topic of Web3 application and on-chain privacy protection. Along with speakers from different perspectives, w3tested discussed on points including how blockchain technology shapes “data sovereignty”, Web3 dark forest and how to break by privacy computing, how DApp analyzes and processes on-chain data, and the coexistence of Web3 and regulation.</p> Events  Halloween Quiz&nbsp;Event <p>As introduced in the last issue of our monthly update in October, zCloak invited everyone to join the special Halloween quiz event on Halloween night, Oct 31. The quiz lasted for a week and ended on Nov 7. A total of 66,326 enthusiastic community members participated in the event and dug into the quiz questions related to the 0x499 interview with zCloak’s founder about DID technology and utility. We are thrilled to conclude the event with 39,827 OATs issued and we are glad our community members enjoyed the quiz. We will continue to bring meaningful and beneficial events to our community as well as to the Web3&nbsp;world!</p> Ambassador Program <p>On Nov 15, zCloak Network announced the opening of its Ambassador Program 2.0. On top of a a great phase one of the program, the core team made changes to the program rules and guidelines after careful consideration, and are inviting some new blood to join and grow together. The application closed on Nov 25 with 371 amazing applications received by zCloak. Final decision for different roles including Moderator, Collaboration Representative, and Content Creator will be made in the following week. We look forward to working with our new ambassadors and to building and growing together!</p> World Cup zk-Guessing Event <p>On Dec 1, zCloak Network launched the world’s first zero-knowledge-based World Cup Guessing Event with some partner projects (including BuidlerDAO, Flock.io, Tusima, Mirror World, Moledao, SnapFingersDAO, Web3Go, LegalDAO, Macondo). Jointly, the projects call on Web3 football fans to actively participate in the event, where DID and zero-knowledge proof technology are used in the prediction process of the 2022 World Cup. In this event, users can prove whether their guess is correct (e.g. predicted team enters semi-finals), without telling anyone what their guess is. With this game event, users can get a taste of zCloak Network’s efforts on privacy protection.

<p>Starting today, Brave Search will feature privacy-preserving ads as part of a global beta program. Ads will give users the option to use our independent search engine with ads that don’t track them, or to sign up for ad-free paid search. As with other search engines, Brave Search ads are clearly labeled and are integrated into the search results page. However, Brave Search ads protect users’ data and anonymity, while supporting their access to independent and transparent search as a true alternative to Big Tech search engines.</p>
<p>Ads are a key part of search engines, helping to facilitate the free and open exchange of information on the Web, and to connect users to helpful products and services related to their search terms. Despite their usefulness, most search ads track users and violate their privacy. Brave Search ads are fundamentally different: They provide the same utility minus all the tracking and privacy invasions found in other search ads. They give users a chance to learn about new products and—soon—earn rewards for their attention to those ads.</p>
<p>Brave Search is built on a truly independent index of the Web (one of only a handful of search engines that can make that claim), and recently passed 20 million queries per day, growing faster than any search engine since Bing. Search ads allow Brave to maintain independence as it grows, and do so without giving in to Big Tech’s privacy invasions.</p>





    


    




 Privacy-first ads 
<p>By design, Brave Search ads are anonymous, clearly marked, and follow Brave’s commitment to putting users first, and to ethical and transparent advertising practices. Clicking on Brave Search ads is a fully private experience (unlike the ads on search engines like Google and Bing). Brave Search only uses your search query, country, and device type to show you ads, and does not keep any kind of profile of your searches.</p>

 Search Premium 
<p>For users that don’t want to see ads, Brave is also offering an ad-free experience: <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=search">Search Premium</a>. For $3 per month, Brave Search Premium users can continue to enjoy a completely ad-free Search experience, and directly support Brave’s mission to make the Web a more private place with independent search.</p>

 Beta phase and Brave Rewards 
<p>During this beta phase, Brave Search users will see text-based ads in search results. However, during the beta period, Brave users who have opted-in to Brave Private Ads and are using the latest version of Brave will not see Search ads, since these new ad units are not yet eligible for BAT earnings. We’re actively working to integrate Brave Rewards with Brave Search, and hope to make Search ads eligible for BAT earnings in the coming months.</p>
<p>Brave believes in the importance of independent, private Web search, and in putting users in charge of their online experience. Not using Brave Search? Try it now at search.brave.com, or <a href="https://search.brave.com/default">set it as your browser’s default search engine</a>.</p>
<p>If you’d like to advertise with Brave Search ads, please reach out to <a href="mailto:sales@brave.com">sales@brave.com</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>tl;dr —&nbsp;Today Brave News introduced integrated RSS subscriptions, locally personalized suggestions, new sources and content channels powered by Brave Search, and other improvements. New supported regions include Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Spain, and the UK.</p>
<p>Big Tech controls the news ecosystem through centralized, Web 2.0-style news aggregation. But this control is waning, particularly as distributed models gain popularity. In many ways, RSS feeds and RSS readers (though not new) are an early instance of Web3-style decentralization. Our hope is that Brave News will make it obvious that a decentralized news ecosystem is far better for users and publishers than what Big Tech offers today.</p>
<p>Brave offers the capabilities users want in a news experience (such as content discovery, feed subscriptions, and personalized suggestions) directly in the browser. There’s no need to rely on centralized servers because all these Brave News features take place solely on your device. This update sets the stage for giving users more control over their news feed and relationships with publishers.</p>
<p>Today’s browser release (desktop version 1.46) includes several Brave News improvements that bring us closer to this vision of a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving news ecosystem, including:</p>
 
 A Follow button in the browser for adding a site’s feed to Brave News 
 New content Channels powered by Brave Search 
 Personalized Suggestions made locally on your device 
 Improved Source Management 
 Availability in new regions including Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Spain, and the UK 
 





    


    




 Privacy-preserving personalization 
<p>Brave News can also use your browser history to personalize the content in your feed. But unlike other browser feeds (such as Google News), Brave’s content personalization happens exclusively in the browser, and none of your browsing data ever leaves your device.</p>
<p>Brave News ranks content you follow highest in your feed, and helps you discover new sources to Follow based on your browsing history and sources you already Follow. Brave identifies sources that are similar to each other and recommends suggestions privately in Settings, where you can choose to Follow and add them to your feed.</p>
<p>Note: Brave’s suggestions service is <a href="https://github.com/brave/source-suggestions">published as an open source project</a> if you want to learn more about how it works.</p>

 Channels and new settings options 
<p>Many users have requested more controls for customizing Brave News. Today’s update improves the way users Follow and Unfollow sources, and we’ve introduced “channels” which are topics or areas of coverage such as Crypto News, Music, and the new Gaming channel. If you’re already a Brave News user, any customizations you’ve made in the previous version of Brave News will automatically appear in the new version, and you’ll also find a much simpler interface for managing sources.</p>

 Brave News around the world 
<p>Brave News is also expanding internationally thanks to Brave Search. By querying Brave Search for the most popular content sources around the world and identifying publishers with public RSS feeds, Brave News now supports language- and region-specific content. In addition to coverage in Japan and the US, new regions now include English for Canada and the UK; Spanish for both Mexico and Spain; and Portuguese for users in Brazil. More languages and regions will be added over the coming months.</p>

 Coming soon: Easily add content to your Brave News Feed 
<p>As you browse publishers’ websites in the Brave browser, you’ll find a new, one-click Follow button. The button is located in the browser address bar and will appear any time you visit a site that provides an RSS feed. Click Follow, and content from that publisher will then appear in Brave News automatically, updating each time your browser fetches the feed.</p>
<p>Note: The new Follow button in the browser address bar will be released later this month. Today’s release is available for desktop users, and iOS will be updated with the new Brave News features in its upcoming 1.46 version. Android will be updated with the new Brave News features soon thereafter.</p>

 What’s next for Brave News 
<p>Many users have requested alternative views of their Brave News feed, such as a more traditional, inbox-style RSS news reader, which we plan to work on soon. We also plan to introduce an ad-free version of Brave News, mobile alerts, cross-platform sync, more import/export options, and some useful integrations with other Brave products and features.</p>
<p>To give Brave News a try and enjoy news and content directly from your browser, simply open a new tab in the Brave browser, and scroll to get started. If you’re not using Brave yet, you can download it now at <a>brave.com/download</a>.</p>

 Today, we’re excited to share the next phase in our journey: <a href="http://privy.io">Privy&nbsp;Auth</a>. <blockquote>Privy Auth is a simple library to easily onboard all your users to web3, regardless of whether they already have a wallet, across mobile and&nbsp;desktop.</blockquote><p><a href="http://privy.io">Privy</a> exists to help developers craft delightful products and keep users in control of their assets and data across apps. Since our launch, we’ve been hard at work helping amazing teams like those at <a href="https://www.station.express/">Station</a> and <a href="https://www.violet.co/">Violet</a> manage users’ off-chain data and build user-respecting products. Privy Auth is the next step in this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Our work has inexorably led us here. First, as a recurring request from our customers who already use Privy to secure user emails, social accounts, phone numbers, etc. Second, through a core product requirement: in order to enable users to control data permissions across apps, Privy must be able to authenticate users directly.</p><p>User journeys in Web3 have evolved from discrete, one-time events — like signing a transaction — to continuous interactions with users, involving both on- and off-chain data. For users, this means better products, but it also means developers have to handle much more complexity. This complexity starts at login: wallet connectors are clunky, onboarding flows are confusing to users, and the problem gets worse as the number of chains and wallets grows. To bring web3 mainstream, we have to reshape user onboarding.</p> Enter Privy&nbsp;Auth <p>Privy Auth is a simple library to easily onboard all your users to web3, regardless of whether they already have a wallet, across mobile and&nbsp;desktop.</p><p>We are building Privy Auth around 3 principles:</p>  Crypto for all — Web3 must be built for newcomers and experts alike. The best products will bridge the right UX from web2 and web3 to lower the barrier to entry. This means progressive user onboarding, gradually engaging users as they progress through your app, from first wallet connection to multi-wallet account creation.  User control — All products will involve on- and off-chain data. The best will rely on data portability from app to app to unlock new experiences.This means it must be easy for users to decide what they share with&nbsp;whom.  Self-custody — Self-custody is an essential part of web3. Popular apps will serve as bridges into self-custody, enabling people to take on more control over their assets and data if they so&nbsp;choose.  <p>Privy Auth is live with customers today as part of our early release. It integrates with your favorite libraries like ethers and wagmi; it’s easy to migrate from RainbowKit, Onboard.js or any other wallet connector or auth&nbsp;library.</p><p>Out of the box, Privy Auth gives&nbsp;you</p>  Simple onboarding for all users, with or without wallets, using email and social accounts.  Reliable wallet connectors, optimized for desktop and mobile so you can stop worrying about users getting lost on the way to your&nbsp;app.  A unified user abstraction so you can easily manage all users. Connected, authenticated, multi-wallet, we support all of your&nbsp;users.  <p>If you’re building in web3 and want to delight your users from the first interaction, <a href="https://50fzxaracbi.typeform.com/to/v5gtHb74">we’d love to talk</a>. With just a few lines of code, you can securely onboard all users, whether they have a wallet or not, and get back to focusing on your core&nbsp;product.</p><p>We have a lot more coming and we can’t wait to share more with you soon. Web3 gives us the opportunity to reinvent the data paradigms that have failed us over the last 30 years and give users back control over their data online. This starts at&nbsp;login().</p><p>Team Privy</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/announcing-privy-auth-4754be04c515">Announcing Privy Auth!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Press release: Nym Advisor, Andrés Arauz denounces FATF design guidance on CBDCs and leads urgent call for a more democratic process <p>International standardization body ISO/TC68 better positioned to lead on standards of CBDCs for the benefit of global&nbsp;society</p><p>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 30 November 2022 — Today, Nym advisor Andrés Arauz, former director of Ecuador’s central bank and 2021 presidential candidate, called for the design of CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) to be moved to a more open, democratic, and privacy-respecting standards process at the United Nations Internet Governance Forum&nbsp;(IGF).</p><p>Arauz stated his immediate intention to join the already existing <a href="https://committee.iso.org/home/tc68">International Standards Organisation TC68</a>/AG5 Working Group on central bank digital currencies where governments from the Global South are currently absent. Even cryptocurrency advocates can take an active role, as they can join through their national standard setting bodies as&nbsp;members.</p><p>This is in response to the increasing trend of countries declaring that privacy protection will not be included in the design of CBDCs as <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Virtual-Assets-FATF-Report-G20-So-Called-Stablecoins.pdf">recommended </a>by <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/">FATF</a> (Financial Action Task Force) under the guise of anti-money laundering. The FATF is completely opaque, dominated <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/how-little-known-g7-task-force-unwittingly-helps-governments-target-critics-2021-08-05/">by geopolitics</a>, and is heavily influenced by the <a href="https://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/">Wolfsberg Group</a>, a club of the largest US and European&nbsp;banks.</p><p>In the interest of social good, guidance from a standards body that has the responsibility to include any nation state wanting to participate, will be less asymmetric to everyone who will be impacted by CBDCs. Deeper involvement in ISO/TC 68 will allow all relevant stakeholders, including both the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the newer generation of privacy-focussed Web3 experts, to set innovative technical standards for CBDCs and decentralized alternatives, providing financial freedom to those who need it while mitigating the risk of illegal activities.</p><p>“CBDCs will be legal tender and need democratic safeguards that guarantee the human right to privacy, their standards should not be defined by the FATF -an unaccountable, ineffective and opaque body-. Stakeholders from civil society and alternative finance should get involved to embed these human rights in the CBDC hardware and software standards,” Arauz&nbsp;said.</p><p>This was announced alongside Nym CEO Harry Halpin and Open Knowledge Foundation CEO Renata Avila at the <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022">United Nations Internet Governance Forum (IGF)</a> 2022 in Ethiopia, during <a href="https://intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-town-hall-99-the-data-of-money-blockchains-andor-surveillance">Town Hall #99 The Data of Money: Blockchains and/or Surveillance</a>.</p><p>Halpin added: “CBDCs could easily become tools of mass surveillance and control to repress political dissidents and entire nations. It’s imperative that the cryptocurrency industry get involved in this discussion over CBDC standards at the highest level, by teaming up with countries from the Global South that need to throw off the yoke of colonial banking systems to serve their own people rather than the imperialist overlords of the&nbsp;FATF.”</p><p>The IGF session focused on the current state of financial surveillance and new routes to privacy-preserving CDBCs and financial autonomy led by the global south. CBDC standards should allow both nation-states and non-nation state actors to interoperate and include privacy by design, which has been disingenuously dismissed under the guise of money laundering concerns even though privacy will be needed for national security purposes and to respect basic rights. Violations of an individual’s privacy rights through mass financial surveillance should be taken seriously and respected.</p><p>Watch the livestream: <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-live">https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-live</a></p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance. More: <a href="https://nymtech.net">https://nymtech.net</a></p><p>About Andrés&nbsp;Arauz:</p><p>Arauz has been a prominent figure in leading the drive on technological and monetary disintermediation. Motivated to reduce the bureaucratic need for the central bank to hold and distribute large amounts of physical dollars, he was one of the first to experiment with CBDCs, piloting Dinero Electrónico as then-Director of Ecuador’s central bank. Arauz is a force driving the need for open standards for CBDCs and global payments. Contrary to most in government, he is a strong advocate for the benefits of free and open source software. As Minister of Knowledge and Human Talent, he transitioned the Ecuadorian ministry’s internal systems from closed software systems.

<p>Dune Analytics is a platform aggregating blockchain data, making data easier to query and understand for the larger public. Over the past years, Dune has become the go-to tool for blockchain analytics, as well as the home of a community of dune wizards numbering in the thousands, with its fundraising at a 1 Billion valuation as a testament to the growth of the project over the past 4 years.</p><p>In today's episode, we are joined by the project's co-founder, Fredrik Haga. We discuss the products Dune Analytics offers, why it's hard to aggregate data that in principle is public, and how a community of data wizards was built in a grassroots effort. We also chatted about product focus and vision for the future, as well as useful lessons for bootstrapping a project on a shoestring budget.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The beginning of Dune  The challenges and difficulties in building a blockchain data product.  Technical improvements on Dune V2  Supporting for non-evm chains  Business models, userbases, and valuations  Interesting use cases on Dune  Community Building  The focus on product experience and next steps for the project  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://dune.com/community">Dune Analytics's website</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/duneanalytics">Dune Analytics Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/hagaetc">Fredrik Haga's twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

Note that you will make a selective disclosure of your credential — you only share your discord user name and the verification code (your credential hash will be recorded) with zCloak for membership verification, but keep your guessing secret to yourself.</p><blockquote>Phase II — Zero-Knowledge Proof for Semi-Finals</blockquote><p>Dec. 12 — Dec.&nbsp;16</p><p>At this phase, you can prove whether your guess reaches the Semi-Finals without revealing your guess to anyone by use of zero-knowledge proof. Participants who guess correctly will have the chance to win an additional prize ($1,000 pool for 20 winners).</p><blockquote>Phase III — Who is the champion?</blockquote><p>Dec. 18 — Dec.&nbsp;20</p><p>At this phase, you can announce your guess and zCloak verifier will verify if it is the champion. The eventual winner has the chance to win an additional prize ($1,000 pool and 5 whitelists for 5 winners).</p><blockquote>Phase IV — Claim your&nbsp;prizes</blockquote><p>Dec. 21</p><p>On this day, we will reveal how to claim your rewards. Please keep your DID mnemonics and your backup DID JSON file safe to collect the&nbsp;rewards.</p> Guide — Phase&nbsp;I  1. Create your zCloak&nbsp;Account <p>Click this link: <a href="https://cred.zkid.app/#/account?redirect=claimer">https://cred.zkid.app/#/account?redirect=claimer</a></p> 1.1 Click ‘Create account’ to get your first zkID&nbsp;account <p>Note: All users will need to create a new account as we have adopted an updated version of DID protocol.</p> 1.2 Create&nbsp;Password <p>All your data is encrypted by this password. Please keep your password&nbsp;safe.</p> 1.3 Generate&nbsp;mnemonic <p>The mnemonic is the last approach to restore your DID account. Please keep it in a safe&nbsp;place.</p> 1.4 DID key backup JSON&nbsp;file <p>After confirmation, a DID backup JSON file will be downloaded to your computer. You can restore your DID account in another browser with your password and this DID backup JSON file (or with your mnemonics). Keep the file&nbsp;safe.</p> 2. Make the guessing with verifiable credential <p>After creating your account, please click this link to enter our Credential Platform: <a href="https://cred.zkid.app">https://cred.zkid.app</a></p> 2.1 Switch your&nbsp;role <p>Now your role is claimer, who is the owner of the Verifiable Credential (VC). To issue a VC that contains your guessing of the champion, you need to switch your role to ‘Attester’, who can attest or issue a VC to others or to him/herself.</p><p>Click this button to switch your role from claimer to attester.</p> 2.2 Issue <p>Click ‘Issue’ of the menu and ‘Issue’ of the WCG Ctype to issue the guessing&nbsp;VC.</p><p>Click ‘Issue to myself’ to automatically fill in your own&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Note: If you encounter ‘The DID Document not found’, please wait a moment and refresh the page again since it takes some time to get your identity on the blockchain.</p> 2.3 Finish your identity verification <p>Join our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/rRnGDBJ8N6">https://discord.gg/rRnGDBJ8N6</a>) and get your verification code from the ‘zkid-verify’ channel.</p><p>Type your whole Discord ID and Verification Code. Then you can choose your guess of the champion&nbsp;team.</p> 2.4 Submit <p>After submitting, you can see a notification as&nbsp;follows:</p> 3. Verify your VC to record your participation <p>Congratulations! Now you have finished guessing and got a Verifiable Credential to prove&nbsp;it!</p><p>To ensure every DID only chooses one team and the guessing is done before the deadline, you should share your credential hash and some verification information with zCloak verifier. Please note this is just for data commitment purpose. Your guessed team is a&nbsp;secret.</p> 3.1 Switch your&nbsp;role <p>In order to view and manage your credentials, you should switch your role to ‘Claimer’.</p> 3.2 Download and store your&nbsp;VC <p>Now you can view your VC. Please note that your VC data is saved in your browser cache. zCloak doesn’t save any of your VC data. You can download the VC as a json file and keep it in a safe&nbsp;place.</p><p>If you use other browsers or devices, you can import this VC file. If you lose your VC file, NOBODY can recover it for you. This is part of your responsibility in order to control your own&nbsp;data.</p> 3.3 Share your VC information <p>At this step, please share the Discord UserName and Verification Code from your VC. We only record the first share. Make sure you only share these two fields or you will be disqualified from the&nbsp;event.</p><p>The Receiver DID&nbsp;is:</p><p>did:zk:0x0A2F3464C592279A0dF3aFA27e5b05b0978923bA</p><p>All information ticked will be sent to us. To avoid disclosing your guess, please DO NOT tick ‘Champion Team’. Otherwise, you will be DISQUALIFIED.</p> 3.4 View the&nbsp;feedback <p>Congratulations! After getting the feedback in the ‘Notifications’, you have finished all the tasks in phase&nbsp;I.</p> 3.5 Retweet your&nbsp;VC <p>Now you can Reweet your VC to your friends as follows. Thank you for participating in this event! Please wait for our guidelines for the next&nbsp;phases.</p><p>Notes on the technical ingredients: the DID method — <a href="https://github.com/zCloak-Network/zk-did-method-specs">the “zk” method</a> — used in this event is implemented by zCloak Network and registered in the W3C. The zero-knowledge proof computation is based on the <a href="https://github.com/maticnetwork/miden">Polygon Miden VM</a> in the zkID wallet. User DID documents (not credential) are stored in <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>. zCloak Network will compose a separate article to explain the cryptographic elements used in this&nbsp;event.</p> About zCloak&nbsp;Network <p>zCloak Network is a privacy-first DID and verifiable computation infrastructure. It aims to deliver the Web3 dream of Self-Sovereignty by moving both the storage and the computation of user data into user device from centralized servers. The integrity of user computation is proven by a STARK-based ZK-VM in a browser extension. zCloak’s W3C compatible DID system can mirror real-world legal status and reputation in DeSoc. With zCloak Network, people can use their real-world data for e.g. DeFi, Identity, Biometric applications without disclosing their privacy. zCloak Network is chain-agnostic — its identity and ZKP service can be served for most public blockchains.</p><p>Website: <a href="https://zcloak.network/#/">https://zcloak.network/#/</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/zCloakNetwork">https://twitter.com/zCloakNetwork</a></p><p>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/9RFhqVPGkf">https://discord.gg/9RFhqVPGkf</a></p> Terms &amp; Conditions: <p>zCloak Network reserves the right to cancel or amend any Activity, Activity Rules, or Details at our sole discretion.</p><p>This campaign is open internationally, but restrictions due to compliance regulations for different jurisdictions apply.

<p>NYM token is now integrated into BNB wallets by&nbsp;default</p><p>We are pleased to announce that Nym has made a bridge to the <a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en">BNB Chain</a> thanks to <a href="https://celer.network">Celer</a>! The NYM utility token is now available as a BEP-20 token. What does this mean? It means that real $NYM can be used on BNB Chain, opening a pathway to privacy for the BNB ecosystem while keeping users SAFU from the many scams involving fake $NYM on BNB Chain. From now on, <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0xdd2612c292431aaa727fe24d1a8afbe4928bbc55">0xDD2612c292431aaa727fE24d1a8AfBE4928Bbc55</a> is the only valid NYM token address on BNB&nbsp;Chain!</p><p>Originally initiated by <a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Binance</a> and now a community-driven, permissionless and decentralised ecosystem, BNB Chain is the world’s largest smart-contract blockchain in terms of transaction volume and daily active users as of October&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The NYM token is the utility token of the Nym mixnet — a powerful privacy system that protects network layer communications from traffic analysis, metadata and IP surveillance. By using the mixnet, your communications will be protected from apps and wallets that are gathering your IP addresses as well as observers watching the whole&nbsp;network.</p><p>Holders of NYM (ERC-20) tokens can use <a href="https://cbridge.celer.network/1/56/NYM">cBridge</a> to bridge their NYM tokens from Ethereum to the BNB chain and back. This means that native NYM (Cosmos) tokens are now accessible for the BNB ecosystem if two bridges are used (cbridge and GravityBridge), enabling people to bond and run mixnodes, delegate stake in the mixnet and contribute to operating the privacy&nbsp;system.</p><p>How does the bridge&nbsp;work?</p><p>cBridge uses a lock-and-mint model, creating a mapped version of the NYM token on the BNB&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>When a person transfers the token from Ethereum to BNB chain, the $NYM (ERC20) will be locked on Ethereum and an equal number of $NYM (BEP20) will be minted in a 1:1 pegged ratio and sent to you on the BNB Chain, maintaining stable supply across&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Conversely, when a person transfers from the BNB chain back to Ethereum, the $NYM (BEP20) will be burned on the BNB chain and an equal number of $NYM (ERC20) will be sent back to you on Ethereum.</p><p>You will have to pay a bridge fee which consists of a ‘base fee’ and ‘protocol fee’. The ‘base fee’ covers the gas fee on the destination chain, in the form of the $NYM in that chain’s format. The ‘protocol fee’ is paid as incentives to the cBridge LPs, validators and stakers, ranging from 0–0.5% of total transfer amount. Overall, the bridge is very cheap and&nbsp;fast!</p><p>How to use the&nbsp;bridge</p>  Go to <a href="https://cbridge.celer.network/1/56/NYM">https://cbridge.celer.network/1/56/NYM</a> and connect to Metamask Ethereum&nbsp;Mainnet  Choose NYM token from the token&nbsp;list  Input the amount of NYM tokens you wish to bridge to BNB&nbsp;Chain  <p>4. After inputting the amount of NYM tokens, you can see the exact fees that you will be charged underneath and the estimated time of&nbsp;arrival.</p><p>5. After the transaction has been submitted on chain, the top right will show if the transaction is pending or completed. You can also find the transaction details on etherscan or&nbsp;bsccan.</p><p>6. The switch from Ethereum Mainnet to BNB Chain on Metamask. If you have not already added BNB Chain, use the configuration information below: Mainnet (this is probably the one you are looking&nbsp;for)</p>  Network Name: BNB&nbsp;Chain  New RPC URL: <a href="https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/">https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/</a>  ChainID: 56  Symbol: BNB  Block Explorer URL: <a href="https://bscscan.com">https://bscscan.com</a>  <p>7. Import BEP20 version of NYM token in your Metamask wallet: 0xDD2612c292431aaa727fE24d1a8AfBE4928Bbc55, then you should be able to see the amount of NYM tokens appear your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>NOTE: <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0xdd2612c292431aaa727fe24d1a8afbe4928bbc55">0xDD2612c292431aaa727fE24d1a8AfBE4928Bbc55</a> is the only valid NYM token address on BNB Chain, beware of&nbsp;scams!</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym.

<p>Game of Chains&nbsp;✨</p> Dear Cosmonauts! <p>Phase 2 officially ended on November 25, 2022! We hit a number of important milestones we are so excited to share! Buckle&nbsp;up:</p> HIGHLIGHTS <p>Game of Chains validators launched three new consumer chains, giving them a feel for the governance process and the DevOps that will be required to launch real consumer chains in production. These 3 consumer chains&nbsp;include:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022/gopher">Gopher</a> — This is a consumer chain built by Hypha to help test the Go relayer with Interchain Security.</p><p>Neutron — This consumer chain will run in production come Interchain Security launch! They’ve been building their permissionless smart contract development platform for the past few months. Check out their announcement on launching Game of Chains&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Neutron_org/status/1595090867949563904">here</a>!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022/hero">Hero</a> — This is the placeholder name for the Generic Asset Issuance Chain which is set to issue USDC come Interchain Security launch. Big shoutout to the StrangeLove team for developing Hero and putting in the work to get the Generic Asset Issuance chain to&nbsp;launch!</p><p>Throughout this process, validators voted on proposals, started up the consumer chains, set up relayers, and worked to ensure that their nodes were adequately configured to minimize downtime. Validators also ran through the motions of removing Apollo through a governance proposal, which was started in Phase&nbsp;1.</p> COMMUNITY <p>Validators and the broader Cosmos community have been actively participating in public discussions on Interchain Security including thoughts on ICS risks, validator operational overhead, auditing binaries, the role of testnets in ICS, and more! Check out this great Q&amp;A discussion hosted by Citizen Cosmos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXMoF18bckU">here</a>.</p> PHASE 3 HAS&nbsp;STARTED <p>We are already in the beginning stages of Phase 3 where validators will continue to run consumer chains and go through the process of starting and stopping consumer chains. Hypha has redistributed voting power so that the testnet coordinators no longer have majority control of the network. This will force validators to play a more active role in governance and keep everyone on their toes to ensure that the testnet keeps&nbsp;running!</p><p>In this phase, we are asking validators to propose new chains and vote on them. Those following along can keep track of which chains have been proposed <a href="https://testnet.ping.pub/provider/gov">here</a>. We already have Duality about to be onboarded as their governance proposal went live late Friday&nbsp;evening!</p>Shoutout to Dan B from Strangelove for the meme!&nbsp;😁 SCORING <p>We are keeping score of where validators are in the leaderboard on <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022#scoreboard">interchainsecurity.dev</a>. Thank you to everyone who has submitted evidence of their task completion. If you haven’t please make sure to do so to be eligible for a prize! Please note that tallying takes time and we’re trying to update the leaderboard once a week so the leaderboard won’t always have a full picture of validators standing in Game of&nbsp;Chains.</p><p>MASSIVE thank you to everyone for participating in Phase 2. Looking forward to seeing the validators become more self-sufficient in Phase 3and all of the new chains that will be proposed!</p><p>About the Author:<br>Jelena Djuric works at <a href="https://informal.systems/about">Informal Systems</a> as product Marketing Manager.<br>Jelena is on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Gnomeskiiihttps://twitter.com/jelenaaa____">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/phase-2-update-f93b07bc162f">PHASE 2 Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP). </p>



<p>Four of the current ZCG committee members’ terms expire at the end of December, so we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in December. </p>



 How to Stand for Election to ZCG 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">governance zcg-elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining their priorities and vision for Zcash. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly as replies to their respective posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on 12th December 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>During the week commencing 12th December, the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> to select four candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2023.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The four candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2023. Committee members may stand for re-election at the end of their term.</p>



<p>Prospective candidates should familiarize themselves with the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;Hudson Jameson’s decision to step down from the committee in <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/hudson-jameson-leaving-zcg/41941">June 2022</a>  triggered an election resulting in the appointment of Cody Burns, whose term will expire in June 2023. The other four committee members’ terms are expiring at the end of December 2022. </p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks. </p>



<p>From January, members will receive a stipend of $1,650 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC).&nbsp;</p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>To avoid conflicts of interest, the following policy applies to the ZCG Committee: </p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members will be required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to this topic on the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

<p>Brave’s native crypto wallet now features integrations from 1inch, Allbridge, AutoFarm, Based, Cardinal, Coral Cube, DARA, EYWA, Guild, Hyperspace, Matrica, Morpho, Tectonic, Plaid, and Quest3.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Brave continues to expand its Wallet Partner program with the addition of 15 new DApps in November. Since June, over 75 projects have integrated Brave Wallet in their Web3-enabled applications. While we encourage outreach and partnership with the growing ecosystem of DApp builders, developers looking to add Brave Wallet to their DApps independently can use our <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">Brave Wallet documentation</a> for DIY integration in just a few steps.</p>
<p>To learn more about our previous Wallet partners, read our past announcements from <a>June</a>, <a>July</a>, <a>August</a>, <a>September</a>, and <a>October</a>. Here are the partners that joined in November:</p>

 1inch 
<p><a href="https://1inch.io/">The 1inch Network</a> is a collection of DeFi products made for safe, lucrative, and fast operations in DeFi. Their lead product is a DEX aggregator that finds the best rate on swaps across 300 liquidity sources on multiple blockchains. The 1inch DEX aggregator has reached more than 3.7 million unique wallets, and $254 billion in overall transaction volume to date. Alongside the aggregation protocol, the 1inch core contributors’ team keeps developing their own liquidity protocol, limit order protocol, and a multichain mobile wallet.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be integrated with Brave Wallet,” says Sergej Kunz, the 1inch Network co-founder. “This is an important step towards growing out of the DeFi space and bringing new users to Web3 products.”</p>

 Allbridge 
<p><a href="https://allbridge.io/">Allbridge Core</a> enables the transfer of value between blockchains by offering cross-chain swaps of native stablecoins. Being messaging protocol agnostic, Allbridge Core connects a variety of EVM and non-EVM networks.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly excited to join Brave’s Wallet Partner program. This enables us to provide cross-chain services to the widespread Brave community. Integrating Brave Wallet with Allbridge Core paves the way to more accessible stable swaps in the DeFi space,” said Andriy Velykyy, co-founder and CEO of Allbridge.</p>

 Autofarm 
<p><a href="https://autofarm.network/">Autofarm</a> is a multichain yield optimizer that enables users to get returns from yield farming pools by simply staking in Autofarm vaults. Vaults auto-compound yields at optimal intervals, while pooling gas costs through battle-tested smart contract code and best-in-class yield optimization strategies. AutoSwap also acts as a DEX aggregator which splits trades across multiple DEXs to ensure the best prices and lowest slippage possible, with no extra fees at all.</p>
<p>“As a leading yield optimizer in the DeFi scene, we are happy to partner with Brave. By implementing support for Brave Wallet, we have opened access to our safe and user-friendly DeFi experience for millions of Brave browser users,” said Luuk, Business Development at AutoFarm.</p>

 Based 
<p><a href="https://getbased.com/">Based</a> is a social messaging platform built around NFTs. They seek to enable individuals to create and experience more meaningful interactions around their NFT networks and content, with less effort, on one native platform.</p>

 Cardinal 
<p><a href="https://www.cardinal.so/">Cardinal</a> is a Solana protocol that enables the conditional ownership of NFTs. It’s powering the future of NFT utility through rentals, subscriptions, staking, tickets, royalty enforcement, and more.</p>
<p>“Innovating with the Brave team was exciting on many levels. We had a chance to work with a group who were passionate about making a difference in the NFT landscape and tackle the challenge of enforcing royalties. From a custom minting experience using BAT token, to delivering world class art, the <a>Brave launch</a> was exactly what the space needed,” said Manny Lora, Head of Partnerships at Cardinal.</p>

 Coral Cube 
<p><a href="https://coralcube.io/">Coral Cube</a> is a best in class NFT aggregator, marketplace, and launchpad. Since inception in early 2022, the team has been dedicated to serving creators and collectors across NFT use cases, known for its ability to address customer needs throughout the value chain.</p>
<p>“It’s a tremendous honor to partner with a Web3 mainstay like Brave. At Coral Cube, we’ve admired Brave’s innovative practices and sustainable business model, a pioneer for delivering user value. We’re excited to deepen our partnership, help bootstrap Brave’s NFT initiatives and support their growing team,” said Meisam Vosoughpour, CEO at Coral Cube.</p>

 EYWA 
<p><a href="https://eywa.fi">EYWA</a> is a decentralized cross-chain interoperability protocol that allows cheap transfers between asset types within any connected chain. EYWA helps projects become cross-chain and offers ultimate transaction simplicity for users. The EYWA ecosystem includes cross-chain products such as Token Bridge, Data Protocol, DEX, Assets, Liquidity Aggregator, and Liquidity Protocol.</p>
<p>“Our main idea is decentralization. We believe that partnering with Brave will accelerate the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies in the global community. Brave is one of today’s best Web3 projects with a huge audience who has access to cryptocurrency benefits through their wallet and browser. We will help bring in additional features such as gasless transactions, and fast and convenient cross-chain exchanges. We believe that society is ready for decentralized and reliable finance,” said Boris Povar, CEO at EYWA.</p>

 Guild 
<p><a href="https://guild.xyz/">Guild.xyz</a> is the infrastructure for platformless access management. It exists to help you manage communities, and create portable memberships and social structures around on- and off-chain requirements—and to build unique user journeys across applications.</p>
<p>“When users connect their wallets to guild.xyz, Brave is the default wallet Guild offers at login if they are not using other extensions. This makes the user experience much smoother, familiar, and personalized for our members,” said Raz, Founder at guild.xyz.</p>

 Hyperspace 
<p><a href="http://hyperspace.xyz">Hyperspace.xyz</a> is the most liquid NFT marketplace and aggregator on Solana helping NFT traders save money buying and selling NFTs across over 20 different sources. Hyperspace also provides infrastructure to empower creators and developers to build native web3 experiences via NFT APIs. Their mission is to enable the future of NFT trading and commerce.</p>
<p>“We are proud to partner with Brave wallet to enable users to use a secure wallet experience. With so many users using the Brave browser and BAT, we are excited to integrate more deeply into the Brave ecosystem,” said Kamil, Co-founder at Hyperspace.</p>

 Matrica 
<p><a href="https://matrica.io/">Matrica Labs</a> focuses on providing critical infrastructure within the blockchain ecosystem. As the premier gating and identity-provider in Web3, Matrica powers nearly 2,000 communities with over 300,000 users. Serving as an all-in-one intuitive experience with a powerful and extensive suite of services, Matrica provides a platform that empowers individuals, communities, businesses, marketplaces, and more.</p>
<p>“As a daily Brave browser user, utilizing Brave Wallet was a no-brainer. The experience has been seamless and it’s great knowing you’re receiving the same emphasis on security and privacy that Brave is all about,” said Joseph, COO at Matrica Labs.</p>

 Morpho 
<p>The <a href="https://www.morpho.xyz/">Morpho</a> protocol is a lending pool optimizer on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s a peer-to-peer layer on top of lending pools like Compound and Aave. Rates are seamlessly improved for suppliers and borrowers while preserving the same liquidity and risk parameters. The core use cases are lending and borrowing assets and earning interest. Currently, the protocol deals with ~$300 million in total liquidity.</p>
<p>“Thanks to Blocknative, the integration of Brave Wallet in our DApp was almost seamless,” said Tom, DevRel at Morpho Labs.</p>

 Tectonic 
<p><a href="https://tectonic.finance/">Tectonic</a> is the leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol and money market on <a href="https://cronos.org/">Cronos</a>, the first EVM-compatible chain built on Cosmos in partnership with Crypto.com.

This product supports more than 300 self-custody wallets through one single integration, making it a one-stop solution for developers who want to be able to support as many wallets as possible with minimal technical development needed.</p>
<p>“We viewed fully integrating Brave Wallet into Plaid Wallet Onboard as an important priority for crypto consumers and our developers. It is one of the top wallets on desktop and mobile, and we want to make sure these consumers can quickly find and connect Brave whenever they are connecting,” said Clay Allsopp, Head of Crypto at Plaid.</p>

     ZenCon0 – Our first-ever ecosystem summit has wrapped up! This inaugural event brought together some of the greatest minds in crypto to envision our future.  
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23900"></a></p>
<p>Celebrating the growth and accomplishments of our project and ecosystem with partners and supporters was a dream come true for us. Hosted by our sister company Horizen Labs, we welcomed partners, advisors, and community members that joined us at our first ecosystem summit to celebrate our achievements and share ideas for growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two-day conference was filled with spotlights, panels, and break-out sessions ranging from <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">Metaverse on the Horizen</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/zXhR5u3RLhs">Web3 &amp; Sports</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/wGaZRj5VOCg">The Power of Community</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/3nnRnbst7A4">Zen OG stories</a>, and more!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23901"></a></p>
 Welcoming Our Friends 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23902"></a></p>
<p>We were thrilled to see many of our partners, team members, and long-time community members on stage at this event. Each panel and discussion was fantastic, but some of our favorite highlights included the <a href="https://youtu.be/3nnRnbst7A4">Zen OG panel with Horizen co-founder Rolf Versluis</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXhR5u3RLhs&amp;t=1s">the Web3 Sports fireside chat with Andrea Radrizzani of Leeds United</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/prLOm0JgLwY">the Horizen EVM marketplace presentation and demo with Sebastian Gronewald of Create3 Labs</a>. We were also able to capture footage of the event setup, which you can <a href="https://youtu.be/0jnOyIX-z1Y">check out on YouTube</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23903"></a></p>
 The BizTalks 
<p>We heard many interesting talks in the areas of finance and investing, such as “<a href="https://youtu.be/54NnrY2XmN8">Growing the Ecosystem Through Investments and Introducing HL Builders</a>,” <a href="https://youtu.be/lI_l-hRHzs8">“Cryptoeconomics trends”</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/j2XjwfOq8kU">Venture Now – The Investor Perspective</a>, and more! </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23904"></a></p>
<p>The panel <a href="https://youtu.be/ZUlGgTdE7V0">“Metaverse Trends”</a> gave attendees an intriguing look into what trends thought leaders in the space are looking at currently and where they think they will head in the near future. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23905"></a></p>
<p>The discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/dnJR_x9M7PA">“</a>Raising Funds – The Startup Perspective” gave us all an intriguing perspective on some of the early stages of creating a startup especially focused on web3 and blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
 The TechTalks 
<p>On the tech side of things, we heard incredible updates from the Horizen and Horizen Labs teams’ – <a href="https://youtu.be/8dgQ8Vr5FWs">an overview of TokenMint and its current status</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">where the team is on the Horizen EVM sidechain, DeFi on Horizen</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/JvY8o8N4_2Q">what’s next for Zendoo</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We welcomed experts to share their knowledge on topics like <a href="https://youtu.be/rJ2NWf-KcpY">“Plonk and LookUp Arguments,”</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/kQ37ZJ_wtO0">“Private NFT Protocols,”</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/RX7dGq_GZuI">“zkVMs Under the Hood,”</a> to mention a few. These educational panel discussions and talks provided many with additional technical expertise and understanding. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23906"></a></p>
 The Team Sessions 
<p>ZenCon0 also brought the global team together in one place to brainstorm, connect, and innovate. The Horizen Labs and Horizen teams from different divisions gave presentations on their expertise areas, which allowed members of other teams to gain exposure and knowledge in areas they might not previously have. Ranging from hands-on demos and product overviews to improving blockchain communications.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23908"></a></p>
<p>Internal sessions like “Bridging the Divide: From Tech to Product,” a discussion on how products go from technical concepts to useable products and how we market them, enabled the team to learn more about process flow and improvements and get insights into how other teams work together to drive our future. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23909"></a></p>
<p>While sessions like <a href="https://youtu.be/2OiF6cxJu94">“Common Vulnerabilities in Solidity Smart Contracts”</a> enabled us all to learn more about the tech behind our upcoming releases and understand more about the engineering decisions behind the creation of things like our upcoming EVM sidechain. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23910"></a></p>
 The Parties! 
<p>We kicked off ZenCon the night before the conference with a beautiful, welcoming party at the location of the event. This was an amazing opportunity for everyone to network and was where some of our team members met one another in person for the first time before kicking off the next two days!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23911"></a></p>
<p>The next side party was the CryptoMondays and Horizen Rooftop Aperativo at the Horizen Milan office, which was a great opportunity for further networking and enabled our team members outside of Milan to see the new office! This was an amazing event followed by a mystery dinner, where everyone was grouped randomly to enjoy dinner and network outside of our typical teams.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23912"></a></p>
<p>Finally, we ended this amazing experience and event with a fantastic closing party with great music, delicious food, and dancing! It was the perfect end to the best event we attended this year, and we cannot wait to welcome everyone again for the next ZenCon! </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23913"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23914"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23915"></a></p>
 After ZenCon – Getting the Team Together 
<p>After the main event, the Horizen and Horizen Labs teams took on an exciting challenge – A Horizen hackathon focusing on dapps that could be created on our upcoming EVM! The winners would have a chance to help make their idea a reality in our ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This fun team-building exercise was a great way for everyone to get to know each other better. The teams all came up with great ideas that we could see being potential use cases on Horizen one day! You may even see one of them in the coming months!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23917"></a></p>
<p>We also took a day to enable our teams to get to know each other better and get some well-deserved relaxation. We spent time hiking, exploring, and enjoying one another’s company. Afterward, the team split into groups to complete a fun scavenger hunt! Followed by an amazing final dinner together before we all traveled back home.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is a fascinating field that has made tremendous development over the past few years. From GPT-3 to Dall-e and Stable Diffusion, the vastness of the scope of applications for AI and neural computing is becoming clearer than ever. At the base layer, there is a need for decentralized p2p AI compute platform that provides flexible access to the wider public. Gensyn sets out on the mission to provide just that by building a market place protocol for AI compute - ultra-low cost, hyperscale, permissionless.</p><p>In today’s episode we are joined by the project's co-founders Ben Fielding and Harry Grieve. We take a deep dive into the current landscape for AI and AI compute, the reasonings and trade-offs in building Gensyn, the protocol’s focus and edge cases, and how the protocol is utilizing the blockchain technology as both incentive layer and credibly neutral platform.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The founders' background and reasonings for development on Blockchain  The current state of AI development and breakdown of AI concepts  The current landscape for AI modeling and compute  Gensyn's difference to other protocols, such as Golem  How Gensyn is adhering to the decentralized default, and making trade-offs in product building  Building Gensyn as a Layer-1 protocol  Deep dive into the Gensyn Protocol and edge cases  Other players in the protocol: solvers, verifiers, and whistle blowers  Building a blockchain  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://www.gensyn.ai/">Gensyn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/gensynai">Gensyn on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/fenbielding">Ben Fielding on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/_grieve">Harry Grieve on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Tally Ho: Tally Ho is a new wallet for Web3 and DeFi that sees the wallet as a public good.

 Introducing the Nym SDK — powerful privacy served directly to your&nbsp;browser <p>Nym releases a new TypeScript SDK to create apps that can use the Nym mixnet and Coconut credentials quickly</p><p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk/v/1.1.4">Nym SDK</a> allows you to send data over the Nym mixnet with ease from browser-based applications. It has recently been updated to version&nbsp;1.1.4.</p><p>This is the very first time that the full privacy powers of mixnets are available easily and directly from a browser&nbsp;window!</p><p>Any application that works from a browser or embeds a WebView can use this SDK to send data through the Nym mixnet to benefit from the network layer privacy protections it offers. This also includes client-side apps that use Electron, React Native, or Tauri frameworks (basically anything that can execute WebAssembly).</p><p>If you are a JavaScript or TypeScript developer and would like to give things a try and see how it works, have a look at our <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk">GitHub repository for examples</a> on how to use the&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>As an example, here is a basic <a href="https://chat-demo.nymtech.net">chat webapp</a>. Texts that are sent through the Nym mixnet and to the receiving party. Try running it between yourself and a friend or in two browsers! The <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk/typescript/examples/react-webpack-with-theme-example">code can be found here</a> if you’d like to understand how it&nbsp;works.</p><p>We are currently working on reply SURBs, which will allow the recipient to reply to the sender without knowing their address. We are also working on a version that works with NodeJS and native workers, so you can use the mixnet from your Express webapps or from a&nbsp;CLI.</p><p>Experiment with the current version and watch NPM for upgrades.</p><p>We look forward to seeing what kind of apps people will build with this&nbsp;client!</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym.

<p>Within the digital identity ecosystem, verifiable credentials (VCs) refers to an open standard for digital credentials that represent information that would normally be found in passports, driver’s licences, university titles, and other forms of accreditation.</p>



<p>In this post, we explain the mechanics underpinning VCs and some potential use cases.</p>



 In another time and another place, there were trustworthy knights. 



<p>Ivanhoe is one of Walter Scott’s best-known works. Deemed a historical romance novel, the story follows Wilfred of Ivanhoe, a Saxon knight, and his beloved, Lady Rowena. The thrust of the plot is Ivanhoe’s determination to marry Lady Rowena, with whom she grew up after Rowena was orphaned and became the ward of Wilfred’s father, Cedric, a powerful Saxon lord. The conflict arises when Cedric betroths Rowena to another, Athelstane, out of political interest.</p>



<p>Wilfred is portrayed as the epitome of chivalry. He’s heroic, honourable, and loyal. Rowena is equally depicted as chaste, virtuous, and loyal to her true feelings of love for Ivanhoe. Becoming a knight was a big deal in those days. Indeed, knighthood came to be considered a form of nobility, though in the lower scale. But the point is that knights were respectable, trustworthy individuals. So much so that, often, knights were assigned as elite personal guards for lords, who trusted knights implicitly. Over time, and as methods of warfare evolved, knights gradually became obsolete and eventually morphed into the honorary titles that survive to this day.</p>



<p>Let’s focus on the trust part, as this has bearing on our narrative. Knighthood could be earned by different means: prowess on the battlefield, for certain. Social status did have an influence. The peasantry had a scant chance of being knighted, for example. And there were economic factors at play, too. Armour, weapons, and knight-related paraphernalia were expensive, and beyond the reach of most. But perhaps the key factor for a lord (or someone from the royalty) to bestow knighthood unto somebody was trust. A knight-to-be had to prove himself worthy of trust by the lord. This implied honour, the upholding and protection of the weak, and respect. All these attributes had to be proven before the dubbing ceremony took place, where the lord would place the flat of a sword on the shoulders of the man kneeling before him, thus bestowing knighthood upon him. A foundation of trust was vital for the lord-knight relationship to work.</p>



 The triangle of trust 



<p>Fast forward a few centuries to the present day. Blockchain technology has enabled a new identity framework, centred around digital credentials. VCs are part of that framework.</p>



<p>VCs stand at the centre of a triangle of trust, which features three vertices: Issuer, Holder, and Verifier. The triangle represents the following flow: the Issuer digitally signs a credential (or set of), and issues them to the Holder, which manages the credentials and, when required, presents them to the Verifier. In this context, the Issuer and the Holder trust each other. The Holder trusts the Verifier, and the Verifier trusts the Issuer. As we can see, VCs are anchored on implicit trust, much like the relationship between a knight and a lord was all those years ago. Furthermore, this identity model puts the individual (the knight, in our narrative) in control of their identity attributes.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: quick definition 



<p>We all carry a set of physical credentials in our wallets at all times. Driver licenses, government IDs, library cards, health insurance cards, a passport if we are abroad, and myriad others. These things are a) cumbersome, and b) antiquated. It is cumbersome because we have so many of them, all issued by different entities. And antiquated because, well, they come in physical form, which means they can be lost or damaged beyond usability. Both scenarios would require contacting the issuing entity’s help desk many times, and a lengthy wait until a replacement is issued.</p>



<p>Now imagine if, instead of having to carry all those documents on you at all times, all you had to do was show a QR code that contained all that information. If you needed to use any of your credentials, someone would just scan the QR code, and poof, voila. Done. This is the essence of VCs. A digital representation of credentials that enables the individual to selectively share their information, without having to actually show the actual data. VCs enable the third party to instantly verify that the information is true, without having to call or contact anyone else.</p>



<p>In short: VCs are tamper-proof credentials that can be instantly and cryptographically verified.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: properties and components 



<p>As specified in the W3 data model, VCs must fulfil three inherent properties. They must be:</p>



  Machine-verifiable  Secure and tamper-proof  Respectful of privacy  



<p>At a technical level, VCs have three basic components: metadata, claims, and proofs</p>



<p>Metadata – This is information cryptographically signed by the Issuer. Metadata reflects the properties of the credential (who the issuer is, expiry date, and a public key, among many other pieces of information).<br>Claims – A statement about the Holder. Date of birth, for example.<br>Proofs – Information about the Holder that accomplishes four things:</p>



  Allows others to verify the source of the data (i.e., the issuer)  Proves that the data belongs to the Holder, and to that Holder alone  Guarantees that the data has not been tampered with  Checks that the data has not been revoked by the Issuer  



<p>All this information is contained within a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file, which is an open specification format for transmitting data as a series of attributes and values, and also arrays. These JSON files can then be converted into a JSON Web Token (JWT), which is essentially a JSON file with a cryptographic signature added in. These signatures are kept secure by a pair of public and private keys.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: use cases 



<p>VCs can be applied to many different aspects of identity-related frameworks. For example:</p>



  Government-issued documents, including passports, driver licences, national ID cards, etc.  Travel visas  Healthcare certificates  Credit scoring information  Educational credentials (diplomas, university titles, and any other academic achievements)  Documentation required for opening bank accounts, and applying for <a href="https://zaisan.io/self-sovereign-identity-finance/">financial products</a> (loans, mortgages, etc.)  Credentials for opening a bank account or setting up payments  Verification of disability status  



<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list. Rather, it is a sample of some of the possible solutions that VCs can be part of.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>There are no knights in today’s world, at least not like the ones described in Ivanhoe, or so many other medieval-themed tales. But the image of the honourable and strait-laced Wilfred will do just fine for our analogy. Wilfred (and all those bestowed with a knighthood) embodied trust, truth, and honour. VCs play a very similar role, albeit several centuries later, and in a world that has moved away from the centralization of power that lords represented. You can think of VCs as the knights of a decentralised world, representing the system of trust, truth, and honour that every identity framework requires to function.</p>



 Key takeaways 



  VCs stand at the center of a triangle of trust, which features three vertices: Issuer, Holder, and Verifier  Current standards dictate that VCs must be machine-verifiable, secure and tamper-proof, and respectful of privacy  At a technical level, VCs have three basic components: metadata, claims, and proofs  VC information is usually presented in JSON format, which can be converted into a JWT. This adds a cryptographic signature to the credential

 zCloak Network Partners with Scroll to Provide a Privacy-Preserving Identity Service on Ethereum Layer&nbsp;2 <p>zCloak Network announced that it will work with Scroll to provide a privacy-preserving identity service on Ethereum L2 for Scroll users. The partnership will focus on bringing a W3C compatible DID and Verifiable Credential platform on Scroll’s L2 architecture. The collaboration will also include an exploration of call data cost optimization and general research on zk-STARK/zk-SNARK technology, etc.</p><p>Scroll is a native zkEVM layer 2 solution for the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to scale Ethereum with cutting-edge research and technology. With zkEVM to prove the correctness of EVM execution in Layer2 and the building of a complete L2 architecture around it, Scroll is providing a full zkRollup solution on Ethereum. Additionally, if Scroll provides its users with a full suite of DID and Verifiable Credential service, there will be more possibilities of use cases explored and better interaction on Scroll’s L2 structure with less friction.</p><p>zCloak Network can provide Scroll with such DID and Verifiable Credential services with its <a href="http://zkid.app/">zkID.app</a> product and related SDK. zkID.app helps users to establish their own DID on Scroll, and this decentralized identity will function as an avatar of an entity in cyberspace, and their real-world identity data will be linked to it in a privacy-preserving way, stored on user’s local devices through browser extension.</p><p>The link of real-world data to DID is made possible by verifiable credentials. In this case, zCloak wants to help Scroll construct a platform where Scroll’s users can have their identity data attested, generate Verifiable credentials (VC), and use their VCs in various applications on Scroll’s L2&nbsp;network.</p><p>In more advanced use cases, services provided by zCloak Network can also serve as proof of social relations between users and organizations. Moreover, organizations can use zCloak to do KYC on their clients with an approach that preserves user privacy and data sovereignty. There are many use cases for <a href="http://zkid.app/">zkID.app</a> to be applied on Scroll, for example, DAOs can prove their treasury is above a certain number without disclosing the exact portfolio. In another case, project founders can prove that they have certain education or work experience without giving away too many&nbsp;details.</p><p>In conclusion, by collaborating with Scroll, zCloak Network leverages zero-knowledge proof technology to provide a unique set of DID protocols and infrastructure for Scroll’s users to use their real-world data for on-chain activities while preserving privacy. There will be implementation of both parties’ technology and products within this partnership, mainly regarding identity verification, conveying trustworthiness, and privacy protection. Both zCloak Network and Scroll are bringing Web3.0 solutions to projects and users, and we believe our collaboration will drive higher trust within the Web3.0&nbsp;world.</p> About Scroll <p>Scroll is a native zkEVM Layer 2 scaling solution built to scale Ethereum. Scroll enables high-throughput, low cost smart contracts, trustless security, and the same developer experience as Ethereum L1. Scroll’s architecture consists of Scroll Node, Roller Network, and Rollup and Bridge Contracts. Putting all of these together, Scroll is able to execute native EVM bytecode on L2 while inheriting strong security guarantees from base layer Ethereum. Scroll’s visions are to empower humanity — starting with blockchain developers and users, to build in the open with the community, and to fight for decentralization and censorship resistance.</p><p><a href="https://scroll.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP">Twitter</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://discord.gg/GQxeCTA4dJ">Discord</a></p> About zCloak&nbsp;Network <p>zCloak Network is a privacy-first DID and verifiable computation infrastructure. It aims to deliver the Web3 dream of Self-Sovereignty by moving both the storage and the computation of user data into user device from centralized servers. The integrity of user computation is proven by a STARK-based ZK-VM in a browser extension. zCloak’s W3C compatible DID system can mirror real-world legal status and reputation in DeSoc. With zCloak Network, people can use their real-world data for e.g. DeFi, Identity, Biometric applications without disclosing their privacy. zCloak Network is chain-agnostic — its identity and ZKP service can be served for most public blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://zcloak.network/#/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/zCloakNetwork">Twitter</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/j3mATwNVSH">Discord</a></p>

 Nym Shipyard Academy — welcome to Stage&nbsp;2! <p>Congratulations to our Nymsters — the more than 600 graduates from Stage 1 of the Nym Shipyard Academy! Over the past two weeks, participants learned about the Nym privacy system and some of the main surveillance problems of digital infrastructures. Two quizzes tested their knowledge. Those who scored 60% or higher on at least one quiz during Stage 1 have graduated to Stage 2 — the Navigator stage. Those who scored 50% and more will receive Stage 1&nbsp;rewards.</p> Changes to Shipyard Academy&nbsp;Rewards <p>The total reward pool for the Nym Shipyard Academy was 100K NYM tokens, with a 15K prize pool for Stage 1. However, since we designed Shipyard Academy the market took a heavy hit, not to mention that probably quite a few participants of the Academy were personally affected by the FTX meltdown. We want to make sure to account for&nbsp;that.</p><p>For this reason, we decided to increase the overall prize pool to 115K NYM tokens, adding 5K to the prize pool of each stage. This means the prize pools of each stage&nbsp;are:</p>  Stage 1: 20K NYM tokens (from&nbsp;15K)  Stage 2: up to 40K NYM tokens (from&nbsp;35K)  Stage 3: up to 55K NYM tokens (from&nbsp;50K)   Stage 1&nbsp;rewards <p>When it comes to Stage 1, all pupils who achieved 50% or more on quiz 1 or quiz 2 get a share of the reward pool. The rewards scale with quiz performance, with top scorers receiving the highest&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Here is the Stage 1 leaderboard — check it to find out how you did and whether you graduated to become a&nbsp;Nymster!</p><p>Congratulations to all our participants! If you didn’t manage to graduate to Stage 2, but want to know about future opportunities? Sign up&nbsp;<a href="http://eepurl.com/gdor_f">here</a>.</p><p>To receive your NYM&nbsp;tokens:</p>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Download the Nym&nbsp;wallet</a>  Await further instructions…  <p>Did you know you can use your NYM tokens via the wallet to bond a mixnode and help run the Nym&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRMZY6Ez1bA">Learn more.</a></p><p>Did you know that you can delegate your NYM tokens via the wallet to help secure the Nym mixnet and earn rewards for doing&nbsp;so?</p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">Learn more.</a></p> Stage 2: Navigator <p>By the end of stage 2 you know how to navigate the digital oceans in a safe manner and will have become a privacy advocate.</p><p>Now that you have learned the basics about Nym, network layer privacy and digital surveillance, it is time for you to help others navigate the digital oceans securely. The second stage of the Nym Shipyard Academy is all about sharing what you have learned so far and start to take action — by protecting your privacy as you use some of the most common apps in&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>During this stage, you&nbsp;will:</p>  spread the word to others about privacy online and the problems of popular applications like Telegram and&nbsp;Discord;  learn to use <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/nym-connect">NymConnect</a> to protect the network layer as you chat online and tell the world you are doing&nbsp;so;  deepen your knowledge about the Nym network and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/choose-your-character-an-overview-of-nym-network-actors-19e6a9808540">the types of nodes</a> it consists&nbsp;of;  learn about the token economics and how incentives help to ensure the privacy and security of the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.  <p>As the stakes are getting higher, the quiz will be more difficult during Stage 2. You may want to look around on our Discord server for study groups, or create your own! Reach out to our Community Managers if you need info on study&nbsp;groups.</p> Stage 2&nbsp;rewards <p>When it comes to Stage 2, the final size of the prize pool is in your hands! You now understand what the Nym mixnet does, and the importance of using it to protect your privacy. It is time for you to start using it, and get others to use it&nbsp;too!</p><p>The initial prize pool of Stage to is 25K NYM tokens and today, NymConnect has 250 daily active users. If together we hit and maintain 800 daily active users throughout Stage 2, the reward pool will go up to 40K NYM tokens. Keep an eye on our Discord server where we will regularly report the current daily active users, along with the current size of the Stage 2 prize&nbsp;pool.</p> Kick-starting Stage&nbsp;2… <p>The first thing you need to do is download <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/nym-connect">NymConnect</a> to protect your desktop Telegram chat messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/quj8H2qeOwY">Follow the instructions</a> for how to set your Telegram chat app to run via a SOCKS5 proxy and send your traffic through the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Now that you understand our tech and the problem it is solving, it’s time to spread the word. Over the next two weeks, you need to post a minimum of three posts on socials, memes, visuals or text about the privacy issues of popular apps or what is good about privacy and Nym. One of these posts needs to include a link to <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/nym-connect">NymConnect</a>.</p><p>Our aspiring Nymjas, a hand-picked group of elite privacy enthusiasts should take note, as this task is especially important for them. We are also keeping a close eye on the Contributions channel on the Nym Discord server, where you can share your blog posts, translations, guides and other contributions.</p><p>Just like last week, there will be information drops across Nym socials that will give you the necessary information to pass the quiz which will take place at the end of Stage 2. There will be two lectures on Nym node types and Nym token economics. NOTE: Stage 2 will have only one quiz, and a submission form to show us your best social media&nbsp;post.</p><p>Make sure to keep an eye on our socials and attend the weekly lectures to max out on the Stage 2&nbsp;quiz!</p><p>Minimum passing requirements:</p>  download and use NymConnect  post 3 original tweets mentioning Nym or sharing our&nbsp;content  pass the Stage 2 quiz with at least 60% correct&nbsp;answers.  <p>Good luck!</p><p>The Nym Network is powered by the NYM Token, a utility token that can be used to access the network, run a mix-node, and NYM should only be used within the Nym mixnet. NYM is not a general purpose payment mechanism nor cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. For investment purposes, do not use NYM but instead look into Bitcoin or other investment vehicles.</p><p>The rewards of and participation in Shipyard Academy is only available to individuals who do not reside in locations that makes them ineligible to participate and/or receive prizes, including the United States, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, the Crimea region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic. Nym may request that participants provide relevant information as necessary, and can only process payments once cleared by the Nym legal&nbsp;team.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-academy-welcome-to-stage-2-d697802c2275">Nym Shipyard Academy — welcome to Stage 2!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Findora Postmortem Report<blockquote>This postmortem report is written for and provided to the community to provide transparency into a recent outage. This article will describe the event, its root cause, and its resolution while highlighting how improvements will be made in an effort to prevent a recurrence of the&nbsp;issue.</blockquote> Event Date <p>Tuesday, November 15,&nbsp;2022</p> Impact &amp;&nbsp;Duration   Mainnet consensus halted  Duration: 4.5&nbsp;Hours   Overview <p>The Discreet Labs DevOps team attempted to coordinate with a set of Findora community validators for a pilot upgrade on the Findora Mainnet network. During this attempt, the Mainnet network experienced an unexpected outage. Engineers identified the issue, immediately began troubleshooting efforts, and worked with the affected validators to revert the nodes to their previous version. More community validators joined the effort to restore their&nbsp;nodes.</p> What Occurred <p>At approximately 5 PM, Nov 15, 2022 (PST), the Findora Mainnet’s consensus stopped for 4.5 hours. The incident was triggered, not caused, by several transactions sent from a newer beta version of the Findora wallet after DevOps coordinated with a set of validators during a pilot upgrade with the v0.3.3X Mainnet&nbsp;update.</p><p>The event was detected proactively by the event monitoring system. Discreet Labs began troubleshooting efforts within 10 minutes of the notification.</p> Root Cause(s) <p>The v0.3.3X update includes a new transaction parameter in the transaction body. The transaction hash calculation logic of the node is as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>Deserialization -&gt; Signature Verification -&gt; Transaction Execution -&gt; Serialization -&gt; Compute Transaction Hash</blockquote><p>Since the new parameter did not exist in previous versions, nodes running v0.3.27 ignored the parameter when calculating the transaction hash. In version 0.3.3X, however, this field is involved in the transaction hash calculation, thus causing the transaction hashes to be inconsistent.</p> Resolution <p>The new transaction parameter will be ignored for hash calculation in v0.3.3X but will retain its role in signature verification. This update to release v0.3.3X will ensure transaction hashes remain backward compatible with v0.3.2X&nbsp;nodes.</p> Moving Forward <p>The Discreet Labs team has documented several lessons learned and preventive measures to take moving forward. The items below reflect the methods teams will use collaboratively to minimize risk and optimize communication.</p> Additional Testing via Mainnet-Mock   Upgrades with impact potential will undergo additional rounds of testing on a transient network called “Mainnet-Mock”. This network will be an identical copy of Mainnet, including its data and validators, acting as a mirror of Findora’s production network.  Mainnet-Mock will be created and deconstructed as needed. As a mirror copy of Mainnet, testing against the Mainnet-Mock network will require the assistance and close communication of Findora community validators to reach &gt; 66.67% consensus.  Upgrades that carry potential impact will be validated on the Mainnet-Mock network before being classified as “Mainnet-Ready”.   Change Management Process Improvements <p>Changes that can impact production will go through an improved change management process. These process improvements will ensure that all the appropriate stakeholders are in-sync with the engineering change&nbsp;task.</p>  Discreet Labs will continue to ensure that partners and CEX contacts are notified of upcoming changes using the schedule above. Technical support will continue to be provided when&nbsp;needed.  The details of changes that can impact production will be communicated extensively with the community well in advance of the scheduled change date. Discreet Labs will share information two weeks before the change, one week prior, three days prior, one day prior, the day of the change, and the day&nbsp;after.  Change information will be shared across social media, pinned to the official Discord and Telegram channels and Reddit as announcement posts. Discreet Labs will communicate to the validator community on validator-specific channels across Discord and Telegram.  Mainnet-Mock testing will be conducted as part of the change management process. See above for information on Mainnet-Mock.  <p>Special thanks to the validator community who worked together in restoring their nodes in a collaborative manner, reflecting the positive values the Findora community fosters and embraces. Your decision to help decentralize and secure the Findora network is greatly&nbsp;valued.</p><p>We look forward to upgrading Mainnet to v0.3.3X together.</p> About Findora <p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography.

<p>Secure multi-party computation is a well-known cryptographic technique designed to secure digital assets or protect information cryptographically. Today, several MPC theories and algorithms are leveraged in various sectors to safeguard information. Similarly, with the rise in popularity of blockchain-based financial solutions (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/cross-chain-defi-possible-or-forever-limited/">DeFi</a>), the interest in MPC has spiked, mainly due to the applications of MPC in safeguarding funds in crypto wallets.<br></p><p>In a nutshell, multi-party computation enables programmatic solutions to secure “secrets” by splitting them into multiple parts, such that no single participant know the underlying “truth”. Thanks to this, no single participant can reconstruct or leak secret information.<br></p><p>In this article, we will understand the concept of secure multi-party computation in detail, how it works, and its numerous applications.</p> What is multi-party computation (MPC)? <p>Multi-party computation is a cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties, each in possession of fragments of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-in-the-age-of-surveillance-a-pipedream-or-something-worth-fighting-for-341a67f1db76/">private data</a>, to participate in computing a specific result. This specific result is computed by combining their data without disclosing the nature or content of their inputs or any other secret information related to the process. <br></p><p>In simpler terms, multi-party computation brings together separate entities holding pieces of information that, when combined, can reveal a secret, sign a message, or approve a transaction. It’s also worth noting that MPC achieves this without revealing any details on the information in each individual's possession.<br></p><p>It’s worth noting that in MPC, the data split across multiple participants does not represent the secret if simply combined together. Instead, these pieces of information will serve as inputs to participate in the desired computation. Every valid MPC protocol must fulfill two specific requirements:<br></p>  Suppose participants reveal their secret information or discard the rules during the computation. In that case, the multi-party computation protocol will not allow dishonest participants to force the honest parties to disclose their confidential information or influence the outcome of the result.<br>  No one can deduce each party's secret information from the protocol's execution. This means that the result of the computation does not give its holders any hint of what the private information in the participants' possession is.<br>  <p>MPC as a concept is said to be born in 1980s when Chinese computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yao">Andrew Yao</a> first adopted two-party computation and introduced secure multi-party computation. Here's what the timeline of the evolution of MPC looks like:<br></p>  1982 – 1986: To solve the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_problem">Millionaire's Problem</a>, Andrew Yao introduced two-party computation and adapted it to any calculation involving two parties.<br>  1987: Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali, and Avi Wigderson release the <a href="https://wiki.mpcalliance.org/gmw.html">Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson protocol</a>, adapting two-party computation to a multi-party format.<br>  The 1990s: More studies on multi-party computation resulted in several breakthroughs, one of which was enabling MPC on mobile (i.e. less powerful) devices.<br>  2008: The first practical application of MPC at scale occurred in a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/meeting-on-privacy-enhancing-cryptography/documents/toft.pdf">sealed-bid sugar beet auction</a> in Denmark.<br>  2015: Following an increase in hacks and thefts from crypto wallets, crypto wallet providers and custodians begin utilizing MPC for private key and digital asset security.  2019: The <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/pushing-mpc-wallet-signing-speeds-8x-with-mpc-cmp-9/">MPC-CMP</a> debuted as the first automatic, one-round key-refreshing multi-party computation algorithm.   How does multi-party computation work? <p>To understand how multi-party computation works, let’s consider one famous example.<br></p><p>Greg and Smith, two employees holding similar roles at a company, are having lunch. Then, they want to know whether they earn the same amount or if any of them is being paid less than what they deserve. Yet, they do not want to reveal their wages. How do they solve this dilemma without revealing their secrets to one another?<br></p><p>A simple way to solve their problem would be to disclose their income to a trusted mutual friend, who can tell them if they earn the same wage based on the information she has received. However, the goal of a multi-party computation protocol is to help them figure out who's worth the most among them without third-party involvement.<br></p><p>Using oblivious transfers, Greg and Smith can solve their dilemma quickly. The oblivious transfer method is a non-technical way to explain secure multi-party computation. In this scenario, Greg gets four locked suggestion boxes and marks each box with a particular amount that may represent the hourly pay for their roles. Box-1 is marked $40, Box-2 is marked $50, Box-3 is marked $60, and Box-4 is marked $70.<br></p><p>Let’s say Greg earns $50 hourly, so he takes only the key for Box 2. Smith makes $60 hourly and has to select the box that matches his hourly earnings. On four pieces of paper, he writes a 'NO' on three sheets and a 'YES' on the fourth. These scribblings will go into each box, and the one with a 'YES' goes into Box-3 since Smith earns $60 per hour, while other boxes get a NO.<br></p><p>When Greg unlocks Box-2, he finds a NO, indicating that Smith does not earn $50 per hour. Greg now has to tell Smith that they do not make the same hourly wage, though neither of them knows who earns more or less. Their secrets are safe, and they have exchanged information without revealing anything. Note that this analogy depends on honesty from both parties.<br></p><p>Secure multi-party computation splits essential information that can be used to compute a specific result among multiple parties in total secrecy. Each participant only knows the information in their possession, and throughout the computation, no part of the secrets are revealed.<br></p>Another example, similar to one mentioned above, to understand the concept on MPC. (<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/secure-multi-party-computation/">Source</a>)‌ ‌<p></p>Threshold signature scheme MPC diagram. (<a href="https://www.qredo.com/blog/what-is-multi-party-computation-mpc">Source</a>) Applications of multi-party computation <p>Over the years, multi-party computation has found several use cases and applications. The earliest <a href="https://partisia.com/better-market-solutions/mpc-goes-live/">large-scale application</a> was recorded in 2008 at a sealed-bid sugar beet auction in Denmark. Farmers' bids were private, with the protocol responsible for determining the highest bid. The farmer with the winning bid went on to pay the second-highest request on the bidding log. Sealed-bid auctions remain popular still. <br></p><p>There are several variations and modifications of multi-party computation schemes enabling further applications. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">Threshold signature schemes</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shamirs-secret-sharing-algorithm-cryptography/">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a> are two famous examples of cryptographic methods leveraging MPC. <br></p><p>Other significant applications of MPC include:</p> Data Analytics <p>Big firms that deal with confidential user data, like healthcare companies or financial institutions, can collect data securely from an anonymous pool of users, compute, analyze, and gain insights from the data using MPC. This way, users will not reveal their personal information, and these organizations can <a href="https://soda-project.eu/mpcenterprise/">analyze</a> the data for insights without uncovering it. <br></p><p>This same method can be applied to autonomous cars, shipping or truck fleets, and aircraft fleets, with recipients like car companies, city planners, and service providers benefitting from the insights without knowing any details on the information provided.</p> Genetic Testing <p>Secure multi-party computation can also be utilized in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7545831">genetic testing</a>. Patients can access their genetic profiles privately and securely without revealing any confidential information on their metabolism rates, family traits, hereditary disease information, and other data thatthey would rather not share.</p> Threshold MultiSig in Blockchains <p>Threshold multi-signature schemes are a subfield of multi-party computation and can perform similar functions as a private key on the blockchain, including public address generation and transaction signing. <br></p><p>With MPC, the private keys of a crypto wallet can be split (<a href="https://silencelaboratories.com/silent-shard/">shards</a>) among several parties in such a way that for any function to be performed, a minimum number of people holding key shares have to be involved. <br></p><p>If some participants within the group become dishonest, they will not be able to have their way unless they reach the threshold for signing transactions. Usually, these participants do not know each other.</p> Digital Wallet Security <p>Multi-party computation protocols enhance private key security and, by extension, digital wallet security. Most cryptocurrency wallets use private keys, usually stored in a particular '<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusted</a>' device. While this method primarily depends on the strength of the device's security measures, it also presents a single point of failure. <br></p><p>Using MPC, private keys are split up between multiple entities, making it more difficult for attackers to compromise the digital wallet since they have to attack multiple points simultaneously.</p> Closing Thoughts <p>Multi-party computation has evolved over the years and remains a crucial breakthrough in the world of cryptography today. From sealed-bid auctions to crypto wallets, MPC protocols are being leveraged in various applications. <br></p><p>From a blockchain perspective, however, leveraging MPC for security of digital wallets is a critical, immediate application that multiple parties are invested on. As more and more wallet providers begin to adopt MPC protocols for wallet security, the era of seed phrases may be over. As of now, several <a href="https://zengo.com/mpc-wallet/">wallet providers</a> have already started opting MPC to offer better protection and an improved user experience.<br></p><p>In the coming year, hopefully, we'll have more real-life applications of multi-party computation touching our daily lives similar to what happened with <a href="https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication">public key authentication</a>.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Since joining Privy earlier this year, I’ve been spending most of my time working with web3 developers to help improve their products’ UX, onboarding flows, and user data privacy. I’ve spoken with over 100 founders in the space working on gaming, NFTs, web3 social, defi, payments/accounting, and much more. In spite of all the recent market uncertainty, my optimism about our market burns hotter than ever. Here are some learnings from a very deep dive with&nbsp;Privy.</p><p>Winter is here. As we bundle up and prepare for another cycle of hunkered down building, the Privy team has been reflecting on what it’ll take for web3 to unlock the next phase of adoption beyond financial use cases. In the coming months, seeds will be planted that’ll grow into the next wave of consumer apps to shape our lives. These apps must prove to be useful and fun enough to pull both my 15-year-old cousin and my 85-year-old grandma into our market (whether they know it or&nbsp;not).</p><p>Our work helping developers build better web3 products and bridge the gap between on and off chain data has given us a sense of the features these apps will need to have to hit mainstream adoption. Without further ado, here are our ingredients for developers cooking up the web3 consumer apps of tomorrow:</p>  Progressive onboarding — meet users where they are: The next billion blockchain users don’t have self-custodial wallets yet. While self-custody is perhaps the single most important feature of a web3 product, apps need first-class ways for walletless users to onboard and get immediate value. The best apps will have ways for users to onboard via email or social identities, and seamlessly upgrade to self-custody when they’re ready or as the app demands it. As the old saying goes: you’ll attract more bees with email auth than with mnemonics.  Mobile-first — bringing blockchains to every pocket: If you’ve given up on a web3 app after trying to connect on mobile, you’re not alone. The broken mobile user flow of getting misdirected to the app store upon wallet connection runs rampant, and for good reason: building mobile-optimized experiences in web3 is hard. But mobile accounts for &gt;60% of internet traffic (growing fast!). The web3 apps of tomorrow will be natively mobile — props to apps like OpenSea, Zapper, and dYdX for leading the way&nbsp;here!  Friction where it matters — when to slow a user down: Not all blockchain transactions are created equal. While it might make sense to interrupt a user session to prompt a signature on a financial transaction, many on-chain events should occur without user interruptions, notably in web3 social and gaming. Should you sign something every time you follow a new account, make an in-game move, or like a post? Of course not. Lots of exciting development in areas like session-specific keys and account abstraction will pull UX forward on this front. The best apps will be judicious about when to prompt users (shout out to our friends at Farcaster for showing us an example of what great looks&nbsp;like!).  Asset portability — open is the way to win: Whether they realize it or not, consumers will choose to use blockchain apps because they allow users to seamlessly bring their assets in and take their assets out. While it can be a tempting value capture play for developers to lock assets into their apps’ walled gardens, this misses the point! Games that let users bring their own leveling reputation and that let users leave with assets they earn in gameplay stand to attract new potential audiences and deliver much richer first time experiences for those audiences off the bat. Financial assets, user data, and identity will travel with users across the internet, and developers who build for more than just using blockchain as a financial backdrop for their apps can unlock new user experiences that are only possible in&nbsp;web3.  <p>It’s always darkest before dawn. Winters are exactly the sort of distraction-free environments necessary to breed the innovations that pull our market forward each cycle: it’s no coincidence that Ethereum and Uniswap were launched in the depths of 2015 and 2018, respectively. As long as we cook up the next generation of web3 apps with the above in mind, this should be the last winter before mainstream consumer adoption is here to&nbsp;stay.</p><p>We’re lucky to be serving the builders working day-and-night to turn mainstream adoption into a reality, and we can’t wait to show you all what we’ve been up to these past few&nbsp;months.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/how-crypto-goes-mainstream-from-here-d1371be33d5f">How Crypto Goes Mainstream from Here</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>NFT Community management tasks help to ensure the smooth running of the community and its future development in <a href="https://zaisan.io/web3-explained/">Web3</a>. It helps to keep track of community events and developments and to keep the community organised and cohesive to the project goal. Community management can help to resolve disputes and to show empathy to digital asset owners. Nevertheless, NFT holders are, in essence, shareholders of the project. NFT community management is becoming even more important as Web3 communities continue to grow, and remember, with a strong community, anything is possible.</p>



 Quick refresh: what is an NFT (community)? 



<p>The management of non-fungible tokens (NFT) communities is a critical but often overlooked aspect of developing and deploying these digital assets. NFTs are unique tokens on a blockchain that can represent ownership of digital or physical assets. In contrast to fungible tokens, which are interchangeable and can be divided into smaller units, NFTs are non-divisible. Due to their rarity or uniqueness, they are ideal to represent items like art, collectibles, and in-game items with monetary value.</p>



<p>NFT communities are flourishing online spaces where people with a shared interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can connect with one another. As the popularity of NFTs continues to grow, as do too the number of people flocking to these communities in search of information, advice, and support.</p>







 Why NFT community management is essential 



<p>With such a wide range of people with different levels of knowledge and expertise, NFT community management can be a challenge. It is important to strike a balance between providing content that is both informative and accessible to all, while also avoiding overwhelming newcomers with too much information.</p>



<p>While the technical aspects of creating and deploying NFTs are essential, it is equally important to have a well-managed community around the project. This is because NFTs are often bought and sold in online communities. The success of an NFT project depends on the strength of these communities. For example, an NFT gaming community needs players to support the game, therefore, enjoy playing the game<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/"> to transact in-game assets</a> with one another.</p>



<p>A good NFT community will have a variety of content that covers the basics of what NFTs are and how they work. Additionally, it includes more in-depth articles and discussions for those with a more advanced understanding. It is also essential to have a system in place for moderating content and managing users in order to keep the community respectful and welcoming to all. One way is by establishing rules and best practices written on communication channels, as well as creating a tutorial page for newcomers.</p>



<p>With the right mix of content and community management, NFT communities can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in this exciting technology. It can be a fun entry point to the Web3 world!</p>



 3 Tips to create a strong foundation for your NFT Community 



<p>There are a few things that project owners should keep in mind when managing their NFT communities.</p>



 1. Constantly remind people of your vision 



<p>Have a clear vision and to communicate constantly with your members. This way, you can keep everyone on the same page and working towards the same goals. Let’s take an example: using Web3 technology, an NFT online chess game allows users to interact with in-game assets and transact<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/"> </a>them. It creates a <a href="https://zaisan.io/play-to-earn-business-models-games/">Play-to-Earn (P2E) model</a>. For instance, this NFT game has the vision to create a community in which chess players can enjoy playing the game while earning rewards in forms of digital assets, NFTs and cryptocurrency. It is therefore necessary for the weekly content plan to include benefits and positive facts about NFT online chess in order to create rapport and build high beliefs about the project as more players join.</p>



 2. Active moderation is key 



<p>The project ambassadors should be active in the community and should engage with community members on a regular basis. This is essentially getting more experienced people in the community to be a moderator. They should be the ones who are zealously advocating for the project. But as a project that just started, it is indispensable to have a community manager to push forward content and to be listening to the market needs.</p>



 3. Get people involved in decision-making 



<p>Finally, it is vital to have a community-centered approach to decision-making. This means that the community should be involved in decisions about the project, such as what features to add or what direction to take the project in. This will lead the project to a democratic system. The funds spent on NFTs are being directed to the project development from a shared decision-making perspective. In practice, this can be done by a voting system or members’ livestream meetings with the project owner.</p>

I’ll keep things short and to the&nbsp;point.</p> Verus Desktop v0.9.5&nbsp;Update <p>⏰ Update your Verus Desktop wallet before 19 November 11 PM UTC. This release updates the Komodo notaries to season 6 and you must update to reliably stay synchronized to the Verus mainnet (activation height of block 2,291,830).</p><p>v0.9.5 introduces 2 new APIs and CLI commands, signdata and verifysignature, that encompass all of the capabilities of previous signing and verification APIs and add new capabilities for advanced signatures and verification — a more powerful and flexible framework for NFTs and ID-bound legal rights and agreements.</p><p>In addition to digital signing of documents or information using an ID, the new APIs enable easily binding together multiple sources of content, documents, identities, and VDXF keys together into one verifiable signature and then being able to verify that signature, including all of its specific bindings.</p><p>🔗 <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Download Verus Desktop&nbsp;v0.9.5</a></p> Verus PBaaS &amp; DeFi&nbsp;Updates <p>In anticipation of the Verus PBaaS mainnet upgrade — delivering no-programming needed blockchain and currency launches, MEV-free DeFi, non-custodial Ethereum bridging and so much more — community developers introduce a protocol improvement designed to make the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol even more resistant than what we believe was already the leading algorithm to multi-block attempts at&nbsp;MEV.</p><p>The protocol improvement makes the following adjustments:</p>  Conversions and cross-chain transfers still roll-up into exports that are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions, but to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next requires a random bit pulled from later&nbsp;blocks.  The last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, which is no longer the&nbsp;case.  Import transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.  <p>These changes together serve to disincentivize any miner or staker from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss. They would be better off saving their working capital to arbitrage imports by joining transactions, bringing them close to market, and earning money without risk of loss. In addition, if they do end up putting more value of transactions in a block that caps the export rollup, they will reliably earn meaningful rewards without risk of loss in that way as&nbsp;well.</p> Bug Bounties&nbsp;💰 <p>While we don’t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended.</p><p>If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000&nbsp;VRSC.</p><p>🗒️ <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.5-2">See PBaaS-Testnet Release&nbsp;Notes</a></p><p>🛎️ <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Join Discord and report&nbsp;bounties</a></p> Introducing VerusID to Verus&nbsp;Mobile <p>This version of Verus Mobile takes a major leap forward, enabling support for VerusID, including sending and receiving funds and use of your VerusID as a password-free, secure and self-sovereign web or mobile app sign-in, made possible with the VerusID authentication protocol.</p><p>Verus Mobile v0.3.0–24 supports the version 1.0 of the VerusID authentication protocol, which prepares for the PBaaS upgrade and supports application provisioning of IDs, an important way applications can onboard users, give them a verified self-sovereign ID and funds address, enable sending and receiving payments, and make applications more secure by design with an easy, password-free sign-in.</p><p>In addition to its new support for VerusID and the Verus Authentication Protocol, this version of Verus Mobile continues to include Wyre as a fiat on-ramp and maintains support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a variety of popular coins and&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>If you are an app developer who wants to benefit from and help pioneer a better, more user-centric, inherently commerce-enabled, verifiable application model for a true Internet of Value, this is the release that enables you!

<p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ethereum-competitors-advantages-and-disadvantages/">Ethereum</a> is at the forefront of the crypto charge, and Ethereum account abstraction might be a key aspect of bringing it to the masses. But what is it precisely, and what makes it necessary?</p><p>Many see the network as the future of blockchain finance, as it holds several advantages over Bitcoin. It is the first blockchain to support smart contracts and the largest (volume-wise) after<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/"> Bitcoin</a>. </p><p>But as beautiful as the future of Ethereum and crypto may look, mass adoption remains a genuine concern. </p><p>While crypto enthusiasts may not need help creating and preserving the security of their self-custodial Ethereum wallets, the user experience for newly onboarded users could be better. This is especially true when setting up a <a href="https://appinventiv.com/blog/custodial-vs-non-custodial-wallets/">non-custodial wallet</a>. The process of generating and safely storing seed phrases remains quite complicated and, if a user loses access to her seed phrase, they might as well forget about whatever coins their wallets hold because the funds will be beyond their reach. Surely, onboarding a billion users under such circumstances will remain to be seen as challenging.</p><p>To improve the existing technology and lower the barriers of entry for new users, developers at the<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/"> Ethereum Foundation</a> began to propose the concept of Ethereum account abstraction. In this article, we'll look at what Ethereum account abstraction is, how it works, and most importantly, how it will benefit users.</p> How do Ethereum accounts work? <p>To use the Ethereum network, you must create an Ethereum account. A typical Ethereum account has a public address and a private key. You should not confuse Ethereum accounts for Ethereum wallets, as the latter is only an interface that helps you interact with tokens on the blockchain.</p><p>An Ethereum account consists of four key components: nonce, balance, codeHash, and storageRoot.</p>  The<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-series-understanding-nonce-3858194b39bf"> nonce</a> is a counter that tracks the number of transactions an account sends or contracts an account creates, depending on the account type.<br>  The balance is the amount of<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/wei"> wei</a> owned by an account. Wei is a denomination of ether, Ethereum's native currency.<br>  The codeHash of an Ethereum account is the code tied to that account on the<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/"> Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>, a virtual computer built on the Ethereum blockchain. Since only contract accounts (explained below) are tied in code to the<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zkevm-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/"> EVM</a>, in accounts without code (also known as externally owned accounts or EOA), the codeHash is an empty string.<br>  The storageRoot of an Ethereum account is the hash that encodes the account's storage content. Also known as the storage hash, it is a<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/"> 256-bit hash</a> of a Merkle Patricia trie's root node. A<a href="https://medium.com/@chiqing/merkle-patricia-trie-explained-ae3ac6a7e123"> Patricia Merkle Trie</a> is one of the key data structures for Ethereum’s storage layer and provides a cryptographically authenticated data structure that can be used to store all (key, value) bindings.  <p>Essentially, Ethereum accounts are of two types: externally owned accounts (EOA) and contract accounts (CA).</p><p>Let’s have a look at both types of accounts and what differentiates them. <br></p>Ethereum account types – EOA &amp; CA. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-ethereum-accounts/">Source</a>) Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) <p>A 'regular' Ethereum account with which you can initiate transactions, send, and receive ETH or any other Ethereum-based token (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc), and interact with smart contracts is an externally owned account (EOA). The average Ethereum user owns an EOA, and through wallets, the account interacts with the blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/introduction/the-programmable-account/eoas-vs.-contract-accounts">Externally owned Ethereum accounts</a> cost nothing to create, as they incur no storage requirements. They are simple accounts unassociated with data storage or code. EOAs are the only Ethereum account type with private keys, and these private keys have control over transaction signing. Also, when two EOAs interact, they can only initiate ETH or token transfers. </p><p>In summary, an externally owned Ethereum account has a public address and a private key, can initiate transactions and interact with smart contracts, requires no storage, and is represented on the EVM with an empty code string.</p> Contract Accounts (CA) <p>Contract accounts are a tad different from EOAs, as a code written on the EVM controls their activities. They are also commonly known as smart contracts. This code, once written, cannot be altered and will define the nature of transactions the contract account can complete. CAs do not initiate transactions, unlike their EOA counterparts. Instead, they can only send transactions in response to a transaction received.</p><p>For example, if you send a token to a contract account to exchange said for ETH tokens, the CA receives your transaction and, through its code, sends the corresponding amount of ETH to your address. Apart from being able to transfer tokens, contract accounts can also create new contracts. </p><p>Since CAs are controlled by their code's logic, they do not have private keys. Also, contract accounts use network storage. As such, creating them comes at a<a href="https://medium.com/the-capital/how-much-does-it-cost-to-deploy-a-smart-contract-on-ethereum-11bcd64da1"> cost</a>. The nonce of a contract account counts the number of contracts every specific CA has created.</p> What is Ethereum account abstraction? <p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/data-abstraction">Data abstraction</a> in computer science translates to hiding information to increase efficiency. For example, a software developer can learn how to write a compiler or understand the mechanisms between the compiler, processors, or memory functions when building with high-level programming languages. Data abstraction keeps the 0s and 1s underneath, allowing developers to work directly with more friendly languages, saving time and allowing for more complex operations.</p><p>In the case of Ethereum, account abstraction seeks to eliminate the existence of two types of accounts by unifying them. Thus, a single contract account will be empowered to transact with tokens and create contracts, unifying both account types. Instead of being separate account types, both EOAs and CAs will fall under a single type.</p><p>With this change, transactions will move off the<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/modular-vs-monolithic-blockchains/"> blockchain</a> and onto the EVM, eliminating the distinction between accounts. Let’s look into what exactly motivates this idea, whether it is truly achievable, and what are its benefits.</p> Motivations for account abstraction <p>Earlier, we pointed out the problems with the existing technology of Ethereum accounts and how a lack of flexibility translates to a poor user experience. With the complexities involved in the current account model, the developers are severely limited in offering a better user experience.</p><p>The core motivation for account abstraction stems from the goal of reducing from two account types to only one account type i.e., contract type. A single account type for all the Ethereum accounts will enable developers to provide a seamless experience to users on a single account with the functionality to transact tokens as well as create new contracts. It will also make it easier for developers to create better protocols and services without the need to make distinctions between account types since transacting will be moved fully into the EVM and off of the blockchain protocol.</p><p>Another motivation for account abstraction is to offer a rich user experience such as <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-multisig-wallet">multi-signature</a> security, <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html">social recovery</a>, rate-limiting, creating allow/deny-list of addresses, and <a href="https://easyfinetwork.medium.com/meta-transactions-what-are-gasless-transactions-ee71b88d7fad">gasless meta-transactions</a>. Currently, only contract accounts (<a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/what-are-smart-contract-wallets-and-how-can-they-benefit-defi-users/">smart contract wallets</a>) are capable of offering these features, however, the UX offered by these accounts is hindered by relying on fluctuating gas prices. Additionally, since contract accounts cannot pay gas, the user needs an EOA to pay gas fees or leverage a relayer (usually centralized entities).</p><p>Account abstraction can offer the best of both worlds and drastically improve the user experience by taking steps toward a model where in the long term all accounts are contracts, contracts can pay for gas, and users are free to define their own security model.</p><p>To effect these numerous changes and pave the way for more implementations, better flexibility, and an upgrade in the Ethereum user experience, developers have created several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on account abstraction, spearheaded by<a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1576199517434949634"> Vitalik Buterin</a>, co-founder of Ethereum.</p> Proposed EIPs for account abstraction <p>EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal, which are the core methods through which updates and decisions are made on the Ethereum blockchain. Here are several EIPs that were proposed to tackle the issues of account abstraction.</p> EIP-86 (Status: inactive) <p>EIP-86 can be said to be the first EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) aimed at account abstraction. After an initial proposal to prepare a security abstraction, the<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-86.md"> EIP-86</a> proposed implementing changes that would abstract out signature verification and the nonce scheme. These changes would allow users to create contract accounts that are not hard-coded to follow the traditional model but could be programmed to use any signature or nonce scheme in transaction processing.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ECDSA</a> and the default nonce scheme were the only mechanisms providing account security in the traditional model. In the proposed model, all accounts would become contracts, contracts would be able to pay gas fees, and users could tweak the account security and implement their desired signature/nonce scheme.</p> EIP-2938 (Status: inactive) <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2938">EIP-2938</a> offers a restricted version of account abstraction. The proposal sought to allow smart contracts to function as EOAs, allowing them to initiate transactions and pay for gas. In EIP-2938, developers propose introducing a new type of transaction and two new<a href="https://github.com/crytic/evm-opcodes"> opcodes</a>, aiming to keep implementation simple and allow more complex features over time.</p><p>The account abstraction transaction type would contain three fields – nonce, target, and data – where data represents all parameters that the account abstraction contract must execute and the transaction must validate. In contrast, the target represents the smart contract with the logic to validate transactions.</p><p>EIP-2938 is a simple proposal. As such, it does not support several features of account abstraction like nonce abstractions and meta transactions and does not remove EOAs.</p> EIP-3074 (Status: in review stage) <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074">EIP-3074</a> takes another path, distinct from its predecessors attempted. Instead of converting smart contracts to EOAs, EIP-3074 tries to adapt EOAs, adding a few changes here and there to make them behave like smart contracts. </p><p>The proposal seeks to allow users to hand over control of their 'regular' accounts to a contract by signing a message with their account. With the signed message and two new opcodes, an invoker (the smart target contract) could initiate transactions in the EOAs instead.</p><p>EIP-3074 focuses on enabling transaction sponsoring and multicall execution and allowing users with EOA accounts to enjoy the benefits of account abstraction without creating new accounts or transferring their assets. The proposal could achieve flexibility, albeit it does not eliminate security concerns. Notably, users under EIP-3074 still have to back up their seed phrase.</p> EIP-4337 (Status: likely to be changed before activation) <p>The most recent proposal,<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337"> EIP-4337</a>, looks to improve smart contract wallets. In a drastic departure from the usual approach, EIP-4337 simplifies the creation and operation of smart contract wallets on Ethereum by sharing the load across the required on-chain and off-chain infrastructure.<br></p>Achieving account abstraction through EIP-4337. (<a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/account_abstraction_roadmap">Source</a>)‌ ‌<p>EIP-4337 eliminates the need for sending transactions, with users required to send a set of UserOperations instead. Bundlers then pack the UserOperations into a single transaction and send it to the EntryPoint contract, executing the transaction and compensating the bundlers duly. EIP-4337 eliminates the worry of subsidizing gas fees, but it fails to end the era of EOAs on Ethereum.</p> Use Cases <p>Ethereum account abstraction, when achieved, will drive several implementations and user experience changes and allow developers the freedom to build or operate accounts on their terms.</p><p>Account abstraction will also enable developers to use smart contract logic to determine not just the effects of transactions, but also the fee payment and validation logic. Hence it could allow several crucial security benefits such as multi-sig and smart recovery wallets, the ability to change keys without changing wallets, and quantum safety.</p><p>Here are some use cases which account abstraction will help bring to reality:</p>  Wallets: With account abstraction, users will be able to benefit from advanced security features such as multi-sig, and smart recovery as well as leverage the ability to change keys without changing wallets.  Sponsored transactions: Account abstraction will allow entities or their subsidiaries to transact in several ways, like paying fees on users' behalf and allowing users to pay gas fees in ERC-20 tokens, which will be converted and relayed to the blockchain as ETH.  Meta-transactions: With account abstraction, users can accept meta-transactions (gasless) and pay for gas without trusting a relayer.   So: Is Ethereum account abstraction the next massive change for the network? <p>While Ethereum account abstraction is not yet a reality, it has become a hot discussion topic since the success of the Merge. Over the years, Ethereum's developers have pushed back account abstraction, favoring urgent blockchain upgrades. </p><p>Now, it is only reasonable that Ethereum accounts become easier to use and understand and more welcoming to onboard the less tech-savvy. Ethereum account abstraction, as of now, appears to be the most likely way to effect a massive UX change for Ethereum to lead the mass adoption charge in crypto.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

    <p>TestZEN or tZEN is a testnet version of ZEN to be used for testing various products and services on Horizen, such as deploying a testnet sidechain, launching a token or NFT on TokenMint testnet, etc. tZEN is free and has unlimited supplies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can visit the Horizen tZEN faucet ( <a href="https://faucet.horizen.io/">https://faucet.horizen.io/</a> ) to get tZEN sent to either Sphere wallet or Cobalt wallet. You will receive 42 tZEN each time and there is no limit to how many times you can claim tZEN. The tZEN faucet is currently on MVP stage. New release coming soon with improved user experience and interface.</p>
 Mainchain Faucet – Send tZEN to Sphere Wallet 
<p>This is where you enter your testnet Sphere Address in order to receive TestZEN to Sphere Testnet Wallet.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Sidechain Faucet – Send tZEN to Cobalt Wallet&nbsp; 
<p>This is where you enter your testnet Cobalt Address to receive TestZEN direct to Cobalt!</p>
<p>You will also need the sidechain ID of the sidechain network that you will use the tZEN in. The sidechain ID can be found by clicking on Cobalt, clicking the hexagonal shape in the upper right corner and it will be displayed on the bottom. We are using TokenMint testnet as an example here:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once you click on GET TZEN, you will see a “Transaction successfully created! Your funds will arrive shortly.” You can track the transaction on the sidechain block explorer and activity history in Cobalt.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You will receive a fixed amount of 42 tZEN each transaction. </p>

 PHASE 1&nbsp;Update  Game of&nbsp;Chains✨ <p>Dear Cosmonauts,<br>Phase 1 of Game of Chains is officially COMPLETE!</p><p>Read on for an update on how it&nbsp;went:</p><p>Game of Chains will be running for the rest of the month of November. In our first week of running the public incentivized testnet, we experienced some delays with launching consumer chains, however those bugs have been fixed! Validators, read on for more information on when to expect those governance proposals during Game of&nbsp;Chains!</p> HIGHLIGHTS 🎉 <p>We started Game of Chains on November 7th by launching two “dummy” consumer chains — Apollo and Sputnik. While we had over 150+ validators sign up, we currently have about 90 validators in the active set. You can check out the group of validators <a href="https://provider-explorer.goc.earthball.xyz/validators">here</a>.</p><p>We’ve also launched a public <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">leaderboard</a> that anyone can follow to see which validators are in contention for WINNING Game of Chains! This <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">leaderboard</a> is a running tally and we will try to update it on a regular basis as tasks are submitted and evidence is confirmed. You can check out how the judges will be evaluating validator participation <a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022">here</a>.</p> Bugs, bugs, bugs!&nbsp;🐜🐜🐜 <p>During the testnet a bug was discovered in Gaia (Cosmos Hub) with ICS v0.2.0. The result of the bug was that multiple consumer chains were unable to start. This bug was fixed, and validators were able to successfully upgrade the network to the version of ICS v0.2.1 on Friday November 11 (morning EST), following which validators successfully launched two consumer&nbsp;chains!</p><p>Additionally, relayer operators found that validator set updates were not being propagated. This was investigated by Hermes and Interchain Security teams (thank you to the Informal Systems team!) and a patch for Hermes is now available</p> Memes, memes, memes!&nbsp;😂 <p>We have testnet awards for the best memes generated by the community and we’ve already seen some great memes by Stakecito and Jabbey in Discord and on Twitter! Stakecito contemplates what <a href="https://twitter.com/stakecito/status/1590029735421444097">sabotage</a> might look like in Game of Chains and Chainapsis asks us to let that <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_ck89/status/1590634392141332481?s=46&amp;t=PmmoBj2Wb4A2zDs8RB5JnQ">sink&nbsp;in</a>!</p> Public Goods&nbsp;💗 <p>Thank you to all the validators that are supporting this testnet through block explorers, RPC end points and more. Some highlights of the public goods that we’ve seen so far&nbsp;include:</p>  Polkachu offering a variety of community <a href="https://polkachu.com/testnets/cosmos">tools and&nbsp;services</a>  PingPub added the ConsumerAdditionProposal to their dashboard and also offered RPC endpoints including <a href="https://provider-rpc.ztake.org/">this</a> one for the provider chain (Cosmos&nbsp;Hub)!  Thank you to Chainapsis for supporting Game of Chains through the <a href="https://testnet.keplr.app/chains/goc---provider">Keplr</a>&nbsp;wallet!   Auditing 🔐 <p>CrowdControl, Virtual Hive, and CryptoCrew have been investigating an issue where validator set updates seem to be inconsistent between provider and consumer chains. Plus, CryptoCrew published their script for auditing the validator set changes between consumer and provider sets (check it out&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/clemensgg/579983404afd4e906a4419fe4e81d100">here</a>).</p> Next Steps&nbsp;👇👇👇 <p>Over the next week, we will continue running Game of Chains, this time with consumer chains that are planning to launch in production once Interchain Security goes live! This includes the Generic Asset Issuance Chain (or GAH for short). This chain will host USDC when deployed, and hopefully other blue-chip assets in the future. We will also be running Duality, a novel DEX/AMM coming to Cosmos. You can read more about them&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dualityxyz/status/1590333430104932352">here</a>.</p><p>Following these proposals, validators will run Stride and Neutron — two additional consumer chains coming to&nbsp;Cosmos!</p><p>Last, but not least, thank you to the entire validators for your incredible support throughout Game of Chains. Interchain Security would not be what it is without the dedication of the Cosmos validator community. Cheers to you and stay tuned for updates on the next phase of Game of&nbsp;Chains!</p><p>About the Author:<br>Jelena Djuric works at <a href="https://informal.systems/about">Informal Systems</a> as product Marketing Manager. <br>Jelena is on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Gnomeskiiihttps://twitter.com/jelenaaa____">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/phase-1-update-game-of-chains-85a40bc27572">PHASE 1 Update — Game of Chains✨</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

This is obvious on the individual level – how you order goods, the way you chat with friends, and the news you consume… all from a handheld computer. It’s also becoming more obvious at the company level. The pandemic shook the world into remote work and many companies have decided that maybe work can be done in ways they never imagined.

Could the network rival the state?&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode we’ll explore what a nation state even is and how it may be challenged by a new Leviathan: the network. We also cover the difference between a nation and a state, how constants become variables, the cloud continent, digital power, your identity stack, calibrating risk, polycentric law, cloud regulations, building fast with atoms, founding vs inheriting, the powerful vs the powerless, and just about everything in between.</p><p>Timestamps:&nbsp;</p><p>0:00 - Introduction</p><p>2:41 - Nation vs state</p><p>14:38 - Constants becoming variables</p><p>16:12 - The cloud continent</p><p>20:10 - The three leviathans</p><p>30:00 - Digital power</p><p>37:20 - The identity stack</p><p>53:22 - Cloud first, land last</p><p>55:49 - Diplomatic recognition</p><p>1:01:47 - Root access to land</p><p>1:06:35 - Calibrating risk as society</p><p>1:16:13 - Regulatory harmonization</p><p>1:28:15 - Polycentric law</p><p>1:34:49 - Building fast with atoms</p><p>1:38:57 - Looking to history</p><p>1:42:00 - Founding vs inheriting</p><p>1:50:46 - The one commandment</p><p>2:17:33 - The powerful vs powerless</p><p>2:28:46 - The competition for people</p><p>2:33:45 - Historical lines</p><p>2:42:23 - v3 of governance</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Balaji’s Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">https://twitter.com/balajis</a></p><p>Balaji’s website: <a href="https://balajis.com/">https://balajis.com/</a></p><p>The Network State: <a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/">https://thenetworkstate.com/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find us on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.com/podcasts">https://a16z.com/podcasts</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund.

Off-ramping crypto usually requires users to transfer on-chain assets from their wallet into a centralized exchange (or first complete swaps on a decentralized exchange), where they can sell their crypto for fiat cash, then finally transfer funds to their bank account. The process can be costly and time consuming, as users often have to pay fees for each transaction they make with their crypto on-chain. If they have to swap their tokens multiple times, the process can become even more costly by triggering multiple taxable events.&nbsp;</p>

 In September 2022, the first ZenCon, the conference dedicated to the Horizen ecosystem, took place. It was the first opportunity to gather the whole team and the community around the same event. If you follow Horizen news, you've heard about Zencon0, the first event organized by Horizen Labs for the Horizen ecosystem. After five years, […]

    <p>In September 2022, the first <a href="https://zencon.events/">ZenCon</a>, the conference dedicated to the Horizen ecosystem, took place. It was the first opportunity to gather the whole team and the community around the same event.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/community-NA_V1700-Copie.jpg"></a><br>If you follow Horizen news, you’ve heard about Zencon0, the first event organized by Horizen Labs for the Horizen ecosystem.</p>
<p>After five years, it was time to celebrate Horizen’s accomplishments surrounded by those who were there to help lay the foundations of the project and all those who, along the way, came to bring their strength to take Horizen’s ecosystem even further.</p>
<p>At this level of expansion, it was essential to exchange thoughts. Horizen’s growth was made in the image of its decentralized blockchain. The team and community members are spread across all continents. To me, that’s what makes the project so strong. It’s a machine that never sleeps, designed with the help of a multitude of different cultures and interests. A successful scalability challenge!</p>
<p>Since its inception, the goal has evolved to reflect the community as it grows and changes.</p>
<p>That’s Horizen: In essence, it provides privacy through zk-SNARKs, and for all, it’s bringing privacy to life. This is an important issue for everyone who goes online and is careful with their digital footprint.</p>
<p>Another facet of Horizen is decentralization. The project started its Secure Nodes and Super Nodes system in 2018, which has since been in the top 3 most extensive networks, surpassing Ethereum and Bitcoin combined: It is unbounded by design.</p>
<p>Since then, Horizen has become the zero-knowledge-enabled network of blockchains, thanks to its impressive team of cryptographers.</p>
<p>That’s Horizen: A project that has brought together enough passion and talent to evolve continually.</p>
<p>This story was told at Zencon0, through panels, presentations, brainstorming sessions, and aperitivos. It was an absolute pleasure and hype machine to work together, or simply to gather with blockchain and technology experts and enthusiasts at the center of all discussions for three days in a row.</p>
<p>Among the guests, I would like to highlight four Zenvangelists who were present. Michael, Guan, Jonghung, Jongchan, and Psyrax are more than Zenvangelists; they are OGs. Without them, the Horizen community would be very different. It was truly fantastic to meet all of them.</p>
 Interviewing Horizen’s Zenvangelists 
 Michael 
<p>We’ll start with the one from Australia, Telegram, Korea, and/or Discord, our dear Michael. If you’ve interacted with the Horizen community, you’ve probably come across him. He is now a Zenvangelist that cannot be ignored!</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG20220913215558-Copie.jpg"></a>Our dear Michael, who had the chance to pose with Rob Viglione
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an amazing experience meeting the teams behind Horizen and Horizen Labs. Being able to see firsthand how the companies and teams operate from such a professional standpoint really gave me a lot of confidence in the future success of Horizen. I have walked away inspired and with a lot of ideas to build something great on Horizen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting everyone in real life! I felt like I knew so many people, even though we had only previously connected online. Being able to meet in person was really special.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will definitely be there!</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V1798-Copie.jpg"></a>Our marketing team and community brainstorming about the Horizen community
 Guan 
<p>Without Guan, the Horizen community in China would not be the same. It feels like Guan was there when Horizen was founded. So much so that he has become essential. It was great to meet him finally to talk about Horizen, and his cats face to face.</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the zencon0 is good because everyone in Horizen’s ecosystem can meet each other in person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite part was I visited the Horizen Labs’ workplace. I witnessed the huge team expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s an amazing event, and I will be there next year!</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V2550.jpg"></a>The Horizen Labs office is superb! We enjoyed the rooftop and took this amazing picture.
 Psyrax 
<p>Psyrax also joined us. If you have needed support from Horizen, I am sure Psyrax assisted you. He is our node, mining – well – global Horizen expert. Psyrax also protects our Discord and Telegram communities by protecting them from scammers and bots!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed Zencon0. It was a really amazing experience to hear about what has been going on behind the scenes and listening to a great cross-section of society that can use the ecosystem. I really liked Sebastien Micke’s perspective and use case for NFTs and photographers retaining their digital rights to their productions.</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can’t say that I had a favorite moment, as the whole experience was great, but if I had to choose, I would say that networking across the conference with the new people that I met and being able to put faces to names I have only known through the computer.</p>
<p>Q: If we do Zencon next year, will you be there?</p>
<p>I will definitely be keen to attend next year. If the team announced dates and locations, I would book our flights in a heartbeat.</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V0480.jpg"></a>Jonghun (Zenvangelist, left) and Jongchan Hong at Zencon0
 Jonghun 
<p>Last but not least is Jonghun, our Korean OG. He was a long-time community member and has done a fantastic job promoting Horizen in his country. Thanks to him, our Korean community is bustling and passionate about the project!</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was such an honor for me to be able to attend this gathering of people interested in Horizen from all over the world. Also, I was excited to be able to announce the start of Horizen Korea in Korea for the first time at Zencon0. It was very beneficial because it was a place where people from various fields could share their thoughts on blockchain and Horizen. It was an opportunity for me to broaden my insight personally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked all the moments when I could see everyone in one space regardless of time zone. We communicated, but there were some delay issues due to the time zone, but the moment we communicated with everyone in one place was memorable. The discussion about Horizen Community is also very memorable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
 Community Spotlights at ZenCon 
<p>The community was in the spotlight throughout the conference, with three slots dedicated to the community. We even had the honor of sharing a panel with Lou Kerner to talk about the Horizen community’s presence in Asia, thanks largely to Guan and Jonghun, whom we introduced earlier.</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V1618.jpg"></a>Lou Kerner, Lucy Wang, Guan Yin, and Jonghun and Jongchan Hong talking during the panel.
<p>Even our Marketing team OGs went on stage. Thank you, Lucy and Erica, for shining a light on this beautiful Horizen community.</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V1480.jpg"></a>As you see, we were delighted to share the news!
<p>To conclude, I would say that the Horizen community is terrific. Everything started in 2017 as a cryptocurrency. Five years later, Horizen is an entire blockchain ecosystem, soon to have an EVM-compatible sidechain. Meanwhile, these steps would have been for nothing if we hadn’t done them with the community. Together, we are building the future of blockchain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In short, below are 7 benefits of using digital identities: <br><br>• Mobile-first solution<br>• Establishment of a framework of trust<br>• Smart city access<br>• Digital economy<br>• Financial and social inclusivity<br>• Enhanced portability<br>• Better understanding of the individual</p>



<p>Each of these benefits will be explained more in-depth below. But before we delve into the actual benefits of implementing and using digital identity frameworks in both the public and private domains, let’s first take a look at the definition of a digital identity.</p>



 What is a digital identity? 



<p>In essence, a digital identity is the accumulation of information on an entity held online&nbsp;by third parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you are interacting with a website or application you are always leaving information behind. Broadly speaking, all the data and information involved in someone’s digital identity can be divided into two categories: Digital attributes and digital activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital attributes include someone’s date of birth, official documentation (passports, driver license, etc.) serial numbers or other identifiers, a person’s medical records, banking details, etc. The second category -digital activities-, includes a person’s posts on social media, for example, purchase history, ‘Likes’ and comments, etc. The combination of these two categories constitutes someone’s digital identity.</p>



 The 7 benefits of using digital identities explained 



 Mobile-first solution 



<p>A primitive (but working) handheld mobile phone was unveiled by the now defunct American company Motorola back in 1973. It was a rather bulky and ungainly device that would take around 10 hours to fully charge. Nevertheless, the Motorola device heralded an inevitable shift towards mobile technology that continues today. (Current projections say that, by 2024, there will be around 17.7 billion mobile devices operating in the world.)</p>



<p>Society is going mobile, and as such, today’s society seeks more and more mobile-first solutions.</p>



<p>Digital identity enables this approach by using a digital wallet that enables users to take their credentials anywhere they go, and share them at any time, with whomever they want, and get authenticated by any entity, private or public, to easily access services.</p>



 Establishment of a framework of trust 



<p>Currently, identity networks and authentication methods are heavily fragmented. Every organisation, every agency, every institution has its own set of rules and guidelines that determine how people receive their credentials, and how they authenticate in their network. Because of this individualised disparity, a set of credentials accepted by one organisation might not necessarily be accepted by another. This issue is exacerbated when dealing with organisations from different countries. (Driving licenses and educational credentials perfectly illustrate this problem).</p>



<p>Establishing a trust framework between all participating organisations means that someone’s credentials can be instantly verified, regardless of geographical location or cross-border limitations.</p>



 Smart city access 



<p>Current urban enclaves, while modern and relatively safe, are far from smart. There still are many deficiencies and areas of improvement in terms of traffic and waste management, infrastructure, wireless access, etc. The Internet of Things (IoT) will enable several technological advancements that will improve these aspects, but it is a very different story for the individual.</p>



<p>As of today, 54% of the world’s population lives in cities, and the current projection is that this figure will reach 66% in about three decades. Because of this likely rise in urban dwellings, enhanced services and a positive and rewarding citizen experience are key factors for the success of smart cities. Citizens currently engage with urban’s infrastructures in different ways. Paying for parking or at the shop’s till with a smartphone, for example. Or using electronic tickets to speed up access to trains, buses, or other methods of transportation. But each of these services requires its own identification method. Together with an entire network and technical backend to manage access, permissions, and upkeep.</p>



<p>A truly smart city begins with digital identity to drive engagement and efficiency. Individuals need to engage with government, public and private bodies, and other agencies digitally and expeditiously, so the experience is seamless and positive. This will lead to further engagement.</p>



 Digital economy 



<p>Digital identity truly is at the heart of a paradigm shift in digital engagement. Too much friction in the interaction with governments and service providers holds people back from engaging further, which in turn leads to economic stagnation. In the world of today, people expect fast and immediate digital service, whether it’s from their internet provider or the WiFi service at the airport.</p>



<p>The digital economy is the background for the digital identity scene. Digital identification drives inclusive growth, particularly when considering that around 1.7 billion people worldwide are financially excluded. This is because of lack of provable identity. If all those people were to own digital identities, a great economic value would be unlocked.</p>



 Financial and social inclusivity 



<p>Banks and other financial institutions would not risk lending to those people who could not effectively prove who they are. If credit or finance is denied, the individual might not be able to access proper education, or housing, or services. Progressively, someone would be left further and further behind. They would be excluded.</p>



<p>The provision of identity is the gateway for both financial and social inclusivity. Digital identity enables frictionless interactions with public and private institutions, including banks, of course. By enabling someone to have equal chances to access financial devices, people become included in society or education.</p>



 Enhanced portability 



<p>Traditional means of identification (driver licenses, passports, ID cards, etc.) are portable in the sense that people can carry them around. But some of these forms of ID might not be officially recognised in different countries, or even in different states within the same country. Academic credentials have the same issue. And in both cases, the individual depends on third parties to amend, share, or verify some of these documents.</p>



<p>The concept of portability in the context of digital identity applies differently. A digital ID is portable because it can be migrated and used elsewhere without friction, and in a way that is completely up to the individual to make the choices and decisions regarding his personal data.</p>



 Better understanding of the individual 



<p>People are complex entities with changing needs, attitudes, desires, and interests. In today’s always-connected world, commercial enterprises spend a lot of money researching the market to better streamline their product lines and target the right customer segments and demographics.</p>



<p>A digital identity that maps more accurately to an individual’s real-life identity will enable companies to achieve more personalised promotion and more seamless omni-channel marketing.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>When you think about it, identity is in everything we do. From greeting friends or family, to getting a loan from the bank, or purchasing insurance. We take all this for granted. Yet for many millions of people, things aren’t as easy or straightforward when it comes to accessing finance or services. The lack of identity hampers thriving.</p>

<p>Blockchain-based applications are poised to change the way people all over the world interact with money and value. But before we see adoption by millions of users, blockchain infrastructure will need to evolve beyond current capabilities to process far more transactions per second at low cost, without sacrificing security gained through sufficient decentralization. The delicate balance between these competing priorities has become known as the blockchain trilemma. Different approaches to balancing these goals and delivering a blockchain experience ready for global adoption were discussed by an all-star panel in the Scaling for 1B Users and Solving the Blockchain Trilemma main stage session at Converge22.&nbsp;</p>

   Paradoxically, while most blockchains consist of publicly available, open lists of records, it is extremely complicated to extract useful data from a blockchain.

<p>Paradoxically, while most blockchains consist of publicly available, open lists of records, it is extremely complicated to extract useful data from a blockchain. The blockchains most protocols are built on are optimized to be secure and tamper-proof but are sub-optimal (to say the least) for extracting intelligible information as the data is both difficult to access and difficult to&nbsp;decode.</p><p>Yet, as is true with traditional, database-backed applications, access and analysis of on-chain data is an essential part of any substantial application. Today developers are forced to build and operate complex infrastructure (running blockchain nodes, setting up a storage and querying system, ETL, etc.) and to develop a deep understanding of the inner workings of smart contracts in order to extract, process, analyze, and display historical on-chain&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://agnostic.engineering/">Agnostic </a>is tackling the issue of blockchain data accessibility by providing a platform to help developers access decoded data in real time. The team at Agnostic have developed an automated pipeline to index smart contract calls and events with no manual action needed to add new contracts and, hence, avoid re-indexing the whole chain. Written for developers, the team at Agnostic are building for the real use cases web3 builders are currently facing.</p><p>What’s even better than that? All of this happens in a PostgreSQL- and GraphQL-compatible engine so your existing developers can immediately be productive and your existing SQL-enabled tools will work out of the&nbsp;box.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Web3 is riddled with complexities for users, including incoming developers who want to build new applications. Having programmatic access to decoded data through familiar, industry-standard mechanisms will allow a new swath of developers to easily build apps, and as the number of developers continues to grow exponentially, the Web3 infrastructure and dev tooling market will naturally grow in both breadth and adoption. Rather than making every new Web3 developer essentially start from scratch, Agnostic brings a simple SaaS experience with an interface familiar to essentially every Web developer on the&nbsp;planet.</p>

<p>Many people consider space to be the next frontier and equally an infinite horizon to explore. But the reality is that not all “space” is the same and there are strategic zones that don’t only matter up there – but down here on Earth. Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) is one of those regions – a zone filled with satellites that support life on Earth, from agriculture to climate to navigation to defense. Unfortunately, these live satellites are not alone in our space highways. LEO is getting increasingly clogged with space debris; we’re polluting our skies just like we’re polluting our land.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with all three cofounders of Privateer – Steve Wozniak, Alex Fielding, and Dr. Moriba Jah, as they explore just how much junk is up there, how this challenge is expected to progress with time due to lower launch costs, and ultimately, what infrastructure is missing in this fragile ecosystem – from tracking to global treaties to a sharing economy of satellites.</p><p>By the end of the episode, listeners should be more equipped to understand how our infrastructure in space vastly impacts life on Earth, how the preservation of this ecosystem is crucial, and how Privateer is providing the map to better understand and fix the issue.</p><p>Timestamps:&nbsp;</p><p>With Steve Wozniak</p><p>00:00 - Intro</p><p>3:24 - Why space and why now?</p><p>8:55 - The changing perception around space</p><p>13:29 - Exponential technologies and thinking different</p><p>16:32 - Inventors vs engineers vs visionaries</p><p>18:46 - Early days at Apple and moving towards the future</p><p>20:53 - Steve’s personal fascinations</p><p>23:58 - How vocabulary drives awareness</p><p>1:21:55 - Woz returns!</p><p>With Alex Fielding and Dr. Moriba Jah</p><p>24:43 - Is space really an infinite void?</p><p>25:55 - The growing pollution in space</p><p>29:14 - The impact of space down on Earth</p><p>30:34 - The challenge of space policy and governance</p><p>38:27 - Orbital highways and carrying capacities</p><p>41:05 - Dependence on space infrastructure and its fragility</p><p>45:14 - Privateer’s role in the evolving ecosystem</p><p>46:52 - Democratizing space through data sharing</p><p>49:45 - Can we undo the damage that’s been done?</p><p>52:01 - Determining intent in space</p><p>58:17 - Talent needed in the space industry</p><p>1:01:04 - Privateer’s biggest challenges</p><p>1:09:22 - Space stewardship and Hawaii’s kuleana</p><p>1:15:19 - Who inspires Alex?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Privateer’s website: <a href="https://mission.privateer.com/">https://mission.privateer.com/</a></p><p>Privateer’s Wayfinder tool: <a href="https://mission.privateer.com/">https://mission.privateer.com/</a></p><p>Privateer on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/PrivateerSpace">https://twitter.com/PrivateerSpace</a></p><p>Steve Wozniak on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz">https://twitter.com/stevewoz</a></p><p>Alex Fielding on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Alex__Fielding">https://twitter.com/Alex__Fielding</a></p><p>Dr. Moriba Jah on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/moribajah">https://twitter.com/moribajah</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find us on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.com/podcasts">https://a16z.com/podcasts</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund.

<p>TL;DR: Basic Attention Token announces its first Solana NFT collection, BAT x Adam Ape for Brave, expanding BAT utility in NFT marketplaces. Fans can discover the limited collection through Magic Eden’s NFT Launchpad, which brings them to a custom experience landing page powered by Cardinal, where they can connect via their Brave Wallets and buy the NFTs with SPL BAT or SOL.</p>
<p>Today, Basic Attention Token is announcing its inaugural Solana NFT collection, BAT x Adam Ape for Brave, <a>increasing support for BAT / NFT utility</a> within NFT marketplaces. The launch follows Brave’s <a>May 2022 integration</a> with the Solana blockchain to expand Web3 access. That same day, Brave unveiled its partnership with <a href="https://magiceden.io/">Magic Eden</a>, Solana’s largest NFT-based Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BAT and Magic Eden have also joined forces with <a href="https://www.cardinal.so/">Cardinal Labs</a> to make BAT x Adam Ape one of the first collections on Solana to launch with the new <a href="https://cardinal-labs.notion.site/Cardinal-Creator-Standard-3963436c5f634ff99da2b0e32800fe54">Cardinal Creator Standard</a>, which enforces royalties at the protocol level on all secondary trading. The decision aligns with Brave’s long-standing mission of supporting digital creators and Magic Eden’s commitment to exploring new creator-supporting models, particularly as more marketplaces shift towards making creator royalties optional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fans will discover and access the BAT x Adam Ape collection through <a href="https://magiceden.io/launchpad/bat">Magic Eden’s NFT Launchpad</a>, which redirects them to a custom experience <a href="https://mint.cardinal.so/bat">landing page, powered by Cardinal Labs</a>. There, fans can connect via their Brave Wallet (or another Solana DApp wallet) and purchase the NFTs with <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">Solana v2 Wormhole BAT (SPL BAT or “wBAT”)</a> or <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">Solana (SOL)</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 BAT x ADAM APE FOR BRAVE&nbsp; 
<p>Basic Attention Token partnered with <a href="https://twitter.com/adam_ape_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Adam Ape</a>, a renowned multidisciplinary artist in Web3 and the traditional graphic design and digital animation space, to launch its 2500-piece genesis collection: BAT x Adam Ape for Brave. Together, they created four PFP-style NFTs, modeled after Brave’s logo. Each of the four NFTs—respectively named The Curious, The Dabbler, The Degen, and The Sage—is dynamically animated with facial expressions and sound effects and represents one of four stages of immersion in Web3. Read more about the inspiration behind the NFT designs <a href="https://magiceden.io/launchpad/bat">here</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>The first three NFTs in the ordered set, Curious, Dabbler, and Degen, will mint randomly, meaning holders won’t know which piece they’ll receive until after they mint. Holders who collect all three may later have the option to burn the set to obtain the legendary-tier Sage, of which there will only ever be 300 in existence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presently, there are no guarantees of additional utility for BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT holders. However, we’re looking forward to engaging with Adam Ape and the BAT Community to explore different utility possibilities for holders of each tier, including Sage holders, over time.&nbsp;</p>

 LAUNCH FAQ 

 Is there a Discord I can join for this project? 
<p>Yes, please join our <a href="http://discord.gg/batbrigade">BAT Brigade Discord</a> community to stay up to date with the latest information on the launch.</p>

 When does the NFT collection launch? 
<p>The BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT collection will officially launch on Thursday, November 10th, 2022.&nbsp;</p>

 Where can I buy the NFTs?

<p>Sale start times by timezone:&nbsp;</p>
 
 9:00 a.m. PST (UTC -8) 
 12:00 p.m. EST (UTC -5) 
 5:00 p.m. GMT (UTC +0)

<p>The 300 legendary-tier Sages are not included in the initial mint supply of 2500 NFTs. However, they will become available at a future date for holders of Curious+Dabbler+Degen sets who want to burn their set to obtain a Sage.</p>

 What currencies can I use to buy the NFTs? 
<p>The NFTs will be available to purchase with <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">Solana v2 Wormhole BAT (SPL BAT or “wBAT”)</a> or <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">Solana (SOL)</a>, and cost 3 SOL each or the BAT equivalent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 How do I get SPL BAT or “wBAT”? 
<p>There are several options for buying or bridging SPL BAT on Solana:&nbsp;</p>
 
 You can buy wBAT directly in the Brave Wallet with Ramp’s fiat-to-crypto onramp or swap an existing SOL balance for wBAT.&nbsp; 
 
<p>


    





    
    




    





    
    
</p>
 
 Use the Wormhole Bridge to bridge $BAT from Ethereum to Solana.&nbsp; 
 

 I already own BAT. How do I convert my BAT into SPL BAT? 
<p>You can bridge your BAT from Ethereum to Solana through Wormhole’s <a href="https://www.portalbridge.com/">Portal Bridge</a>.</p>

 Where can I buy SOL? 
<p>You can buy Solana (SOL) with fiat or crypto directly within the Brave Wallet via Ramp, or from any cryptocurrency exchange that lists Solana.&nbsp;</p>

 What Web3 wallet can I use to mint the NFTs? 
<p>You can use your Brave Wallet or another Solana DApp wallet, such as Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, etc.&nbsp;</p>

 Can I mint NFTs with the Brave Wallet in my Brave mobile app? 
<p>Brave on mobile does not yet offer support for Solana DApps. We recommend using the Brave Wallet in a desktop version of Brave to mint your NFTs.&nbsp;</p>

 I am registered for Bravelist. Does that mean I get priority minting? 
<p>Yes. If you’re on the Bravelist and have registered your Solana wallet address and Discord ID, then you get priority minting. The <a href="https://mint.cardinal.so/bat">Cardinal-powered minting DApp</a> will detect your Bravelisted wallet upon connection and permit you to mint within the first two hours of the sale.</p>

 How many mints does Bravelist get me? 
<p>Bravelist permits you to mint 1 NFT per registered wallet. You will need to return during the public mint to mint additional NFTs.</p>

 I am not registered for Bravelist but I want to take part in the sale. How do I participate? 
<p>Once priority minting ends after two hours, minting will open up to the general public. At that time, anyone using a Web3 DApp wallet could connect and purchase NFTs with SOL.&nbsp;</p>

 How do I view my NFTs in the Brave Wallet? 
<p>NFT gallery view in Brave Wallet is still in development. We recommend viewing your NFTs in the NFT marketplace UI (e.g., <a href="https://coralcube.io/">Coral Cube</a>) if purchased on the Brave Wallet.</p>

 I want to sell, trade, or transfer my NFTs. Where can I do this? 
<p>You can sell, transfer, or trade your NFT from within <a href="https://coralcube.io/">Coral Cube</a>’s marketplace user dashboard with your Brave Wallet or Solana DApp wallet connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also access Coral Cube directly from the <a href="https://mint.cardinal.so/bat">minting page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 I own a Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFT. When can I burn them to get a Sage? 
<p>After the conclusion of the mint, we will publish a follow-up announcement detailing how to burn your Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFT set to obtain a legendary-tier Sage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, there will only ever be 300 Sages in existence, so not everyone can get one. Join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/batbrigade">Discord</a> and follow us to <a href="https://twitter.com/AttentionToken">Twitter</a> to get project updates first.</p>

 When will you reveal utility for each of the tiers? 
<p>There are no guarantees of additional utility for BAT x Adam Ape NFT holders at the time of the mint. However, we’re looking forward to engaging with Adam Ape and the BAT Community to explore different utility possibilities for holders of NFTs from each of the four tiers.</p>

 How does Cardinal’s royalty-enforcement mechanism work? 
<p>Cardinal’s Creator Standard solution involves (1) a token-manager protocol and (2) a corresponding marketplace integration UI.</p>
<p>Coral Cube (secondary NFT marketplace) has integrated Cardinal’s marketplace manager UI and supports trading for tokens that use the token-manager protocol, including BAT x Adam Ape NFTs.</p>
<p><a href="https://cardinal-labs.notion.site/Cardinal-Creator-Standard-3963436c5f634ff99da2b0e32800fe54#30ae25de15a2418193525817d1b41072">Here</a>, you can read more about Cardinal’s Creator Standard, including the technical implementation details.</p>

They happen to pretty much everyone, but whether a company is prepared to recover from it depends on multiple factors, from their level of understanding of the risk to the data protection tools they have at their disposal.

 Ready. Set. Secure! Game of Chains kicks&nbsp;off!  Cosmos Validators, Let’s&nbsp;Go! Are you&nbsp;ready?<p>Starting November 7 2022, over the next 2–4 weeks, 150+ validators will participate in Game of Chains — the latest public incentivized testnet in the history of the Cosmos&nbsp;Hub!</p><p>Game of Chains will help validators develop confidence around running Interchain Security — a highly anticipated feature coming to the Cosmos Hub in January 2023. Interchain Security will allow blockchains to leverage the high security of the Cosmos Hub (currently at a market capitalization of ~USD $4B). Because the security of a proof of stake network is closely tied to the value of the blockchain itself, a relatively strong market cap ensures reliable security for blockchains looking to maximize their security!</p><p>In the short term, and before permissionless deployment is available, consumer chains (those “consuming” security from the Cosmos Hub) will be required to go through governance to get their chain admitted by the validator set. This “governance gated” process will make it such that validators have ample time to vote, accept and ultimately run the node of the consumer&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Game of Chains will give validators a flavor of what to expect once the feature is live! Through the various GoC phases, validators are expected to build an understanding of ICS and help us discover interesting attack&nbsp;vectors.</p><p>The testnet infrastructure will&nbsp;include:</p>  Provider chain  Multiple consumer&nbsp;chains  IBC relayers  Support services  <p>Over the 3 phases of Game of Chains, validators will complete a series of predetermined tasks that prove their proficiency at running the ICS protocol. In each phase, points will be awarded to participants who complete certain tasks. Validators at the end of the testnet who have completed the most amount of tasks will be eligible for awards. Please see a detailed breakdown of the phases and tasks&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022">here</a>!</p><p>Last, but not least, please remember&nbsp;that:</p>  Only Cosmos Hub validators in the active set are eligible to earn rewards in the Game of Chains testnet&nbsp;program.  Validators operated by employees of Informal Systems, Hypha, and Interchain Foundation are eligible to participate, but ineligible for&nbsp;rewards.   Good luck validators! 🎉⚛️🎉  Ready. Set.

 Tech and Product  Advanced Staking <p>Week after week, we’ve published updates on the state of Advanced Staking development and testing. Currently, we’re defining the remaining operational steps for its release, a topic we’ll touch on in <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1587534810460950530">our upcoming AMA.</a><br></p><p>Besides this, deployment scripts and readme are being reviewed. Minor reviews of the UI are also underway. We’ll soon publish a detailed guide about this milestone for our protocol!<br></p> Panther’s v1 release <p>This month, the development contributors have outlined and estimated resources for the remaining tasks involved in this release. This will help us better project and prepare for this milestone. A crucial ongoing step is finalizing all the zero-knowledge circuits needed, based on the possible user flows.<br></p><p>Work has also started on a project preliminarily called zTrade. This functionality will enable v1 users to swap assets within Multi-Asset Shielded Pools.<br></p><p>Our DeFi integration project is moving forwards as well. We have completed our DeFi Adaptor product definition, with its implementation to begin this month. A new Blockchain Architect will also join in early November to lead the cross-chain project.</p> Community  Panther Discussion Forum <p>On October 4th, we released Panther’s Official Discussion Forum, a space for all of our community to engage in the discussions that will decide Panther’s future.<br></p><p><a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/">Access it now</a> and play your part in steering our trajectory!<br></p>Progressive decentralization at work!<p>To facilitate community-led decision-making for the Panther ecosystem, independent moderators manage the Discussion Forum. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_YAuq0Xdt-MOpZWe1gOR-GdlCwtixhK6VBoZnQe6USF37nQ/viewform">Please fill out the application form</a> if you are up for the task.</p> Leading Privacy Alliance <p>The <a href="https://www.leadingprivacy.com/">Leading Privacy Alliance (LPA)</a> is an initiative that brings together Web3 firms and organizations with the common objective of increasing privacy in crypto and beyond. <br><br>"Our ultimate goal is to raise awareness about the current state of privacy, implement solutions to these problems, and educate users and projects about the fundamental role of privacy in the technology we build and use.”<br></p><p>The initiative was <a href="https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2022/10/leading-privacy-alliance-launched-prior-devcon-in-bogota">launched</a> on October 9th, just before Devcon Bogota, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-joins-the-leading-privacy-alliance/">where Panther became one of its very first members</a>. Adam Spiers, our Senior Architect, spoke on the stage during the inaugural event, outlining why Panther decided to join this movement.<br></p>“As a project that aims to enable trust and privacy in the DeFi space, it is a natural fit for Panther to join the LPA. We strongly believe that the sector's stakeholders need to form a coalition to defend the right to privacy.” Events  Devcon Bogotá <p>This October 11th-14th, contributors of Panther attended <a href="https://devcon.org/">DEVCON Bogotá</a>, in Colombia! DEVCON always involves attracts the very best in the industry, and there were lots of discussions about partnerships, protocol-building, and the future of Ethereum with other blockchain developers. <br></p><p>We also got the opportunity to chat with Panther backers and believers and distribute some Panther swag! <br></p>Our farewell picture. See you at the next event! World Ethical Data Forum <p>Panther also participated in and sponsored the <a href="https://worldethicaldataforum.org/">World Ethical Data Forum</a>. The WEDF is an event spanning multiple industries in tech, with discussions around the numerous outstanding issues surrounding the future of data.<br></p>Anish Mohammed, Co-Founder, was featured in the WEDF’s flyers.Co-Founder Oliver Gale gave a talk on the opportunities and risks in the DeFi space. Panther in the media <p>In his <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/10/21/the-web-is-moving-toward-a-new-paradigm-and-this-is-good-news-for-its-users/?utm_campaign=Social%20Member%20Articles&amp;utm_content=225508160&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-900461811576778752&amp;sh=51e373e3208f">first standalone article</a> for Forbes Business Council, Oliver Gale points out how the Web is changing towards a new open paradigm, the impact of these changes in users, and how businesses can adapt.<br></p><p>Oliver also authored <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/how-zero-knowledge-proofs-will-guarantee-compliance-for-defi-adoption/">a guest post for VentureBeat</a> on how zk-proofs will guarantee compliance for DeFi adoption. Oliver says,<br></p><p>“More than ever, protocols need to implement a rigorous approach to compliance. Regulators, on the other hand, must keep the focus on the appropriate actors in the Web3 space, as overreaching destroys the economic value otherwise available.”<br></p><p>For a change of pace, the Bloomberg Crypto podcast invited Oliver to talk about the crypto nomad lifestyle. Is it feasible to be a crypto nomad during a bear market?

<p>Recently the Anoma team posted benchmarks of zero-knowledge proofs. Zcash Halo is one of the zero-knowledge proofs being benchmarked, and we wanted to take an opportunity to share why Halo is even better than these <a href="https://twitter.com/adrian_brink/status/1576925949995933700">initial benchmarks</a> indicate.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/14/zcashs-halo-breakthrough-is-a-big-deal-not-just-for-cryptocurrencies/">Halo</a>, if you’re not familiar, is a trustless, recursive zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) discovered by Sean Bowe at Electric Coin Co. and was implemented in Zcash earlier this year. It eliminates the trusted setup (that’s huge!) and allows greater scalability (also huge!).</p>



<p>Within the Anoma evaluation, a small task was posed for the proof: proving and verifying a 3×3 Sudoku puzzle solution. The results showed that Halo was very efficient. It generated proofs within this program in less than 1/10th of a second and verified proofs in around 3 milliseconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>But when compared to other attributes of Halo, this efficiency might not even be what devs find most important when building out a ZKP tool. Halo stands out for three additional reasons:</p>



 
 Trustlessness — no “trusted setup” 



 Recursive — more about that superpower below 



 Extremely well-engineered for security and performance 
 



<p>Let’s dive into what each of these mean:</p>



 Halo is Trustless 



<p>When Zcash launched in 2016, its zero-knowledge proofs required a setup phase to produce public parameters that allowed users to construct and verify private transactions.</p>



<p>As our friend Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html">explains</a>, “A trusted setup ceremony is a procedure that is done once to generate a piece of data that must then be used every time some cryptographic protocol is run. Generating this data requires some secret information; the ‘trust’ comes from the fact that some person or some group of people has to generate these secrets, use them to generate the data, and then publish the data and forget the secrets.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the setup phase, these secrets had to be destroyed to prevent counterfeiting of Zcash. (There’s a great <a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony">Radiolab episode</a> about the first Zcash trusted setup ceremony.)</p>



<p>But Halo has no trusted setup. Halo eliminates the risk of ceremony compromise, increasing confidence in the soundness of the entire system.</p>



<p>Eliminating trusted setup also allows for greater protocol agility. New zero-knowledge protocols can be designed and deployed without requiring another run of the complex and dangerous trusted setup ceremony.</p>



<p>Most of the current generation of zero-knowledge projects rely on trusted setup, because trusted-setup ZKPs are super efficient, and because efficient-enough trustless ZKPs (like Halo) hadn’t been developed yet when those projects started a few years ago.</p>



<p>We’re betting that eventually most of the world will switch to trustless ZKPs and trusted setups will become a footnote of history.</p>



 Halo is Recursive 



<p>Halo is recursive. That’s a technical term, but what it basically means is that it is scalable — you can use Halo to prove facts about arbitrarily complex programs and arbitrarily big data sets.</p>



<p>Halo’s recursive attributes allow for more scalable ZKP applications, and it’s also general purpose. This means that you can use Halo for any and all ZKP applications.</p>



<p>Halo supporting recursion also means that independent, mutually distrusting parties can cooperate to prove facts about their whole combined data set without sharing their private data with each other and without being vulnerable to the other participants cheating. That is a really interesting and never-before-seen capability. We’re&nbsp; looking forward to seeing what people do with it!</p>



<p>Historical note: Halo was the first zero-knowledge proof system ever discovered that is both trustless and recursive.</p>



 Halo is Secure and Efficient 



<p>We engineered Halo for industry-leading security and performance. Unlike other next-generation zero-knowledge proof systems, Halo 2 comes with a <a href="https://zcash.github.io/halo2/design/protocol.html">proof of its security</a>. Writing a proof of security is a difficult and time-consuming process that most cryptographic engineers skip, but it gives greater assurance that the cryptography works as intended.</p>



<p>The flagship implementation of the Halo algorithm is maintained by the legendary cryptographic engineering team at The Electric Coin Co — the team whose pioneering work is the basis of more or less all zero-knowledge proof technology in use today.</p>



<p>Our Halo implementation has been audited by multiple independent experts, and it is <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash">live on Zcash mainnet</a>, protecting Zcash users and ZEC holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Halo 2 implementation (an improved <a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1300850821223964672?lang=en">edition</a> of Halo) is open-sourced under Apache/MIT, and is free to use. This means anyone can use it for any purpose without requiring our — or anyone’s — permission.</p>

<p></p><p>The word anarchy stems from the Greek word “anarchos”, which means “without ruler.” For some, the term “anarchy” draws associations with lawless states of chaos from the past. However, the term in its contemporary sense is used to refer to a vision of society that is absent of unjust hierarchy and coercion. One of the key concepts within the contemporary anarchist vision is that people are, by nature, equal to one another, and should be free to live in ways that reflect this equality. Anarchists respect all individuals who develop skills and knowledge bases that have beneficial applications.</p><p>In the internet’s early days, it was structured more in accordance with anarchist ideals, offering users privacy and a less hierarchical experience. Today, the internet is dominated by government and Big Tech players that have eroded personal autonomy and transparency.</p><p>Everyone has a fundamental right to privacy. These days, pushing back against the tide of insidious data collection and online privacy infringements requires the deployment of anarchist-inspired notions of self-determination and privacy as freedom. Wrenching some sovereignty back from overreaching companies, organizations, and government agencies is feasible with the help of privacy-minded tools and strategies. Let’s take a closer look at how digital initiatives that promote greater freedom and autonomy are embracing anarchist principles.</p> What is Crypto-Anarchy? <p>The internet is at the root of how many people organize their lives. For this reason, most contemporary discussion of personal freedoms tends to be centered around the right to digital privacy.</p><p>The prefix “crypto” is often used negatively to refer to groups who have hidden motives or views. For instance, the term “crypto-fascist” refers to those with fascist views who hide their fascism in order to avoid stigma or consequences. On the other hand, the “crypto” prefix used in the term “crypto-anarchy” refers to strategies for cultivating autonomy that make use of cryptography tools.</p><p>As such, while crypto-anarchy is rooted in strategies that foster privacy and anonymity, these goals themselves are not obscured by crypto-anarchists. In fact, many crypto-anarchists are actively involved in promoting the importance and value of digital cryptography tools.</p><p>Historically, anarchism itself has been associated with left-wing thought, and anarchy’s aversion to hierarchical structures draws associations to communalism and libertarian socialism. However, crypto-anarchy today has links to anarcho-capitalism, too—a right-libertarian political philosophy centered around ownership of private property absent of centralized control.</p><p>Anarcho-capitalism calls for a voluntary society that individuals design themselves with the help of private agencies; in an ideal anarcho-capitalist society, individuals would voluntarily opt into contracts of participation designed to fulfill the will of the people.</p> Anarchy and Privacy <p>Anarchist thought is largely centered around skepticism towards coercion from intrusive governing forces. Personal privacy is widely regarded as an inalienable right. For instance, the<a href="https://unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/peace-human-rights-and-humanitarian-response/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmouZBhDSARIsALYcouoZ7jXgVP3CDqdgZjyPAWaKjedWEEMsEuuhZKkhkaWQYFjZyuBiwUgaAoEBEALw_wcB"> UN’s Declaration of Human Rights</a> states: “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence.”</p><p>Freedom of thought, freedom of association, freedom of expression, and freedom from discrimination are all rooted in the individual’s right to create boundaries and to choose what to reveal and what to hide from others. Actions as simple and intuitive as putting on clothing or closing the bathroom door are rooted in our implicit understanding that there are aspects of ourselves we prefer not to share with others, for a number of reasons.</p><p>As individuals, we make countless decisions about our privacy every day. Insisting that our privacy is not violated without consent is an important way we protect ourselves from abuses of power. However, the ever-increasing role of technology in our lives has blurred our relationship to privacy. While we would naturally feel skeptical of anyone eavesdropping on our conversations, going through our mail, or searching our homes without a warrant, digital surveillance has created a<a href="https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-panopticon-what-is-the-panopticon-effect/#:~:text=The%20panopticon%20is%20a%20disciplinary,not%20they%20are%20being%20watched."> panopticon effect</a> in which it’s nearly impossible to tell who is collecting information about us, and for what purpose.</p><p>Crypto-anarchist tools offer users renewed awareness and control over what information they are sharing with external parties, which is an important step in eradicating privacy intrusions.</p> A History of Bitcoin’s Relationship to Anarchy <p>The principles that led to the development of Bitcoin are the result of a deep and sustained engagement with anarchist ideals. The original development of this technology can be traced to the Cyperpunks’ mailing list from the early 1990s—a virtual meeting place of early digital privacy enthusiasts.</p><p>The Cypherpunks are an example of a digital voluntary society. Many Cypherpunks communicated anonymously by way of aliases, and used cryptographic tools both as a matter of principle—believing in online anonymity as a path towards greater online freedom—and to seize the potential of the power of cryptography as a path towards decentralized and uncoerced economic transactions, for instance.</p> Challenges Facing Bitcoin’s Role as a Privacy Tool <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency. All transactions are permanently recorded and stored on the blockchain without the need for regulatory forces or third-party verification. These are essential aspects of its potential as an empowering and privacy-minded digital currency. However, these characteristics also require additional tools and strategies to ensure its capacity to maximize privacy and personal freedom.</p><p>Many newcomers to Bitcoin see it as a short-term investment vehicle, primarily focused on fluctuations in the price of bitcoin rather than the revolutionary potential behind decentralized money. Novice users may leave their bitcoin exchanges, which essentially negates the freedom-related benefits of Bitcoin.</p><p>Most popular cryptocurrency exchanges are centralized (CEXs), meaning third parties have control and oversight over users’ funds. The well-known expression “not your keys, not your coins” refers to the fact that those who have access to bitcoin assets’ private keys (CEXs) ultimately have control over the assets.</p><p>When users put their private keys in the hands of others, this is an aspect of their privacy (and freedom) that they are giving away in exchange for convenience.</p><p>The pitfalls of CEXs go beyond the privacy-related issue of private key ownership, too.<a href="https://crystalblockchain.com/articles/the-10-biggest-crypto-exchange-hacks-in-history/"> Major crypto exchange hacks</a> have occurred in the past, resulting in users losing their bitcoin. Some bitcoin exchanges, including<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriga_Fintech_Solutions"> Quadriga</a>, have been outright scams, defrauding users of their money.</p><p>One of Bitcoin’s most integral features is how it offers users the ability to have custody of their own assets, without fear of outside interference. An understanding of the fundamental principles of Bitcoin and the history of its development is an important aspect of learning how to use it as a defensive privacy tool.</p> Defensive Tools to Establish Personal Privacy <p>Those with limited familiarity with Bitcoin often presume it to be an anonymous currency, but the opposite is true. Bitcoin operates under principles of transparency, which allow all transactions on the blockchain to be publicly viewed and verified.</p><p>Users’ public keys can be linked to past transactions, which can be linked to users’ personal identities through Know Your Customer (KYC) policies. KYC requires that merchants collect data about their customers. For instance, if you use Bitcoin to purchase an item from a website, that website may collect your address and other information, creating a link between that information and your Bitcoin address. Users’ IP addresses can also be linked to Bitcoin transactions, leading some users to enlist services that hide their IP addresses.</p> Anonymizing Strategies <p>New tools have been emerging that seek to improve Bitcoin’s privacy in order to give users more control over how personal data is shared.<a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/how-coinjoins-fix-bitcoin-privacy/"> Coinjoin</a> is one popular anonymizing strategy for Bitcoin. Coinjoin works by allowing users to temporarily join their funds together, acting as a kind of opaque wall between previous and future transactions.</p><p>Additionally, privacy experts tend to recommend privacy-minded internet browsers to make bitcoin-related activity less publicly viewable.<a href="https://www.torproject.org/"> Tor</a>’s browser is a well-established anonymizing tool. Its free browser gives users the ability to mask their web activity from outside parties using multi-layered encryption. When it comes to communicating about cryptocurrency transactions, experts recommend end-to-end encrypted messaging services like<a href="https://signal.org/en/"> Signal</a>.</p> Wasabi Wallet <p>Privacy-minded digital wallets are an effective way to maintain control over your bitcoin and to address the privacy concerns inherent to Bitcoin.<a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/"> Wasabi Wallet 2.0</a> is a privacy-focused bitcoin wallet that is user-friendly and offers a shortcut to the privacy-enhancing benefits of Bitcoin as a tool for crypto-anarchists.</p><p>Wasabi Wallet is a zero-knowledge tool, which means its developers collect no information about users. Making use of the Tor network, block filtering, and coinjoin technology, Wasabi Wallet 2.0 is trust free. It is also a non-custodial wallet, giving users control over their own private keys, offering the full self-determining potential of Bitcoin.</p> Wasabi Wallet as a Defensive Technology <p>Without access to the right tools, protecting oneself from insidious surveillance and data collection can feel overwhelming. Across the internet, privacy and security issues are widespread, and many web-based services are oppressively hierarchical, offering little to no independence and freedom for users.<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">According to one study</a> from the Pew Research Centre, four in five Americans feel they have little to no control over how their data is viewed and collected online, and around the same number believe the pitfalls of this digital surveillance outweigh any benefits. The same study shows that well over half of Americans are concerned about digital surveillance.</p><p>Those interested in preserving their privacy online have rightfully gravitated towards Bitcoin and the crypto sphere, which has a history rooted in strong-willed individualism in the face of intrusion from overbearing institutions. While some people associate the term “anarchy” with the avoidance of rules or consequences, the opposite is true—crypto-anarchist ideals are centered around transparency, equality, and fairness for all. Privacy is a key component of personal freedom, and tools like Wasabi Wallet help users defend their individual online property rights as part of a path toward a more liberated life.<br><br></p>

<p>Have you ever dreamed of opening your own hotel? Did you ever harbour aspirations to transform an old and dilapidated building into an alluring art-deco establishment where literary types gather to sip tea and compare notes about their latest masterpiece? Maybe you have, at some point in your life, imagined an opulent opening day, when the Grand Crypto Hotel welcomes its first set of guests through its revolving doors.</p>



<p>Back in the day, you would have to be a millionaire, or a real estate tycoon to be able to open such a hotel and partake in hotel ownership. But what if I explained that there is a way that you can own a part of that hotel without great wealth? Is your interest piqued yet? Sit down there beside the fire and listen while I tell you about tokenisation. It won’t take long, I promise.<br></p>



 A brief history of tokenisation<br> 



<p>In today’s technology-savvy world, we understand tokenisation as the process of turning sensitive data into non-sensitive data tokens. That then can be shared or traded without compromising the underlying information. Banks use tokens to transmit banking details to a payment processor, for example, to prevent data breaches.</p>



<p>But tokenisation itself is a concept as old as mankind itself. Clay tokens used to count, store, and communicate financial data are known to have been used circa 4,000 BC in regions today known as the Middle East. Early tokens were individual pieces made in different sizes to represent quantity. Later, the tokens would be etched with lines or dots to denote the quality of whatever they represented.</p>



<p>These early tokens were used for administrative purposes, in local economies. Much later, they led to the advent of writing. So from the very beginning, tokenisation has been used to convey information. Data.</p>



<p>This trend of representing data continues today, albeit in a more sophisticated fashion, more in accordance with modern technology.</p>



 Tokenising the hotel industry<br> 



<p>If you ask any hotelier what their main business goal is, you’re likely to hear that their focus is to increase occupancy rates, and maximise revenue per room, commonly known as RevPAR. Millions of hotel rooms worldwide lie unoccupied, i.e., they’re not producing revenue. And as the pandemic made evident, being able to fill your hotel is never certain. So, in light of this economic quandary, hotel managers have been forced to reinvent the business and find alternative ways to make their establishments profitable again. Tokenising their hotels is one of these new ventures.</p>



<p>But how does<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft/project-management/"> tokenising a hotel</a> actually work, and what benefits does it bring? Tokenisation opens up two interesting avenues: Fast access to monetary resources (capital, in other words), and tokenisation-as-as-service.<br></p>



 Releasing capital, fast<br> 



<p>Hotels range from small, family-run establishments, to larger, franchise-owned mega buildings. The plot of land where they stand might be worth millions, and when considering the furnishings, equipment, ornaments, furniture, etc., the value of a hotel site might run into the billions. The problem is if the hotel has no guests, all that value is locked unto itself. In fact, it costs a lot of money just to have the place open, in terms of staff, energy consumption, water, etc.</p>



<p>During COVID-19, millions of hotel rooms remained dormant for the better part of two years, with many hotels looking for different ways to unlock all this locked capital. In this situation, the hotel owner could just sell the property, but this would mean finding a buyer, which is easier said than done, particularly in times of uncertainty. And if the property is sold, the hotel would obviously be in the hands of somebody else. This might not be in the seller’s best interest.</p>



<p>Tokenisation would enable the hotel owner to sell part of the hotel, by digitising the hotel’s assets through blockchain technology. Once the digital version of the hotel is uploaded to the chain in the form of tokens, the owner can begin selling these assets to different buyers. People would effectively own part of a hotel. The blockchain would keep all the information transparent and secure. So, the hotelier can track which tokens are sold, to whom, and at what price.</p>



<p>In this scenario, tokenisation enables the fragmentation of the sale (rather than selling the entire hotel to one person). This means that every investor retains what is called fractional ownership. In other words, you no longer need to be an eccentric billionaire to own a hotel. Or part of it, anyway.<br></p>



 Tokenisation-as-a-service<br> 



<p>Tokenising a hotel opens up brand new possibilities for turning a profit via blockchain, including tokenisation-as-a-service.<br>The digitisation process creates a perfect replica of the hotel on the blockchain, a ‘digital twin’, if you will. Using smart contracts, several specialised platforms now enable this virtual representation of your establishment to manage daily tasks.</p>



<p>These include maintenance, supplies, etc. through third-party contractors, for example. This has an immediate and obvious benefit: cost reduction, by a great margin. The hotel manager (the human one) can delegate all these tasks to the digital twin, and focus on more pressing matters. Tokenisation-as-a-service saves a whole lot of money and frees up a great deal of time.</p>



<p></p>



 How to tokenise your hotel: NFTs or FTs? 



<p>In the hotel industry, these differences can be explained through the example of tokenising a hotel. Let’s say you want to tokenise ownership of the hotel with fungible tokens, you can, for example, create a 100.000 hotel tokens, and each token represents ownership of 1/100.000 of the hotel. Every hotel token is the same and can be easily traded as each token has the same value.</p>



<p>As described above, tokenisation (in blockchain) is essentially the process of representing a certain item with one or more tokens, and it can be done in two ways, namely through fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens. Fungible tokens are interchangeable, for example every euro is the same as every other euro. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are all unique and can have different values, such as different art pieces or different car parts, etc.</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-hotels-customer-loyalty/">But you can also tokenise ownership of a hotel with non-fungible tokens.</a> In this case you could tokenise the hotel rooms, the hotel restaurant, the hotel ground, etc. Each of these assets has a different value and people could then buy these individual assets rather than a fraction of the whole hotel. To make things even more interesting, you could then also tokenise high-value assets such as the ground of the hotel for example, using fungible tokens.</p>



<p>In this example both ways of tokenisation are used to fractionalise ownership, just in different ways. But they can coexist and work together.</p>



 Conclusion<br> 



<p>Whether it’s a relatively small family-owned hotel, or a location of a major hotel franchise, tokenising hotels, or hotel rooms, creates real investment opportunities for small to medium investors. And from the hotelier’s perspective, it’s a win-win situation.</p>

 Diardi Election — Instructions <p>Hey guys, we hope you’re all doing&nbsp;well.</p><p>This article will go over how anyone can participate in the upcoming Diardi elections using the web application we created for&nbsp;it.</p><p>The application is available at <a href="https://election.scalaproject.io">https://election.scalaproject.io</a></p> Instructions  Create Account <p>You can create an account on the app just like you would on any other platform and log in with your credentials.</p><p>Click the “Register Now” button to fill in the information.</p><p>Note that you can use any name you want, but remember that this name will be displayed on the Elections dashboard, and everyone will be able to see&nbsp;it.</p><p>We recommend using your Discord username if you have one. For example, MasterMind#2808.</p> Dashboard <p>After the registration, you will be redirected to the Elections dashboard.</p> How does the election&nbsp;work? <p>Let’s introduce the mechanisms behind the Diardi elections.</p> vXLA <p>vXLA “voting tokens” are simply the same XLA coins you had in your wallet before the snapshot on October 31,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>You don’t have to do anything on your side to swap your XLA coins to vXLA. This has already been done on-chain at the snapshot&nbsp;time.</p><p>Those tokens are worth nothing and are only used to vote for applications on the election&nbsp;app.</p> Elections Process <p>The elections will end on November 18,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>During this period, you will be able to send your vXLA tokens to the election app to apply to become a Diardi node operator and also vote for the applications.</p><p>Obviously, you can vote for yourself!</p><p>Remember that 1 vote = 1&nbsp;vXLA.</p><p>After the election period is over, the candidates with the most votes will be elected to become node operators.</p> XLA Balance <p>Your current XLA coins always remain in your wallet. You can check by connecting to your favourite remote node or by syncing&nbsp;locally.</p><p>The vXLA voting tokens are only available when you are connected to the Diardi remote&nbsp;nodes.</p> Snapshot <p>After October 31st, you can send your coins back to any exchange if you&nbsp;want.</p> Number of node operators <p>Depending on the number of applications, we are looking for 32 or 64 Diardi node operators.</p><p>The Scala team will reserve some nodes for the core team members for testing and development purposes: 4 spots if 32 operators are elected and 8 spots if 64 are&nbsp;elected.</p> How to&nbsp;apply? <p>This section will explain how you can apply to become a Diardi node operator.</p> Requirements <p>Anyone can apply to become a node operator, but all candidates must be able to own and operate a server with a public IP&nbsp;address.</p><p>The server specifications would be similar to running a Scala node since the proof-of-algorithm is much faster than that of regular&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Thus, even a dual-core server will be plenty, but it will give you the upper hand if you have a faster server with a very stable/fast network. What’s given below will be recommended specifications for a Diardi&nbsp;node:</p>  8 cores  8 GB&nbsp;RAM  Minimum of 64 GB of&nbsp;storage  <p>Note: It is strongly suggested to use a VPS for better performance and stability!</p><p>If you believe you have all the requirements to become a node operator and you can commit to it, follow the steps&nbsp;below.</p> 1. Retrieve your Deposit&nbsp;Address <p>Once logged in, you can click on the “Copy Deposit Address” button in the Dashboard to copy your deposit&nbsp;address.</p><p>This is the address you will deposit your vXLA tokens&nbsp;to.</p> 2. Deposit your vXLA&nbsp;tokens <p>-&gt; From the GUI/CLI wallet<br>Open your GUI or CLI Scala wallet, ensure it is synced and then connect to the remote elections node.</p><p><a href="http://election-node.scalaproject.io:11812">http://election-node.scalaproject.io:11812</a></p><p>⚠️ IMPORTANT: You must use the election remote node to be able to access your vXLA tokens; if you use a regular remote node and send your real balance to the election wallet, it will be lost&nbsp;forever.</p><p>-&gt; From the Telegram wallet<br>You also can use the Telegram wallet to send vXLA tokens to the election application, and those who have an XLA account will be auto-generated to vXLA. You can verify this by running /balance which will show your vXLA&nbsp;balance</p><p>Simply use the following command to the Wallet Bot in Telegram:</p><blockquote>/withdraw vxla your_election_deposit_address all</blockquote><p>If you want to send only a portion of your balance use the&nbsp;command</p><blockquote>/withdraw vxla your_election_deposit_address &lt;amount&gt;</blockquote><p>Where amount is the number of vXLA you want to&nbsp;send</p> 3. Vote <p>Once you have deposited all your vXLA tokens on the application, you can vote for yourself (or someone else if you don’t want to apply to become a node operator) by clicking on the vote button next to your&nbsp;name.</p><p>You can click on the “View Votes” button to see all the votes you have cast, and you can click on the “View Transactions” button to see all the transactions that have happened on your deposit&nbsp;address.</p><p>You can verify all the vote counts by using the following address, view key, and the remote node&nbsp;above.</p><p>Address — SvkGTcFJj6u9qh4Gs6T9QCcvLLh1KV5qhba35fReeC8VDhDzbeSkDySQPVJgKSh6fxH7UNNtLbr6UF9RDSURiE2u2vTDjb9g5</p><p>View key — 92c064be19242b8a9f839a10eee2b581a219c859c06111238b8af05399edc208</p> Candidates Presentation <p>We want to allow all Diardi Node Operator candidates to introduce themselves and explain why they think they can be significant assets for the Scala project and community.</p><p>If you have submitted your application to become a node operator, you can now introduce yourself and provide more information to support your application.</p><p>Comment under this Trello card: <a href="https://trello.com/c/LclsOxJB/106-diardi-elections-candidates-presentations">https://trello.com/c/LclsOxJB/106-diardi-elections-candidates-presentations</a>.</p><p>Don’t forget to provide the username you are using in the Elections app!</p> Conclusion <p>The candidates with the most votes will be selected to become Diardi node operators. The Scala team will contact the elected operators on Discord or by&nbsp;email.</p><p>The details of the following steps will be announced on Discord and Twitter, for example, how to configure the Diardi&nbsp;node.</p><p>Happy voting!</p> Community 👋 <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact&nbsp;us:</p>  Website: <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">https://scalaproject.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">https://t.me/scalaofficial</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scalahq">https://twitter.com/scalahq</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/</a>  Scala Mining Stats: <a href="https://scalastats.com/">https://scalastats.com/</a>  Email: hello@scalaproject.io   <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/diardi-elections-instructions-46f2bba73acb">Diardi Elections — Instructions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>Oct. 2022 Volume 1 Issue&nbsp;4</blockquote><p>Hello community, it’s time for our October Monthly Update! We summed up our milestones achieved with partnerships, AMAs, and events for you to review. We want to keep our community members updated and well informed, so stay tuned to our monthly&nbsp;updates!</p> Partnerships <p>On Oct 16, zCloak announced our collaboration with Vitae3, an on-chain reputation product. With Vitae3, orgs can issue members identity and experience as non-transferable token, and members could claim that to build their on-chain profile. Vitae3 will serve as official management tool for zCloak Network and with extensive possibilities to product integration.</p><p>On Oct 20, zCloak Network announced its collaboration with&nbsp;.bit (dot bit), which is a blockchain-based, open source, decentralized cross-chain account system. In celebration of this joyful announcement, we set up a lucky draw giveaway using Cwallet with a prize pool of USDT and&nbsp;.bit accounts. We look forward to further collaboration with&nbsp;.bit!</p> AMAs <p>On Oct 6, Luci from 0x499 interviewed the founder of zCloak Network w3tester in their Delight Podcast. The topic was “As the cornerstone of the decentralized society: How should DID expand its utility?”</p><p>w3tester talks about W3C DID and data privacy extensively in this episode, and here are some main takeaways:</p>  Web2 data needs to be utilized in the Web3 world in some ways in order to enrich application scenarios of DID on-chain.  During the transition to the cyber world, DID will carry the mapping of Web2 identities and social relationships in the Web3&nbsp;world.  The future reputation of an individual or organization no longer depends on the endorsement of a centralized organization, but gradually accumulates through the interaction between decentralized parties in the&nbsp;system  A complete DID system needs to have four basic characteristics: an identifier system based on cryptography, a verifiable trust transfer mechanism, an identity data storage solution where users have absolute sovereignty, and protection of user&nbsp;privacy.  <p>Links for you to&nbsp;revisit:</p><p>Apple Podcast: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/cn/podcast/ep-18-w3tester-cn-%E5%9C%A8%E4%BA%BA%E7%B1%BB%E8%BF%9B%E5%85%A5%E8%B5%9B%E5%8D%9A%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E7%9A%84%E8%BF%87%E6%B8%A1%E6%9C%9F-did-%E5%B0%86%E4%BC%9A%E6%89%BF%E8%BD%BD%E8%BA%AB%E4%BB%BD%E4%B8%8E%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E7%9A%84%E6%98%A0%E5%B0%84/id1633780324?i=1000581759018">https://podcasts.apple.com/cn/podcast/ep-18-w3tester-cn-在人类进入赛博世界的过渡期-did-将会承载身份与社会关系的映射/id1633780324?i=1000581759018</a></p><p>Spotify: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/101ZzQ">https://open.spotify.com/episode/101ZzQ</a></p><p>Transcript in Chinese: <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jodlbaEO-kvX-7wtHo-ZaQ">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jodlbaEO-kvX-7wtHo-ZaQ</a></p><p>Transcript in English: <a href="https://zcloaknetwork.medium.com/0x499-interview-as-the-cornerstone-of-the-decentralized-society-how-should-did-expand-its-utility-cdd1bbac0ec8">https://zcloaknetwork.medium.com/0x499-interview-as-the-cornerstone-of-the-decentralized-society-how-should-did-expand-its-utility-cdd1bbac0ec8</a></p><p>On Oct 18, zCloak Network invited CyberConnect and their Head of BD Wenyi to a Twitter Space session on the topic of Decentralized Identity — Product and Visions. This was the first event zCloak held on the Link3 platform since we became a verified project on Link3.

Vic from Vic TALK was invited as the host, and zCloak’s founder w3tester and CMO Annabella attended as speakers. The AMA discussed mainly about how zCloak Network is building as a privacy-preserving safe house based on the technology of zero-knowledge proof. Both parties provided WΞSTs and Quest3 NFTs with a USDT giveaway for the audience. In the future, we hope to collaborate with SnapFingersDAO and its large community to explore more use cases for zCloak’s ideas and bring more joint events and talks to all our&nbsp;members!</p> Events <p>On Oct 8, one of our partners SnapFingerDAO published a detailed review of the zCloak Network&nbsp;project.</p><p>Here’s the link to the article: <a href="https://mirror.xyz/snapfingersdao.eth/TeeJ1dEO0XBbnOpXj1sYLonws8kqdSBUzzSZUA7uzY8">https://mirror.xyz/snapfingersdao.eth/TeeJ1dEO0XBbnOpXj1sYLonws8kqdSBUzzSZUA7uzY8</a></p><p>We announced our Invitation Event 1.0 beginning Oct 15 and ending Oct 31.

<p>With spring here in Australia, there’s no better sentiment for announcing the full decentralization of the Verida Testnet — a globally distributed project founded with Aussie roots. Our testnet name pays homage to the wattle, the <a href="https://www.anbg.gov.au/acacia/">Acacia</a> — the largest genus of vascular plants in Australia.</p><p>Over the last few months, the Verida team has been quietly preparing for an upgrade of the Verida Acacia testnet to provide a fully decentralized identity layer. In the early stages of the Verida network, it was much faster to create a centralized identity server. This allowed us to have a working network sooner rather than later. We’re entering the next phase of the network where we can provide a 100% decentralized network. Decentralizing identities is a critical step in that&nbsp;pathway.</p><p>Starting November 2022, we’ll progressively open the network to the public. This is a milestone step to seek valuable feedback and iterate, on our way to Mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p><p>The Verida Network comprises the underlying protocol, technology and documentation built by Verida. Developers can leverage the Verida SDKs to use and contribute to the code to improve the network. Service providers can deliver infrastructure to the network by running nodes that users can select to&nbsp;use.</p> 1. What do I need to&nbsp;do? <p>Developers will be required to update to the latest SDK. There are breaking changes as the protocol will now be looking up identities and data storage infrastructure from the blockchain. More details will be provided to developers closer to the testnet upgrade. Join our #acacia-testnet channel on Discord to stay up to date with the latest information.</p><p>End users will be required to update to the latest Verida Vault. This allows and empowers users to create new identities that are now decentralized. It’s a huge paradigm shift from the current Web2 model that collects troves of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Note: Due to the nature of this upgrade, the existing identities (DID’s) and data on the current Testnet will be reset. All data and identities will be lost unless you&nbsp;backup.</p> 2. What’s included in this Testnet&nbsp;upgrade? <p>We have a number of updates going live across the Verida network, Verida Vault and SDKs as part of the Acacia decentralized Testnet&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>This will include the following high-level updates:</p>  Decentralized DID Registry: The current DID registry is currently stored on a centralized server and accessed by the protocol via an API. This DID registry will be moved to live on-chain, giving anyone the ability to register their own identity on the network. This upgrade also includes a built-in “proof” mechanism that unlocks the ability to create a generic “data bridge” to prove verified off-chain data on any Verida supported blockchain.  Verida SDK: Updates to the Verida SDK to leverage the new blockchain based DID Registry.  Verida DbStore: Improvements to provide more access controls, an enhanced authorization token based security model and the ability to enforce remote deletion of databases.  Verida Vault: Updates to use the latest protocol SDK and to sponsor gas fees for verified mobile&nbsp;users.  Verida Connect: Enhancements to support the new token based authorization model and remote device access revocation.  <p>Our <a href="https://developers.verida.io/">Developer Portal</a> will be updated to reflect the changes as the Testnet becomes fully decentralized.</p> 3. What are the Acacia Testnet limitations? <p>With the public upgrade of the decentralized Acacia Testnet, it’s important for users and developers to keep in mind current constraints.</p>  The Acacia Testnet should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing purposes. It’s great for getting your application ready for&nbsp;Mainnet.  Data stored and accounts created on Acacia will not be transferable to Mainnet. These are separate networks, similar to Ethereum’s Testnets and&nbsp;Mainnet.  Verida is currently running the encrypted storage nodes for the Acacia Testnet. We will progressively open up the network to be operated by trusted node operators in the coming&nbsp;months.  The Acacia Testnet will continue to exist as a test network once the Verida Mainnet launches later this year. We’ll keep you updated on important dates.  You may encounter a few bugs and/or performance issues. We’ve done our best to make things work as smoothly as possible, but please remember, this is still a&nbsp;Testnet.  <p>Please report any issues by <a href="https://github.com/verida/support">opening a ticket on Github</a> or let us know in <a href="https://discord.verida.io/">Discord</a>, so we can fix them as soon as possible.</p> 4. How can I keep&nbsp;updated? <p>For any questions, issues or feedback relating to our Testnet launch, please join our community on <a href="https://discord.verida.io">Discord</a> and join the #acacia-testnet channel.</p><p>Stay up to date with our latest announcements, news, ideas and inspirations, join and engage on our community channels.

    <p>TokenMint is designed to provide a streamlined tokenization process for all users, with or without developer background. When first launched, the platform provided an easy and quick way to create fungible tokens. We are adding the NFT capability to TokenMint, which will enable the creation and minting of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on TokenMint. The NFT capabilities are live on the <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">TokenMint testnet</a> for anyone to test, while we also recently launched <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/tokenmint-nft-live-on-mainnet/">NFT capabilities on mainnet </a>as well!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To welcome this exciting milestone, we hosted an art competition for our community! It was exciting to see so many amazing NFTs created by our community, especially to see all of the new activity on our TokenMint platform. We hope that the community enjoyed this competition as much as we enjoyed seeing the creative entries!</p>

<p>Amman (Jordan), San Francisco (United States), November 1st, 2022 – A new hope for Human Rights in the Metaverse emerges as the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (UN-ESCWA) adopts Metaverse Safety Week, an annual global awareness campaign led by XR Safety Initiative (XRSI) that brings the world together to safeguard the Metaverse. XRSI’s Global Digital Policy Advisor, Kristina Podnar, made the announcement at the Arab SME Summit in the presence of global regulators and members of the Jordanian Royal Family.</p>



<p>UN-ESCWA is one of five regional commissions under the United Nations Economic and Social Council’s jurisdiction and promotes Western Asia’s economic and social development through regional and subregional cooperation and integration. XRSI is a San Francisco-based nonprofit Standard Development Organization (SDO) focused on helping build safe and inclusive emerging technology ecosystems.</p>



<p>Kristina Podnar, XRSI’s Global Digital Policy Advisor, noted that “the Metaverse is one of the most talked about modern technology concepts. As we look forward to activities that range from leisure and gaming to professional and commercial interactions, financial transactions, or even health interventions, we cannot shy away from the corresponding tough conversations around data protection and cybersecurity, ownership, misuse, interoperability, and portability. I am delighted that XRSI is facilitating conversations across sectors which will move all of us beyond talk and into action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the focus on bringing the world together and proactively addressing the Metaverse-related risk impacting humans and societies, XRSI celebrates the third annual awareness campaign between Dec 10th and Dec 15th. The Metaverse Safety Week is created and promoted by XRSI with these key focus agendas:</p>



  Encourage the Metaverse stakeholders, such as organizations, governments, academics, creators, and global citizens, to adopt the intervention for safety awareness by organizing conferences, meetups, and webinars, conducting internal employee awareness training, issuing transparency reports, digital asset distribution for promoting safety or making pledges related to safeguarding the Metaverse.  Help Governments, Big Tech, Academia, Think Tanks, Civic Organizations, and Communities worldwide understand how they can combine resources and play leadership roles to stay ahead of the challenges that the Metaverse brings along.  Create a better and safer Metaverse for all by spreading awareness and promoting policies, guidelines, safety frameworks, and research.  



<p>Kavya Pearlman, the XRSI CEO, notes that “Metaverse brings new economic opportunities and enables several profound innovations to life but also brings along safety, privacy, and ethical risks. Each year before the holidays, the world must come together to ensure that we engage with the Metaverse technologies with safety, security, and human rights at the forefront. By dedicating an entire week to various themes, XRSI intends to create a reflection point on the safety and trust aspects of Metaverse technologies.”</p>



 Metaverse Safety Week 2022 – December 10th-15th, 2022 



<p>The 2022 virtual event is a week-long event that commences on the 74th Human Rights Day, 10th December, at a unique virtual venue, with rich and immersive experiences crafted explicitly for the occasion. Metaverse Safety Week features a global agenda with sessions, social moments, panels, and live interviews this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Metaverse Safety Week focuses on building an open, inclusive, safe Metaverse by inviting the ecosystem stakeholders to connect, collaborate, and share their research, knowledge, and passion. Any organization can adopt the awareness campaign to create their own programming or support the XRSI-led campaign by submitting requests to speak, conduct a panel or create a parallel event altogether. The Metaverse Safety Week awareness campaign is a community-driven global movement for responsible innovation, better regulations, and more profound knowledge of the world we are immersing in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stake natively on Polkadot easier than ever and with as little as 1 DOT thanks to this new scalability feature for Polkadot’s staking system.</p><p>Nomination pools are a new feature for <a href="https://polkadot.network/staking">Polkadot’s staking system</a> that allows users to pool their DOT tokens together on-chain to nominate validators and receive rewards, significantly improving the system’s scalability. Now, anyone with as little as 1 DOT can receive rewards for staking natively on Polkadot.</p><p>Coupled with the recently launched <a href="http://staking.polkadot.network">Polkadot Staking Dashboard</a>, the new user-friendly staking app that recently came out of beta, nomination pools lower the barrier to entry for participation in staking directly on the network and simplify the staking process. Now, users with less DOT and those looking for a more passive staking experience can stake directly on the network.</p><p>Crucially, these updates also reduce the incentive to stake through third-party services and intermediaries. By cutting out the middleman and staking natively (directly on the Relay Chain) DOT holders can help keep Polkadot secure and decentralized while receiving competitive rewards of up to 18%*.</p><p>Native, protocol-level nomination pools also represent a major innovation in the broader blockchain industry, where stakers with less tokens are often disadvantaged and staking pools typically necessitate relying on intermediary services.</p> The need for nomination pools <p>From the beginning, Polkadot’s Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) system was designed for maximum security, decentralization, energy efficiency, and fair representation, efficiently balancing the interests of smaller and larger DOT holders alike. It has always been a goal for Polkadot to provide inclusive access to staking participation and lower the barrier to entry as much as possible for nominators.</p><p>But following the launch of Polkadot’s Relay Chain in 2020, <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-and-kusama-staking-changes/">rapid scaling</a> of the network in 2021 and an increase in demand for staking participation put a strain on this innovative staking system. To ensure the network's security, a maximum number of 22,500 nominators was introduced and governance passed a series of motions that gradually increased <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/157">the minimum nomination amount to 160 DOT</a>. This limit was eventually <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/921">lowered back down to 10 DOT</a>, but the minimum amount needed to be part of the top 22,500 nominators and earn rewards is now dynamically determined and is still somewhere around 170 DOT at the time of writing.</p><p>To remedy the system’s scalability issues and remove the limitations introduced on participating as a nominator, several <a href="https://youtu.be/_wjAYivFQBU">improvements to Polkadot’s staking system</a> were developed <a href="https://polkadot.network/tag/staking-updates/">over the past year</a>. The most significant and exciting of these is the nomination pools feature, which launched first on Kusama and is now live on Polkadot.</p><p>Before nomination pools, the only way to participate in the nomination process and receive rewards natively was for users to directly nominate validators, using their stake of DOT tokens to select up to 16 trustworthy validators.</p><p>However, not only does direct nomination require users to have a significant stake in DOT tokens to participate, it also requires playing a more active role in researching, selecting, monitoring, and periodically reevaluating their choice of validators.</p><p>With nomination pools, the creator of a pool manages nominations on behalf of pool members, reducing the time and overhead necessary to participate in nomination. Of course, pool members should still conduct their own due diligence when determining which pool to join. In contrast to direct nomination, pools also do not require users to create both a stash and controller account, further reducing the complexity of native staking.</p><p>Alternatively, before nomination pools DOT holders could stake indirectly via third-party services and liquid staking providers, but at the expense of network decentralization and security. Indirect staking also meant that DOT holders had to give away their economic voting power to third parties, often handing over a percentage of their rewards in the process.</p><p>Beyond making native staking more accessible for those with less DOT, nomination pools also remove the theoretical limit on the number of users the system can handle, allowing it to continue to scale as demand for staking participation continues into the future.</p> How nomination pools work <p>With nomination pools, multiple DOT holders can pool their tokens together and act as a single nominator, collectively backing a set of validators chosen by the pool creator with their combined stake.</p><p>Rewards are automatically split pro-rata among the members of the pool, and nomination pools do not currently take a commission. This means that pool members can currently expect the same rate of rewards for their stake as they would if participating in the system as a direct nominator.</p><p>To ensure economic incentives are aligned and network security is maintained, slashes are also applied proportionally to pool members who are actively bonded.</p> Joining a nomination pool <p>The simplest way to participate in nomination pools is through the <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard">Polkadot Staking Dashboard</a>, the network’s new, user-friendly web application for staking. More advanced users can also participate via <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps">Polkadot-JS Apps</a>.</p><p>Joining a nomination pool through the Staking Dashboard is as easy as connecting your account, selecting a pool, and signing a transaction to contribute your DOT to the pool. For a complete walkthrough on how to join a pool through the Polkadot Staking Dashboard, see the <a href="https://youtu.be/gQ-ZucYgWZc">tutorial video walkthrough</a>.</p><p>Note that you can only participate in a pool with a transferable balance and the amount you participate with is transferred from your account to the nomination pool. Those who have already bonded funds can bond additional funds or re-stake rewards. Currently, you can only belong to one pool at a time. Because the member funds are transferred from your account to the pool's account, any funds you nominate to a pool will not appear in your balance.</p><p>Additionally, voting for governance with pooled funds is not currently possible. In order to unstake, or simply switch from one pool to another, you’ll need to wait the 28-day unbonding period on Polkadot.</p> The stakes are infinitely better on Polkadot <p>Polkadot's native nomination pools are an important and valuable addition to the network. As a result of this update, NPoS becomes more scalable and provides a more user-friendly and inclusive way to stake on Polkadot, opening up staking to many more DOT holders.</p><p>Pools also offer new opportunities for validators. With nomination pools deployed, the number of DOT entering the staking system is likely to increase, and validators will have an incentive to ensure the inflow of tokens is directed towards them.</p><p>Join or open a nomination pool today via the <a href="http://staking.polkadot.network">Polkadot Staking Dashboard</a>, or via <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=light%3A%2F%2Fsubstrate-connect%2Fpolkadot#/staking/pools">Polkadot-JS Apps</a>.</p><p>Read more about staking on <a href="https://polkadot.network/staking/">the Polkadot website</a>, or <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">visit the Polkadot Wiki</a> for a more technical deep-dive on nomination pools.

Companies would avoid issuing payroll or costs for fear of exposing sensitive information to competitors. Yet that is the current experience on&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Web3 must provide a comparable level of privacy as Web2 before mass adoption is possible. This is the mission of&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>Findora is using zero-knowledge proofs to create a privacy platform that can solve these problems. By combining privacy and auditability, by prioritizing compliance and personal ownership of data, Findora prepares Web3 for real-world application and lays the foundation for a free and decentralized digital&nbsp;future.</p> ZK-DID <p>ZK-DID has the ability to restore ownership of personal data to&nbsp;users.</p><p>For example, you could prove your credit score is above a certain number, or your GPA is above a certain level, without revealing the specific numbers or other data. You could prove your age without disclosing your birth&nbsp;date.</p><p>Using zero-knowledge proofs, ZK-DID lets users choose what information they reveal to third parties while preserving the information they wish not to disclose.</p> What Is&nbsp;Findora <p>Findora combines the programmability of Ethereum with advanced privacy-providing ZK-technology. It allows developers to build innovative privacy dApps using Solidity, SDKs, and the functions they are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>An innovative L1, Findora is a leader in zero-knowledge cryptography. Its ZK-technology will allow developers to combine privacy and auditability for compliance purposes. Through SDKs, Findora is a plug-n-play privacy tool for all of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Findora makes Web3 viable for mass adoption through privacy and zero-knowledge innovation.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/findora">Discord</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/findora">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/findoraen">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Medium</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/findorafoundation/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FindoraFoundation">Facebook</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Findora_Official/">Reddit</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-privacy-hackathon-at-ethsf-2022-512f64a3585f">Build Privacy at Findora’s 2022 EthSF Hackathon</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A short writeup for the Polkadot ecosystem on implementing the newly released nomination pools feature.</p> What? <p>Nomination pools are a new type of scaling solution that's being added to Polkadot staking. It mainly targets the stakers who do not have enough DOT to participate actively in the normal staking process, i.e. as a “nominator”. Learn more about pools at the following links:</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_wjAYivFQBU">Nomination Pools and The Story of The Polkadot's NPoS</a>.  <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">Nomination Pools | Polkadot Wiki</a>.   How? <p>Pool members have a much simpler API compared to nominators: They join a pool, they can increase or decrease their stake in that pool, and they can claim their rewards whenever they want.</p><p>On the other hand, the process of creating and managing a pool is entirely new and we expect that to be the most work heavy part for our ecosystem, wanting to support pools. Nonetheless, you can focus on the “Pool member experience” at first, since most of those who want to manage a pool will be “power users” who can find their way in Polkadot JS Apps or other UIs with rough edges.</p><p>Here are some resources to help you with implementation:</p>  <a href="https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_nomination_pools/index.html">pallet-nomination-pools documentation.</a>  <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-march-2022/">https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-march-2022/</a>  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io">https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io</a>  <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33/views/3">https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33/views/3</a>   Why? <p>Polkadot’s complicated taking system has been the subject of a lot of community feedback over the last year. A portion of these stakers have already migrated to other staking services. A number of them are nominating on Polkadot, but are not always earning rewards. Therefore, we expect a large number of end users to wish to move back to staking directly on the Relay Chain (as opposed to more centralized services) and pools are exactly the tool for that. This is a great opportunity for the entire ecosystem to help these users achieve this goal, while attracting more users.</p><p>We encourage all wallets in our ecosystem to identify nominators who are not earning rewards, and invite them to join nomination pools. See <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/issues/7902">this issue</a> as further information around this.</p> Common Mistakes / Notes <p>Here are a few mistakes that we realized over the last few months UI implementers should keep an eye on.</p> Pool Members   In general, whenever a pool member changes their total point, the chain will automatically claim all their pending rewards for them. This is not optional, and MUST happen for the reward calculation to remain correct (see the documentation of `<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_nomination_pools/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.unbond">bond</a>` as an example). So, make sure you are warning your users about it. They might be surprised if they see that they bonded an extra 100 DOT, and now suddenly their 5.23 DOT in pending reward is gone. It is not gone, it has been paid out to you!  Joining a pool implies transferring funds to the pool account. So it might be (based on which wallet that you are using) that you no longer see the funds that are moved to the pool in your “free balance” section. Make sure the user is aware of this, and not surprised by seeing this. Also, the transfer that happens here is configured to to never accidentally destroy the sender account. So to join a pool, your sender account must remain alive with 1 DOT left in it. This means, with 1 DOT as existential deposit, and 1 DOT as minimum to join a pool, you need at least 2 DOT to join a pool. Consequently, if you are suggesting members to join a pool with “Maximum possible value”, you must subtract 1 DOT to remain in the sender account to not accidentally kill it.  Points and balance are not the same! Any pool member, at any point in time, can have points in either the bonded pool or any of the unbonding pools. The crucial fact is that in any of these pools, the ratio of point to balance is different and might not be 1. Each pool starts with a ratio of 1, but as time goes on, for reasons such as slashing, the ratio gets broken. Over time, 100 points in a bonded pool can be worth 90 DOT. Make sure you are either representing points as points (not as DOT), or even better, always display both: “You have x points in pool y which is worth z DOT”. See <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/6195ef41946017ec860d2d8ad58f9bc18b5797bf/frame/nomination-pools/src/lib.rs#L633">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/6195ef41946017ec860d2d8ad58f9bc18b5797bf/frame/nomination-pools/src/lib.rs#L624">here</a> for examples of how to calculate point to balance ratio of each pool (it is almost trivial ;))   Pool Management <p>The pool will be seen from the perspective of the rest of the system as a single nominator. Ergo, this nominator must always respect the `staking.minNominatorBond` limit. Similar to a normal nominator, who has to first `chill` before fully unbonding, the pool must also do the same. The pool’s bonded account will be fully unbonded only when the depositor wants to leave and dismantle the pool. All that said, the message is: the depositor can only leave the chain when they <a href="https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_nomination_pools/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.chill">chill</a> the pool first.</p>

<blockquote>Interviewer: Luci Web3先锋, 0x499 Core Member &amp;&nbsp;YouTuber</blockquote><blockquote>Interviewee: w3tester, Founder of zCloak&nbsp;Network</blockquote><p>On October 6, 2022, 0x499 interviewed the founder of zCloak Network, w3tester, about his opinion on how DID should expand its utility in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Key takeaways:</p>  Web2 data needs to be utilized in the Web3 world in some ways in order to enrich application scenarios of DID on-chain.  A complete DID system needs to have four basic characteristics: an identifier system based on cryptography, a verifiable trust transfer mechanism, an identity data storage solution where users have absolute sovereignty, and protection of user&nbsp;privacy.  Future reputation of individuals or organizations no longer has to come from the endorsement of centralized organizations, but can be gradually accumulated through interactions among decentralized parties in the&nbsp;system.  During the transition period to the cyber world, DID will carry the mapping of Web2 identity and social relations in the Web3&nbsp;world.  <p>Luci: Please introduce yourself and your&nbsp;project.</p><p>w3tester: Thank you for the invitation, it’s an honor. I’m w3tester, the founder of the zCloak Network project. I studied at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, where I received my MS and PhD in Computer Science. When I was doing my doctoral research around 2011, I studied the algorithm of Bitcoin and conducted some research on it as a distributed system. After returning to China, around 2019, I became the first batch of Chinese ambassadors of Polkadot.</p><p>zCloak Network is a privacy-preserving computation platform based on zk-VM (zero-knowledge virtual machine) technology. In zCloak, we have created a new computation paradigm, which includes self-sovereign data and self-proving computation—the storage and computing of user data take place in client device, not in centralized servers. At the same time, we use DID and ZKP (zero-knowledge proof) technology to prove the integrity of the user’s computation. This paradigm is the exact opposite of the model of Web2’s big data and cloud computing. To put it simply, zCloak implements a new privacy-preserving computation paradigm of “invisible yet verifiable data,” allowing users to use Web2 data in a privacy-preserving manner in Web3 scenarios. It will greatly enrich the use cases in&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Luci: As the cornerstone of a decentralized society, how should DID’s application scenarios be extended? Why does Web3 need to rebuild identity for everyone and does it matter for Web3&nbsp;people?</p><p>w3tester: In Web2, data is as important as land and oil, and it is a new material of production. Whoever controls the data basically controls the production relations in the data era. zCloak believes that the core of Web3 lies in user Self-Sovereignty, i.e. data ownership. In Web3, users should control their own data storage and the computation process—that is how users can fully control their own identity, property and other rights. Therefore, in the Web3 era, we need to rebuild the way we express, manage and control our own identity, and then use this as an anchor to build a new type of production relationship based on&nbsp;data.</p><p>But how do users really take control of their data? How do you prove the data is your data? How do you express your interactions or attitudes towards another entity without going through a third-party company? These all require the decentralized identity technology. Therefore, in the Web3 era, it is very important to use DID technology to rebuild everyone’s own digital identity.</p><p>Luci: Can you introduce W3C DID? What are the underlying data sources of current DID protocols? How can we migrate the original large amount of identity data in Web2, such as proof of education and work experience, to&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>w3tester: Let’s briefly talk about the definition of DID and its development history.</p><p>For the definition of DID, there are currently two different but mix-used definitions of DID in the Web3 context — Decentralized Identifier and Decentralized Identity. Technically speaking, DID is a decentralized identifier ​​technology. An identifier is a unique identification that distinguishes each subject, like our ID card number. Identity refers to one’s unique characteristics in general. DID contains the dual meanings of decentralized identifier and decentralized identity. In today’s discussion, let’s take its meaning of decentralized identity&nbsp;first.</p><p>Closely linked to DID is Self-Sovereign Identity, which was proposed many years ago. Today’s DID technology is actually a natural continuation and extension of the concept of self-sovereign identity under the new technology conditions of the new era. The core of self-sovereign identity enables users to protect their identity information and data sovereignty in a cryptographic way. Decentralized digital identity technology and DID technology are to a large extent the implementation of self-sovereign identity technology based on blockchain and new cryptography technology. DID has been widely and enthusiastically discussed in Web3 recently. Personally, I believe that today’s Web3 DID projects can be divided into two categories:</p>  W3C DID project: DID projects that conform to the W3C standard;  On-chain DID projects: DID projects related to everyone’s on-chain data and on-chain addresses.  <p>W3C DID projects usually include both on-chain and off-chain data. On-chain DID projects only use on-chain data, so on-chain DID projects are actually a subset of W3C DID projects.</p><p>W3C is the acronym of World Wide Web Consortium, which is a global standardization organization founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994. Common Internet standards such as HTML, CSS and AJAX come from this organization. In the Internet environment, since people need to communicate with each other, the connection between points and interactions between different projects are needed. So it is very important to have a common standard under a large number of connection needs. The Web needs standards for interoperability, and the W3C is responsible for developing these standards.</p><p>In the field of DID, W3C has also developed a lot of standards related to decentralized digital identity, including DID, verifiable credential, and has recommended many cryptographic algorithms. It is because these DID standards developed by W3C have been supported and used worldwide for a long time until today and continuing, so when DID is mentioned, the W3C standard is an important topic.</p><p>The core of W3C DID includes the DID Document, which stores various keys generated by various public key cryptography. They allow you to perform two very high-frequency operations in identity interactions — trust delivery in the form of signature algorithms, and data transmission through end-to-end encryption.</p><p>The main task of DID Document is to describe the cryptographic algorithm and express the user’s public key. DID Document is essentially an extension of public key cryptography. The system for secure communication based on public key cryptography also includes PGP. In the early days, I used PGP to communicate with members of the Ethereum Foundation. The problem with it is that it is difficult to let others know what your public key is on a verifiable or large-scale network — and this is one of the core problems the W3C DID system is trying to solve. We surely know our own public key, but how do we let others know that what they see is the public keys that belong to me which has not been modified? At this point, the VDR (Verifiable Data Registry) mechanism is needed, which is a carrier of the DID Document, used to store various keys generated by various cryptographic algorithms in the DID mentioned above.</p><p>There are many ways to implement VDR, such as using blockchain, database, IPFS, etc. zCloak’s zkID DID system also has its own VDR implementation.</p><p>Therefore, the current on-chain DID track is actually a subset of the DID track under the W3C standard, but with the addition of blockchain technology. For example, the W3C DID can be substituted by on-chain address, and the verifiable credential can be partially substituted by the transaction information on-chain, so that a small facet of the subject identity can be formed, which can partially realize some functions of the W3C DID. However, the on-chain DID track does not have the core privacy protection function in DID, such as end-to-end encryption in messaging. Also limited is that, people can only use existing cryptographic algorithms of the chosen blockchain.</p><p>Recently, various on-chain DID applications have emerged. This may be because the on-chain DID project is easier to design and implement. With a wallet, you can participate in community activities every day, or conduct on-chain marketing, and there are many other use cases. But from a technical point of view, the on-chain DID project is much simpler than the W3C DID project, in the sense that an on-chain DID project doesn’t need to design its own cryptographic tools, as the chain itself provides all the cryptographic mechanisms. Some of the current on-chain DID projects are more focused on resources, communities, and marketing.</p><p>However, if the DID system wants to achieve greater development, it cannot be limited to using on-chain data only—it has to include Web2 data. The mechanisms and methods need to be taken careful considerations—for example, Tornado Cash has begun to be regulated by OFAC, and voices coming form Europe and the US pushing forward to regulate on-chain DeFi activities, in which an important step is to reinforce that KYC information to be used on-chain. That means user’s off-chain data need to be used for on-chain app in some way. Another example would be some Move to Earn project, since user data is still processed through their centralized servers, now they are facing some regulatory and legal&nbsp;issues.</p><p>It’s obvious that when Web2 data is used in a Web3 scenario, we must pay attention to the user’s data sovereignty and user privacy protection. This is not only a problem that projects need to include in their structure, but could even rise to the regulatory and legal level. In other words, Web3 projects should not use the big data and cloud computing mechanism to process user data like Web2 projects do. But if we only focus on on-chain data, it is not enough to form a multi-dimensional user identity. Therefore, only when Web2 data can be freely used in Web3, the application scenarios of DID on-chain can be truly enriched.</p><p>Luci: What do you think of the user privacy of DID and SBT projects? Is this a&nbsp;problem?</p><p>w3tester: Privacy is one of the most important propositions of the Web3 DID projects, and it is a must, not an option. I think user data privacy is the most fundamental reason for Web3 to exist. One of the core concepts of Web3 is to respect user sovereignty, especially the data sovereignty of users. But what’s special about data is that as long as I see your data, I can copy your data, so this data is not only yours, but mine as well. This is different from physical assets, which cannot be used by others just because of a simple copy operation. Therefore, as long as someone can see your data, you have no sovereignty over your data — the premise of data sovereignty is that everyone’s data cannot be seen by others. In order to protect data sovereignty, it is necessary to protect the data privacy of users. Conversely, without data privacy, there is no data sovereignty, and there is no&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Of course, not all types of applications have to be 100% private, and some on-chain data can be publicly revealed. For example, information about posts and likes, participating in a hackathon, or someone being a member of a certain institution/organization… These information can be certified by using SBT — which is completely open on-chain, without any concept of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>But in many scenarios where user data is used, privacy is a necessity. Just think about your friend relationships, contact information, family members, health data, medical cases, daily expenses on Alipay and WeChat, what you bought, where you bought it, when you bought it, etc., are basically all privacy information we want to protect. Web3 is here to help users protect this kind of data that needs&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>At the same time, it should be noted that these data must not be put on blockchains. Storing personal private information in an open channel — blockchain or IPFS — is a very dangerous move. On-chain DID projects, including the SBT mentioned just now, cannot carry this privacy concept in their current form. SBT expresses a concept of Yes or No — whether you have participated in a certain activity, whether you have passed the KYC of a certain exchange—it is a concept of a sign. Therefore, the application of SBT is limited, but if SBT can carry more user privacy information in some way and exist in the form of NFT, its use case will be expanded a lot. zCloak first proposed the concept of zk-SBT in the first half of 2022, which is to combine privacy digital credentials with SBT. In this way, your SBT has both an open side and a dark side, and the information on the dark side is presented through&nbsp;ZKP.</p><p>In general, on-chain privacy is a necessity for many Web3 projects, and at the same time, better technologies are needed to protect users’ private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Luci: What are the technical, commercial and practical (such as regulatory) difficulties in the process of aggregating various credentials into an identity?</p><p>w3tester: Let’s briefly talk about the concept of Credential. A person is the aggregation of social attributes, and the various information, attributes, and characteristics of a person’s identity are actually given to you by others, not by yourself. Think about it, if you participated in an event, who can prove your participation? Can you say that you are an employee of a certain company without the company’s certification? Can you prove that you own certain assets without a bank statement? Therefore, the process of people proving their identity or having certain attributes is the concept of proof by others or mutual proof, not self proof. In the field of identity, the vast majority of identity-related information is proof by others and mutual&nbsp;proof.</p><p>Two core elements of the DID identity system&nbsp;are:</p>  Identifier, mentioned earlier: represents any form of a subject. The mechanism that distinguishes a subject from another includes Identifier, Document, and Registry and other components.  Trust transfer mechanism: the most important technology/element in the DID identity system is actually how to transfer trust between different subjects. Many people ignore this when discussing DID.  <p>VC (Verifiable Credential) is verifiable because the credential itself comes with a digital signature. This digital signature method can describe the identity attributes of a subject, and the content of the credential is composed of identity information of the subject — such as passport, name, age, home address, passport number, proof of various on-chain activities, etc. That is, the content of the credential is a description of some identity attributes of the subject. The digital credential allows a trusted organization to transfer its trust in the information presented on the credential through the use of digital signature. This trust transfer mechanism is the cornerstone of the entire DID system. When a subject accumulates a large number of such credentials, there will be a digital identity of an individual with rich dimensions.</p><p>It is for this reason that the data used by the on-chain DID projects is actually a generalized digital credential. These on-chain data are digital credentials or certificates made for you by miners, which prove the interactions between the subjects and various services, applications, or other subjects on-chain, and record the results of these interactions. The credential is on-chain data and the basis of the on-chain DID&nbsp;system.</p><p>The W3C has developed a set of digital credential standards called Verifiable Credential to help these digital credentials be used in different scenarios. These standards can meet the needs of some basic scenarios, but cannot meet some advanced needs — selective presentation, privacy proof, etc. zCloak has developed a DID protocol called zkID (Zero Knowledge Identity), which also includes a W3C-compliant verifiable credential platform.</p><p>There are generally three usage modes for digital credentials:</p>  Present the full text. Fully display what is contained in the verifiable credential.  Selective disclosure. Only display the key information that is relevant and necessary for the current application scenario.  Zero-knowledge proofs. To obtain certain services by proving that the user’s identity has certain attributes. However, it does not show the specific original plaintext data and information.  <p>Therefore, in different scenarios, we have different usage modes of the verifiable credential technology.</p><p>What I just mentioned is more from a technical level. The realization of the technology is not the same as the realization of the product. Equally important to technology is the establishment of a trust system of business, which includes the establishment of international standards, such as the DID and verifiable credential underlying technical standards established by W3C. In addition, some trusted entities providing services, such as a notary office, law firm, audit company, accounting firm, etc., are also needed, and they have the ability and legal authority to check and audit the user’s identity. As for how these trusted institutions establish their own Web3 identities, they need the help of the DID identity anchoring mechanism to establish their own on-chain Web3 identities. Furthermore, these trusted entities may gradually gain a reputation value — because they do a lot of audit and proving work for users, thereby their reputation will be gradually driven&nbsp;up.</p><p>From this perspective, what we proposed is for there to be a large on-chain trust ecosystem in Web3, or which zCloak calls it an on-chain Trust Market. Why we say that, is because zCloak believes that with the development of blockchain technology and the popularity of Web3 evolving, a Web3 “Taobao” mechanism may be created in the future, but this “Taobao” does not sell goods, but sell trust between various institutions. We just need to wait and see who takes the lead in the market, and in establishing their own reputation in such Trust Market, and do various certifications for all kinds of&nbsp;users.</p><p>Luci: Will Web3 identity management develop into a monopoly in the future? What is the biggest competitive advantage in the&nbsp;track?</p><p>w3tester: The industry is still in a very early stage of exploration. In the future, the Web3 identity management track will have many subdivided tracks. Some projects may focus on technical infrastructures, some may focus on applications in a vertical track, and some may want to be embed into other applications and become part of other projects in the identity&nbsp;service.</p><p>There are already many related use cases in the current on-chain DID market&nbsp;, such as digital credentials like POAP and OAT of Galxe, or some concepts of SBT in a broader sense; there are also some applications similar to domain names, such as ENS and Space ID by BSC; or some information aggregation identity applications&nbsp;, such as Next.ID; and applications in the social track such as CyberConnect.</p><p>At present, everyone is still doing some very useful early discussions regarding on-chain DID, but the corresponding mechanism is not particularly perfect. Take the domain name system ENS as an example. Although you can fill in all kinds of identity information, the problem is that there is no review mechanism to prove the information you fill in. Anyone can fill in anything they want. You can apply for a billgates.eth domain, but is that name behind Bill Gates? No way to&nbsp;know.</p><p>Therefore, the main problem of the current domain name system is that there is no trust transfer mechanism in the system, the information expressed is relatively limited, and the application scenarios are relatively narrow. Does a credential we get for attending an event represent who we are? It seems that it does, but it also doesn’t, since this point is indeed too small. We aggregate information on-chain to do transactions, so our transaction records, NFT purchase records, and interactions with certain contracts are essentially an on-chain consumption behavior. These records are just to prove that we made such moves. They are like the shopping lists we get after checkout at a store. Is this event certificate/shopping list my identity? Obviously they are too small to describe a person’s identity. Therefore, the related on-chain DID projects are doing some very interesting attempts, but the scope of problems that can be solved by them is still relatively narrow.</p><p>In the Web3 era, a real DID or DID management project should have four basic characteristics:</p>  Cryptography-based identifier system  Complete and verifiable trust transfer mechanism  Users must have absolutely sovereign identity data&nbsp;storage  Users are able to use their data in a privacy-preserving way  <p>On this basis, a better direction for DID projects to explore is to be compatible with the DID+VC system of the W3C standard. How to build a truly decentralized VDR (Verifiable Data Registry) on top of the DID+VC system, how to use Credential in a way that protects privacy, how to envelop the largest consensus in the Web3 industry in a universal and inclusive way to form an ecological network, etc. These are big propositions that require continuous exploration in the industry.</p><p>Under such a background, it is basically impossible for a single project to dominate, and we all very much hope to see many projects blooming together in the industry.</p><p>Luci: Under what circumstances will users take the initiative to manage their own DID identities, instead of applying and discarding them at any time like a wallet&nbsp;address?</p><p>w3tester: In order for users to really value their DID identity, they need to realize that DIDs are actually useful to them and need to be used from time to time. On-chain DID or generalized Web3 DID needs to provide users with some very practical and common use cases and convenience, not only on-chain, but especially in a large number of off-chain scenarios, making it a habit for users in order to popularize. In fact, the development resistance of DID and verifiable credential technology is not that big, but the industry is still relatively early. The popularization of a technology or application does not depend solely on its own conditions; the development of the industry, user awareness and usage habits are all important.</p><p>For providing convenience to users, imagine if the paper and pen signing and stamping procedures where people need to go back and forth to do manual work are completely replaced by the verifiable credential technology in DID — just clicking “confirm” after unlocking your mobile phone. At the same time, the security of the whole process is ensured by the strongest cryptographic algorithms. Then I believe that most people will not be able to return to the scene of paper, pen, and stamps. It’s just like how paying with QR code/barcode replaced the swiping of an actual bank&nbsp;card.</p><p>At the same time, in the process of using DID and verifiable credential, each user will accumulate a large number of credentials — which may include credentials issued by notary offices, public security bureaus, hospitals, workplaces, schools, etc. When such credentials accumulate to a certain amount, they can form a multi-dimensional description of a user’s identity. With this multi-dimensional description, users can use this data in more scenarios in a way that protects privacy. This is a very efficient and convenient network effect that makes it increasingly difficult for users to “de-habit.”</p><p>zCloak team’s zkID project has a zkID login function, which allows users to generate multiple tags describing their identity and characteristics based on their own DID and verifiable credentials, and then log in to any Web2 or Web3 website through the login function. After logging in, the other party does not know who they are, but can see their tags. We call this process the “User Self Portrait” mechanism, which contrasts with Web2’s user portrait mechanism.</p><p>Web2’s user portrait is based on big data technology, and by tagging each user’s data, it can promote advertisements and do other series of behaviors in a targeted manner. However, in Web3, although there are also tags and user characteristics, your tags are generated based on your own verifiable credentials, not given to you by someone else. You can let Web2, Web3 websites or applications provide you with a variety of personalized conveniences and services based on these tags. It sounds fascinating.</p><p>Of course, Web3 will also consider the distribution of benefits. Any project party, including zCloak, wants to select some core, high-quality users. These users who supported the projects’ communities in an early stage may be eligible for whitelisting and airdrops in the future, so as to receive rewards from the projects. Inevitably, however, there will always be robots to mess up the mechanism and prevent those who actually participated in community building from getting the most impressive rewards, which actually destroys the reward mechanism.</p><p>So, how can we solve this problem? In the future, we can add certain identity attribute requirements to the whitelist and airdrop mechanism. In this way, the project party can encourage everyone to actively participate in various community building activities, and issue credentials to these participants as prove of their participation in certain activities, that they have worked hard to contribute. Afterwards, in the airdrop phase, users can be qualified for airdrop by showing the specific credentials. In this way, the real benefits are left to users who are deeply involved in the industry and can really accompany the project for a long time. This is very fair for users, and it is not only for the project party to find its own real users, but also to maximize the reward&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>Luci: Although DID has a broad field of application scenarios, how should the profit model of the upstream and downstream links of DID be designed? In the end, who should pay for&nbsp;it?</p><p>w3tester: In a DID system, the participants generally have three parties, namely the User, the Attester, and the Verifier.</p>  The User. It is the party with the largest number of people. In some systems, it is called Claimer or Holder, and zCloak calls it User. They are the largest composition in the DID&nbsp;system.  The Attester. Also called Issuer in the W3C standard, they are organizations that issue digital credentials to users or notarize users’ digital credentials.  The Verifier. The attester attest to an attribute of the user, and the result of the attestation is a verifiable credential. The user submits the verifiable credential to the verifier for them to determine whether the result is correct and acceptable. If accepted, the process&nbsp;ends.  <p>In the whole process, there is a very simple basic principle — whoever benefits should pay. There are several parts of the process that generate&nbsp;cost.</p><p>From the user’s part, they have gained some convenience by using DID and VC — such as completing manual signatures through digital signatures, verifying whether the identity credentials of other organizations and other people are correct, and using a remote way to get a credential. This saves a lot of time and is with other benefits. Therefore, in the process of using DID, it is reasonable to charge users for some&nbsp;fees.</p><p>From the attester’s part, the attester obtains service fees by providing attestation services. For individual users who provide attestation services, such as a lawyer, it is normal and reasonable to want to charge a certain fee for this service after performing some kind of check on the identity of a certain person or witnessing a certain contract. This process is where lawyers get paid for performing public services on an individual’s DID digital identity or document. Additionally, for institutions that provide attestation services, such as notary offices or accounting firms, in the early stages, they may also do similar services for free or even subsidized in order to occupy the market. This is actually a very simple model of providing services to gain&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>From the verifier’s part, they verify the user/organization’s digital credentials to meet their own business needs. For example, some countries require service providers not to provide DeFi services to their nationals, so there is a compliance requirement — how to verify whether the person using the service is a citizen of this country? The current system cannot achieve this. If there is a mechanism that allows service providers to verify that their user identities meet the regulatory requirements of their country, and at the same time, service providers do not need to do a series of tasks such as collecting user data and establishing data storage, then these service providers are certainly willing to pay a premium for this compliant service.</p><p>In addition to the three parties mentioned above, there is also a DID infrastructure provider that provides DID services to help everyone establish their identity and a trust transfer mechanism in the entire DID upstream and downstream process. Then it is also reasonable for DID infrastructure providers to obtain certain benefits for providing these technical services.</p><p>Therefore, the upstream and downstream of the entire DID process are to provide a set of trustworthy and convenient infrastructure, so that trust and identity transfer become convenient, fast, and credible, and then use these conveniences to leverage greater market and more applications. The upstream and downstream of the entire DID process allow us to interact in a more trusted way in Web3. I think there is a cost to this credibility and trustworthiness, which is worth it for many individuals/organizations.</p><p>Luci: Whether DID can develop, do you think depends on what short-term, medium-term and long-term factors?</p><p>w3tester: For the development of DID, it is still under construction in the short term, focusing on technical infrastructures.</p><p>From a medium-term perspective, the core keyword is Trust Market. We want to form a global market of trust. On the basis of infrastructure, we will establish the credibility and reputation of different market players, so that the trust and interaction between them can be flowed and expressed in a convenient way. At the same time, the market-oriented mechanism will be able to calculate, price, and pay for all kinds of behaviors in this process. The building of the trust market will be a very important proposition.</p><p>From a long-term perspective, national-level regulatory compliance, and even the drafting and publication of some UN-level technical standards and public documents, are very important. Their emergence may become a future landmark event, proving that the DID system will gain global popularization and widespread adoption. The large-scale promotion and use of decentralized digital identity systems on a global scale will be the long-term goal of the DID industry.</p><p>Luci: Who is likely to be the ultimate winner in the DID track? Is it current Crypto native companies, the Web2 internet corporates, or even government/official holding companies?</p><p>w3tester: As things stand, it is impossible to determine who will be the ultimate winner. But the future will definitely be a situation where many projects and companies bloom together, and the possibility of monopoly is relatively small. Everyone starts from different perspectives and uses their existing advantages to explore how to solve various problems in the DID industry and how to build. But whether it is a crypto native company or a Web2 Internet corporate or a government/official holding company, they all have their own advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>However, there is no doubt that the early infrastructure stage must mainly rely on crypto native companies, after all, everyone is already familiar with the blockchain technology. Therefore, even DID in the context of W3C is also suitable for using corresponding cryptographic methods on-chain. At present, although there are various projects in exploration, it is not easy for them to form a large-scale and comprehensive identity service platform. When a large and comprehensive platform emerges to unify all technologies and various types of credentials in some form&nbsp;, the exploration of some subdivision directions may be covered by large infrastructure.</p><p>For Web2 Internet companies, such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc., they are likely to enter the market with their own user advantages — Facebook currently has nearly 4 billion global active users, and to which the number of tens of thousands of Web3 users is incomparable. On the other hand, most things have two sides — if Web2 adopts the DID system to return the user’s data sovereignty to users, from a certain point of view, is destroying its own life, because the core method for Web2 to obtain benefits is the exact opposite — the mastering of user data. It is like when a landlord evenly distributes his arable land to all the farmers, and the farmers take the land harvest as their own, can the landlord still rely on the land to make money? Maybe, he can make money in a new way, or maybe he can’t make money at all, but the answer to this question can only be proven by&nbsp;time.</p><p>For the government or state-owned enterprises, DID is still a little far away. For the development of most new technologies, some players at the national level are still in a wait-and-see state in the early stage, and will only officially enter the game when the situation is relatively determined. One of the biggest advantages of these players, however, is that they hold vast amounts of user data — the identity data of each of us is concentrated in large national databases. They have the natural advantage of being an Attester. But the advantage is not necessarily decisive, because based on the future Trust Market, a large number of behaviors will be market-oriented, and reputation needs to be accumulated. Reputation comes from the interaction and feedback between users and communities, and will not be naturally trusted just because of its official identity.</p><p>DID is an international market and system, and no country can claim to be the natural center. Just like our Belt and Road Initiative in China, if we want to expand, we must put a large number of other countries into this framework. Within this framework, these countries are in a relationship of mutual respect, equality and cooperation. International exchanges and cooperation do not have a center, nor should there be a center. Therefore, the establishment of the DID system itself is the embodiment of the spirit of decentralization, which allows different countries, nations, and subjects of any form to participate in an equal way, and also contribute in the building of the DID Trust Market. So, the real winner is really unpredictable right now, and all we can do is to do what we need to do. Just do good deeds without asking for the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Luci: In terms of application scenarios, including the building of credit system, reputation system, social network, and other possible application directions, which direction do you think is the first area where DID may be successfully applied?</p><p>w3tester: The scenarios you just mentioned are all good, but from my point of view, on-chain social networking will be an interesting and promising scenario.</p><p>The social network in Web3 should not be a social network in a narrow sense just like Facebook and Twitter, but should be more like a concept of a decentralized society. In this decentralized society, each subject will have its own DID identity. Cryptography gives these subjects a mechanism to interact with other subjects and protect their own privacy in Web3, and use their own private data in a verifiable but invisible way to obtain certain services.</p><p>For quite some time, it is not easy to live fully in cyberspace. In such a transitional period, what DID has to do is to map some relationships, identities, attributes, characteristics, etc. of the subjects in Meat Space based on the DID standard in cyberspace. Also, it is important to ensure the sovereignty of data and privacy security based on cryptography, enabling credible and meaningful interactions between subjects in cyberspace. If a decentralized society like this can be built, it will be of great significance from the perspective of application scenarios.</p><blockquote>THE END</blockquote>

<p>In the future, thanks to a revolutionary set of technologies — built on the principles of fair access and decentralization — humanity will experience greater freedom and security than at any point in history. Each individual will enjoy self-sovereignty, and collaboration and creativity will be at an all-time high.</p>



<p>In 30 years, there will be fewer centralized gatekeepers to decide who can participate in society. There will be fewer king makers to determine who wins and who loses.</p>



<p>In this era — the Golden Age of freedom and self-expression — education and opportunity will be accessible to everyone, innovation will thrive, privacy will be normal and expected, and the people (and governments) of the world will agree that a vibrant society depends on respecting and upholding human dignity, security, and consent.</p>



<p>This is ECC’s vision for the future; and for our part, we will empower economic freedom for billions with a fair, open currency, accessible to every person on the Internet.</p>



 Zcash today 



<p>Today is Zcash’s birthday. Launched on Oct. 28, 2016, Zcash was the first project of any kind to successfully use zero-knowledge proofs. Earlier this year, Electric Coin Co. (ECC) <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash/">implemented Halo</a> — a new and improved zero-knowledge proving system — to remove reliance on complex setup ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The efficiencies built into this upgrade made possible — for the first time ever — private, trustless digital cash payments on mobile phones. Halo is now being tested in other projects for its privacy and scalability benefits; and in <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ethereum-zcash-filecoin-collab/">a partnership</a> with Protocol Labs, Filecoin Foundation, and Ethereum Foundation, ECC is collaborating with these teams to unlock recursion in Halo and explore how the technology might be used in the respective ecosystems. (Also, there’s <a href="https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/new-agreement-between-filecoin-foundation-and-electric-coin-co-63df066212b1">a multi-million-dollar pool</a> for developers and teams who are interested in adding utility for the Filecoin and Zcash chains.)</p>



<p>Next year, in 2023, ECC will release a fully-supported commercial mobile wallet in the iOS and Android app stores with the rationale that Zcash adoption will grow when (1) the user experience is excellent — easy and fast — and (2) users are given compelling features and capabilities that support a growing number of use cases. This is aligned with our North Star, a commitment to help build a world-class user experience for ZEC, the Zcash token.</p>



<p>In 2023, we’ll also make a formal recommendation to move Zcash from <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/should-zcash-switch-from-proof-of-work-to-proof-of-stake/">proof of work to proof of stake</a>. This is ultimately a Zcash community decision, but we believe the benefits far outweigh the risks, and we are looking forward to the discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s so much more to be excited about, such as a <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/long-term-sustainability-with-the-zcash-posterity-fund/">posterity fund proposal</a>, <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-proposal-for-shielded-assets-zsa-uda-for-defi-on-zcash/40520">ongoing third-party work</a> on Zcash shielded assets, a <a href="https://zfnd.org/zebra/">Rust-language Zcash node</a> being built by the Zcash Foundation, continuing decentralization and development funding with the recent formation and momentum of the <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> organization, and some impressive Zcash partnership announcements on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve only just begun.</p>



 ECC’s 30-year plan 



<p>Empowering billions of people around the world with economic freedom is a monumental task, and it will require many mission-aligned people and teams to commit to it. Starting with a 30-year goal in mind, ECC has worked backwards to conceive a path for our contribution toward achieving it. There are increasingly more strategies and contributions to Zcash from across the ecosystem, and we look forward to collaborating to realize our collective vision of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For obvious reasons, the roadmap is more detailed in the near future.</p>







 2052: Zcash for billions 



<p>In the year 2052, every person on the Internet will have the ability to obtain and use Zcash according to their own preferences. Economic freedom requires private digital cash that is equitable, available, permissionless, privacy protecting, and resilient; and we (not just ECC, but many Zcash community contributors) are laser-focused on building the absolute best solution. We’ve come a long way since 2016, but the technology will have to evolve, starting today, to scale to billions of users.</p>



<p>This, of course, is not the end goal. It’s a milestone. We envision Zcash as a critical component to economic freedom for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



 2032: Deliver a world-class UX for ZEC 



<p>Goal</p>



<p>ECC will have delivered a world-class user experience for ZEC (the Zcash token) — a fair and open currency within a framework that protects freedom, dignity, consent, and security.</p>



<p>Success criteria for 2032</p>



  Using ZEC across ECC and third-party applications is so easy users don’t have to think about it. It is at least as easy to use ZEC as it was to share photos and videos in 2022 world-class apps, such as Tik Tok or WhatsApp.  ZEC users: The number of actual human users — people who have purchased, sold, sent or received ZEC in the previous 24 months&nbsp; — is 1 billion across the globe.  Zcash is a top-five cryptocurrency by market cap.  Sentiment: Zcash users are likely to recommend Zcash to a friend or colleague. This is measured in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score">Net Promoter Score</a> (NPS). For Zcash, the NPS is ≥ 50 every year.  Decentralization: Because decentralization is important to user security, censorship-resistance, and project longevity, at least 10 long-term, viable organizations are now focused on Zcash.  



 2025: Proof of stake and interoperability 



<p>Three years from now, we will have delivered an ECC-built and -supported mobile wallet on top of an interoperable Zcash protocol that leverages a proof-of-stake consensus. Features in incremental wallet releases will be based on Zcash user feedback, industry feedback, and market research. The wallet will support core PoS and interop use cases.</p>



<p>Goal</p>



<p>Zcash will have transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. There will be strong support for Zcash interoperability and broad access to ZEC across DeFi and CeFi. At this point, we expect strong demand for Zcash/ZEC among the “early majority.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Success criteria for 2025</p>



  ZEC users: The number of users has doubled from the previous 16-month period, and the ECC wallet is seeing 1 million monthly active users.  Zcash is a top-10 cryptocurrency by market cap.  Sentiment: The Zcash Net Promoter Score (NPS) is ≥ 50 every year.  Decentralization: At least five long-term, viable organizations are focused on Zcash.  



 Late 2023: UX foundations 



<p>By the close of 2023, the ECC mobile wallet will be available in the iOS and Android app stores&nbsp; with network-level privacy and instant sync — providing speed, convenience, and greater access. This is critical for a world-class UX for ZEC and lays the foundation for growing ZEC users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Goal</p>



<p>Deliver an open-source wallet that is available on Apple and Android stores and well supported by ECC; improve the ZEC UX including network privacy and instant sync; improve the Zcash tech stack (wallet, SDK, lightwalletd, protocol) sufficient to double users by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Success criteria for 2023</p>



  Users: The number of users has doubled from the previous year.  Sentiment: The Zcash Net Promoter Score (NPS) has been ≥ 50 for the last 12 months.  Decentralization: At least four long-term, viable organizations are focused on Zcash.  



 The next four months: Establish new baseline 



<p>ECC’s No. 1 priority at the moment is updating the Zcash protocol and our wallet SDKs to help third-party providers fix wallet syncing issues. An increased on-chain transaction load has resulted in unacceptable sync times for many everyday users, and ecosystem partners are also affected. We are focused — across teams — on alleviating these issues as soon as possible, so Zcash users have an experience they expect and deserve. Our immediate objectives are centered on working with third-party wallets that are built on the ECC SDKs (Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable) to:</p>



  Ensure users can spend their funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet)  Ensure users can receive and spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in one hour  Implement updates which provide users clarity on syncing progress  Ensure none of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK  



<p>Other success criteria for this period</p>



  ECC teams agree on the definition or proxy for global ZEC user counts.  Research and engineering have defined and communicated a revised three-year roadmap inclusive of user growth objectives, proof of stake, and interoperability.  



 Prioritization and achieving objectives 



<p>To deliver on all this important work, ECC has laid out a process that mandates our leadership meets every four months to revisit strategy and roadmap, evaluating data for the current period and reviewing waypoints. Functional owners (for example Steven Smith in Engineering) will be responsible for functional roadmaps that are aligned with the strategic roadmap and for determining where they need cross-team support. Each success criteria will be owned by an assigned functional owner to track and determine how we (all of ECC) can align to best meet the objective.</p>



 Empowering economic freedom 



<p>“Zcash for billions” is a change-the-world vision. Maybe that’s cliché, but today, too many people are forced to use discriminatory, poorly managed, and insecure centralized entities to store and transfer money digitally. Too many people are forced to live within fiat systems that are managed by governments that don’t have their constituents’ best interests at heart. Most cryptocurrencies do not provide adequate privacy and security protections for most use cases, and they expose users to surveillance which can lead to exploitation, manipulation, and seizure.</p>



<p>Today, billions of people in the world do not have access to a fair and open currency or supporting financial services. We build and support Zcash to drive greater economic freedom and opportunity for everyone.</p>

  Users downloading the latest release should expect much more reliable and frequent coinjoins... zkSNACKs is also extending its fundraising support to help the Tor team fund developers to work towards resolving this ongoing issue.

 Tor Optimization for Better Coinjoins <p><br>It is, unfortunately, no surprise to anyone that the privacy network <a href="https://status.torproject.org/">Tor has been under Distributed Denial of Service attack</a> for the last few months, and as a result, has been suffering from severe latency and reliability issues in routing traffic. Many bitcoin projects, including Wasabi Wallet, depend on Tor as a mission-critical infrastructure to protect the privacy of their users. In light of the attack, this resulted in infrequent coinjoins for Wasabi Wallet users. As a countermeasure to address this reliability issue, the Wasabi client switched from connecting with the backend onion server to using Tor exit nodes and routing traffic to the clearnet domain of the coinjoin coordinator. All traffic is still anonymized to prevent the client from leaking its IP address to the coinjoin coordinator server and protect user privacy. After performing testing and scenario analysis, the Wasabi contributors realized it would vastly improve the reliability and frequency of coinjoin rounds, preventing inputs from being blocked by the coordinator. Inputs are usually blocked if they repeatedly fail to sign the coinjoin transaction, to protect against DDoS attacks on the coordinator itself. Users downloading the latest release should now expect much more reliable and frequent coinjoins, vastly improving their experience. As this doesn’t directly address the Tor hidden identity registry DDoS attack but routes around it, zkSNACKs is also extending its fundraising support to help the Tor team fund developers to work towards resolving this ongoing issue. &nbsp;</p><blockquote>Tor is a critically important project for privacy on bitcoin and the internet that millions of people rely upon on a daily basis. Wasabi Wallet is grateful that such a tool exists and will do as much as possible to support Tor by promoting it and helping with its fundraising. Tor reliability is directly impacting the user experience of Wasabi Wallet users, so we care about this issue a lot. ~ Max Hillebrand, Wasabi Contributor and CEO at zkSNACKs.</blockquote> A New Privacy Progress Feature <p><br>Privacy is often an abstract concept that is hard to relate to for most users. Making privacy more understandable by providing elegant visuals is taking one step closer to bringing privacy to millions of bitcoiners around the world.<br><br>On the home screen of the Wasabi desktop app, a privacy progress bar is now available, showing the size of each coin and their privacy levels within a colour scheme. Users now have a complete view of their wallet privacy with the existing wallet privacy score (that remains unchanged). The privacy bars can be expanded into a privacy ring viewed in a pop-up dialog, which provides additional information about each coin, its size and its privacy level. This gives optional insight into the wallet's status, allowing users to have a better understanding of how much privacy they’ve achieved at any given time.</p><blockquote>There is something satisfying with checklists and loading bars, especially when completed. It feels like progress is made and work gets done. While we believe privacy is a habit rather than a fixed goal, we hope that bringing privacy progress visuals will help more users take the leap and reclaim their privacy. ~ Max Hillebrand, Wasabi Contributor and CEO at zkSNACKs.</blockquote>

 Announcing Game of Chains — Open for Registration! ✨ Do you see the sun rising over Gaia in the background? ☀️<p>Dearest Cosmos Validators</p><p>The 3rd Public Incentivized Testnet in the history of Cosmos, following <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/game-of-stakes">Game of Stakes</a> &amp; <a href="https://v1.cosmos.network/goz">Game of Zones</a>, is open for <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">registration</a>! 🎉🎉🎉</p> Announcing — “Game of&nbsp;Chains”! <p>Game of Chains is an incentivized testnet program that will help validators develop confidence around <a href="https://informal.systems/2022/05/09/building-with-interchain-security/">Interchain Security</a> (ICS) and provide a public platform where this new technology can be thoroughly tested.</p><p>What is Interchain Security?</p><p>Interchain Security is a feature which will allow the Cosmos Hub to share security with other blockchains. On a technical level, this means that the Cosmos Hub validator set will gain the ability to validate other blockchains alongside the Cosmos Hub. These blockchains are called “consumer chains”, and will be secured by the Cosmos Hub’s billions of dollars of staked&nbsp;ATOMs.</p><p>In August, Informal Systems published<a href="https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v0.1"> v0.1 pre-release</a> of Interchain Security, which, at a high-level, is an implementation of the Interchain Security protocol that is set to go live in January 2023. This protocol implements: validator set change packets and confirmations; slashing packets; distribution packets; Cosmos-SDK modifications. You can check out the full specification<a href="https://www.notion.so/Interchain-Security-Testnet-cc65af3d57724c2bab52a04f3f3d3a7d"> here</a>.</p><p>For this testnet, we will work together to test out features of the protocol that validators will be running! Further, validators will have an opportunity to test “real world” consumer chain software that will be adopting Interchain Security in 2023! These projects include: <a href="https://linktr.ee/neutron.org">Neutron</a>, Duality and&nbsp;Stride!</p><p>20 000 ATOMs will go to Game of Chains&nbsp;winners!</p><p>Cosmos Hub validators will compete for rewards throughout this public testnet which is funded by the community pool via <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/77">Prop 77</a>! Thank you to the entire Cosmos community for supporting this initiative. ✨</p><p>Rewards will be distributed to winning validators based on a points system (more details to come!). These rewards will be allocated to validators that complete certain tasks, and submit an entry for Testnet&nbsp;awards.</p><p>👉Please note that only active Cosmos Hub validators are eligible for rewards! Further, if you win, your validator will be required to provide KYC information in order to receive ATOM&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>What are the next&nbsp;steps?</p><p>First, any interested validator needs tosign up to participate in Game of Chains! <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022</a></p><p>To start coordinating your participation in Game of Chains, you will be added to the Cosmos Network discord channel with the information provided in the registration form. Make sure you are in the discord <a href="https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork">here</a>. Channel: #game-of-chains</p><p>Game of Chains is scheduled to launch on November 7, 2022.

      Elena Nadolinski: Privacy for the People        <p>By Nicole Zakheim</p><p>Photography: CAYCE CLIFFFORD</p><p>Published October 27, 2022</p>        Driven by a passion for computers and community, a cryptocurrency founder creates a solution for all.      



 
 
   
<p>One night in 2017, Iron Fish founder Elena Nadolinski attended a birthday party at the Palo Alto home of Protocol Labs founder and CEO Juan Benet. Her then-boyfriend, now-husband and Figma co-founder, Dylan Field, had been roommates with Benet, and they were part of a close group of friends. The party was filled with talk about cryptocurrency generally, and Ethereum specifically. Benet’s company had started Filecoin, a cryptocurrency-operated file storage network, and he was about to roll out the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized storage and file referencing system that can operate on Ethereum.</p>



<p>Something about the conversation struck her as particularly urgent—all these “incredibly brilliant people, being all very excited about this piece of technology”—cryptocurrency, but it was still too complicated for most people to widely adopt it. It required hours of setup, some technical knowhow and access to powerful computers. To Nadolinski, who had had immigrated to America from Russia when she was 8, it seemed like two ideas in opposition: cryptocurrency promised to be a currency for the people, by the people, but it was still limited to those with the resources and ability to immerse themselves in technology to participate. What about the rest of the world? On the way home, Nadolinski sat shotgun, phone in hand, scrolling down an internet wormhole as Field drove across the dark city.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadolinski had been recognized as a teen by the White House as an up-and-coming computer science superstar, interned at Microsoft and had been recruited as an engineer by the buzzy startup Tilt, and then worked at Airbnb, but she admits that by the time of this party, she didn’t really get the technology that powers the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency. “It’s inaccessible for even a smart, technically savvy person,” she says. She Googled: “What is Ethereum?” and flicked through the results. When she remembers this moment now, she laughs at herself trying to get to the bottom of a set of wildly complex questions while driving home from a party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ethereum is this world computer, right? So, okay, that’s a really big phrase. What does that mean? Ethereum does distributed computations. Again, what is that? That seems confusing. And so the first kind of use case that I read about it was something to do with decentralized voting. How do you make voting more fair? And I thought, okay, that’s interesting, but that doesn’t seem like such a breakthrough. And so I kept kind of digging and digging and digging into it. And the first use case that actually made the most sense to me was non-fungible tokens.” She saw the non-fungible tokens, or NFTs—digital files whose proof of ownership can be stored on the blockchain, so a person can show they own the “original”—as a compelling use of the blockchain because they introduced scarcity to something that was previously considered endlessly replicable. Within several months, Nadolinski went from thinking about scarcity to charting a path to a more accessible cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>This is how Nadolinski, now 30, talks—moving from one massive idea to the next, toggling between tech lingo and business jargon in a rapid conversation style that makes concepts like “world computer” or “non-fungible token” easier to understand. After her Ethereum-Google in 2017, Nadolinski researched cryptocurrency ecosystems, reading white papers and speaking with founders, protocol developers and engineers. As a curious computer scientist, she was drawn to the complexity. But as a person, she was drawn to cryptocurrency’s close-knit community and its members’ enthusiasm for its possibilities. She started attending hackathons and meetups, asking questions, offering solutions, making friends and contributing in such a meaningful way that she started receiving invitations to present. Soon, she stepped away from her job at Airbnb to pursue cryptocurrency full-time.</p>



<p>Today, Nadolinski and her team are close to launching Iron Fish as a layer 1 blockchain to support a new cryptocurrency as well as a privacy layer for other existing cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are the least private way of transacting; the transparency of crypto transactions is the pillar of trustless verification. It means anyone could track an individual’s crypto transactions in real time using data-mining techniques. Since crypto digital wallets have unique addresses, their transactions can be traced by cross-referencing with personal data. And even while some cryptocurrencies are private, and others can be made private, the processes are cumbersome, confusing and still may be vulnerable to deanonymization. All transactions on Iron Fish are encrypted, protecting the user by hiding transaction information through a cryptographic technique called zero-knowledge proofs. Eventually, as Iron Fish becomes more mature and integrates with more existing blockchains, any cryptocurrency transaction can be made private in a compliant way. This means that, some day, users could have all the advantages of any cryptocurrency without the privacy issues that currently plague it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The name Iron Fish alludes to the protective power of cryptography. During World War II, the United States used codes to communicate with allies that were based on Native American languages, spoken by Native American enlisted men called Code Talkers. The code, never broken, was declassified in 1968. Nadolinski chose the word Iron Fish, meaning submarine—“besh-lo” in the code derived from the Diné (also known as Navajo)&nbsp; language—because the idea of a submarine was strong, protective and something secret, or in this case, private.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Issuing currency is a primary function of modern governments, which enact policies to keep it stable so a nation’s economy can function. Cryptocurrency can be a way to hedge against the inflation or deflation that comes with traditional currencies. “For people in the United States, it’s like, well, ‘I think maybe it’s nice in a moral, philosophical way for me to hedge my bet in terms of which currency I keep my wealth in,’” Nadolinski says, “but for other people in Venezuela, Turkey, Argentina, Russia, Ukraine, all those countries are experiencing inflation … if they could have a way out …” Beyond that practical application, Nadolinski’s company is part of a rapidly growing cohort of encryption and privacy tools—messaging, browsers and VPNs—designed to protect users from the threat of data scraping, surveillance and hacking. “Freedom is synonymous in many ways with privacy,” Nadolinski says. “So even though Americans have forgotten how good they have it, there are so many arguments for them to still care about private cryptocurrencies.” Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire understood the promise of Iron Fish the moment he heard about it, and Sequoia invested in November 2021. With a deep technical background, Maguire had heard about the promise of blockchain technologies since at least 2007. So when he met Nadolinski more than a decade later, he was intrigued by her vision for realizing blockchains’ potential for usability and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maguire imagines a scenario where Iron Fish would be even more necessary—a hypothetical future in which cryptocurrencies are used for everyday transactions, in which it would be possible for scammers to see people’s anonymous-but-public transactions and trace them back to a wallet and know where that person is, what they’re doing, and even what they’re planning to do. “Imagine you’re buying an airline ticket to fly from L.A. to Europe,” Maguire says. “So someone can guess you’re going to be out of town for the next week and they can go rob your house.” Nadolinski also tells a story about speaking to a good friend who said they wanted a private cryptocurrency to spend at Burger King, because they didn’t want their health insurance provider to know about their diet habits and raise their rates. This is only partially hypothetical. At the moment, cryptocurrencies cannot be spent at Burger King, but can be spent at McDonald’s, and retailers like Amazon, Overstock, Microsoft and AT&amp;T, among others.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Nadolinski and her parents immigrated to America when she was in elementary school. They lived in several places but eventually settled in Virginia. She spoke little English and her parents held her back a year so she’d be in the same grade as another student who spoke Russian and English. This was a disaster; Nadolinski remembers her as a bully who intentionally mistranslated things. So Nadolinski pushed herself to learn English rapidly at school, and as she grew up, she found a cohort of “supersmart, badass” girlfriends who “all wanted to change the status quo.” Her parents worked as software engineers, and she’d page through their books at home. In high school, she took her school’s AP computer science class and taught herself everything else she’d need to know to become vice president of the computer science club and president of its robotics club. She loved her teammates, the kind of kids who liked to tinker and code, and who, she jokes self-awarely, “liked to stay after school for hours to make sure that the robot goes straight.” The robots went straight enough that the team earned a second-place finish at a global competition. She <a href="http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/virginia_tech/article_aa071111-6125-55fd-9520-bd05d14d20b2.html">was honored</a> at the White House with the Aspirations in Computing Award from the National Center for Women in Information Technology, and the Central Intelligence Agency gave her an award, recognizing a program she designed to compress images. The irony doesn’t escape her today, pointing out that image compression is related to encryption, which the CIA knows something about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadolinski first heard about cryptocurrency in 2011. During a fundraising brainstorm for the robotics team, a teammate suggested they use the school’s computer lab to mine Bitcoin. The currency was still new, and worth between $1-$30 each. Nadolinski shut the idea down, saying, “That’s silly. It’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH5-rSxilxo">never going to work</a>.” And just as her opinion of cryptocurrency from 2011 has evolved, the rest of the world is catching up. Larry David starred in a 2022 Super Bowl commercial, playing a character who scoffs at the wheel, ridicules the light bulb and mocks the indoor toilet. The commercial was for FTX, a notably accessible cryptocurrency exchange. Today Nadolinski laughs, ruefully describing how if she’d been game for the idea, the team would, in all likelihood, be perpetually endowed. As of this writing Bitcoin trades at about $20,000, and has been as high as $68,000.</p>



<p>After graduating high school, Nadolinski studied computer science at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. During the school year, she interned at the cloud computing services company Rackspace for engineer Dave King, who is still a mentor and friend. For up to 10 hours a week, she tackled a backlog/wishlist of “tiny tickets,” but King remembers one of Nadolinski’s projects that was “not that tiny.” He says she handled the moment gracefully when managers suddenly realized that some code she’d been updating impacted several other pieces. “We thought it was scoped, and it was clearly not scoped,” he says with a chuckle. It launched Nadolinski into a nine month project, “She was in rooms seeing how implementation might happen and seeing how to make the decision,” King says. “I think Elena was quite fastidious in attention to detail … which is something that brought her success. She was good in collaborative situations, as the intern, understanding how people made things work and fixed things.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>King says great engineers are distinguished by their ability to figure out ways to get around problems, something he saw in Nadolinski immediately. “Like, there are five little hurdles. Which ones are the ones we invest in to fix? And which ones do we just let go? Knowing how to manage your time, making choices for today and the future. Some people are like, ‘We have to fix everything all the time.’ And that is not as productive.” Nadolinski spent summers interning for Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, and after graduating in 2015, she took a full-time job there. Nadolinski realized she loved collaborative building but hated bureaucracy. After a year, she moved to San Francisco to immerse herself in the more collaborative startup world. She got a job working again for King, this time at the new crowdfunding company Tilt, but it was acquired by Airbnb about seven months after she started. “She was asking me about the user acquisition strategy,” says King, remembering Nadolinski as being particularly savvy about business even as she was working on the engineering side. “Tilt went international to grow our customer base, and signups were very high, but you can only go into so many new markets,” he continues. “And we had a conversation like, ‘Is this really going to work?’ And she didn’t get the answers she really wanted … and when we took the acquisition, I was like, ‘Oh, Elena figured this out six or seven months ago.’ She had a healthy skepticism about the information she was getting, and really getting into the details of things to understand what was going on.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now at Airbnb, several months after the Ethereum epiphany at the birthday party, she attended EthWaterloo, a 36-hour Ethereum hackathon in the Canadian computer science hub of Waterloo, Ontario, which attracted hundreds in October 2017. There, she worked on the problem of how to enable decentralized video streaming on the IPFS. She talks about how problem solving in one area unlocked insights in other areas: “And that got me to ask, ‘What is decentralized computing,’ and ‘How do you prove an honest computation?’” That thinking led her to zero-knowledge proofs, which use cryptographic techniques to verify transactions without exposing user data, which is now a big part of how Iron Fish works. But it was more than the thinking and problem solving that made EthWaterloo a turning point for Nadolinski. She tells a story about how at 3:30 a.m., Dan Finley, the man who wrote MetaMask, a cryptocurrency wallet for Ethereum, helped her debug her own MetaMask integration. “And that was a very special feeling. It was like, ‘Wow. This community is so welcoming and so encouraging and is so available to help.’ And so, from that hackathon in particular, it’s like, ‘Wow, I want to be part of this.’” She went on to attend and present at more hackathons, giving talks while live-coding non-fungible smart contracts onstage in about 30 minutes. She says she wanted to encourage more people to experiment with Ethereum, to see this emerging technology as approachable. And it started to work. Focused on being relentlessly pragmatic and approachable as opposed to theoretical, Nadolinski became an in-demand speaker and collaborator. When she gave a talk called “Demystifying Zero-Knowledge Proofs” in 2018 at Devcon IV in Prague, tracing the history of cryptography through to its involvement in cryptocurrency today, people reached out on Twitter and Telegram, thanking her for making such a complex topic so understandable and asking how they could start learning more themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After that talk, she was invited to speak at EthBuenosAires in 2018, the first event of its kind in Latin America. At the same time, Airbnb wanted her to go to Barcelona for a user-research study, a rare, exciting opportunity. She was torn. She was constantly learning from her colleagues at Airbnb, and appreciated the company’s focus on aesthetics, but she’d already booked the trip to Argentina. “That was the turning point of, like, ‘Okay, I feel like I have two jobs, and I’m sucking at both of them, and I need to choose one,’” she remembers. “And I obviously chose crypto.”</p>



<p>“So, I was looking into NFTs already,” she continues. “I was looking into zero-knowledge proofs, and I worked backward. I said, ‘Okay, let’s just assume that in whatever time horizon, crypto payments are going to be ubiquitous, whatever that means. What do we need to get there?’” Privacy seemed like the obvious answer. She explains that today’s levels of transparency are unsafe for users, as in Maguire’s hypothetical plane ticket-buying scenario, but also unsafe for nations. “Everything that you do on any kind of most known blockchains is fully transparent to the world,” she says. “If you use Ethereum or Bitcoin today, your wallet information is available to anyone in the world to see what exchanges you use, what items you have, what protocols or smart contracts you’ve ever interacted with.”</p>



<p>By 2018, ZCash rolled out an open-source protocol called Sapling to try to solve for privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. All forms of currency, whether cash, credit or digital, face the challenge of making a transaction private enough so people feel free to use it in everyday life, while enabling regulators to ensure all transactions are legal. And this balance makes cryptocurrency innovation especially tricky. But this was Nadolinski’s passion, and, after raising funding in 2021 to start hiring a team, it would become her business model: users would move their cryptocurrencies to Iron Fish’s blockchain, which would cloak their assets by anonymizing and encrypting their data, and the miners who add to the blockchain would receive a fee paid in the Iron Fish token, $IRON. This incentivizes use of $IRON for everyone who wants to move their currency to the Iron Fish blockchain. The cryptocurrency community is still figuring out a balance between privacy and minimizing crime committed with cryptocurrency. A crypto wallet typically has a private key, which is analogous to a password, to allow the user to spend their funds, and a public key, to allow the user to request funds. Most privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, including Iron Fish, also support view keys, in addition to private and public keys, at the wallet level. Initially, only the creator of the wallet has access to that wallet’s private, public and view key. The holder of a view key can see all associated transactions with that wallet, even in a fully private system. This allows regulated entities, like exchanges, to be compliant and provide audits. Nadolinski says her team is also working on adding controls on how a cryptocurrency can move in and out of the Iron Fish layer, a kind of monitoring capacity on the bridges between blockchains to limit hackers from taking advantage of the Iron Fish privacy platform. Nadolinski explains, “Crypto can’t go forward without privacy. But the future is going to be privacy-with-compliance. That’s what we are working on at Iron Fish.”</p>



<p>Nadolinski is also working to make Iron Fish especially user-friendly. The Iron Fish core team has a mantra to make Iron Fish “the Apple of blockchains”—inuitive, easy to use and something that works right out of the box. “And it’s actually very difficult to make it work out of the box, because it’s really complicated tech, but we’re trying our best,” Nadolinski says with a self-aware laugh. To get there, she and her team consistently survey early users for feedback about the blockchain implementation and the wallet. And she’s been inspired by Airbnb’s use of design, she says, to make an otherwise unusual experience—“You go into someone else’s house and you sleep on their bed,” or using cryptocurrency—cool. She points to how several private currencies feature black websites, with code-style text or pirate motifs, aesthetics that speak to secrecy, but which are not universally appealing. Her site has inviting language and features bright colors and sea creatures rendered in a woodblock aesthetic. One fish wears sunglasses. But her biggest point of user-design pride is the installation process. Instead of a typical cryptocurrency setup, a multi-step ordeal that can take up to three hours, anyone can run an Iron Fish node using just one command line in the terminal.</p>

<p>***</p>



<p>In May, Nadolinski launched Iron Fish’s second incentivized testnet, a standard way to ensure a new blockchain is stable and bug-free, in which a working version of the blockchain is used by a limited cohort who spot problems in the code and try to stress-test the system. Phase two is wrapping and Phase 3 will launch in the first quarter of 2023, aiming for a mainnet launch in the third quarter. Participants earn $IRON tokens in exchange for certain kinds of participation. At its peak so far, the second testnet has hosted 11,000 concurrent nodes. Bitcoin, the most-used cryptocurrency, for comparison, typically hosts about 15,000 concurrent nodes. “I think that is a testament to how easy it is to run Iron Fish,” says Nadolinski.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This testnet is the last one before the team pushes the blockchain live. Stakes are high. This phase is so critical because, unlike traditional software that can be updated to fix bugs or add features, big changes can break the blockchains themselves. “These testing phases are very stressful because it’s like, if you miss one thing in mainnet, you’re really screwed,” says Maguire. While small updates can be rolled out without breaking the chain, to make a big update, a coordinated effort has to occur in the community of exchanges, miners and users to accept the change, a difficult proposition for a technology spread across a global community. Maguire observes that big code changes where the currency survived the disruption have only happened a handful of times, notably with Ethereum and Bitcoin. “These things were catastrophically painful conversations in these communities and took years to settle,” Maguire says. “So once you ship crypto code, it’s basically final.” And bad code can be a disaster. Estimates of how much cryptocurrencies hackers are stealing vary widely, but the numbers are notable. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/06/reports-show-scammers-cashing-crypto-craze">Federal Trade Commission reports</a> that Americans lost $1 billion in 2021, but the FTC acknowledges that its reports represent a fraction of the likely total. The blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, which doesn’t guarantee its data, estimates that <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-Crypto-Crime-Report.html?">$14 billion worth of cryptocurrencies has been stolen because of weaknesses in code</a>.</p>

<p>Nadolinski says the Iron Fish testnet is now processing more zero-knowledge proof transactions than any other chain. But she is balancing development and optimization with the pressure to launch. Iron Fish’s value depends on getting people to want to use it, and testnets create the kind of buzz that leads to adoption. Maguire speaks to the pressure from the community: “They’re like, ‘We’re desperate. Get this thing out. We want to use Iron Fish in production.’” Nadolinski is sensitive to that sense of urgency. After all, she’s doing all this because of the cryptocurrency community, which she got introduced to through her husband, Field. “He is one of the most connected people I’ve ever met,” she says. When she was at Microsoft, Tilt started recruiting her, so she Googled its co-founders, James Beshara and Khaled Hussein. She spotted Beshara in the 2015 Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list for Consumer Tech. Also in that year’s cohort was Field, pictured with a tremendous grin, one that makes him stand out on the page, still searchable today. “And I scrolled past this face, and it was like, ‘Wow. This person’s my age, was an intern at Microsoft, started a company, raised $3 million.’ I was like, ‘Whoa. I thought I had to have years of experience to do this. And here’s a person who just did it.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, she accepted the job at Tilt, moved to San Francisco, broke up with her boyfriend and gave in to her friends’ prodding to join a dating app. One day, she chose OKCupid and started scrolling. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, where did I move?’ There was that phrase: the odds are good, but the goods are odd. Yeah. And I kept scrolling and scrolling and scrolling, and getting kind of depressed. Then I see a face, and I thought, ‘Whoa, I recognize that face.’”</p>



<p>She says she assumed Field was out of her league, but she wanted to start her own company and hoped he’d agree to meet to talk shop. He was the first and only person she messaged, asking him either to coffee or lunch, and dropping in a link to her LinkedIn profile. Field responded enthusiastically, but said that the LinkedIn link was a first for him on the dating site. Nadolinski laughs telling the story now: “I was privacy-conscious and my OKCupid account had almost no information. It had a picture, but you couldn’t tell it was me.” She’d posted only one image, a picture taken from far away. In it, she wears glasses, which she typically doesn’t. “It had my age and my height, because I thought that was important. I’m very short. And my Facebook wasn’t publicly accessible. So I wanted to show him that I’m a real person. The only way I thought of doing that was my LinkedIn profile. It was a very logical decision.”</p>



<p>He replied that lunches were hard, but he could do dinner. It’s not lost on Nadolinski that she had to design her own privacy-protecting solution for interacting authentically on a dating app. They’ve been together ever since. When Nadolinski talks about founding Iron Fish, she focuses on how the tech community, and the cryptocurrency community specifically, rewarded her curiosity and generosity with help and encouragement. Her appreciation for how that community has been uniquely accessible in spirit, even if not in technology, is what she’s built Iron Fish around. Now she’s poised to make the community she loves so much even larger, sharing it through greater accessibility—with most anyone with a computer, or two, and internet access. “A lot of people around the world are excited about blockchain. They’re excited to participate in a new layer 1 project,” Nadolinski says. And with her focus on pragmatic solutions and that user-friendliness, she’s excited to help them as a member of a community that has helped her so many times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“And that was a very special feeling. It was like, ‘Wow. This community is so welcoming and so encouraging and is so available to help.’ And so, from that hackathon in particular, it’s like, ‘Wow, I want to be part of this.’</p>

<p>“That was the turning point of, like, ‘Okay, I feel like I have two jobs, and I’m sucking at both of them, and I need to choose one. And I obviously chose crypto.”</p>

In our digital society, companies continue to request personal user information in exchange for their services — without individuals fully comprehending what they’re agreeing to. What’s worse, these companies fail to secure this data from outside attacks, which have become all too&nbsp;common.</p><p>The current regulatory model is broken. It requires companies (large and small) to capture private information about individuals to “verify” them. This creates large honeypots of personal information in corporate data centres and creates a huge attack vector for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>Despite these challenges, we’re at a sliding-door moment in history. New technologies for the safe storage and sharing of personal data now exist. This is important as data growth on the internet isn’t slowing down. <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/big-data-statistics/#gref">In 2020, every person generated 1.7 megabytes per second</a>. Yet US <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/a-customer-centric-approach-to-marketing-in-a-privacy-first-world">Mckinsey research</a> suggests only around 33% of people believe companies are using their personal data responsibly.</p><p>With data hacks and leaks on the increase, it raises questions about the fundamental design decisions for securing personal data. Can alternate models that put the user first really offer stronger protections for individuals? I believe&nbsp;so.</p><p>Web3 aims to protect personal information as digital property rights through users owning and controlling their data. By putting data back in the originator’s hands it means there are fewer large repositories of data controlled by companies that can be hacked and leaked. By not having to hold that personal data, companies can also reduce their risk exposure.</p> Notable hacks and broken&nbsp;trust <p>The frightening list of hacks of personal data is <a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/">long</a>. Here are some of the largest leaks in recent&nbsp;years:</p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4?r=US&amp;IR=T">533,000,000 users from 106 countries</a> had their phone numbers, full names, locations, birthday and in some cases emails leaked. This data is from a vulnerability that was patched in 2019 but the data was released publicly in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Microsoft: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/01/22/microsoft-security-shocker-as-250-million-customer-records-exposed-online/?sh=79a44d374d1b">250,000,000 users</a> worth of customer service and support logs spanning 14 years were found to be accessible through unprotected servers with public access. Containing IP addresses, emails, geographic locations, confidential case notes and case&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/29/linkedin-breach/">700,000,000 users’</a> phone numbers, physical addresses, geolocation data and inferred salaries were stolen in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>In the first half of 2022, Flashpoint <a href="https://flashpoint.io/resources/report/state-of-data-breach-intelligence-2022-midyear/">reported 1,980 data breaches</a>, 60% the result of hacking. And these are only the reported breaches. Common data leaks reveal email addresses, names, addresses, credit card numbers, health and financial information.</p>Source: <a href="https://flashpoint.io/resources/report/state-of-data-breach-intelligence-2022-midyear/">Flashpoint</a> (2022)<p>These are public companies with vast resources that can hire the best and brightest minds in security. It’s commonplace to store passwords as hashes for security but the rest of your data is plain text. So, why is the rest of user personal data, like phone numbers and postal addresses, stored less securely?</p><p><a href="https://www.lepide.com/research/2020-state-of-data-security-report.pdf">Lepide found in their 2020</a> global survey that 57% of companies have two or more open data shares and 77% have over 5,000 ‘stale’ sensitive files. Businesses struggle to know where their data resides, why it has been collected, who has access to it and how it is actually being used. Additional copies of data increases a company’s attack exposure, creating more data sources that can be exploited by&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>Why does personal user data have to exist in duplicate across different companies in centralised databases? Uploading your drivers licence to a company to be verified in exchange for services is an example of&nbsp;this.</p><p>We are “duplicating” our personal data for each of these companies. The duplication of these personal identifiers increases our individual risk if there’s a future leak. This is particularly a concern when we repeatedly see company failure to keep data safe, time and time again. These databases shouldn’t exist in the first place. Instead an individual should control their own data in their own database.</p><p>End-to-end encryption and personal data ownership and control can change&nbsp;this.</p><p>Individuals can own their personal information and share it “on demand” with companies who can verify, then delete, eliminating the huge systematic security risks created by current regulatory requirements.</p> No one cares about privacy until they need&nbsp;it <p>Before the internet, it was commonplace for people to print births, deaths and marriages in the paper. As old newspapers get digitised, it becomes possible for scammers to search for ‘your mothers maiden name’ and birthday. This is an example of an unintended consequence. It was impossible to predict the impact of printing a birth in the newspaper before the digital&nbsp;era.</p><p>Scientist, Carl Sagan, captured this sentiment:</p><p>“It was easy to predict mass car ownership but hard to predict Walmart.”</p><p>In much the same way, it’s impossible to predict the long-term consequences of troves of stolen personal data. It’s not a far stretch to imagine the worst-case scenarios as governments seek to streamline processes.</p><p>Take personal health data, for example. With a large enough pool of stolen health data, it would be possible to build risk assessment models with it. These models with their opaque algorithms are licensed by health insurers to deny cover to your childrens’ children because of risk factors in your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Personal data security isn’t just an issue&nbsp;now.</p> Zero-party data management is a step&nbsp;forward <p>Many companies are shifting from legacy data collection methods through the use of third-party cookies and data acquisition with data brokers and assessing alternative options. This is being hastened by the <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/us/en/blog-list/2020/what-the-end-of-third-party-cookies-means-for-advertisers.html">phasing out of third-party cookies</a> which will affect brands and advertisers. Third-party cookies are now being blocked by default in web browsers. <a href="https://thecustomer.net/forrester-on-the-the-zero-party-data-revolution/">21% of users</a> in the US are searching with cookie-blocking add-ons to prevent cross-site tracking.</p><p>Users are waking up to being ‘the&nbsp;product’</p><p>This shift is prompting most companies to uplift their first-party data approaches. That is data collected directly from user in-app and website behaviours and not shared elsewhere. This data is still generally captured as a requirement for interacting with the&nbsp;company.</p><p>An approach that honours the user is adopting zero-party data strategies. Zero-party data is shared intentionally by a user with a company. Intentionally being the operative word. This could be their purchase preferences, likes or other personal data that they’re comfortable having the company recognise them by. This data can play a valuable role for companies in personalising its experience for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Zero-party data is the user consenting what they wish to share about themselves. It establishes a stronger trust relationship between the company and user, through transparency and data minimisation around value exchange. Zero-party data is higher quality data, compared to other forms of data, as it comes straight from the&nbsp;user.</p>Source: <a href="https://www.groupfio.com/getting-by-without-cookies-why-zero-party-data-is-the-future-for-digital-marketing/">FiO</a><p>Whilst zero-party data establishes principles for a stronger consent model for sharing personal information, that data still is typically stored with the company it’s shared&nbsp;with.</p><p>This brings us back to the problem and the solution — how data is stored. Web3 data models and personal data vaults truly give users privacy-preserving tools with strong consent workflows for how this information is shared and engaged&nbsp;with.</p> So, how do we achieve&nbsp;this? <p>If the top companies we interact with everyday are getting hacked, what does this mean for the rest of us? What’s the solution?</p><p>Shift data ownership and control to the user and encrypt&nbsp;it.</p><p>Encrypting personal data when it’s not in use makes it harder for hackers to get access to the human readable data. So the question then becomes, where should the encryption occur?</p><p>If the encryption happens on the server then the UX for the user is simple. The trade off is there’s no way for the user to know that it’s actually happening. It’s kind of like buying a car from a used car salesman who says: “Trust me, this is a great car. Just take my word for it. There’s no need for a vehicle inspection, it’s a total waste of money.” Would you just take them at their word? Or would you feel better if those claims could be verified? You’d need more than a stranger’s word.</p><p>If the encryption is done on the user’s device, the individual has control over their keys and can verify that their data is being encrypted. However, this means that the user is responsible for their key management. If they don’t take this seriously or fully understand it, they can get locked out of their accounts with no way to reset&nbsp;access.</p><p>End-to-end encryption enables private and secure data sharing for all. This is a key capability that should be built into data communications to ensure user privacy. Data is encrypted from sender to recipient, remains encrypted during transit and cannot be decrypted by anyone but the intended recipient. We’ve seen Zoom and Whatsapp recently implement this in their&nbsp;apps.</p><p>It’s possible for users to own their personal data, store it in a secured encrypted decentralised database network and consent to share it when seen appropriate.</p><p>This is a core primitive for Web3 that Verida has brought to market for user-controlled data storage solutions.</p> Secure data web3 storage for personal&nbsp;data <p>One of the challenges in today’s digital ecosystem is the lack of secure private data storage for user-owned personal data. This is one very critical component for data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>File storage networks in web3 are a growing sector. The top four protocols have a combined market cap of $2.4 billion (Filecoin, Arweave, Storj &amp; Sia) as of Oct 24th 2022. They remain unsuitable for the most sensitive personal information, which is generally structured in databases, as they are open public storage networks most suitable for blob storage like media, audio and video. By design they are not able to provide compliance required by regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, and&nbsp;CCPA.</p><p>There have been attempts to store encrypted data on these protocols, but the encrypted data still remains public. It’s susceptible to (and highly likely) that improvements in technology will be capable of breaking the encryption, making everyone’s private information public for the world to&nbsp;see.</p><p>“Encrypted Data Vaults” are an emergent storage solution that help preserve data privacy and ensure trusted data access. They provide users with access to data storage they control with their own private keys, similarly to how users control private keys to access their crypto tokens. They can be managed by a user through a self-custody digital wallet and available in web browsers and on mobile&nbsp;devices.</p>Source: <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/concepts/data-storage">Verida Self-Sovereign Data Storage</a>&nbsp;(2021)<p>At Verida, we’ve implemented encrypted data vaults that store data on Verida<a href="https://github.com/verida/documentation/blob/feature/where-to-store-web3-data/docs/network/storage-node"> storage nodes</a>, which is open source software and can be self-hosted. The nodes provide end-to-end encrypted database storage. This means that the operator of the data node cannot read the data stored in the node they’re running. This data is synchronised in real-time with the Verida Vault for easy interaction with applications.</p><p>Access to the data on the storage nodes are protected with authentication and authorisation protocols that ensure access is tightly controlled, unlike existing public storage protocols. Users can move their data to different, private nodes, at any time. Data can be guaranteed to be stored in a particular country or region, to ensure compliance with “cross-border” data regulatory requirements common in most countries.</p><p>Users can choose what personal information they share with companies and revoke that access at any time. This brings forward a future web where users can safely control personal data, without duplication. It’s a&nbsp;win-win.</p> Managing personal data needs to be&nbsp;easy <p>MetaMask is one of the most popular crypto wallets. It had 545,000 monthly active users in July 2020, hit <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/metamask-users-defi-ethereum-decentralized-finance-consensys-crypto-2021-8">over 10M by August 2021</a> and was <a href="https://decrypt.co/86263/ethereum-wallet-metamask-reports-21-million-users">21M by November 2021</a>. Usage of crypto wallets is growing, their ease of use is improving. A growing number of people are taking control of crypto assets and becoming familiar with this new technology. We see this same trend extending beyond crypto to personal data,&nbsp;too.</p><p>In the future users will have a digital wallet on their phone, only accessible to them. This digital wallet holds and protects their private encrypted data. The user can grant outside access on an “as needs” basis, for trusted service providers to deliver personalized offerings. This enables end-to-end encrypted zero-party data sharing between users and companies.</p><p>Once given access, third parties can validate data, provide a digitally signed verification certificate, then delete it. This verification certificate can be shared with companies so a user no longer has to provide the actual data to any company to access the&nbsp;service.</p>Verida Vault: Data and Credentials<p>All personal data is portable and doesn’t have to be duplicated. Our digital wallets will become the home interface for our data, that is owned and managed by the user. This is what Verida is building with the <a href="https://www.verida.io/vault">Verida Vault</a> mobile application.</p> Building a safer future for personal&nbsp;data <p>Web3 brings a fundamental change to the ownership and control of user data. Sensitive personal data doesn’t have to stay concentrated in closed platforms and duplicated across different company databases where it’s at risk of security breaches.</p><p>User-owned data can be shared cryptographically with companies and applications when needed. New open data markets and associated business models can also form based around user consent and zero-party data.</p>Digital wallets are key to personal data&nbsp;control<p>Challenges with implementing these new web3 data models do exist. The problem of personal data duplication across corporate databases is partly driven by regulatory requirements to store and retain data. But regulation and data architectures are shifting. We are seeing innovation occurring <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/finnish-consortium-pilot-eidas-compliant-self-sovereign-identity-network-409161/">particularly in Europe</a> that are user-centric initiatives giving control of data back to&nbsp;users.</p><p>The unbundling of data ownership from applications in Web3 shifts personal data control from companies to individuals. This ultimately can reduce data security risks for companies, as they don’t need to store the data themselves.</p><p>Verida is building open source technologies that makes implementing data encryption and personal data storage solutions easier. The Verida open source libraries have a package for managing the user’s keys. Verida simplifies the process for developers to implement good encryption practices. Verida has built the Verida Vault to handle the key management for users in the Verida&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Verida is working closely with partners for ecosystem growth, health, and success.

Findora would become the first privacy-focused chain on Synapse and gain exposure to many new communities if the proposal&nbsp;passes.</p> TL;DR <p>❗️Between October 26th and October 29th, Synapse Bridge will vote to integrate the Findora&nbsp;Network.</p><p>❗️Synapse is a major cross-chain bridge linking over 16 ecosystems, exposing Findora to new communities.</p><p>❗️If the proposal passes, the Findora Foundation and Synapse will create high-yield liquidity pools to promote $FRA, $SYN, and $nUSD, Synapse’s stablecoin.</p><p>A cross-chain bridge featuring a DEX and liquidity pools, Synapse connects over 16 EVM and non-EVM chains, including Arbitrum, Fantom, Avalanche, Cronos, BNB Chain, and Polygon. Synapse is a battle-tested project that has handled over $11.45 billion in total bridge transfers. It currently stands at #14 by TVL on Avalanche and #17 on Polygon, according to <a href="https://defillama.com/">DefiLlama</a>.</p> Mutual Benefits <p>The proposal holds many potential benefits for Findora and&nbsp;Synapse.</p><p>For Findora, users on the 16+ ecosystems integrated into Synapse could access Findora and its $FRA tokens with ease, allowing users to exchange their assets for $FRA and experiment with Findora’s confidential transaction functions.</p><p>As an example, users on Arbitrum or Fantom could quickly swap nUSD (Synapse’s stablecoin) for FRA to pay gas fees or for staking. Currently, users can only transfer assets from Ethereum and BNB Chain using the <a href="https://rialtobridge.io/">Rialto Bridge</a>. By promoting new tokens like $FRA in their <a href="https://synapseprotocol.com/pools">Pools</a> section, Synapse would make it easier to discover Findora, helping it attract more&nbsp;users.</p><p>For Synapse, it will get to add a unique L1, the first in its network to be privacy-focused with extensive zero-knowledge cryptography research. High-yield pools featuring Synapse’s native token, $SYN, and nUSD tokens will be set up on <a href="https://fairyswap.finance/farms">FairySwap</a>, giving their users more options for yield&nbsp;farming.</p> Moving Forward <p>The voting will go live on October 27th, and stay open for three days. If the proposal passes, Synapse and the Findora Foundation will both contribute $13,000 to promote their respective $SYN and $FRA tokens through yield farming&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>On the Findora side, Synapse would contribute to FRA/nUSD and FRA/SYN liquidity pools on <a href="https://fairyswap.finance/farms">FairySwap</a>. Synapse would also promote a high-yield FRA liquidity pool on its platform.</p> About Synapse <p>Synapse Bridge is a secure cross-chain communication platform connecting over 16 different EVM and non-EVM blockchains. Employing an Optimistic security model, Synapse allows any arbitrary data to be exchanged between chains, including contract calls, NFTs, and snapshots.

<p>Ron Conway, a well-known American venture capitalist, once said ‘I think for technology and innovation we have to ignore politics.’</p>



<p>Technology is a clear driver for ingenuity and innovation. Politics, on the other hand, is where intrigue, personal agendas, and the pursuit of power by any means necessary conflate to create a turbulent sea of neverending strife. When the two cross over, results are not always good.</p>



<p>Technology has often been implicated in political scandals. In 1971, a Xerox machine became ground zero for the Pentagon Papers affair that would have grave repercussions for the Nixon Administration. (The scandal would, indirectly, contribute to Nixon’s resignation following Watergate.) In Russia, political technology is a euphemism for election rigging. And the 2016 US election was marred by allegations of foreign interference through social media platforms.</p>



<p>Besides, technological devices have also had a positive influence on politics. Data analytics enables political strategists to obtain more accurate information about voter behaviour. Through this, they can mount more effective political campaigns, for example.</p>



<p>Into the political stage now jump non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain. This article explores the potential applications of digital tokens in the political ecosphere, focusing on fundraising and exclusive NFT-led events.</p>



 Fundraising in the age of blockchain 



<p>Fundraising is a vital tool for any political party intending to become a serious contender in any democratic election. But the political spectrum is, few would deny, a murky pond teeming with shady operatives. Such often resort to morally questionable tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponents. And running deep beneath this darkened surface is a layer of political donors and lobbyists who stake absurd amounts of wealth to push their agenda forward. The so-called dark money is the engine that moves the levers of power. Transparency and accountability are anathemas to all this.</p>



<p>The solution to this issue is complex. Often, those involved in such fundraising schemes have little desire for any solution to be found. Preserving the status quo -and the cash flow- tends to override any moral concerns.</p>



<p>In August 2021, NFTs found their way into the political arena when Scott Jensen, a Republican gubernatorial candidate for Minnesota, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/01/candidate-for-minnesota-governor-releases-campaign-nfts/">issued a series of NFTs to support its campaign</a>.</p>



<p>Jensen released two NFTS, with a run of 25,000 each, and a price tag of $5 per NFT. The proceedings would support his campaign for Governor. By purchasing these items, the buyer would also get access to extra perks, such as meeting Jensen in person.</p>



<p>Democrats are not far behind in the NFT race. Early in October, a group of fundraisers for the Democratic party launched a series of politically-themed NFTs through Front Row, an NFT marketplace. The NFTs themselves were digital representations of people from the Texas Democratic Party. Specifically, the group of more than 50 Democratic lawmakers who had fled the State of Texas in an attempt to block a vote restriction bill put forward by the Republican party. Each NFT was priced at $250. The buyer would be considered a ‘donor’ to the party, with the actual platform -Front Row- taking a fee.</p>



<p>Both in Jensen and the Texas examples, there would be a price limitation of $5,800 to conform to existing campaign financing laws. (Political action committees -PACs- and party committees are not subject to the same guidelines, and that’s where ‘dark money’ reigns supreme.)</p>



<p>The use of NFTs turns these partisan fundraising efforts into interesting experiments. While limited in scope, they certainly offer a glimpse into what might become part of future political campaigns, both in the United States and elsewhere.</p>



 NFT-only political events, and beyond 



<p>Grassroots movements are essential to foment democratic principles in the community. These organisations promote participation, engagement, and inclusiveness, and help drive voter turnout. Members meet regularly in church halls, conference rooms in hotels, and even in pubs, to discuss current matters, etc.</p>



<p>A proposed use case for NFT in the political ambit is the celebration of ‘NFT-only’ conferences and other events. These could only be attended by members of any chapter of local or national grassroots groups who hold a scannable NFT. The tokens could unlock perks for the holder, such as meeting a particular speaker (such as the Jenssen NFTs), digital goodies, merchandise, etc. At the time of writing, there is no known political event adhering to this NFT-led initiative. Hence the 2022 VeeCon event will only be open to those who own a VeeFriend NFT.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In the grand scheme of things, NFTs remain a relatively nascent technology. They have only become a thing in 2021, in the wake of the now infamous Beeple NFT sale. Throughout this year, we have seen NFTs enter the popular lexicon and more and more mainstream commercial ventures dipping their toes into this fascinating Pandora’s Box. In 2022, American retail giant Macy’s auctioned off a range of NFTs based on its iconic Thanksgiving Day parade balloons. Comic book publisher Marvel has released several rounds of comic book-themed NFTs. This alone represents a constellation of possibilities.</p>



<p>NFTs for the political stage remain in a ‘try-before-you-buy’ phase, so to speak. But even though the road ahead remains somewhat hazy, the foundations for a larger NFT sphere of influence have been laid in politics and elsewhere.</p>

      Partnering with Evy: Product Protection You Can Trust        Simon, Shana, Tanguy and their team are making product insurance plans effortless—for merchants and customers alike.  <p>By Stephanie Zhan and George Robson</p><p>Published October 25, 2022</p>      



     
	 
		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>You replace your old cell phone with the latest and greatest model—and it falls on the floor and cracks. Or you buy a beautiful new couch—and spill red wine all over it. We’ve all experienced the frustration of seeing a purchase turn into a headache. The more you spent, the more anxiety-inducing those moments can be—even if the seller is down the street, and certainly if they’re half a world away. If you did spring for insurance to replace that dropped phone or wine-stained sofa, it might take hours to dig through old emails for your policy information and navigate the claims process, only to learn the fine print says you aren’t covered.</p>



<p>And in Europe, you likely don’t have a policy at all. Today, only a fourth of top online sellers offer product protection, and offline retailers have plans that could be vastly improved. Consumers are left on their own, and sellers forgo valuable opportunities to increase their sales and customer loyalty.</p>



<p>But now, Evy co-founders Simon Kemoun, Shana Azria and Tanguy Le Stradic are changing all that. Built from the ground up, their platform offers a simple set of APIs merchants can integrate to offer product insurance, allowing them to price customizable protection plans by category and deliver tailored coverage at lower deductibles. What’s more, Evy can handle the claims—often instantly. Sellers get a turnkey solution that helps their business grow, while customers get transparent policies, stress-free customer service and best of all, peace of mind.</p>



<p>When our friends at La Famiglia introduced us to Simon, Shana and Tanguy last year, Evy was just the three of them, and no product. But they did have complementary backgrounds (Simon previously founded a consumer social app and is a former McKinsey consultant; Shana was a senior engineer at Apple; Tanguy hails from rising-star French neobank Qonto) that combined to give them outsider insight on this space, and they had conviction in their technology-first approach. We were proud to lead their seed round earlier this year.</p>



<p>Fast-forward nine months later, and Evy has now grown into a talented and hard-working team of 10 and counting, offers insurance plans across multiple product categories with partnerships rolling out in phones, other electronic appliances, furniture, and more, and is already expanding beyond their roots in France into several other European countries. This week, as we celebrate their new pan-European partnership with e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.manomano.co.uk/">ManoMano</a>, we are as excited as ever about what the future holds for Simon, Shana, Tanguy and their team—and ultimately, for shoppers everywhere. With each expansion into a new product insurance category, Evy is taking another step toward a world where we can all get what we need, worry-free.</p>



<p>Evy is hiring now! If you’re interested in joining the team, please <a href="https://getevy.notion.site/Careers-at-Evy-239e76fd976e4b87960b6b4a45777473">reach out</a>.</p>

<p>Written by Anirudha Bose</p>
<p>Signing DApp transactions for EVM chains is a security nightmare. It’s very common for users to blindly approve a signature request while being completely oblivious to what the transaction is going to do behind the scenes. This is commonly referred to as “blind signing” in the world of cryptocurrency (not to be confused with blind signatures in cryptography).</p>
<p>Blind signing is unfortunately a very common attack vector in crypto, where an attacker tricks the user into signing a transaction that drains their wallet (since there’s no way for the user to distinguish between a legitimate and a malicious transaction). Earlier this year, in a phishing attack on OpenSea users, an attacker stole hundreds of NFTs by simply tricking victims into signing a transaction to sell all their NFTs for 0 ETH. This story is far too common for the crypto ecosystem to ignore.</p>
<p>With Brave browser release 1.45, we are excited to debut a smarter signing experience on Brave Swap for all EVM transactions. With our latest updates to Brave Wallet, our signing experience is getting a redesign that aims to take the stress out of approving transactions. On any trading platform that’s powered by the 0x API (including Brave Wallet internal swaps), you’ll see clear and straightforward descriptions of how the transaction will impact your token balances.</p>

 The perils of DeFi 
<p>Using DeFi apps today is a lot like going to a shop and asking the shopkeeper to take whatever cash they need from your wallet for the purchase. The contracts you interact with already have an approval to spend part or all of your token balances, using the <code>approve()</code> method of the ERC20 interface. Consider the following transaction approval popup on Metamask, which is a Uniswap trade for USDC-ETH on the Optimism network:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>Approving this transaction requires a leap of faith, since none of the original swap parameters like maker and taker assets, quote amounts, etc. are visible on the approval screen. You’re essentially signing complete gibberish. It’s not just poor user experience; it’s&nbsp; unsafe. This info can be spoofed to execute almost anything without your awareness.</p>

 What the hex? 
<p>Transactions are to smart contracts what HTTP requests are to web services. DApps use a data segment in EVM transactions, known as calldata, to indicate which function to invoke in a smart contract and with what parameters. The calldata however is just a sequence of bytes that’s not human readable. You can view the calldata segment of a transaction on Etherscan under the “Input Data” section, as in the following example:</p>



    



    



    
    


 Anatomy of EVM calldata 
<p>The calldata is a read-only, byte-addressable space where the data parameter of a transaction or call is held. This calldata is encoded by wallets and Web3 clients following the Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI). Let’s look at a simple contract with a method to add two <code>uint256</code> numbers, and see how you’d construct the calldata to execute this method:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>The first four bytes of the calldata, known as function selector, specify the function to be called. Method arguments are packed in chunks of 32 bytes, with types smaller than 32 bytes zero padded if necessary. Fixed-size types like <code>uint256</code>, <code>address</code>, etc. are represented within the available 32 bytes. However, dynamic types like bytes and arrays follow head-tail encoding. In this scheme, the data is packaged at the tail-end of the transaction’s calldata. The arguments are references in the calldata to where the content is.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the calldata example above based on the encoding rules to have a better understanding:</p>



    



    



    
    

<p>We can now update our example contract logic with heavily-commented inline assembly (albeit a bit contrived), to demonstrate how EVM parses the calldata behind the scenes:</p>



    



    



    
    


 Parsing complex calldata 
<p>Here’s a more realistic example of how to parse the calldata of the 0x contract function <code>sellTokenForTokenToUniswapV3</code>, involving dynamic types. Recall that dynamic types use the head-tail encoding scheme, unlike fixed-size types. Our example is a swap trade from COW to USDC, using the following path for the order: COW -&gt; WETH -&gt; USDC.</p>
<p>The function we’re trying to invoke is:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>Here’s the same calldata, but broken down and grouped to indicate how we can parse it to extract meaningful insights about the swap trade.</p>



    



    



    
    

<p>Note that parsing the calldata is not enough—we also needed to figure out the information embedded in the <code>encodedPath</code> argument, which is a Uniswap V3 order path. Thanks to our newfound ability to make sense of the entire calldata segment, we can now infer that the raw hex represented the swap trade 1421.74 COW -&gt; 1000 USDC.</p>

 The end product 
<p>Technical improvements can only be appreciated if an impact is felt by users. So the final piece of the puzzle was to design a UX that gives users all the necessary details to confidently approve a swap, while keeping it generic enough that it can be extended to a vast majority of DEX transactions in the future. After brainstorming with our product designers, here’s what the end product looks like:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>A few highlights of this design:</p>
 
 It displays all the security-critical information about the swap, such as sender account, maker and taker assets along with network information, quote amounts, and exchange rate. 
 It works both for swaps from Brave Wallet as well as third-party DApps integrating the 0x API, on all EVM-compatible networks. 
 The UX could easily be extended to support cross-chain bridge transactions, where the networks for maker and taker assets would be different. 
 The origin of the transaction (i.e. eTLD+1 and the site favicon) are displayed to prevent phishing attacks. 
 

 Conclusion 
<p>We implemented an <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/12797">ABI decoder</a> in brave-core for EVM chains to bring safety and transparency to the transaction approval process. This allowed us to reveal insights about what a seemingly opaque transaction is supposed to do, and build a dedicated UX around it to make the signing process more user-friendly.</p>
<p>In the 1.45 release of the Brave browser, we are bringing this capability to 0x swaps on Brave Wallet, and will soon extend it to Uniswap, Curve, PancakeSwap, and Sushiswap, which should cover more than 70% of all DEX volume on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Building a secure and transparent signing experience in Brave Wallet remains a strong focus for us on the Wallet team. We intend to expand on this work to bring similar UX improvements beyond swaps, such as interacting with lending, cross-chain bridges, and staking DApps.</p>

 Introduction <p>After the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">Merge</a>’s success, the Ethereum network transitioned from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus model into a Proof of Stake (PoS) one, making it a less energy-intensive blockchain. However, amid the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/17/3-must-know-benefits-of-the-ethereum-merge/">numerous positives</a> that the merge appears to have yielded, a <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/04/21/ethereum-merge-threat-lido-finance-proof-of-stake-dominant-defi-platform/">threat of centralization</a> is beginning to rear its ugly head. Thankfully, the Distributed Validator technology can address most of the problems that are associated to this danger.<br></p><p>The task of validating the blockchain has fallen to staking clients instead of miners. Under PoS, the job of a validator is to confirm or propose to add a new block to the blockchain. If the validator's attestation or proposal is timely and accurate, they receive a small reward in ETH. <br></p><p>In theory, anyone can set up a validator node, stake the required amount of ETH, and participate in the network. Yet, several intending validators are instead going through <a href="https://v1.stake.fish/en/ethereum/services/">staking services</a>, with all their <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">risks</a>. But why?<br></p><p>In this article, we’ll look at the current issues (spoiler: centralization) for validators and stakers on Ethereum PoS and how those problems can be solved with Distributed Validator Technology (DVT).</p> Issues with the Ethereum PoS model<br> <p>There is a range of risks for validators and stakers alike when it comes to the Ethereum PoS model. Let’s have a look at each of these issues.</p> Centralization <p>When it comes to retail users, especially those holding small amounts of ETH (Ethereum PoS requires 32 ETH to run a validator), it becomes a complicated procedure for them to set up a validator or maintain it. Hence, it’s very likely that these network participants are inclined towards staking their ETH via staking services. <br></p><p>Since most crypto users hold their funds on custodial platforms such as centralized exchanges, they’re likely to also use a custodial staking service to stake their ETH. Even though custodial staking services promise ease of use and convenience, there are several risks associated with using them, the chief of which is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-11/biggest-ether-staking-service-has-a-centralization-problem">centralization</a>. A central authority is not exactly good news in a global monetary network, and the idea of handing over your keys to an operator who is not immune to slashing penalties, errors, hacks, or even censorship can be devastating for the whole ecosystem. <br></p>The total value of ETH staked by some of the most important actors and platforms suggests a growing centralization problem. (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/centralization-risks-and-flaws-of-ethereum-merge">Source</a>) Single points of failure <p>When a user runs a solo validator, the custody of a validator's private keys is a crucial matter. If a validator losses access to their private keys, they could lose access to their funds. This represents a difficult <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ethereum-account-abstraction-everything-you-need-to-know/">user experience</a> and constitutes a single-point-of-failure risk. The Ethereum PoS protocol doesn’t make it easier either, as its rules prohibit redundancies of any kind. Thus, a validator can only sign messages or remain online via a <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/my-journey-to-becoming-a-validator-on-ethereum-2-0/">single machine</a>.<br></p>The process of becoming a validator on Ethereum PoS. (<a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/my-journey-to-becoming-a-validator-on-ethereum-2-0/">Source</a>)<p>If an attacker breaks into a validator’s machine and gains access to the private key, their activities can cause the affected validator to suffer a slashing of their stake. When a stake is slashed, a portion of the validator’s locked funds is deducted by the protocol. Ultimately, this leads to a loss of funds, revealing the massive vulnerabilities of a single point of failure.</p> Validator liveness check <p>Suppose a validator client fails to sign messages for any reason, ranging from breaks in the network connection or cloud failures to software crashes or hardware issues. In that case, they suffer penalties due to inactivity. They will lose a portion of their staked balances. <br></p><p>Penalties due to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/solutions/double-signing-protection">double-signing</a> can also arise, especially if a validator suddenly goes offline while signing a message. Thus, validator clients risk deposit slashing if they sign multiple instances with the same key, sign the same message twice, or go offline when others are offline. This favors professional validators and discourages the average user with the resources to become one from being a validator, therefore leading to a few validators retaining most of the power.</p> Private key custody <p>There’s a well-known saying in the crypto ecosystem, “Not your keys, not your coins.” If you don’t have custody of your private keys, you’re always at the mercy a of custodial service for the safety of your funds. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/staking/saas/">Staking services</a> offer a way out for participants who do not want to face the risks of dealing with a solo validator setup and maintenance directly, but there's a catch. Stakers using these services have to hand over their private keys to the service in a setting that requires them to trust the staking service operator fully. They must trust the operator for the security of their staking private key.<br></p><p>With staking services, key ownership can be a tricky topic. A sense of security comes with having control over your private keys as a solo validator. Using a staking service will require you to give up that sense of security, trusting someone else to do it for you. For systems where anything can go wrong and malicious actors lurk under the guise of honesty, it is not advisable to trust someone else with the custody of your keys.</p> Forking penalties <p>Under the PoS regime, validator clients connect to Beacon nodes. In the unlikely event that a Beacon node to which a validator is connected <a href="https://www.bsc.news/post/ethereum-bug-leads-to-node-failure-and-a-subsequent-fork-in-the-network">develops a fault</a>, a fork will be created. If the validator client is affected by this anomaly, it will follow the forked chain and appear offline to the main PoS protocol, resulting in penalties.<br></p><p>—-------------------------------<br></p><p>Centralization is sufficient to defeat the purpose of a permissionless and transparent blockchain, but the threats to security and loss of deposits due to penalties are enough to discourage anyone from participating. These issues have created the need for the development of Distributed Validator Technology. Let’s understand what is Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) and how it aims to solve the issues mentioned above.</p> What is Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)? <p>Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) is a decentralized open-source protocol that allows the duties of a validator to be distributed among multiple nodes, as opposed to a single machine, leveraging threshold cryptography. DVT provides a decentralized staking layer on Ethereum, allowing anyone to create and share a validator over multiple <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/fault-tolerance">fault-tolerant </a>machines such that, if any one node is offline or faulty, the validator can continue to perform its duties. The fault-tolerance of a system simply refers to the system’s ability to continue operating despite failures or malfunctions.<br></p><p>In essence, DVT adds an additional layer of fault-tolerance for Ethereum validators removing the possibility of redundancies such as a single point of failure, centralization issues, etc.<br></p>A graphical overview of Distributed Validator Technology (earlier known as SSV). (<a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/eth2-secret-shared-validators-85824df8cbc0">Source</a>)<p>Distributed Validator Technology is a blend of distributed key generation, multi-party computation, Shamir's secret sharing, and Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms that permit validator duties to be split across several nodes without violating the staking rules of Ethereum. We’ll understand these algorithms and what role they play in DVT in the below sections.<br></p><p>In case you’re interested, here’s a video explainer of DVT by Aditya Asgankar from the Ethereum Foundation:</p><p>Distributed Validator Technology not only shares a single validator's duties across several machines but also “distributes” its private keys. Remember, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ethereum-competitors-advantages-and-disadvantages/">Ethereum</a> requires a validator to create or sign messages with its private keys on a single computer. By distributing shares of the private key among multiple nodes and utilizing a distributed key generation scheme, DVT eliminates the single point of failure, as we will see below.<br></p><p>DVT emerged as an idea proposed by the Ethereum Foundation in 2019 in preparation for Ethereum's transition to PoS. Ethereum validators operate with an Active-Passive setup in which backup nodes remain offline. When the active node goes offline, downtimes occur before the backup node can come online, as there are no automatic switches. With DVT, validators can now enjoy an <a href="https://kemptechnologies.com/white-papers/unfog-confusion-active-passive-activeactive-load-balancing">Active-Active arrangement</a>, operating like a multi-signature setup and eliminating single points of failure.</p> How does Distributed Validator Technology work? <p>As mentioned, Distributed Validator Technology combines distributed key generation, Shamir's secret sharing, multi-party computation, and Istanbul's Byzantine Fault Tolerance. You can look at DVT as a multi-signature scheme, but instead of confirming <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">transactions</a>, it is used to perform consensus-required validator duties on the blockchain.<br></p>A working overview of steps involved in the DVT consensus mechanism. (<a href="https://rattibha.com/thread/1530589456872271872">Source</a>) The Distributed Validator Technology pillar: Distributed key generation <p>The first and one of the core components of DVT is a <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/what-distributed-key-generation-is-866adc79620">distributed key generation</a> (DKG) scheme. DKGs involve multiple parties contributing to calculating and sharing a private key such that no single group member has full control over the secret key. The private key is encrypted and split among all participants.<br></p><p>Usually, these nodes qualify as non-<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusting</a>, meaning their operators do not need to know one another, creating sufficient room for fault tolerance. DKG makes way for the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">threshold signing</a> scheme.</p> Shamir's secret sharing and threshold signing <p>Next, <a href="https://medium.com/@keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">Shamir's secret sharing</a> allows the private key to be split such that each participating validator client holds only a piece of the puzzle, and no individual share is sufficient to sign messages. Instead of requiring every participant to be available to reform the secret or sign messages, Shamir's secret sharing employs a threshold, usually predefined, giving room for the validator client to remain online even if there is a faulty or malicious member.<br></p><p>For an example, say we have four operators contributing to a DVT setup, and the threshold for signing messages is 3 out of 4. If one computer goes offline or is not trustworthy, three nodes remain active and can sign messages. With the private key split among four nodes, there is no single point of failure.<br></p><p>Note that Ethereum PoS uses <a href="https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/building_blocks/signatures/">BLS signatures</a>, which allow for aggregation, meaning that it recognizes multiple signatures with the same key and can combine these transactions into one. So, when all participants sign a transaction, the BLS signature system combines all signatures without requiring a complete reconstruction of the private key.</p> Multi-party computation <p>Secure <a href="https://web3wednesdays.xyz/multi-party-computation/">multi-party computation</a> plays a critical role in Distributed Validator Technology. Through MPC, contributing operators can use their secret shares in signing messages and performing computation without reconstructing the secret on any single device. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-deep-dive-into-secure-multi-party-computation-mpc/#applications-of-multi-party-computation">With MPC, the threat of centralizing the private key during computation is eliminated</a>, and the decentralized nature of the distributed validator setup remains intact.</p> Consensus <p>The final piece in the puzzle is a consensus algorithm among Beacon nodes that can achieve fault tolerance through threshold signing schemes. Consensus is achieved among the Beacon nodes to which ETH validators are connected. Beacon nodes are responsible for assigning duties to validator clients.<br></p><p>Using <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">threshold cryptography</a>, a private key is encrypted and split amongst Beacon operator nodes. A threshold number (3 out of 4, 5 out of 7, etc.) is required for any commands to be issued to a validator client. This way, no single Beacon node operator would have unfettered power over a validator.<br></p><p>To reach a consensus over a block in a DVT setup, the <a href="https://media.consensys.net/scaling-consensus-for-enterprise-explaining-the-ibft-algorithm-ba86182ea668">Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance</a> algorithm singles out one Beacon node in the DVT setup as the leader who will propose the block and share it with fellow Beacon nodes. If more than 66% of the Beacon nodes agree that the block is valid, it is added to the blockchain.<br></p><p>If the leader goes offline or is compromised in a DVT setting, the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm will reassign the role to another DVT Beacon node within twelve seconds.</p> Use cases of Distributed Validator Technology <p>Since its proposal in 2019, DVT has been successfully developed by two leading actors: <a href="https://ssv.network/tech/">Secret Shared Validator Technology</a> and the <a href="https://obol.tech/">Obol Network</a>. While these are direct projects spun out with DVT as their core, here are the major possible applications of Distributed Validator Technology:</p> The use of Distributed Validator Technology on Decentralized staking pools <p>Most staking pools today are custodial and have single points of failure, relying on a single validator node with a single key., Added to the threat of a single point of failure is the challenge of experiencing slashing and penalties across the board.<br></p><p>Using a <a href="https://docs.obol.tech/docs/dv/validator-creation">distributed validator setup</a>, staking pools can switch to a decentralized model, reduce penalties and slashing by ensuring minimal downtimes and diversify their current offerings.</p> Staking infrastructure providers <p>To understand how staking infrastructure providers can leverage DVT to offer more robust services, we first need to understand the difference between <a href="https://www.jscape.com/blog/active-active-vs-active-passive-high-availability-cluster">Active-Active and Active-Passive</a> configurations.<br></p><p>When it comes to cloud infrastructure, there are essentially two options on how to configure connections – Active-Active &amp; Active-Passive. In an Active-Active configuration, traffic is load-shared between interfaces based on flow. If one connection becomes unavailable, then all traffic is routed through the other connection. In an Active-Passive configuration, one connection handles traffic, while the other is on standby.<br></p><p>Companies that provide infrastructure to meet individual or institutional staking need solutions towards redundancies of cloud providers with Active-Passive configurations. With DVT setups, infrastructure providers can enable Active-Active cluster redundancies and encourage dynamism in deployments and configurations.</p> Solo validator setups <p>Solo validators that were previously discouraged by high barriers of entry and the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/64-of-staked-eth-controlled-by-five-entities-nansen">risks</a> associated with <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">ETH staking</a> can now participate using a DVT configuration. <br></p><p>With a distributed validator setup, in-house validators can distribute their signing power across multiple nodes in an Active-Active cluster redundancy arrangement. Thus, they minimize the risk of failure and penalties due to downtime, double-signing, etc.</p> In summary, Distributed Validator Technology can be a game-changer <p>Distributed Validator Technology addresses the many challenges of ETH staking and lowers the entry barrier for the average person while encouraging true <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a> on Ethereum. With DVT, institutional or retail validators can meet the protocol’s requirements of safety or liveness, or even both, increase resilience, enjoy Active-Active redundancy configurations, and diversify their operations based on several factors.<br></p><p>As Ethereum now operates fully as a proof-of-stake blockchain, its validators will continue to lean towards more secure and practical configurations for their operations. DVT presents an opportunity for staking on Ethereum to become more decentralized and profitable, even for retail participants. Currently, Obol Network is leading the charge in building an ecosystem for trust-minimized staking that enables people to create, test, run &amp; coordinate distributed validators. Hopefully, in the coming months, we’ll see more development in this direction. <br><br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

     Q3 was an amazing quarter full of growth and exciting new milestones, including the first-ever Horizen ecosystem summit and the first meme coin on TokenMint!&nbsp; 
<p>We are amazed to see the amount of growth we have experienced in a single quarter. We launched several new products and upgrades, grew the team, welcomed a new meme coin to the ecosystem using our new products and more! We are excited to continue meeting new milestones with our growing community.&nbsp;</p>
 Q3 Highlights 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_OCT22_numbers-2.jpg"></a></p>
 Product and Engineering&nbsp; 
<p>The engineering and product teams focused on releasing upgrades to existing products like TokenMint and Cobalt this quarter to enable a wider variety of use cases on the Horizen ecosystem. This included Cobalt upgrades and <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/">documentation on how to use</a> it in preparation for additional functionality like NFTs on Tokenmint!</p>
 TokenMint 
<p>TokenMint Mainnet Launch</p>
<p>Our no-code tokenization platform, <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/tokenmint-is-live-on-mainnet/">TokenMint</a>, was launched on mainnet in Q3! The platform provides a streamlined process for anybody to launch their own token easily and quickly without having a technical background. An introduction of TokenMint with a user guide was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-create-and-launch-a-cryptocurrency-token-with-tokenmint">featured on Cointelegraph</a>. The leading technology media Venture Beat also featured a story on TokenMint where the author covered the importance of tokenization and the value of platforms such as TokenMint in the effort of making blockchain technology more accessible for the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Punkz Token Launch&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform has already been used to launch the first meme token on the Horizen ecosystem called Punkz Token! The token also has it’s own game called <a href="https://pipeflare.io/all-games">Punkz Hero</a>, launched with our partner PipeFlare! Be sure to check it out and get Punkz for playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team has started to add additional features to TokenMint as well. This includes NFTs! While the functionality is currently available on testnet. The team is working towards the mainnet launch, which is coming soon! This will enable people to create their own NFTs utilizing TokenMint and store them on our Cobalt browser wallet. This was an important step for our project because it is one of the many functionalities requested by our community. We were excited to deliver a product many members wanted to see! If you want to try launching your own NFT on TokenMint, head to the home page now, select the NFT tab and check out the guide on loading<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-load-nft-data-into-an-ipfs-repository/"> NFT data to IPFS.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/NFT-zencon0_D1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Thanks to the new NFT functionality on TokenMint’s testnet we launched the first NFT series in time for ZenCon0! The series, called <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zero-gravity-coming-to-tokenmint-an-exclusive-nft-for-zencon0/">Zero Gravity</a>, was issued to all event attendees as a special surprise for those who joined us.</p>
<p>The NFT functionality was also added to <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-ver-1-4-0/">Cobalt wallet version 1.4.0</a>! This version also added ZEN transactions between Cobalt wallet addresses to further extend the usability of our web wallet for our users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the engineering team has been making great progress on the <a href="https://www.horizen.io/blockchain-academy/technology/advanced/evm-ethereum-virtual-machine/">EVM</a> sidechain. The <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/why-evm-compatibility-matters/">EVM sidechain will open our ecosystem</a> up to existing blockchain developers and projects because Ethereum has the largest and most diverse public blockchain ecosystem. This means that EVM compatibility is one of the key ingredients for blockchains like ours to build a successful ecosystem. The team is currently working on the circuit to ensure that our EVM is as secure as possible and is expecting a launch date in early Q1 2023!</p>
<p>There are many benefits to EVM compatibility including existing Ethereum-based defi infrastructure. There are well-established Ethereum smart contracts for an wide range of blockchain-based products, such as automated market makers, decentralized exchanges, peer-to-peer lending protocols, stablecoins, and more. All of which the team is working on or working with new and existing partners to bring to the ecosystem soon!</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/download-the-mandatory-zen-3-2-0-software-upgrade-today/">ZEN 3.2.0</a>! This mandatory upgrade is the first step to&nbsp; preparing our exchange partners, mining pool operators, and full node users for upcoming ecosystem expansion and included upgrades like:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Upgrading integration test suite to Python 3 
 Updates to build system, compatibility with newer versions of Linux 
 Fix IsInitialBlockDownload false positive error message 
 
<p>The final date to upgrade without disruption is approximately October 21st! So be sure to upgrade soon if you haven’t already!</p>
 Community Growth&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_community.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The community has continued to grow steadily this quarter with the largest growth being seen on LinkedIn. Its exciting to see all of our new community members coming together to share their thoughts on what the ecosystem should look like and actively engaging with the team to provide feedback. We look forward to learning more about our newest community members as we continue to expand what Horizen is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This growth has continued to be seen across not only our community, but the web traffic for Horizen as well. We saw a 13% increase in <a href="https://heap.horizen.io/">HEAP</a> organic impressions, which suggests that a portion of our new community is developer-centric. Another exciting growth number we saw was the Horizen Academy content topic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_OCT22_webtraffic.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Our marketing team is in the process of launching a new Horizen Academy! The academy will include content that expands existing articles and educational resources about upcoming products and ecosystem expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are new articles already on the academy including:&nbsp;</p>

This is the first time that there has been an alternative zcash node implementation running on mainnet and that we are excited to see some Zebra nodes now appearing on the <a href="https://blockchair.com/zcash/nodes">Blockchair node explorer</a>!</p><p>We are very happy to share that Zebra also supports the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra#configuring-json-rpc-for-lightwalletd">lightwalletd backend JSON-RPCs</a>, can be used as a lightwalletd backend and is <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zebra-powered-lightwalletd-with-zecwallet-lite/42868">currently an optional backend for ZecwalletLite</a>!</p><p>With this release we have solved the last few outstanding bugs and issues that could have affected the security, performance and stability of the Zcash network and are confident that long-lived Zebra nodes can be run on mainnet. As such, we are looking forward to Zebra experiencing more “production use”, and we will be shortly be engaging security auditors to conduct an audit of the Zebra code to ensure that users can be confident in its security and stability.&nbsp;</p><p>This release of Zebra can be used to join the Zcash peer-to-peer network, which helps to keep Zcash working by validating and broadcasting transactions, and maintaining the Zcash blockchain state in a distributed manner. Zebra’s network stack is interoperable with zcashd, and Zebra implements all the features required to reach Zcash network consensus. Zebra validates all of the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf">Zcash consensus rules</a>.</p><p>So please spin up some instances and let us know what you think!</p>

<blockquote>TL;DR: Introducing a new framework for Sismo governance: Sismo Contributor ZK badge holders get voting power according to their contribution.

Only the best Badges from the playground environment make it to the main <a href="http://app.sismo.io">Sismo curated environment</a>.</p><p>Today we are opening the curation process to the Sismo community through an open governance system, based on contributions.</p><p>We will of course dog-food our own protocol and ZK Badges to track contributions&nbsp;:)</p> Community-based Badge&nbsp;Curation <p>The Sismo <a href="https://playground.sismo.io/">Playground</a> environment is an open sandbox for anyone to create, test and imagine new ways to benefit from Sismo’s protocol privacy-preserving attestation system. This openness means that a lot of different types of badges are created and that some of the highest quality ones are drowned in a mass of other badges that could be deemed low-quality or less aligned with Sismo’s&nbsp;vision.</p><p>On the other side, the Sismo <a href="https://app.sismo.io/">Curated</a> environment core value is to provide a more curated experience for users and applications looking for carefully selected ZK Badges that they can trust. The objective is for the Sismo community to progressively take charge of vetting which ZK Badge will be able to be migrated to the Curated environment from the Playground environment.</p>ZK Badges in Sismo’s Curated environment<p>To help in this endeavour, a set of <a href="https://www.notion.so/Badge-Curation-Guidelines-a62b5d7205734b44b41c603bf1516f4c">Badge Curation Guidelines</a> have been proposed to the community to support them in their decision process. It has the aim to ensure that the Sismo Curated environment only hosts ZK Badges that have been proven to hold a sufficient level of quality, transparency, fairness, and alignment to Sismo’s manifesto.</p> The need for a new governance model  Straightforward token voting is&nbsp;flawed <p>The issues with solely coin-driven governance are&nbsp;known:</p>  It empowers token holders and their interests more than the other type of stakeholders in a project community.  It is susceptible to governance attacks through vote buying or borrowing.  It gives oversized power to wealthy participants compared to small holders and these “whales” can often have conflicting interests in other&nbsp;projects   Lack of private&nbsp;voting <p>The lack of privacy in the current voting system opens the way to bribing or intimidation attacks against specific actors and can prevent some stakeholders from expressing their honest opinions.</p> Exploring the potential of Proof of Contribution <p>An additional metric that should be taken into account in governance systems is the amount of value each voter brought to the system. It seems natural to give more power in the governance to those who contributed the most to the underlying project.</p> Proof of Contribution  Verifying the fact that an account corresponds to a person that has used a protocol, passed some educational training, funded an initiative, contributed to building a system, or performed some useful work in the project ecosystem. Useful participation rewarded with improved governance power is less dystopian than a social credit system because you have a say in the criteria&nbsp;used. Sismo ZK Badges as membership &amp; weighted voting credentials <p>Sismo ZK Badges provide a valuable set of attributes for contribution-based governance models:</p>  They are tokenized attestations of history/activity/reputation packaged as a standard ERC-1155 NFT a.k.a Soulbound Tokens&nbsp;(SBTs)  They preserve the privacy of their owners. They can be minted on a new address that is not linked to the addresses that fulfilled the requirements to get the badge.&nbsp;(<a href="https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/what-are-zk-badges">more</a>)  (Soon) They will allow users to aggregate their reputation by gathering their badges on a single or several pseudonymized address(es) in the&nbsp;future.  They are non-transferable.  <p>This last property allows ZK badges to be less concentrated (no sale/transfer to the rich) and to remain owned by active participants. The non-transferability of badges also limits trustless vote-buying in the sense that any vote-buying will require the seller to hand over his private&nbsp;keys.</p> A new framework for Sismo Governance <p>Check out the new governance process at <a href="https://governance.sismo.io">https://governance.sismo.io</a></p> “Sismo Contributor” badge as core voting power denominator <p>The core voting power denominator is represented by the <a href="https://app.sismo.io/sismo-contributor">“Sismo Contributor” ZK badge</a> (on Polygon mainnet).</p><p>The “Sismo Contributor” ZK badge can be minted by different types of contributors from the Sismo community (check <a href="https://sismo.notion.site/Governance-Overview-5224949448d64bdb81f3d70b3b4cc5f0">Governance Overview</a> for details) and is comprised of 3 levels assigned according to the significance of the minter contribution:</p><p>Level 1 contributors (Users): 1 voting point per&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Level 2 contributors (Community Members): 50 voting points per the&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Level 3 contributors (Builders): 500 voting points per&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Anyone having minted at least one badge on <a href="https://app.sismo.io/">Sismo Curated App</a> (not the playground) is at least eligible for Level 1. Community member can easily get to Level 2 by attending a Sismo event or minting a “Proof of Humanity” ZK Badge, and to Level 3 by contributing actively to Sismo’s ecosystem initiatives or open source development.</p><p>The voting power assignment to the “Sismo Contributor” ZK badge, the badge group generation rules, and the level allocation are all susceptible to being modified through governance in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>This badge will attest that its minter has already interacted at least once with Sismo protocol, community, or ecosystem and will act as a first basic Sybil resistance lever.</p> Conclusion <p>The early stages of Sismo Governance are a perfect time to experiment with alternative governance models that could prove themselves to be valuable. Because it uses Sismo protocol at its heart, this experiment can be reused as a template and improved on by other communities, incentivizing more usage of Sismo ZK&nbsp;Badges.</p><p>Get involved:</p>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/sismo">Discord</a>  <p>Read about our current governance process:</p>  <a href="http://governance.sismo.io">governance.sismo.io</a>   Reference   Moving beyond coin voting governance -<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html">https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html</a>

 Verida Q3 2022 Quarterly Update Verida Q3 2022&nbsp;Update<p>The past few months have again been busy for the Verida team and our protocol development. Work has continued on the development of the Verida Vault with the Android release now available, NEAR integration complete and Wallet Connect support implemented. The Verida Acacia testnet which will shortly become fully decentralized too. Despite a volatile market environment, our community remains engaged and new partners continue to join the network as we work to provide user owned data identity solutions for&nbsp;all.</p> Engineering  Verida Vault <p>Web3 apps need to offer the standard of UX that people are used to today. Verida has worked with Excited, a product design agency based in the Ukraine since 2019 for the design of the Verida website and Verida Vault mobile application. Last month, we were thrilled to announce that the Verida Vault was awarded the coveted <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-vault-designers-win-prestigious-red-dot-award-48deb4336813">Red Dot Award</a> for its interface design.</p>The Verida&nbsp;Vault<p>The Verida Vault mobile app acts as both a “data wallet” and “crypto wallet” for end users. It provides private key management and a user-friendly interface with the Verida network and supported blockchains.</p><p>We shipped the Android release of the Verida Vault in August and it is now available in<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.verida.vault"> Android Play Store</a>. This broadens Vault availability beyond iOS which can be found in the<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verida-vault/id1546599632"> Apple AppStore</a>. Both are in developer preview. APIs are stable except where noted in our<a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/intro"> documentation</a>.</p><p>We welcome developers to come build user-centric, decentralized apps with the vast capabilities of the Verida Vault, including identity, user data, messaging, profiles, Single-Sign-On (SSO), rewards, tokens, and transactions. Learn more about the Vault in our release article&nbsp;<a href="https://news.verida.io/the-verida-vault-is-now-available-in-developer-preview-on-ios-and-android-70d0acdce3dc">here</a>.</p> Product <p>NEAR is now supported in the Verida Vault (testnet only). This includes the ability to store your NEAR tokens, send and receive and make crypto transactions.</p><p>WalletConnect is now supported on Ethereum (Wallet Connect v1), Algorand (Wallet Connect v1) and NEAR (Wallet Connect v2) via the <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/single-sign-on-sdk">Verida Connect SDK</a>. dApps supporting WalletConnect can pass the connection details while connecting with Verida, providing their users with a unified Connect experience, i.e. a single QR-code to scan to connect both Verida and Wallet&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>The Verida Vault crypto wallet import feature has now been extended to provide more flexibility for users. In addition to importing an existing Verida multichain wallet, users can now import accounts for individual blockchains (e.g. Ethereum).</p> Protocol <p>A key focus for the engineering team has been working towards the Acacia Testnet protocol release that will be rolling out from November 2022&nbsp;onwards.</p><p>Smart contract development:</p>  We have open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts">protocol smart contracts</a> currently under development.  Significant engineering effort has gone towards our <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">Decentralized DID Registry</a> that will be launched shortly on Testnet. This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry">ethr-did-registry</a> with extensions that support “per application” based service endpoints, a built-in “proof” mechanism that unlocks the ability to create a generic “data bridge” to prove verified off-chain data on any Verida supported blockchain.  The <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-Name-Registry">Verida Name Registry</a> has been developed, tested and is ready for deployment. This enables Verida accounts to have human friendly names as aliases for their&nbsp;DID’s.  Work has commenced on development work for our future token reward&nbsp;systems.  <p>Verida SDK development:</p>  A major refactor of the Verida SDK has been completed that integrates with the new, <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">Decentralized DID Registry</a>.  Enhancements to the Verida DbStore provide more access controls, an enhanced authorization token based security model and the ability to enforce remote deletion of databases.  <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/single-sign-on-sdk">Verida Connect</a> upgrades adding support for the new token based authorization model and remote device access revocation.   Marketing &amp; Community  Community Rewards&nbsp;Program <p>In September we launched our first <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-launches-community-rewards-program-with-crew3-8ae84153f160">community rewards program with crew3</a>. Through crew3, we are rewarding and recognizing all the hard work of our community through exclusive Discord roles and future Verida Reward Tokens. We had over 130 members of the community participate in the first sprint, with many more <a href="https://news.verida.io/october-sprint-of-the-verida-rewards-program-is-here-c1c42763cb9c">participating in the October sprint</a>. We are thrilled to welcome so many new members to our community of Veridians.</p>Verida Crew3&nbsp;Rewards Australia (Crypto Convention) <p>Verida had a booth at the inaugural Australian Crypto Convention in the Gold Coast, Australia. It was incredible to see over 3000 people attending over the weekend, demonstrating the strength of the crypto and web3 community in Australia.

<p>We’re excited to announce that we’ve expanded support for Brave Translate—our tool to translate websites privately and securely—and that we’ve added 93 languages, going from 15 supported languages to 108! New languages include Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic—<a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/8963107404813-How-do-I-use-Brave-Translate-">check out the full list</a>. Brave Translate is currently available for desktop and Android (v1.45), with iOS support coming in a future update.</p>
<p>Chromium’s native translation service caches user translation requests, passing that data along to Google’s API. Brave Translate, however, is privacy-preserving and enables users to privately translate websites in over 100 languages, without exposing browsing activity. Brave uses a self-hosted server and the <a href="https://lingvanex.com/">Lingvanex</a> translation engine to power translations, which means no caching, and no feeding your translation requests to privacy-threatening models.</p>

<p>As we mentioned in our blog posts regarding releases <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a>, the Zcash network is processing a significantly increased number of shielded transactions. The network remains stable and secure, transactions are being processed normally, and we are making additional performance improvements in 5.3.0 to reduce concurrent memory utilization during scanning among other memory and performance related optimisations in the <code>zcashd</code> node.</p>



<p>ECC’s No. 1 priority at the moment is updating the Zcash protocol and our wallet SDKs to help third-party providers fix wallet syncing issues. An increased on-chain transaction load has resulted in unacceptable sync times for many everyday users, and ecosystem partners are also affected. We are focused — across teams — on alleviating these issues as soon as possible, so Zcash users have an experience they expect and deserve. Our immediate objectives are centered on working with third-party wallets that are built on the ECC SDKs (Edge, Nighthawk and Unstoppable) as well as continuing to make improvements to node performance and memory usage.</p>



 Wallet Performance Improvements 



<p><code>zcashd 5.2.0</code> improved the performance of wallet scanning with multithreaded batched trial decryption of Sapling outputs. However, for some nodes this resulted in growing memory usage that would eventually cause an OOM abort. We have identified the cause of the growth, and made significant improvements to reduce the memory usage of the batch scanner. In addition, the batch scanner now has a memory limit of 100 MiB.</p>



<p><code>zcashd</code> now reports the following new metrics when <code>-prometheusport</code> is set:</p>



  (counter) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.outputs.scanned</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.size.transactions</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.usage.bytes</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.synced.block.height</code>  



 RPC Interface 



  The <code>finalorchardroot</code> field in the <code>getblock</code> result and the <code>orchard.commitments.finalRoot</code> field in the <code>z_gettreestate</code> result have been changed to match the byte ordering used for the <code>orchard.anchor</code> field in the <code>getrawtransaction</code> result. These previously produced different hash values from the orchard.anchor field due to having been byte-flipped in their internal representation in <code>zcashd</code>.  



<p>The binaries for the 5.3.0 release will be available on our download site shortly and the <a href="https://z.cash/support/schedule/">Zcash Schedule page</a> has been updated to reflect this release.</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the latest round of partners that joined Brave’s Wallet Partner program this month. Since its June debut, the Wallet Partner program has onboarded 62 DApps, and promoted their use among Brave Wallet users through Brave Ads and other Brave-owned properties. In addition to our program partners, dozens more DApps are following suit by integrating Brave Wallet outside the program, helping to organically spread the word about Brave’s built-in secure multi-chain wallet.</p>
<p>To learn more about our previous Wallet Partners, check out past announcements:</p>
 
 <a>June</a> 
 <a>July</a> 
 <a>August</a> 
 <a>September</a> 
 
<p>This month’s newest additions feature:</p>

 ACryptoS 
<p><a href="https://medium.com/acryptos">ACryptoS</a> is a multi-chain yield optimizer whose core offering is auto-compounding Single-Token Vaults, which use unique strategies to increase DeFi yield without the risk of impermanent loss. The vaults first launched on BNB Chain, but are now deployed across Avalanche, Fantom, Gnosis, Cronos, and more. Their mission is to build a better, safer DeFi world where their users can sleep soundly while their deposits earn yield.</p>

 BadgerDAO 
<p><a href="https://badger.com/">Badger</a> is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate the growth of Bitcoin in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) across multiple blockchains. It is an ecosystem where projects and people from all across DeFi can collaborate and build together. Shared ownership in the DAO incentivizes builders to have aligned objectives, while decentralized governance ensures that those incentives remain fair to all parties.</p>

 Compound 
<p>The <a href="https://compound.finance/">Compound</a> protocol is a decentralized and autonomous interest rate protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. The core use cases are borrowing assets and earning interest. Compound is one of the first DeFi protocols on Ethereum and currently holds ~$2.3 billion worth of liquidity in smart contracts. Compound III, its newest deployment, enables users to supply a supported collateral asset like WBTC and borrow USDC against it, in addition to earning interest if they supply USDC. Governance of the protocol is decentralized such that COMP token holders can propose or vote on code upgrades. Discord, Twitter, and the comp.xyz forums are where the community publicly discusses protocol development.</p>

 Cronos ID 
<p><a href="https://cronosid.xyz/">Cronos ID</a> is the identity and communication layer on top of  <a href="https://cronos.org/">Cronos</a>, the first EVM-compatible chain built on Cosmos. The Cronos ID Domain Service enables users to associate a unique human-readable “.cro” domain with their crypto wallet address. In the coming weeks, the Cronos ID Notification Service and the Cronos ID Messaging Service will enable peer-to-peer and DApp-to-consumer communication using only wallet addresses. Cronos ID is incubated by  <a href="https://cronoslabs.org/">Cronos Labs</a>, the ecosystem accelerator of Cronos Chain.</p>

 DappRadar 
<p><a href="https://dappradar.com/">DappRadar</a> positions itself as the world’s DApp store at the heart of Web3. It tracks more than 12,000 DApps over 50 blockchains, providing reliable and accurate data for the users who want to discover and explore the world of NFTs, blockchain games, metaverse, and more.</p>
<p>“Brave Wallet’s integration to DappRadar is a powerful partnership of two pioneering companies in Web3. Users will be able to track digital assets in Brave Wallet while exploring the world of DApps on DappRadar. Privacy at its best, while discovering blockchain games, NFTs, DeFi, metaverses, and more,” said Patrick Barile, COO of DappRadar.</p>

 Ferro 
<p><a href="https://ferroprotocol.com/">Ferro</a> is the leading stable coin swapping venue on  <a href="https://cronos.org/">Cronos</a>, the first EVM-compatible chain built on Cosmos in partnership with Crypto.com. Ferro has gained even more relevance during the recent bear market months as it works hard every day to optimize the returns that liquidity providers generate from more than $100 million in deposited DAI, USDC and USDT. Ferro differentiates with its clean, modern look and feel and its best-in-class yields.</p>

 Jungle Cats 
<p><a href="https://junglecats.io/">Jungle Cats</a> is an NFT project based on the Solana blockchain—a collection of Lions and Lionesses taking a journey through gamified rewards and on-chain breeding to mirror the life cycle of what they consider a real-life feline family. The Jungle Cats use their voice—$GROAR (SPL utility token)—to venture deep into the Jungle Safari and participate in the ecosystem.</p>

 Matcha 
<p><a href="https://matcha.xyz/">Matcha</a> is a decentralized exchange from 0x Labs, the team behind the 0x protocol. The DApp is designed to aggregate on-chain liquidity across the Ethereum and EVM ecosystem in order to offer its users maximal value on their trades. Max value means low fees, deep liquidity, and low slippage. Matcha transparently displays all costs and fees associated with trades, and doesn’t take any profits from quoted and final prices, should there be any savings when the trade settles.</p>

 Mean Protocol 
<p><a href="https://meanfi.com/">Mean Protocol</a> is a set of rules and interoperable smart contracts that help DApp developers facilitate everyday banking workflows and investment banking operations. One of the key components of Mean Protocol is Payment Streams, which provide the payment rails for developers to build real-time finance applications.</p>
<p>“Brave’s wallet integration is a pivotal stepping stone in making crypto assets mainstream. MeanFi’s integration with Brave brings our mission to onboard the next billion users to crypto a step closer to reality,” said Michel Triana, CEO and Co-founder of Mean Protocol.</p>

 Minted 
<p><a href="https://minted.network/">Minted.network</a> is a decentralized NFT platform native to Ethereum and Cronos. It aims to bring more tools for collection owners to design, curate, and offer utility to their communities with an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Minted’s key functions are its self-custodial trading platform, native NFT launchpad, multi-chain support, and its security-first infrastructure. The $MTD token on Cronos is used to reward users by sharing the revenue from platform fees and other utilities.</p>
<p>“Our vision for Minted is to become a ‘Digital Bazaar of Wonders’ for creators and new and experienced collectors alike,” said Matt Wan, Director of Brand &amp; Business Partnerships at Minted.</p>

 Moonshine 
<p><a href="https://moonshinelabs.io/">Moonshine Labs</a> is innovating the framework for the next tech revolution by offering a customizable Metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform. Directly connect to every partner and user across our platform, The Verse. Create your project’s paradise. Build your business. Escape the mundane. The Verse is a passion project for the entire team: from the Founder, Charles, dreaming of this world for the last 20 years, Co-founder Will innovating on emerging tech, and lead designer Chris, placing each item with love and care.</p>
<p>“The multi-chain Brave Wallet brings unparalleled security and browser-native support to over 200 crypto assets for our users and partners,” said Will Stone, Co-founder of Moonshine Labs.</p>

 Odos 
<p><a href="https://odos.xyz/">Odos</a> is a decentralized exchange aggregator on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon that allows users to swap between a variety of crypto assets via their unique order route planning. Their patented algorithm traverses a large universe of possible token swap combinations and non-linear paths, delivering greater savings to users. Odos offers the ability to swap between up to six assets in a single transaction and provides institutional APIs to partners who are interested in leveraging Odos’ Smart Order Routing in their applications.</p>
<p>“Supporting Brave Wallet greatly enhances the seamlessness of user interaction with Odos by providing a no-hassle pathway to getting started through the Brave browser,” said Matt Deible, Research &amp; Product Lead at Odos.</p>

 Overtime 
<p><a href="https://overtimemarkets.xyz/#/markets">Overtime</a> is a fully decentralized sports positioning platform that allows users to trade seamlessly through an automated market for sports, which means there’s always a position to be taken on a fan’s favorite games. Born out of the Thales protocol, their mission is to gamify DeFi one step at a time and ultimately close the gap between traditional markets and new, decentralized, and autonomous sports markets.</p>
<p>“Supporting Brave Wallet on OVERTIME was an easy decision. As pioneers in Web3 sports markets we are happy to integrate with Brave and offer our product to its 55+ million users access to markets of the most popular leagues such as the English Premier League, National Football League, Bundesligua, Formula 1, and many more” said Red, Growth Lead at Overtime.</p>

 Rarible 
<p><a href="https://rarible.com/">Rarible</a> is a leading community-centric, aggregated marketplace for NFTs that also offers multi-chain trading for NFTs listed directly on the site. Launched in 2019 by  <a href="https://twitter.com/alxfal"></a>  Alexei Falin and  <a href="https://twitter.com/insider0x"></a>  Alex Salniko<a href="https://twitter.com/insider0x">v</a>, Rarible offers a platform to artists and collectors looking to create, collect, and trade digital collectibles from multiple chains. Since its inception, Rarible has grown rapidly and become one of the most well-known and highly ranked NFT projects in the market, backed by Venrock and CoinFund.</p>
<p>“Rarible is proud to be partnering with Brave to provide the best and safest user experience for our community. With this partnership, we will create a seamless and secure environment for users to explore the world of NFTs on the Rarible aggregated marketplace” said Deborah Won, Partner Marketing Manager.</p>

 SPACE ID 
<p><a href="https://space.id/">SPACE ID</a> (SID) is building a universal name service network to seamlessly connect people, information, assets, and applications across blockchains. It’s chain-agnostic, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and open-source. Incubated by Binance Labs, SPACE ID launched the first version of SID with .bnb Domain Name Service Public Registration in mid-September as the first Top Level Domain (TLD). In other words, SPACE ID is providing the integral identity infrastructure in the BNB Chain ecosystem.</p>
<p>“Supporting Brave Wallet on SPACE ID was a no-brainer. We value the privacy and security the browser brings to our community members, so letting their integrated wallet that requires no additional extension be used to register and manage .bnb domains simply made sense,” said Solo, Head of Growth at SPACE ID.</p>

 Synthetix 
<p><a href="https://synthetix.io/">Synthetix</a> is building a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol for use by any other protocol. Its deep liquidity and low fees serve as a backend for many exciting protocols on both Optimism and Ethereum.

<p>We’re proud to announce that Panther has joined the <a href="https://www.leadingprivacy.com/">Leading Privacy Alliance</a>, an initiative aspiring to be a DAO unifying leading Web3 companies around the shared goal of improving privacy in crypto and beyond. The Leading Privacy Alliance was launched on October 9th, leading to Devcon Bogota, and Panther is among the first companies to join this initiative.<br></p><p>The LPA has been established to address the issue currently facing everyone involved in the Web3 space –how to make working privacy-first an industry standard. The alliance seeks to educate end-users and clients on the importance of the right to privacy, not because there might be something to hide, but for privacy is essential to freedom.<br></p><p>The alliance was founded by <a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Blockwallet</a>, <a href="https://dusk.network/">Dusk Network</a>, and <a href="https://hoprnet.org/">HOPR</a>. Panther is, alongside Omnia, the first company to join. Panther’s Senior Architect Adam Spiers gave a talk during the launch event, explaining the reasons for Panther to join this movement.</p><blockquote><p>Making <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/private?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#private</a> scalable blockchain protocol for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Web3</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DeFi</a> applications is how <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ZKPanther</a> contributes to an holistic and interoperable approach of privacy, shares <a href="https://twitter.com/adamspiers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@adamspiers</a>. <a href="https://t.co/oarcKILrWJ">pic.twitter.com/oarcKILrWJ</a></p>— Leading Privacy (@LeadingPrivacy) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeadingPrivacy/status/1579246326625488896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>As a project that aims to enable trust and privacy in the DeFi space, it is a natural fit for Panther to join the Leading Privacy Alliance. We strongly believe that the sector's stakeholders need to form a coalition to defend the right to privacy.<br></p><p>Web3 deeply needs to be a borderless platform where members can unite, create a shared voice representing the entire industry, and exchange experiences and ideas.<br></p><p>We’re looking forward to playing our part in advocating for privacy and seeking clarity on privacy regulations.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 How Online Privacy Concerns Today is Rooted in the Internet’s Early Days<br> <p>Bitcoin is at the forefront of future-thinking approaches to payments, investing and a range of other applications that extend far beyond its role as a digital currency. While Bitcoin represents the future of digital currency, its prioritization of censorship resistance has links back to the cypherpunk movement, which first emerged in the 1980s and became prevalent in the 1990s as internet adoption began to pick up steam. <br></p><p>Tracing contemporary privacy concerns back to early online privacy activists can be an enlightening way to develop a sense of where Bitcoin may be headed in the future. Some of the top figures who advocate for online privacy, including Timothy May, have links to the original cypherpunk movement. Assange penned the 2012 book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cypherpunks-Freedom-Internet-Julian-Assange/dp/1944869085">Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet</a>, which bolstered mainstream awareness of the cypherpunk movement. <br></p><p>Cypherpunks tend to believe in the power of cryptography and other online privacy strategies centered around combating widespread digital surveillance. For decades, cypherpunks have been designing strategies and platforms to preserve online privacy for those who recognize its importance. Let’s dive into the history of the cypherpunk movement and how its adherents and principles are having a continued impact on the Bitcoin landscape.</p> Who Were the Original Cypherpunks? <p>In the early nineties, a group of computer scientists, programmers, and cryptographers assembled with mathematician Eric Hughes in order to discuss what they saw as the looming threat of increased surveillance facilitated by the burgeoning internet infrastructure. These early internet activists shared a libertarian sensibility—believing that the state should hold only minimal involvement in citizens’ private lives. The cypherpunk movement grew out of monthly meetings between this group and its name was a play on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> genre of science fiction coined by Jude Milhon, which itself drew influence from early hacker culture. <br></p><p>The group created the first anonymous remailer, &nbsp;the cypherpunk mailing list, in which they developed visionary ideas about online privacy. Tim May—who previously worked at Intel—was a founding member and prolific contributor to the cypherpunks electronic mailing list. He also put forth the idea of tools enabling anonymous browsing of the web as well as the idea of anonymous online marketplaces and anonymous whistleblowing systems—all of which are ideas that have seen a number of applications in the years since. The cypherpunks communicated in a brash, jargon-laden style, and their mailing list grew into a core hub of the discussion and development of online privacy strategies. The mailing list became defunct in the early 2000s, but by then the movement was fully up and running and had developed anonymous ways of communicating and sharing resources online.</p> Is the Cypherpunk Movement Active Today? <p>In his work “<a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html">A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto</a>” Eric Hughes wrote “Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.” Frequently, politicians and those who run large social media companies assert that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy">privacy can no longer be expected online</a>, and that only those who have something to hide should be worried about being watched. As Glenn Greenwald pointed out in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters?language=en">an influential TedTalk about online privacy in 2014</a>, we make countless choices every day about what we choose to reveal and obscure from others in our lives and we should protect our right to be able to do so online.<br></p><p>Many online privacy-minded applications and initiatives were either created by people with links to the original cypherpunk movement, or were directly inspired by its philosophies. As mentioned, Julian Assange was an active member of the cypherpunk mailing list and his WikiLeaks organization was directly inspired by the cypherpunk focus on the need for anonymous whistleblowing resources. Other influential people associated with the cypherpunk ideologies include Jacob Appelbaum, who was not involved with creating the cypherpunk mailing list but was later a core member of the team that developed the open-source anonymous communication platform, Tor; Adam Back, who created Hashcash (a proof-of-work algorithm) and Blockstream (a company providing products and services built around Bitcoin), and Bram Cohen, who created BitTorrent. <br></p><p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper using concepts that drew directly from the work of Adam Back, with whom Nakamoto had been in contact. In Bitcoin’s whitepaper, Nakamoto referenced the revolutionary concept of a currency in which transactions are publicly viewable while utilizing private keys to sign unique transactions. Bitcoin was a leap forward in the development of the kind of cryptocurrency first posited by the cypherpunk movement.</p> Recent Cypherpunk Developments <p>Much of the appeal of Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies is centered around the values championed by the cypherpunk movement. Decentralized, anonymous currency rooted in cryptography offers resistance to unnecessary (and ultimately corrupt) government interference. Ideally, cryptocurrencies place privacy and transacting power back into the hands of individuals who are able to control what information they share. <br></p><p>Alongside the continued growth and development of Bitcoin—which maintains its cypherpunk-influenced integrity—there has also been a movement towards cryptocurrencies that have moved away from decentralized models. In the interest of mainstream growth and adoption, they stray from the individual privacy efforts that are central to the cypherpunk vision. Converting centralized (fiat) currency into Bitcoin often requires the use of centralized exchanges and the regulations these entail, which typically degrade users’ privacy. Many new Bitcoin users utilize centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, which collect extensive personal information and have policies that threaten transaction privacy. <br><br>Bitcoin is central to the development of a forward-thinking movement towards individuals holding the keys to their own Bitcoin. However, there are aspects inherent to Bitcoin that have <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/why-we-work-on-bitcoin-privacy/">privacy concerns that innovators are taking steps to combat</a>. The fact that every Bitcoin transaction and address balance is viewable to anyone on the blockchain is key to the decentralized authentication of Bitcoin transactions, as it avoids the need for middlemen. When each transaction’s details can be viewed, it ensures nobody breaks the rules.<br><br>While Bitcoin addresses are not directly linked to users’ identities, they certainly can be. Once one active address’ identity is revealed, the privacy of each party that has engaged in transactions with the compromised address can be threatened. Additionally, “know your customer” requirements from online merchants, which verify users’ identities over time as a security function, can disturb users’ privacy when ostensibly anonymous transactions are connected to these transactions.</p> Coinjoin as a Contemporary Cypherpunk Innovation <p>An important concept when it comes to Bitcoin’s ability to provide an anonymous and private payment method is <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-is-the-bridge-to-bitcoin-fungibility/">fungibility</a>. Fungibility refers to the ability of an asset to be exchanged freely for the same denomination of the same asset. For instance, an unmarked $20 bill’s value does not depend on the bill’s provenance. On the other hand, non-fungible stores of value include artworks, which are unique and where previous ownership is factored into an item’s worth. <br><br>Bitcoin is designed to be a fully fungible currency, but this can be threatened when certain coins can be linked through their transaction history to an unscrupulous user or exchange. One technique associated with restoring fungibility for Bitcoin users is <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/how-coinjoins-fix-bitcoin-privacy/">Coinjoin</a>. Coinjoin is an obfuscation strategy that severs the tie between previous transactions by joining coins together, which effectively anonymizes them. <br><br>CoinJoin activity itself can be viewed on the blockchain and there is still a limit to the success of this obfuscation strategy. Some users may feel that coins that have undergone this process are undesirable. For this reason, the widespread adoption of Coinjoin may be necessary in order to create a situation <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/methods-for-the-destigmatization-of-coinjoin/">where obfuscation is destigmatized</a> and seen as a privacy-retaining tool, rather than as a sign of suspicious activity.<br><br>The growing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin is an example of destigmatization of this nature, as the link between Bitcoin and anonymous online marketplaces like Silk Road (wherein users paid in bitcoin for goods and services that were illegal in certain jurisdictions) became less of a focus.</p> Wasabi Wallet as a Tool for Cypherpunks <p>One groundbreaking tool that goes a long way towards making Bitcoin adhere to the privacy standards that the original cypherpunks strove for is <a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/">Wasabi Wallet</a>—a privacy-focused, non-custodial Bitcoin wallet. Wasabi Wallet uses Coinjoin obfuscation and integrates <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> as a strategy to prevent network deanonymization attacks. <br><br>One challenge faced by Bitcoin wallet developers is how to ensure the privacy of users while also making wallets user-friendly and accessible to those without extensive technical knowledge. The original cypherpunk movement was composed of developers, programmers, mathematicians, and cryptographers. The movement’s motto — “cypherpunks write code” — refers both to the programming skills of the community and the focus on encryption. These days, widespread adoption among those without specialized knowledge is the goal of many developers of Bitcoin-related tools. <br><br>Wasabi Wallet is a desktop wallet, which tends to allow for more robust software than mobile offerings. It prevents third party access to users’ wallet information, increased fungibility provided by Coinjoin technology, and offers the privacy benefits of the Tor onion network.<br><br>The recently-launched <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi2-0-released/">Wasabi Wallet 2.0</a> provides a revamped interface. Wasabi Wallet lets users choose between three coinjoin strategies, depending on whether their main priority is maximizing privacy, maximizing speed or minimizing costs. Users can easily view their wallet’s privatization progress and can also implement Discreet Mode, which further hides sensitive information. <br><br>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tend to naturally attract those who value online privacy and who see the benefits of being in control of how information is collected and distributed. Wasabi makes it easy to send and receive Bitcoin with more privacy than other services suited to average bitcoin users. Coinjoin and other anonymization strategies implemented by Wasabi are paving the way towards a landscape in which it’s possible for all Bitcoin users to be cypherpunks, even without specialized knowledge. <br><br><br></p>

<p>Regardless of the industry or vertical, organisations have a huge amount of compliance obligations that must be followed to avoid penalties or closures and ensure continuity of service. How are these compliance obligations managed, and is there any room for improvement?</p>



 Traditional compliance management 



<p>Traditionally, observations and measurements have been captured using manual, paper-based forms. These forms have proven to be difficult and complex to use, and often suffer from inaccuracies as a result of these inherent problems.</p>



<p>Data collection and management with paper forms can be an inaccurate and labour-intensive process. Data is often key punched twice and then reviewed for missed, out-of-range, or erroneous responses — an inefficient validation process that can be time-consuming and inaccurate.</p>



<p>Handheld Computers, A Feasible Alternative to Paper Forms for Field Data Collection, University of Minnesota</p>



<p>Luckily, these paper-based forms quickly got replaced by their digital counterparts as soon as these alternatives became available. This move to digital forms solved many of the problems paper-based forms suffered from and proved to be much easier to use. Better data entry, less use of paper, and a reduced cost are only some of their features.</p>



<p>While digital forms revolutionised the process of being compliant, they did not come without a cost. The recorded data has to be stored and shared with the relevant regulatory bodies for review and sign-off, which sounds simple in theory but has shown to be rather difficult in practice. Records can be erased, servers can become corrupted, data formats change and data loss can become a huge issue for businesses. Organisations are now beginning to harness new and emerging technologies to solve these issues and ensure transparency and compliance.</p>



 Enabling compliance using blockchain technology 



<p>Blockchain technology has been deemed to be critical for the future of data storage by some, and for good reason. It introduces features like immutability, security, and decentralisation, allowing organisations to verify events, timestamp actions, and ensure real-time compliance.</p>



<p>Blockchain is starting to gain adoption and momentum, as new high-powered protocols have emerged. Some of these protocols no longer have transaction fees and are capable of handling much more transactions per second than previous protocols, to support enterprise-grade applications. The potential of blockchain technology seems boundless, but organisations need to be practical in selecting a chain that meets both their compliance and regulatory obligations.</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Europechain by Zaisan</a> is a perfect fit for businesses that have security, compliance, and performance on their requirements list. Europechain delivers trust by allowing organisations to harness the power and scalability of robust blockchain technology while complying with EU legislation &amp; regulation.</p>



 Process Timestamping 



<p>A process timestamping tool like <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">FACT by Zaisan</a> manages business processes, captures proof of compliance, and tracks procedures. FACT delivers a versatile toolbox for the recording of events from a wide range of predefined smart form templates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flexible template builder enables the configuration of all types of checklists, including compliance checklists. These checklists are cryptographically hashed and time stamped on Europechain to increase security, visibility, and transparency. In addition, roles and activities can be assigned to enable task distribution and increase management awareness of task completion.</p>



<p>FACT is a multi-industry application with an intuitive user interface, allowing for fast and efficient onboarding. Furthermore, FACT has flexible team settings to facilitate the segregation of tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below are just some of the use cases for FACT.</p>



  Real-estate technical inspections  Food safety and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) compliance  Equipment maintenance-checks  Asset tracking  Road-safety management programs  Lean-six-sigma routines  Supplier/contractor-performance management  Safety management  



<p>FACT provides businesses with the opportunity to minimise repetitive, paper-based tasks and maximise the efficiency of employees, with the added benefit of having all events timestamped and added to Zaisan to ensure transparency and completion of time-sensitive tasks. The feature-rich system also allows for visibility through notifications and the reporting dashboard, which can aid in providing insight into team performance and task delivery.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



  FACT is a highly flexible, blockchain-based, mobile tool to manage business processes, capture proof of compliance, and track procedures  FACT provides businesses with the opportunity to minimise repetitive, paper-based tasks and maximise the efficiency of employees  FACT offers multiple uses cases, including -but not limited to- HACCP compliance, <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">compliance management</a>, asset tracking, safety management, and many others  Europechain is a perfect fit for businesses whose priorities are security, compliance, and performance

 Diardi Election — Presentation <p>We know that you’ve all been patiently waiting for news from us regarding Diardi V8 (the next iteration of our network implementation) and the future of our project, and we’ve got something exciting for&nbsp;you!</p><p>As most of you know, we have planned to implement a staked election system for the Diardi Operators since its inception.</p><p>Now, after months of development effort, we present to you the Diardi Election Application as well as the process of how we will let everyone stake their XLA to try and get a spot on the Diardi operators list.</p> What are the Diardi Operators? <p>So if you’ve been out of the loop for some time, the Diardi operators are the ones who will produce blocks on the same chain (every 4th block) using a known address. Contrary to the pure Nakamoto consensus, this brings up the issue of decentralization. That’s where the catch lies: at the moment, if you look at the network, it’s being dominated by 2 or sometimes even just one&nbsp;pool.</p><p>This in itself is not that bad, as all (most) pool operators have been very open and cooperative with us. But the problem doesn’t end there. What if, by sheer chance, this one very large pool were to be attacked? Doesn’t that mean our entire network is now at the mercy of this one lonely server? To combat this, we thought to decentralize this issue by letting a group of members outside of the mining community publish blocks as checkpoint blocks.</p><p>A lot of 51%-attacks revolve around a pool mining a large number of blocks in private and releasing their largest chain to the public network, thereby rendering an entire set of blocks useless. This is very hard to do with Diardi in place, as the malicious pool operator (or the hacker of this malicious pool) must not only have a massive amount of compute power but also have colluded with many Diardi operators as well to conduct an&nbsp;attack.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>It’s pretty simple, actually. To ensure that the Diardi operators applicants are also worthy Diardi operators, we will have staked elections.</p><blockquote>Staked elections involve a user putting up a certain amount of XLA that he holds to showcase that he has the most monetary stake in the chain and thus more than anyone else to lose if the chain may be attacked.</blockquote>A screenshot showcasing the election application<p>We will take a snapshot of the Scala chain with all the user balances on October 31st, 2022. Users will get access to a special remote node that they can connect to with their seeds to send their vXLA (since this is now a forked chain) to our voting application; once the election period of 2 weeks is over, we will select the first Diardi operators (32 or 64) depending on the number of candidates.</p><p>⚠️ IMPORTANT: Please remember that balances sitting on exchanges will NOT be counted as your coins, and you will not be able to send that to the election application. So please move your coins to your own wallet before the snapshot date and move them back to the exchange after, if you’d like to, once the snapshot has concluded.</p> Compensation <p>The Diardi operators who get elected will be allowed to run Diardi nodes, providing them with 25% of all produced&nbsp;blocks.</p> Conclusion <p>If you are curious to know more about how Diardi works, check our Wiki: <a href="https://wiki.scalaproject.io/specifications/feature-desc/diardi">https://wiki.scalaproject.io/specifications/feature-desc/diardi</a></p><p>As usual, let us know on <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">Discord</a> or <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">Telegram</a> if you have any questions or comments.</p> Community 👋 <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact&nbsp;us:</p>  Website: <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">https://scalaproject.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">https://t.me/scalaofficial</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scalahq">https://twitter.com/scalahq</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/</a>  Scala Mining Stats: <a href="https://scalastats.com/">https://scalastats.com/</a>  Email: hello@scalaproject.io   <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/scala-project-diardi-elections-c5467832c4df">Scala Project — Diardi Elections</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
