<p>“I have never been congratulated so much for winning one game,” said a smiling Lee Sedol, at the packed press conference amid enthusiastic applause and camera flashes. The great 9-dan Go player had just defeated DeepMind’s AlphaGo in game four with an unexpected wedge move that his adversary critically underestimated. Two days later, AlphaGo would prevail, winning four of the tournament’s five games. It wasn’t Lee’s move 78 that captured the world’s imagination, but AlphaGo’s move 37 two games earlier. Move 37 was so unconventional that Lee and much of the audience thought it was a mistake before realizing how “beautiful” it was. It had a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/two-moves-alphago-lee-sedol-redefined-future/">1-in-10,000</a> likelihood of being played by a human and was a landmark demonstration of AI’s ability to be superhumanly creative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the tense final minutes of game five, the AlphaGo team crammed into the VIP suite at the Seoul Four Seasons Hotel that had become its command center. The team lead, David Silver, was flanked on one side by DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis and on the other by Ioannis Antonoglou, the research engineer who accelerated the neural networks that made AlphaGo tick. The moment when Lee finally resigned marked the end of a two year journey that pushed the science of reinforcement learning (RL) to new heights, and the team reveled in the accomplishment.</p>



<p>For Ioannis, it was a vindication of what had seemed a risky career move, joining the AI startup in London in 2012 as employee #25 and researcher #6. “It was the only place in the world where people were seriously considering building AGI,” he recalls now, and he was amazed at what RL had achieved in such a short time. He wasn’t the only one who was amazed. In Chicago, a freshly minted PhD in quantum physics named Misha Laskin read the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961">AlphaGo paper</a> and abruptly changed the course of his life. Here was something as beautiful as theoretical physics but with real world impact. Misha realized, “this was a real glimpse into what it will be like to live among superintelligence.”</p>



 AlphaGo and beyond 



<p>Ioannis’s first collaborator at DeepMind was Vlad Mnih, the researcher credited with building the first deep reinforcement learning agent, DQN (Deep Q Network). He asked Ioannis to write a clean implementation of DQN as a library that DeepMind could use to advance deep reinforcement learning research. “Ioannis’s attention to detail and intellectual rigour stood out right away,” says Vlad, “he would always ask why we were going with particular design choices, why we weren’t incorporating things like LSTMs sooner, etc.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year later, when David Silver started working on AlphaGo, DQN had demonstrated how to use deep reinforcement learning in game playing. AlphaGo built on this foundation with many sophisticated innovations including using Monte Carlo Tree Search, a powerful search algorithm that allowed it to explore possible future moves by simulating game outcomes. AlphaGo also featured a dual network architecture with a policy network to predict the next move and a value network to evaluate board positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a monster of a system by contemporary standards and Silver knew that maximizing throughput and minimizing latency was mission critical to train the system and then deploy it for realtime game play. He tapped Ioannis to write kernels on GPUs that could speed up the neural networks they were training. DeepMind was acquired by Google in 2014 and Ioannis quickly moved on to implementing the system on Google’s first TPUs (tensor processing units). These first chips were extremely temperamental and hard to work with but Ioannis figured out how to tame them. “If I couldn’t get it to work,” Ioannis says now, “then we wouldn’t be able to achieve the things that we achieved with AlphaGo.”</p>



<p>After the triumphant victory in Seoul, Ioannis continued to work on expanding the capabilities of these game-playing agents with a small core team. “One of the first papers that we wrote was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270">AlphaGo Zero</a>,” he remembers. “We showed that you can actually get the same performance—actually much better performance than AlphaGo—starting from completely random behavior all the way to superintelligent behavior.” This tabla rasa approach combined with self-play was important to demonstrate that RL can scale to solve new problems.</p>



<p>Then the team built <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815">AlphaZero</a>, which added superhuman-level play of chess and shoji starting from random play, with no domain knowledge except the game rules. The zero in this case also meant that the algorithm can learn to play any zero sum board game. Three years later they introduced <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08265">MuZero</a>, which added Atari games to its arsenal while no longer supplying game rules—just raw pixels. Using reinforcement learning on problems without access to a perfect simulator of the world, as you have in Go or chess, was a longstanding challenge that MuZero solved. “You can actually have a system that both learns the world dynamics,” says Ioannis, “and uses this learned model of the world to actually plan into the future.”</p>



 Transformers in Toronto 



<p>Although Misha was captivated by DeepMind’s research, it took him a while to find his way there. He caught the entrepreneurial bug and went through Y Combinator with an AI startup, but the frontier of AI research kept calling—he dove into a postdoc in Pieter Abbeel’s lab at Berkeley to hone his AI research chops. Like a good reinforcement learning agent, he maximized learning from this environment of other brilliant researchers. Entering as a former physicist had a side benefit: “Because I didn’t know anything, I had this kind of clean slate. And I think that enabled me to try some pretty simple things that other people thought were too obvious to try.” He adds that, “It was surprising to me how doing the simple thing correctly was hard. And oftentimes when people try something simple and it didn’t work, it’s because they didn’t try it hard enough.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of the next two-and-a-half years, Misha followed the interests he developed through self study, improving RL methods in the DeepMind Control Suite and Atari Games environments along with the OpenAI Gym. Specifically, he worked on <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/file/e615c82aba461681ade82da2da38004a-Paper.pdf">data augmentation</a> strategies and extracting high-level features from raw pixels (<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/laskin20a/laskin20a.pdf">CURL</a>). The most cited paper he co-authored at Berkeley was <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/7f489f642a0ddb10272b5c31057f0663-Paper.pdf">Decision Transformer</a>, which reframed RL as a sequence modeling problem, leveraging the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture.</p>



<p>In 2021, Misha interviewed with Vlad, who was starting a new general agents team for DeepMind in Toronto. “I was immediately struck by Misha’s enthusiasm and belief in the power of reinforcement learning and unsupervised approaches, so it was really exciting when he decided to join the team,” recalls Vlad. “Misha was very productive from the start. He got up to speed with Google infrastructure and started producing research results in a matter of weeks, the same amount of time it took him to find all the good coffee shops in Toronto.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vlad also appreciated the clean slate Misha brought with him from his academic research, “he liked to start on new problems with very simple approaches. It’s easy to overcomplicate things in research, but Misha seemed to have a knack for finding the simplest approach that will work on a problem.”</p>



<p>Vlad and Misha would go on to collaborate on a paper titled, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14215">In-context reinforcement learning with algorithm distillation</a> after working together on a DeepMind hackathon project. “Misha and I decided to train a Transformer to mimic a reinforcement learning algorithm to see if it would exhibit self-improvement on tasks it wasn’t trained on,” says Vlad. “We had a lot of fun pair programming and getting the first prototype to work. This was an early example of in-context self-improvement, which has become a very active area of research in the LLM literature. We got really excited when we discovered that the Transformer learned a much more efficient RL algorithm than the one it was trained to mimic.”</p>



<p>Both Ioannis and Misha were pushing hard on how to make deep RL agents more capable and general through increased scale and algorithmic improvements. But on November 30, 2022, AI history took an abrupt turn. “Everything changed when ChatGPT came out,” Ioannis remembers. “I think that was a big moment for everyone in the industry to see that these systems are so powerful and they can be a starting point for something that’s even more intelligent.”</p>



 The Race to Gemini 



<p>ChatGPT’s success exposed that the value of deep reinforcement learning had been hiding in plain sight: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) was a crucial part of its training, aligning the model’s outputs with human preferences and values. Like the Transformer itself, OpenAI didn’t invent deep RL, but was the first to deploy it at this scale.</p>



<p>ChatGPT’s ramp to 100 million users in two months sent shockwaves through the tech industry—but particularly at Google. Not only had OpenAI capitalized on the Transformer architecture, they had added an RL step in post-training to make a runaway consumer product. At the beginning of 2023, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai called a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/technology/google-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html">code red</a>,” and enlisted the help of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to help the company catch up to OpenAI. A few months later, the Google Brain team was merged with DeepMind to become Google DeepMind under the leadership of Demis Hassabis.</p>



<p>The code red brought the AlphaGo lineage of research to an end for Ioannis, who was tapped to lead the RLHF effort for Google’s new large language model (LLM) Gemini. Misha was looking to join the Gemini team as well and Ioannis asked him to lead on reward models. Over the next two years they worked together to launch Gemini 1 and 1.5. Misha was initially intimidated by Ioannis, but soon came to see his colleague in a new light. “What was interesting about the RLHF team that he led was that he was extremely people oriented and worked very hard on ensuring that the people were self-motivated. He would deeply understand what drove them and would figure out the direction to steer them to ensure that what they were doing was impactful for Gemini. I think that’s a superpower that he has as a leader.”</p>



<p>By December of 2023, Google had <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/#introducing-gemini">announced Gemini</a> and when v1.0 was released in February of 2024 it was comparable or better on most benchmarks to OpenAI’s GPT-4. This was a huge accomplishment but the team didn’t let up. A couple of months later it announced <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/#gemini-15">Gemini 1.5</a>, three months before OpenAI released its next major upgrade, GPT-4o. Gemini 1.5 improved compute efficiency through a Mixture of Experts architecture, added multimodal capabilities and a million token context window.</p>



<p>For Misha, the sudden prominence of LLMs was a revelation. “We were trying to solve the general agents problem, but we were looking at it completely the wrong way,” he says. “Because we thought that generality wasn’t solved.” For all their limitations and confabulations, LLMs are the most general systems ever invented. “They’re not very reliable,” Misha explains. “They can’t do any work for you autonomously. You can’t ask them to do something in the way that you would ask a coworker, but they’ll answer almost any question that you have.”</p>



<p>Combining that broad intelligence with the ability to take specific actions reliably was still an unsolved problem. “In AlphaGo, the reward is clear. You win the game or you lose. And in these systems where it’s clear, reinforcement learning works like magic,” says Misha. In most real life situations, however, the reward is quite fuzzy. How do you know if a complex task is complete? How do you know if a human would like a model’s response? This is where his work at DeepMind on open ended reward functions for general agents come in. “It just so happened that that building block that I was focused on outside of language models was one of the core building blocks for training them,” Misha explains.</p>



<p>Misha and Ioannis had achieved their goal of becoming, in Misha’s words, “the best craftsmen of training language models.” They understood these systems inside and out, and yet they didn’t feel the trajectory was moving fast enough towards their burning research question: how to build superintelligent systems capable of acting autonomously?</p>
 



Reflection co-founders Ioannis Antonoglou and Misha Laskin 



 
 Snapping the puzzle pieces together with Reflection 



<p>LLMs have succeeded at achieving a very wide range of capabilities, but their competence is shallow. They have, as Misha puts it, solved the breadth problem but not the depth problem. “It became very clear that these two streams of research are the two building blocks for building a superintelligence,” he says. “You get generality from the language models and you get capability from reinforcement learning.” And indeed, Ioannis adds, “all the necessary components to build a superintelligent agent that can have an impact in the real world are there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When they left DeepMind to form Reflection in March of 2024, their strategy was at odds with where most of the industry was heading. A year later, every major lab is working on reasoning models that augment LLMs with RL, but this wasn’t an obvious direction at the time. Similarly, they had decided to train their own models, a seemingly prohibitively expensive move for a small startup, but it’s clear now that you can radically improve the economics of model training through smart engineering.</p>



<p>“It’s one thing to have the algorithms,” says Ioannis, “but it’s equally important—or even more important—to build them in a way that’s scalable and uses the compute in the best way possible. And we’ve actually seen the power of engineering with DeepSeek, they’ve managed to get such good performance with such a small budget by doing the engineering really well.”</p>



<p>Scaling is crucial to the Reflection approach, but specifically it’s about scaling data and compute in post-training, which allows the agent to get better and better at specific tasks. As Ioannis learned when working on AlphaGo, you have to “really push hard on the systems,” to get superhuman results. But, he admits, “there is a bit of a leap of faith involved, now you have the scaling laws, but until you actually put the investment in and really see that they hold as you go up the orders of magnitude of compute, then you can never be sure, right?”</p>



<p>The scaling laws for pre-trained LLMs are beginning to asymptote, but with RL in post-training the curve is just beginning to climb. Unlike the training data for LLMs, which may be running out, the data for RL training is largely created by the RL agent itself in its interactions with its environment. “It gets some things right, it gets some things wrong,” Ioannis explains. “Things that it gets right it should just do more of and things that it gets wrong it should do less of. So this is like learning from its mistakes. And this really simple mechanism, if scaled correctly, gives rise to superintelligent behavior.”</p>



<p>Misha puts a finer point on this, “the fundamental thing about reinforcement learning—it is the most scalable form of AI. There’s basically no ceiling that we know of.”</p>



<p>The thing about LLMs is that not all tasks are equal for them. They are spikey just like humans, primarily because of differences in the quality and quantity of their training data. Misha explains that the model’s intelligence isn’t evenly distributed across all of human knowledge, but is “a kind of jagged intelligence.” He predicts that the first generally superintelligent systems will be good at some things and not at others.</p>



<p>It turns out that the thing LLMs are spikiest on is also the thing that they are currently used for the most in a work context: coding. “The areas where models are already starting to work well, they’re going to get amplified,” say Misha, “and that’s going to be the first place where we see superintelligent behavior.”</p>



 Superintelligence, the product 



<p>“A lot of AI teams think that the model is the product,” says Misha. “From talking to customers, the way we think about what we’re building, it’s really not a model, it’s a system. So it’s a model coupled to a product that solves real problems for our customer.”</p>



<p>The opportunity that the Reflection founders see is to create genuinely autonomous coding agents that can accurately complete end-to-end tasks that currently an engineer would do. “And if there’s one thing that customers care about above all else in autonomous coding,” Misha reports, “it’s reliability.”</p>



<p>Misha uses Waymo as an analogy for what this might look like in practice. “Part of the product,” he explains, “is the geofencing. It’s not just a car, it’s determining the boundary and its area of excellence.” Instead of claiming at the outset to be capable of any task—as most current coding agents do—the Reflection approach is to partition off the software equivalent of a large metro area and make strong guarantees for safety and reliability within that geography.</p>



<p>The bright side of this limitation is that it enables a more intuitive interface for users. “The most frictionless interface is like the one that you communicate with humans,” says Misha. “The example is you give it an engineering task, and it comes back to you with an implementation that is better than the one that you would have imagined. That’s what we think superintelligence looks like.”</p>



<p>The founders believe that solving autonomous coding is a “root-node” problem that will unlock more general superintelligence. “We think that autonomous coding is AGI complete. So if you show that you have a super intelligent software developer, then that’s all it takes, that’s an AGI,” says Ioannis. “Then it’s a matter of just taking the same algorithm and applying it to different verticals. But you have the recipe for how to get superintelligent systems. All the things that you need for intelligence are there in this particular problem.”</p>



 Why code, why now? 



<p>There are many kinds of intelligence, not just those required to write code. But code seems to be the most available surface area to push machine intelligence. “We think that the intelligence is going to evolve faster than the software,” predicts Misha. “The reason to work on software engineering today is because it’s the one category that is already ready for this. That entire category has been built for it to be machine friendly.”</p>



<p>Automating coding with autonomous agents will have a profound effect on software itself. “In software the form factor that we have as humans, the UIs we are used to using on a computer, are not necessarily the UIs that are going to be optimal for AIs,” says Misha. The GUI, the graphical user interface, evolved because humans have innate priors based on having eyes and hands. But for LLMs, their priors are the language on the internet. “But when it comes to interacting with a computer, the language that you interact with the computer with is code. So to a language model, code is as intuitive as three dimensional object manipulation is for humans,” continues Misha. “Code is ergonomic for language models.”</p>



<p>The implications of these changes will take time to unfold. In the process, companies that produce software will create AI-friendly UIs that enable human interactions with software products to be faster if not instantaneous. Misha foresees that “it might be that pieces of the GUI get eaten and under the hood it’s just a language model doing some work via code.” Instead of a ten click human workflow, the LLM might just write a single line of code that encapsulates the entire task.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Reflection team has a pragmatic definition of superintelligence as a thing that creates value by doing work on computers. “We think that a coding agent is actually going to be the way that a language model does work on any piece of software in the future,” says Misha. “So if you solve this problem, you’ve solved superintelligence on a computer for any piece of software that has an AI friendly interface.” Eventually, Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan imagines that this will lead to “a future where we all become directors of superintelligent agents that conduct knowledge work on our behalf.”</p>



<p>Getting there will involve not just training models, but building the machine-friendly interfaces—from browsers and code editors to abstract representations of task categories—that literally set the stage for superintelligence. Autonomous agents will work best, the founders believe, when they have custom-designed environments (think DeepMind’s Atari environment or the OpenAI Gym) in which they can hone their particular craft. When it comes to code, the required environments and tools are fairly easy to imagine, but other cognitive categories may require greater leaps.</p>



<p>AI at its current stage is like the early steam engines before the discovery of thermodynamics: Lack of theory didn’t stop inventors from producing new engines. “I think deeply understanding why a model works from a theoretical sense will certainly be a very useful thing,” says Misha. “Whenever a thing has been deeply understood theoretically, at least in physics, it spurred a new era of empirical innovations because scientists knew where to search. But you don’t need to wait for that to build reliable systems today.”<br>Richard Feynman was an early hero of Misha’s, inspiring him to study physics. In his lecture on the conservation of energy, Feynman said, “It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is.” The same is true of AI today, and the study of intelligence. During a Noble Prize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkb4qEuxoJc">interview</a> in Stockholm, DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis summed up where we are in the quest for superintelligence: “I think the science of AI is about trying to explore and understand what intelligence is, and the best expression of understanding something is actually trying to build it.”</p>

<p>A recent case involving a former intern at the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has once again confirmed the persistent threat of data leaks, even within organizations entrusted with the most sensitive information.</p><p>Hassan Arshad, the intern, pleaded guilty to smuggling top-secret data out of a protected computer. He transferred the information to his smartphone and then uploaded it to a hard drive connected to his personal computer.</p><p>The incident, which occurred in August 2022 and led to Arshad’s arrest a month later, compromised a “tool” used by GCHQ and revealed the names of agency employees. The British government classified the leaked data as “top secret,” indicating that its compromise could lead to loss of life or directly threaten national security.</p><p>This breach at GCHQ, an agency responsible for signals intelligence and cybersecurity, highlights a critical reality: even the most sophisticated security protocols are vulnerable to insider&nbsp;threats.</p><p>According to CISA, insider threats are risks originating from within an organization, often from employees who have authorized access to sensitive data. These threats can be malicious, as in Arshad’s case, or unintentional, stemming from negligence or human&nbsp;error.</p><p>The GCHQ incident exemplifies several key vulnerabilities:</p>  Insufficient Access Controls: The intern’s ability to access and transfer top-secret information suggests a potential failure in implementing the principle of least privilege, a fundamental data security best practice. Users should only have access to the data necessary for their specific&nbsp;role.  Device Security: The transfer of data to a personal smartphone and hard drive circumvents the secure environment intended for top-secret information. The use of personal devices without proper security measures significantly increases the risk of data breaches.  Insider Threat Mitigation: Despite GCHQ’s advanced security measures, the case demonstrates the difficulty in preventing determined individuals from exploiting their authorized access. Effective insider threat mitigation requires a multi-layered approach, including thorough background checks, continuous monitoring of user activity, and robust security awareness training for all personnel.  <p>PIVX.

<p>Today marks a bittersweet milestone for the Zcash Foundation as we bid farewell to Jack Gavigan (aka <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/u/dodger/summary">Dodger</a>), our Executive Director, who stepped down after four years of dedicated service. Jack’s tenure has been nothing short of transformative, and his leadership has left an indelible mark on the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



<p>Jack began his career working with startups during the dot-com boom of the late ‘90s. He subsequently spent over a decade working in financial technology with major institutions like Morgan Stanley, where he also spent a year as a trader.</p>



<p>Prior to his role at the Foundation, Jack served as COO and Head of Regulatory Relations at the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/">Electric Coin Company (ECC)</a>, where he helped launch Zcash and played a pivotal role in fostering its growth. His work at ECC included <a href="https://z.cash/jack-gavigan-on-jp-morgan-and-disintermediation/">collaborating with JP Morgan on integrating privacy-preserving technology into their Quorum blockchain platform</a>, showcasing his ability to bridge traditional finance and cutting-edge cryptographic solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jack also worked extensively with regulators and policymakers to educate them on cryptocurrencies and privacy-preserving technologies. His efforts were instrumental in helping Zcash gain regulatory acceptance, such as its <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-is-now-the-worlds-first-licensed-zcash-exchange">listing on Gemini Exchange after approval from the New York Department of Financial Services</a>. Furthermore, he contributed to shaping global cryptocurrency regulations through his participation in meetings with organizations like FATF, <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/the-fatf-recommendations/">advocating for balanced approaches that support innovation while addressing compliance concerns</a>.</p>



<p>Jack joined the Zcash Foundation in early 2021, bringing with him this wealth of experience in traditional finance coupled with a deep understanding of Zcash’s mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Zcash Foundation, Jack’s leadership drove several major milestones, most notably spearheading the development of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zebra/">Zebra</a>, which is a Rust-based implementation of the Zcash protocol. Zebra provides a robust alternative to zcashd and lays a solid foundation for future innovations in privacy-preserving technology. Under his guidance, the Foundation also supported initiatives like <a href="https://zfnd.org/frost/">FROST</a> (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures), which enhances cryptographic usability for wallets and signing groups.</p>



<p>Jack’s strategic vision extended beyond technical advancements. He championed community engagement through the annual <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcon/">Zcon</a> conferences, coordinated by the Zcash Foundation, and sought advisory input by running <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a> polls, to ensure that community voices shaped critical decisions. His efforts led to the adoption of <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1015">ZIP 1015</a>, which decentralized ecosystem funding by transitioning grants administration to the Cayman Islands-based <a href="https://www.financialprivacyfoundation.org/">Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF)</a>.</p>



<p>On behalf of the Zcash Foundation and the broader ecosystem, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to Jack for his years of service. Thank you for your unwavering commitment to advancing financial privacy. Your legacy will inspire us as we continue building.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>April 2, 2025 — Starting today, Brave users can conduct shielded Zcash transactions in the browser-native Brave Wallet with the updated desktop release (v1.77). This integration is part of the ongoing partnership with Zcash/ECC and Filecoin Foundation <a>announced at Mainnet 2023</a>, which now allows the privacy-preserving Zcash native currency (ZEC) to be bought, sent, and received directly within Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Shielded transactions use zero-knowledge proofs to hide the sender, receiver, and amount of a transaction from the public blockchain. Adding shielded transactions with Zcash to Brave Wallet gives users a way to send and store crypto privately. The integration introduces Brave Wallet users to a privacy-preserving technology that they can access alongside existing supported networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.</p>
<p>Android and iOS availability are coming in the next several months.</p>

 Extending Brave Wallet privacy with Zcash 
<p>The Brave browser drastically improves privacy and security for anything people do online. With features like its core <a>Shields</a> ad-and-tracker blocker, a built-in <a>VPN</a>, and no-login AI chat agent <a>Leo</a>, the Brave browser can help everyone stay safer while they browse. Brave Search—available in Brave and any other browser—offers fast, accurate search results served from an independent index of the Web, all without profiling its users. The integrated Brave Wallet extends this focus to Web3 or the Internet of Value as a secure, multi-chain crypto wallet built natively in the browser.</p>
<p>Well known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are public in nature, and there’s a cap on how private users can be with the recording of transactions in public ledgers. Zcash aims to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Zcash is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that forked and adapted an early version of the Bitcoin codebase. It offers both transparent transactions and shielded transactions, which use zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy. Transactions in Zcash can be controlled by either a transparent address (t-addr) or a shielded address (z-addr), allowing users to choose between public and private transactions.</p>
<p>By bringing Zcash and Brave Wallet together, Brave can now help users stay secure and anonymous while they browse, while they search and—now—when they transact.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to launch the integration of Zcash’s shielded transactions in our Brave Wallet, giving our users the ability to conduct privacy-preserving transactions directly from the browser,” said James Mudgett, VP of Web3 at Brave. “Brave’s privacy-by-default approach puts users in charge of their data, and enabling our users to buy, send, and store crypto privately with shielded Zcash is a natural extension of our privacy offering.”</p>
<p>“Financial privacy is fundamental to human freedom. With Brave’s commitment to privacy-first Web browsing and Zcash’s best-in-class shielded transactions, this integration marks a major step forward for user sovereignty,” said Josh Swihart, CEO of ECC. “By bringing Zcash (ZEC) into Brave Wallet, we are making it easier for people to access and use digital cash without compromising their privacy—an important win for financial autonomy and, ultimately, for humanity as a whole.”</p>

 Transacting with Zcash in Brave Wallet 
<p>To get started with shielded Zcash transactions, Brave Wallet users can simply click  in the Brave browser, and follow the steps below:</p>
 
 Click Send in the sidebar menu. 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
 
 Select an asset to send. 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
 
 Choose a recipient. 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
 
 Confirm the transaction. 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 About Zcash and ECC 
<p><a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a> is the first cryptocurrency to develop zero-knowledge encryption for private peer-to-peer payments. It’s available in trusted digital wallets and listed on high-quality exchanges around the world, making it the best option for private everyday payments and long-term savings.</p>
<p>Electric Coin Co. launched Zcash in 2016 and continues to support the protocol and user experience, alongside other developers and teams.

<p>Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake created a unique set of conditions (i.e. lack of protocol-level delegation, 32 ETH requirement, long exit queues, etc.) that led to Lido’s liquid staking model to gain huge traction, significantly eclipsing other LSD providers on native PoS chains. stETH added on-demand liquidity, bypassing withdrawal windows, while also increasing DeFi utilization and increasing yields. Moreover, by allowing users to stake any amount of ETH in pools, it removed the requirement for 32 ETH increments, ultimately improving decentralisation through long tail distribution of individual stakers. Lido V3 introduces modular stVaults which enable staking customization. This allows professional actors, such as institutional stakers, to have granular control over validators, MEV and other parameters, diversifying their investment strategies.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Hasu’s background  Discovering Lido  Liquid staking and the early days of Lido  Why liquid staking gained traction on Ethereum  The evolution of Lido  Initial decentralisation concerns and the importance of dual governance  Restaking  Lido V3 and vaults  Institutional staking &amp; ETFs  Ethereum’s ‘crisis’ and its values  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/hasufl">Hasu on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/LidoFinance">Lido on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Bitcoin’s debut in 2009 was the first successful implementation of a digital currency that operates without a central authority. I still remember some of the early selling points of the flagship cryptocurrency — transactions were immutable, relatively cheaper, transparent, and anonymous. Sorry to burst your bubble but “Bitcoin transactions were never anonymous.”</p><p>The reality is that transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are transparent and permanently recorded on a public ledger. This transparency created a significant gap in the cryptocurrency space for solutions that could offer genuine financial privacy.</p><p>Privacy coins emerged to fill this void, offering technological innovations to protect user identity and transaction details. Over the years, these coins have evolved significantly in their approaches to privacy, regulatory challenges, and adoption patterns. From the early predecessors to cutting-edge solutions of today, let’s explore the evolution of privacy&nbsp;coins.</p> Bitcoin’s Privacy Limitations <p>Bitcoin’s pseudonymous design provides a limited form of privacy. While users are not required to provide personal information to create a wallet, all transactions are permanently linked to public addresses. This means that once a Bitcoin address is connected to a real identity — through exchanges, merchants, or blockchain analysis — the entire transaction history becomes traceable.</p><p>Bitcoin’s privacy limitations are apparent in transparent ledgers since all transactions are publicly visible. There are also advanced techniques for de-anonymizing users and of course, with KYC becoming a mandatory step on many exchanges, identity verification links addresses to real&nbsp;people.</p><p>These limitations created the demand for cryptocurrencies with stronger privacy guarantees.</p> History of Privacy&nbsp;Coins <p>The first wave of purpose-built privacy coins emerged between 2012 and&nbsp;2016.</p><p>2012: Bytecoin, often credited as the first privacy coin, debuted in 2012 with its innovative CryptoNote technology. This protocol introduced crucial privacy enhancements, notably ring signatures for transaction obfuscation and one-time addresses for increased anonymity. However, Bytecoin’s initial promise was undermined by allegations of pre-mining, which significantly hampered its adoption and fostered widespread skepticism.</p><p>2013: Although not a dedicated privacy coin, Bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell proposed CoinJoin in 2013. This privacy implementation combines multiple payments from multiple spenders into a single transaction, making it harder to determine which sender paid which recipient. 2013 also saw the rise of centralized Bitcoin&nbsp;mixers.</p><p>2014: Launched in 2014, Dash introduced PrivateSend (originally called DarkSend), an improved implementation of CoinJoin that utilized the coin’s masternode network to mix transactions. While innovative, Dash’s privacy features were optional and didn’t hide transaction amounts.</p><p>Launching as a Bytecoin fork in April, Monero quickly led the privacy coin sector with ring signatures and stealth addresses. In 2017, Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) further enhanced privacy. Monero’s mandatory privacy, however, has attracted regulatory attention.</p><p>2016: Launched in 2016, ZCash introduced a novel cryptographic technique called zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge), allowing users to prove possession of information without revealing the information itself. This allowed for fully encrypted transactions that hide the sender, recipient, and amount. It also enabled selective disclosure, where users can share transaction details for auditing purposes.</p><p>PIVX, a Dash fork, entered the cryptocurrency scene in November 2016, bringing enhanced privacy capabilities. The project’s evolution included the integration of various privacy protocols, culminating in a unique and optimized implementation of zk-SNARKs. This milestone made PIVX the first proof-of-stake blockchain to successfully adopt this technology. Notably, PIVX, like Zcash, offers users the choice between transparent and shielded transactions, providing optional privacy rather than enforcing it.</p> Second-Generation Privacy Innovations <p>As blockchain analysis techniques grew more sophisticated, privacy coins evolved to counter these threats with more advanced technologies. For instance, in 2018, Monero implemented “Bulletproofs.” This drastically reduced transaction size and verification time, making privacy more efficient. This improvement addressed a key scalability challenge in privacy coins. Other second-generation privacy upgrades&nbsp;include:</p> Mimblewimble <p>Proposed in 2016 and first implemented in Grin and Beam (both launched in 2019), Mimblewimble offered confidential transactions and cut-through. Transaction amounts are hidden and blockchain data are compressed by removing unnecessary transaction information. The protocol also uses one-time keys for transactions rather than reusable addresses.</p> zk-STARKs <p>As an improvement over zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge) eliminated the need for a trusted setup and offered better quantum resistance, though with larger proof&nbsp;sizes.</p> Regulatory Status of Privacy&nbsp;Coins <p>The evolution of privacy coins has been shaped not only by technological innovations but also by regulatory responses and market adoption. Notably, they have faced growing scrutiny from regulators. Many exchanges have removed privacy coins to comply with regulatory requirements. There has also been inherent tension between privacy coin features and anti-money laundering requirements.</p><p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) travel guidelines, for instance, require exchanges to share user information for transactions over&nbsp;$1,000.</p><p>To circumvent these bottlenecks, privacy coins have adopted various means, such as optional privacy, as in the case of PIVX SHIELD. Some projects use view keys, which are essentially private keys that reveal transaction details without providing spending authority.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy. Your Choice.<br>To stay on top of PIVX news please visit PIVX.org and Discord.PIVX.org.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-evolution-of-privacy-coins-6130c997edab">The Evolution of Privacy Coins</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Panther Protocol Foundation is taking an important step toward achieving its mission of private DeFi with the launch of its Limited Mainnet Beta on Polygon. The mainnet beta is Panther’s bounded testing environment, running on the Polygon mainnet Network. It is designed to operate under real-world conditions and serves as a sandboxed blockchain environment where features are tested and validated before being deployed into production.</p><p>Eurobit, a licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) will serve as the Zone Manager for the Beta’s Zone. Zone Managers are responsible for managing specific Zones—logically partitioned groups of assets and users—within the network, ensuring transactions comply with regulatory requirements. The beta test will operate with a single Zone.</p> Incentives for Participants <p>Panther has structured an attractive rewards program to encourage active participation in the beta:</p>  Total Rewards: A total of 4 million $ZKP tokens has been allocated for incentives the beta test, with an additional 1 million $ZKP being allocated to to subsidize network costs like gas fees, and bundler services  Transaction-Based Rewards: Rewards will be distributed in proportion to transaction and mining activity along with other incentives, encouraging participants to actively engage in testing the network. For further information refer to our <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/changelog/overview-1/canary?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">documentation</a>.   Testing Period and Withdrawals <p>The beta will operate for a limited period of 2–3 months, followed by a 1–2 week grace period for participants to withdraw their assets and rewards.</p> Cutting-Edge Privacy and Compliance Features <p>Participants will have the opportunity to test Panther’s privacy and compliance features, including:</p>  Compliance Provider: PureFi will manage KYC and KYT processes, including wallet screening, to maintain a secure and compliant environment.  Allowlisted Tokens: Participants will have access to up to 10 supported tokens on the Polygon network, including ZKP, POL, LINK, GRT, UNI, QUICK, and AAVE, enabling diverse and realistic testing scenarios.  Transaction Limits: To maintain a controlled testing environment and to reduce the chance of loss of funds, daily transaction caps are implemented, ensuring the beta operates as a secure and well-sandboxed space for experimentation.  Zone Manager: Eurobit will manage the Beta’s sole Zone, ensuring&nbsp; smooth operations and the integrity of all testing activities.   Testing zSwap and Community Mining <p>The beta test includes testing Panther’s zSwap feature, integrated with Uniswap V3 and QuickSwap on Polygon. Additionally, the test will leverage community-run miners, ensuring decentralization and fostering active engagement.</p> Join our Limited Mainnet Beta <p>To join our Limited Mainnet Beta, refer to our <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/mainnet-beta-canary?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Mainnet Beta documentation</a> and click on the IPFS link on the Entrypoint.

<p>While DeFi’s ultimate goal is to provide an alternative for TradFi, blockchain gaming caters to retail masses, onboarding millions of users to crypto through incentives and fun gameplay. The greatest success story in Web3 gaming thus far has been, without a doubt, Axie Infinity. Apart from creating an engaged community whose early adopters also experienced rags-to-riches stories, it kickstarted an entire movement around play-to-earn gaming. Many have tried copying it, yet most of them failed. Axie Infinity managed to design a sustainable economy that combined NFTs and fungible tokens. The result was the first gamified crypto mining event, at scale. In order to accommodate such a massive demand, in a time when L2 rollups were still in R&amp;D, Sky Mavis founded Ronin, a gaming-oriented Ethereum sidechain. The community that formed around Axie Infinity created a tremendous network effect, solidifying Ronin’s PMF as a gaming powerhouse. Before long, many up-and-coming titles migrated to Ronin, and the growth effects in all their key metrics (i.e. DAUs, transactions, revenue, etc.) further fuelled the flywheel.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jeff’s background  Cryptokitties  Joining Axie Infinity and how it evolved  Monetizing Axie’s economy  The recipe for successful blockchain games  Building Ronin, the gaming L1  On-chain vs. off-chain game elements  Community building  Ronin’s economy &amp; composability  Most suitable gaming genre for Web3  AI x gaming  Crypto gaming investments  Ronin’s current state and future roadmap  Axie’s upcoming MMO  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/Jihoz_Axie">Jeff Zirlin on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/axieinfinity">Axie Infinity on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/ronin_network">Ronin on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/SkyMavisHQ">Sky Mavis on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

  Partnering with Mercury:
The Business Banking Platform of the Future  <p>Immad, Jason, Max and their team serve ambitious companies, with an ambitious goal of their own: to reimagine what banking can be.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/isaiah-boone/">Isaiah Boone</a>	 



Published March 26, 2025
  



Mercury co-founders Max Tagher, Jason Zhang and Immad Akhund.




 
<p>The bank account is the nucleus of business finance, where critical workflows begin and end. It is the first financial relationship a founder sets up, it is in the flow of funds, and it is the core “system of record” for a company’s money. Yet as personal banking has transitioned online, business banking has been left behind, especially for many startups and small businesses. There are tens of millions of these companies in the U.S. alone—consumer-like in scale, but with far more complex needs. The slow, often paper-based processes of incumbent banks simply can’t keep up.</p>



<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a> is a breath of fresh air: a simple, even joyful, product that integrates seamlessly into all of a company’s financial processes and brings the best of modern banking services to ambitious founders and business owners. Startup natives themselves, co-founders Immad Akhund, Jason Zhang and Max Tagher saw firsthand how difficult it was for Silicon Valley companies to access institutional banking services, so they launched Mercury in 2019 with the goal to make it easier.</p>



<p>Six years later, Immad, Jason and Max have built the product they would’ve wanted back then. Happy customers tell us they’ve been delighted to open an account in less time than it would have taken to get just one email returned from a traditional bank, and they say Mercury has become a trusted partner as they build and scale their businesses. That trust has empowered the team to expand into other financial services as they continue to reimagine banking.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury is also moving from Silicon Valley to Main Street, as the types of customers the platform serves expand in kind—both with the launch of the <a href="https://mercury.com/personal-banking">Mercury Personal</a> waitlist, and as the company’s reputation for quality spreads across industries. Last year alone, Mercury handled more than $150 billion worth of transactions; today, it serves more than 200,000 businesses.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia are proud to lead Mercury’s Series C and join their board as the team sets its sights even higher: on a comprehensive suite of commercial and personal banking services. Mercury’s vision for the future has already clearly resonated with its customers, and we believe the innovative spirit and operational excellence that brought them to this moment can drive their growth for years and decades to come.</p>



<p>Mercury is a financial technology company, not a bank. Business banking services provided through Choice Financial Group, Column N.A., and Evolve Bank &amp; Trust; Members FDIC. Personal banking services provided through Choice Financial Group; Member FDIC.</p>

<p>In August 2022, Alexey Pertsev was arrested in the Netherlands. He was convicted of money laundering in May 2024 and sentenced to 64 months imprisonment. What was his offence? He was accused of playing a key role in the development of Tornado Cash, a widely used coin mixing&nbsp;service.</p><p>Contrary to what you may have been led to believe, transactions on public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are not anonymous; they are pseudonymous. While they do not directly reveal real-world identities, blockchain analysis can reveal transaction patterns and connections between addresses. Cryptocurrency mixers, also known as tumblers, were designed to address this privacy concern by obfuscating the link between the sender and recipient addresses, thus disrupting the transaction trail.</p> What is a Coin&nbsp;Mixer? <p>A coin mixer is designed to obscure the link between cryptocurrency transactions. The end goal is to make it difficult to trace the origin and destination of funds. This is achieved by pooling deposits from multiple users and then redistributing them in a way that breaks the transaction history. This complex three-step process broadly involves deposits, mixing, and redistribution.</p><p>The mixer combines funds from one user with those of others, creating a large pool of mixed funds. In some cases, random time delays are implemented and the transactions are split into smaller amounts to further obscure the trail. So instead of mixing a 1.5 BTC transaction directly, the system might split it into standardized units like 1 BTC, 0.3 BTC, and 0.2&nbsp;BTC.</p><p>In the redistribution phase, the mixed cryptocurrency is sent to the user’s designated receiving address, typically from various sources within the&nbsp;pool.</p> Types of Coin&nbsp;Mixers <p>There are two primary categories of coin mixers — centralized and decentralized mixers.</p><p>Centralized mixers are operated by third-party services that take custody of users’ cryptocurrency. Users send their cryptocurrency to the mixer, which then mixes and redistributes the funds. While these services are relatively simple to use, one key risk is that trust is placed in the hands of a third-party. It also creates a single point of failure and users could be compromised or subpoenaed if logs are maintained. Some popular examples include Blender.io, Bitmix, and&nbsp;Mixtura.</p><p>Decentralized mixers, on the other hand, operate without a central controlling entity. Instead, they use smart contracts or peer-to-peer protocols to coordinate the mixing process. Common examples include CoinJoin, Wasabi, and Whirlpool.</p> Use Cases <p>While mixers are sometimes associated with illicit activities, there are several legitimate reasons why individuals might seek enhanced transaction privacy. Given the pseudonymous nature of many blockchain transactions, wealthy cryptocurrency holders may use mixers to prevent becoming targets for theft or extortion.</p><p>It is not out of place for individuals who value their financial privacy to use coin mixing services. In jurisdictions with limited civil liberties, financial privacy tools can serve as protection against government overreach.</p> Coin Mixing Vs. Privacy Protocols <p>One could argue that the aim of coin mixers and privacy-enhancing protocols such as PIVX SHIELD are to enhance financial privacy. However, they differ greatly in their primary goal and&nbsp;methods.</p><p>While coin mixing’s fundamental purpose is to make it difficult to trace the flow of cryptocurrencies, zk-SNARKs (and by extension PIVX SHIELD) focus on verifying the legitimacy of a transaction without disclosing any sensitive information about it. The goal is to ensure that a transaction is valid without revealing who sent it, who received it, or how much was transferred.</p><p>As already mentioned, coin mixing achieves its goal by pooling together cryptocurrencies from numerous individuals and then redistributing them in a way that disrupts the original transaction trail. However, SHIELD uses sophisticated cryptographic algorithms to create proofs that demonstrate the validity of a transaction without revealing the underlying data (sender, receiver, amount).</p><p>PIVX.

<p>In a renewed effort to protect young users, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers reintroduced the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0) earlier in&nbsp;March.</p><p>Spearheaded by Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), the <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/coppa_20.pdf">legislation</a> seeks to fundamentally reshape how digital platforms interact with minors. The core objective is to curb the invasive data practices that have become commonplace in the age of social media and online&nbsp;gaming.</p><p>The proposed bill outlines several key provisions:</p>  Ban on Targeted Advertising: Children and teenagers would be shielded from the relentless barrage of personalized ads that track their online behavior.  Data Minimization and Erasure: Companies would be compelled to collect only the essential data needed for their services and to promptly erase personal information upon&nbsp;request.  Enhanced Consent Requirements: Internet companies would be prohibited from gathering data from 13- to 16-year-old users without their explicit&nbsp;consent.  <p>This isn’t a new battle. Senator Markey, a long-time advocate for children’s online safety, has championed similar legislation for over a decade. While previous iterations of the bill faced roadblocks, COPPA 2.0 gained significant momentum in the last Congress, passing the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support.</p><p>The urgency of this legislation is underscored by the growing chorus of support from children’s advocacy groups, educators, and medical professionals. They argue that the unchecked data collection practices of Big Tech pose a serious threat to children’s privacy and well-being.</p><p>The digital landscape has become a surveillance state for children. Recall that the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) already began an <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/big-techs-dirty-secret-your-kids-privacy-doesn-t-matter-d1e3eabe9921">investigation</a> into how social media platforms such as TikTok, Reddit, and Imgur processed children’s data.</p><p>Senator Cassidy emphasized the parental anxieties driving the legislation, “Every kid has an iPad or smartphone […] COPPA 2.0 is the tool that will give parents the peace of mind they need and keep their children’s personal information secure.”</p><p>The reintroduction of COPPA 2.0 marks a critical juncture in the ongoing debate over online privacy. As the digital lives of young people become increasingly intertwined with their real-world experiences, the need for robust safeguards has never been more apparent. The question remains: will this Congress finally deliver the protections that children and parents so desperately need?</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>Brave presents the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program, expanding BAT utility while giving Web3 brands premium visibility. Launch partners include Bandit’s Badchain, CHOMP, Decentraland, GuanoCoin, Karate Combat, Pudgy Pop, and SOL Incinerator.</p>
<p>Brave Rewards 3.0 is the next evolution of Brave’s unique in-browser rewards program, allowing users to support content creators and earn <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Tokens</a> (BAT) for viewing privacy-respecting ads. Rolling out in phases over 2025, Rewards 3.0 introduces a new Offer Wall experience, more earning opportunities, self-custody payout options, and exclusive benefits from partners for <a>Brave Rewards</a> users and BAT holders.</p>
<p>Learn more about Brave Rewards 3.0 in <a>BAT Roadmap 3.0: The On-chain Era</a>.</p>
<p>The Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program will be a key part of the Rewards 3.0 rollout, ensuring users can continue earning BAT with their attention while unlocking even more ways to earn, spend, and interact with BAT in the broader Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>The program offers unique opportunities that only Brave—and its 82 million monthly active users—can provide. Partners will gain high visibility exposure to new audiences, along with valuable insights into messaging and incentives that resonate most with loyal Rewards users. By integrating BAT utility into their platforms and activations, participating partners will drive engagement and adoption across e-commerce, gaming, digital content, DeFi, and beyond.</p>
<p>For Brave Rewards users, this means direct access to real-world benefits like discounts, premium goods or services, and Web3 experiences—all directly through the browser.</p>

 The Partner Program will grow BAT and Brave 
<p>The Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program enhances BAT’s utility while advancing Brave’s mission to build a privacy-first Web that empowers users. Partners contribute to BAT’s ecosystem by paying for the program in BAT, and integrating new secondary BAT utilities, which will ultimately drive adoption across Web3.</p>
<p>Brave Rewards and BAT were first made available to users in 2017. Rewards 3.0 builds on that foundation by bringing added value to Web3 within Brave’s expanding user base and in the broader multichain attention economy.</p>
<p>Rewards 3.0 also leverages BAT’s growing adoption:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Over 99% of the 1.5B total BAT supply is already in circulation 
 BAT ranks as the 14th most distributed token by on-chain holders on Ethereum 
 1.5M+ verified creators accept BAT contributions 
 600+ advertiser campaigns have leveraged Brave Ads, cementing BAT’s role in a thriving, user-first ad economy 
 
<blockquote>
<p>“In a space that’s become tired with hype cycle after hype cycle and fly-by-night engagement farming, we’re aiming to do something different with the Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program. We’ve created a program for product teams that provides a mix of exposure, duration, and addressable lead users needed to experiment and find early market fit in Brave. We welcome partners to the program that want to grow with the Brave Rewards ecosystem, and that share our interest in bringing useful products, value, and Web3 adoption to millions of new users.”</p>

<p>Over the next six months, a new group of partners will be announced and added to the program each month. Partners in the program will be adding and updating offers throughout the duration of the program. To kick off the program, Brave welcomes our first group of partners:</p>

 Bandit’s Badchain 
<p><a href="https://earn.badchain.org/">Bandit’s Badchain</a> is a satirical blockchain by Bandit Network, designed to poke fun at the hype-driven world of Web3. Embracing the hilariously terrible, it turns epic fails into an art form—because sometimes, being bad is the whole point.</p>
<p><a href="https://bandit.network/">Bandit Network</a> is a leader in white-labeled quest solutions that drive engagement through interactive experiences. In addition to powering quests for Rewards users, Bandit will be featuring Brave as a B2B channel partner to grow the Rewards Partner Program.</p>

 CHOMP 
<p><a href="https://app.chomp.games/application">CHOMP</a> is a subjective oracle wrapped in a gamified quiz experience. It harnesses crowd wisdom to determine the best answer, using research-backed algorithms that analyze user responses. Players share opinions, predict how others will answer, and earn rewards.</p>
<p>As part of the program, CHOMP will feature a weekly BAT or Brave-themed deck, exploring core values like privacy, attention, and community. Brave Rewards users can put their instincts to the test, ‘CHOMP the deck,’ and compete for BAT rewards.</p>

 Decentraland 
<p><a href="https://decentraland.org/">Decentraland</a> is a social virtual world. From community-built landscapes to immersive events, Decentraland offers a vibrant open-source playground where anyone can dive into a world of endless creativity, exploration, and connection.</p>
<p>Decentraland will collaborate with the BAT Community on activations and engagements within Decentraland, exclusive rewards, and bringing both communities together through joint community calls and X Spaces.&nbsp;</p>

 GuanoCoin 
<p>Created by a group of dedicated fans and developers from the BAT Community, <a href="https://www.guanocoin.com/">GuanoCoin</a> ($GUANO) is a memecoin designed to help grow BAT’s ecosystem on Solana. The team recently launched the GuanoCoin Cave, where BAT holders can lock their BAT to earn GUANO over time—now holding over 160,000 BAT. Through the program, GuanoCoin will offer incentives and quests to help Rewards users maximize their on-chain rewards.</p>

 Karate Combat 
<p><a href="https://karate.com/">Karate Combat</a> is the world’s premier full-contact striking league, blending live-action martial arts with immersive CGI environments powered by the Unreal Engine. Broadcast in over 100 countries, it delivers high-energy combat sports with a futuristic edge.</p>
<p>Karate Combat’s involvement builds on an ongoing media partnership with Brave, with plans to use the program to experiment with activations involving BAT and Karate token utility, and new ways to bring both communities together.</p>

 Pudgy Pop 
<p><a href="https://www.pudgypop.com/">Pudgy Pop</a> is a tile-matching game set in the adorable Pudgy Penguins universe. With strategic challenges, charming characters, and a community-driven spirit, it offers a fresh twist on a classic puzzle experience.</p>
<p>Pudgy Pop will collaborate with Brave to promote Web3 gaming through social campaigns and in-person events throughout the program.</p>

 SOL Incinerator 
<p><a href="https://sol-incinerator.com/?gad_source=1">SOL Incinerator</a> is a Solana-based platform that lets users permanently burn unwanted tokens and scam NFTs from their wallets while reclaiming SOL—or BAT—in the process. Designed to keep portfolios clean, it turns burning junk into a rewarding experience.</p>
<p>The program provides a great opportunity for Brave Rewards users to learn and utilize SOL Incinerator to burn unwanted tokens for BAT for added value.</p>

 How interested partners can get involved 
<p>The Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program is just getting started. Each month, we’ll share updates on new partners and exclusive offers for Brave Rewards users.</p>

  Wiz and Google: Securing the Cloud  <p>Congratulations to Assaf and the team.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/doug-leone/">Doug Leone</a>	 



Published March 18, 2025
  



 
<p>Before we partnered with Wiz in February 2020, our history with Assaf Rappaport and his co-founders Yinon Costica, Roy Reznik and Ami Luttwak already went back almost a decade.</p>



<p>We learned in 2013 that a team of alumni from Israel’s elite 8200 cybersecurity unit were starting a company together. We look for outliers at Sequoia—a founder coming out of 8200 was noteworthy, but a whole team was very special. They weren’t looking for financing. But after our Tel Aviv-based partner Gili Raanan secured a meeting, we convinced them to partner with Sequoia and we led the first financing for Adallom. (I later learned that Assaf thought I was Don Valentine when we first met, which may be why he agreed to the meeting.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>After selling Adallom to Microsoft and leading Microsoft’s Cloud Security Group for five years, the co-founders left to once again start something new. We were thrilled to hear they wanted Sequoia and Gili (who by then had his own firm, Cyberstarts) to be their first partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They didn’t know exactly what the something new would be, but they now had a proven track record and the ambition to build an enduring company. Before they even had a product, we led their initial financing round alongside Cyberstarts in early 2020 and I joined the board.</p>



<p>The team quickly hit on the insight that cloud security needed a simpler, agentless architecture for an increasingly complex digital world. Once the vision for Wiz became clear, they <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/wiz-spotlight-with-a-little-help-from-their-friends/">accelerated like no company I’ve ever seen</a>: My partner Bogomil Balkansky, who also works with Wiz, says that in the early days the team strategically leveraged their Israeli time zone, working 9-5 on the product and then working late into the night on sales calls to the U.S. and Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we helped recruit team members, we were consistently impressed with the caliber of talent joining Wiz and their ability to move quickly. Wiz set a record, reaching $100 million in annual recurring revenue in just 18 months, faster than any software company in history, and quickly became a leader in cloud security.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-joining-google">Today’s milestone</a> marks the start of an exciting new chapter. Wiz and Google Cloud share a vision to improve security by making it easier and faster for organizations of all types and sizes to protect themselves, end-to-end, across all major clouds. This will help spur the adoption of multicloud cybersecurity.</p>



<p>The future is bright for Wiz inside of Google Cloud. Just as we believed Google would change the world when we first partnered with the company in 1999, we believe Wiz is transforming cloud security.</p>



<p>At Sequoia, we partner with founders who want to make a dent in the universe. We couldn’t be prouder of Assaf and the team in reaching this milestone. It’s been an honor to be your partner for over a decade. Thank you for letting us be a part of your journey.</p>

<p>It’s no longer a secret that Big Tech companies generally prioritize profits over privacy. You’ve probably heard the saying: “If it’s free, then you are the product.” What’s even more alarming is that while we navigate the complexities of raising kids in a hyper-connected world, these tech giants are quietly amassing vast troves of data, often with little regard for the long-term consequences.</p><p>The veneer of child-friendly interfaces and educational apps masks a relentless data collection machine. From seemingly innocuous games to social media platforms designed for “younger audiences,” children are being tracked, profiled, and targeted with alarming efficiency. This isn’t just about collecting basic demographic information; it’s about building intricate dossiers that can influence their behaviours, shape their preferences, and even predict their future&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Earlier this month, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2025/02/investigations-announced-into-how-social-media-and-video-sharing-platforms-use-uk-children-s-personal-information/">announced</a> that it had begun investigating how TikTok, Reddit, and Imgur processed children’s data. Although the outcome of the investigations is yet to be made public, the privacy watchdog was examining whether TikTok’s use of children’s data leads to them being fed inappropriate or harmful&nbsp;content.</p><p>Separate inquiries are being conducted to determine the validity of Imgur and Reddit’s practices regarding the use of UK children’s personal data for age verification purposes.</p><p>“We welcome the technology and innovation that companies like social media bring to the UK and want them to thrive in our economy. But this cannot be at the expense of children’s privacy,” John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner said.</p><p>In 2023, TikTok was slammed with a £12.7M <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/04/ico-fines-tiktok-127-million-for-misusing-children-s-data/">fine</a> by the ICO for illegally using children’s data, including allowing 1.4M UK kids under 13 onto the platform in 2020. Meanwhile, over 42% of UK parents feel helpless when it comes to social media and video platforms collecting their kids’ data, according to a new ICO&nbsp;study.</p><p>In conclusion, the digital landscape is not inherently harmful, but the current practices of Big Tech companies are creating a dangerous environment for children. It’s time to demand transparency, accountability, and a fundamental shift in how these companies prioritize the well-being of our&nbsp;kids.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

  Partnering with Kela: Modern Defense for Israel and Western Allies  <p>Four veterans of elite intelligence units, including the former General Manager of Palantir Israel, are building an innovative new defense prime, starting with border protection. Their vision is to leverage Israel’s unique cadre of “technowarriors” to help defend the Western world order.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/dean-meyer/">Dean Meyer</a>, and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/shaun-maguire/">Shaun Maguire</a>	 



Published March 17, 2025
  



Team Kela and Team Sequoia, together in Tel Aviv.



 
<p>Israel is unusual in the West: It still has a draft. At the end of high school, instead of applying to colleges, students make bids to join elite units in the military. From the paratroopers to the combat divisions to the elite intelligence group Unit 8200, competition to get the best assignments is fierce.</p>



<p>Israel’s startup ecosystem has thrived by leveraging this talent to build tremendous businesses: post-draft, the country’s “technowarriors” staff many of its most successful tech companies. Veterans of 8200 and other units founded Sequoia portfolio companies Wiz, Island, Cyera, Eon and Decart, among others—and today, about <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-01-18/ty-article/half-of-global-cybersecurity-investment-has-been-in-israel-pm-bennett-says/0000017f-e3f8-d38f-a57f-e7fa23050000">half</a> of global cybersecurity investment goes into Israeli companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.kelasys.com/">Kela’s</a> mission is to redeploy this technowarrior talent back into the defense sector. The vision is two-fold: in the short term, to upgrade Israel’s internal defense capabilities. The company’s initial focus is border protection, an urgent priority post-October 7th. In the long term, the ambition is to convert Israel into a defense tech hub for Western militaries—a source of strategic advantage for NATO and the U.S. as they seek to deter their adversaries.</p>



<p>As conflicts become more tech-native—we have seen previews of this in Ukraine—the Israeli skillset is becoming increasingly important for the Pentagon and for NATO countries. Cyberwarfare, AI, autonomous systems, jamming and counter-jamming techniques, and GPS-denied navigation are just a few of the ways modern defense is becoming technologically sophisticated. Historically, a nation’s industrial might determined its military power. If technology begins to play a co-equal role, then Israel should evolve an even more critical role in defending the Western alliance: as a major exporter of advanced defense technology.</p>



<p>Kela’s founders share a deep expertise in military intelligence. Alon Dror graduated from Israel’s highly selective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program">Talpiot program</a>, which accepts only 25 to 60 cadets per year. After Talpiot, he served as a Tank Platoon Commander and in MAFAT, Israel’s R&amp;D directorate, where he won the Israel Defense Prize. Hamutal Meridor served in Unit 8200 before entering the private sector, where she was General Manager for Palantir’s Israel business. Alon and Hamutal share highly complementary skillsets: Alon is a mission-oriented R&amp;D leader and Hamutal is a business-oriented strategist. Both see Kela as their life’s work.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia had independently formed a thesis around Israeli defense tech, and were primed on this idea when we re-connected with Alon and Hamutal, both of whom we had pre-existing relationships with, during a trip to Israel in April 2024. We were so invigorated by the team’s plans that we extended a breakfast meeting into a full-day conversation. We also traveled to Jerusalem to meet Jason Manne, the company’s third co-founder and an algorithms team leader (Major) in an elite combat-focused R&amp;D unit. Jason was accurately described to us as “the guy you come to when you need something built in two days that usually takes two months.” We were privileged to lead Kela’s $10M seed round shortly thereafter.</p>



<p>The final dominos fell into place over the summer: Omer Bar-Ilan, a technical genius known for his work on Israel’s Iron Dome, joined as Kela’s fourth co-founder. We also partnered with Lux Capital’s Brandon Reeves and Josh Wolfe, who led the company’s Series A and brought on a fantastic angel coalition. The former deputy commander of Unit 8200 was an early advisor to Kela, and numerous retired generals helped to hone the vision and value proposition.</p>



<p>Since its founding, the Kela team has been relentlessly focused on product R&amp;D. Kela’s product is an open architecture platform to integrate sensor data for defense. The company aims to leverage existing commercially available and military-grade technology. It does this by 1) militarizing existing commercial technology (e.g., drones), 2) integrating disparate military technology systems (e.g., specialized sensors), 3) delivering these capabilities to personnel through a single, easy-to-use command center interface and 4) embedding advanced intelligence and AI.</p>



<p>Seven months into building, Kela’s product is now live in the field with multiple active projects. The team’s speed has been a critical differentiator, allowing Kela to achieve in days what legacy companies might require weeks, months, or even years to accomplish. This has earned it early plaudits from both generals and soldiers, who value Kela’s deep understanding of their mission, the company’s technological rigor, and the team’s quick, seamless execution.</p>



<p>With strong demand in Israel and early market pull from American and NATO customers, Kela is now scaling up. The company has recruited 20 elite individuals, each of whom is standalone brilliant, and who collectively have become a force to be reckoned with. We are excited to announce our new venture to the world. Calling on all technowarriors—come <a href="https://kelasys.com/#positions">join</a> us!</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-establishes-swiss-foundation/">The newly established Panther Protocol Foundation, based in Switzerland</a>, will launch a Limited Mainnet Beta before the end of the month on Polygon Network. Closely resembling Panther’s intended mainnet setup, the beta test will operate as a fully self-contained environment using real assets. The beta will serve as a final phase of testing, ensuring functionality and collecting valuable feedback leading up to Panther’s full mainnet launch. This will be the foundation’s first action taken as owner of the Panther codebase.&nbsp;</p> Why a Limited Mainnet Beta? <p>Panther’s beta will be a controlled, self-contained production environment in which features are tested with a limited group of users before full deployment. Unlike traditional testnets, the beta test will use real assets. This will allow the Foundation to fine-tune functionality using actual user interactions and real-world conditions, creating a seamless experience when Panther’s full mainnet launches.</p> Zone Manager <p>Panther Protocol’s Shielded Pool will be divided into Zones, each managed by a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/zone-manager?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zone Manager</a>, a licensed operator who will oversee user access and compliance. For the beta test, Eurobit, a Spanish crypto exchange and licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP), will be the Zone Manager. Separately, the Panther Protocol Foundation had previously <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/09/2993959/0/en/Panther-Protocol-and-Eurobit-Partner-to-Pioneer-Compliant-and-Confidential-DeFi.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">announced</a> that it would work with Eurobit to support its application to become a Zone Manager for Panther’s mainnet.</p> Preparations underway <p>The <a href="https://github.com/pantherfoundation/trusted-setup-ceremony?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">trusted setup ceremony</a> required for the Limited Mainnet Beta has been successfully completed. The process involved having members from the tech team, Panther Foundation, Purefi (compliance partner), Eurobit and the Panther community contributing sequentially, each adding cryptographic randomness to generate the final parameters securely. This ensures the integrity and security of Panther Protocol's Zero-Knowledge circuits ahead of the beta.</p> What’s Next? <p>In the coming days, Panther will release more details about the exact timing of the Beta network, including how users can participate, potential rewards, the sign-up process, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay informed by following Panther on<a href="https://twitter.com/PantherProtocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> </a><a href="http://x.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">X</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord </a>and <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>. </p>

Market Pulse   Masternode Count: The PIVX network experienced a decrease in active masternodes, dropping from 2,058 last week to the current count of 1,975.

This resulted in a weekly average of $0.16, a decrease from the previous week’s average of $0.175. In general, PIV has continued to trade within a relatively narrow range, indicating sideways movement, while facing increased selling pressure amid the general market downturn.    Trading Buzz: The total Weekly Trading Volume was approximately $14.75 million, a decrease from the $15.5 million recorded last week.

<p>The internet has become an indispensable part of our daily lives, facilitating everything from work and education to social interaction. This pervasive connectivity, however, amplifies the potential for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities across our growing array of online accounts and&nbsp;devices.</p><p>Here are a few five safety tips to help you protect your privacy&nbsp;online.</p> 1. Create Strong Passwords <p>With virtually every website wanting you to create an account, your passwords are the first line of defence against unauthorized access. Creating strong and unique passwords for each online service is fundamental to maintaining your&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Not all accounts require maximum security. Protect your most sensitive logins, like email and banking, with unique, robust passwords. For lower-risk sites, a shared, strong password offers a practical balance.</p><p>A strong password should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays, names of family members, or common words. Instead, consider using passphrases — longer combinations of words that are easier for you to remember but difficult for others to&nbsp;guess.</p><p>Additionally, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification beyond your password, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an authentication app.</p> 2. Don’t Overshare <p>I bet you know someone who lives out their entire lives on social media. From eating out at a famous restaurant to bungee jumping, leaving college, and even taking a dump, the urge to share every aspect of our lives can lead to overexposure, jeopardizing our personal security.</p><p>Exposing too much personal information — location, birthday, hometown, even seemingly innocuous details — creates a digital footprint that can be exploited.</p><p>Take control of your privacy by meticulously reviewing and adjusting your social media settings. Understand who can see your posts, and exercise restraint when divulging sensitive data. Remember, the online world retains information indefinitely, and what feels transient today may have lasting consequences tomorrow.</p> 3. Secure Your Browsing&nbsp;Habits <p>Ever wonder why those sneakers you browsed suddenly follow you across the web? It’s not magic, it’s tracking. Platforms use algorithms to analyze your browsing history and target you with&nbsp;ads.</p><p>Your browsing activity reveals significant information about your interests, shopping habits, health concerns, and more. Taking steps to secure your browsing can substantially improve your&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Consider using privacy-focused browsers that block trackers by default. Extensions like privacy badgers, ad blockers, and cookie managers can provide additional control over what information websites collect about you. Regularly clear your browsing history, cookies, and cached data to minimize the digital trail you leave&nbsp;behind.</p><p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) encrypt your internet connection and hide your IP address, preventing your internet service provider and potential eavesdroppers from seeing what websites you visit. When choosing a VPN, research reputable providers that have clear privacy policies and don’t log your activities.</p><p>Private browsing modes (such as Incognito in Chrome or Private Browsing in Firefox) offer limited privacy by not saving your browsing history locally, but they don’t prevent tracking by websites or your internet service provider. Use them as one tool in your privacy toolkit, not as a complete solution.</p> 4. Free Wi-Fi? Think&nbsp;Twice <p>Public Wi-Fi networks, often found in cafes, airports, and other public spaces, typically lack robust security protocols. This creates a vulnerable environment where malicious actors can easily intercept your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Imagine conducting online shopping, entering your credit card details, or accessing sensitive financial information while on such a network. Without adequate encryption, your activity becomes an open book, easily accessible to anyone with the right&nbsp;tools.</p><p>To protect your financial and personal data, exercise extreme caution when using free public Wi-Fi. It’s best to postpone sensitive transactions until you are connected to a secure, password-protected network, such as your home Wi-Fi or a trusted mobile&nbsp;hotspot.</p> 5. Verify Before You&nbsp;Click <p>You probably received an email from a distressed Nigerian prince — I am from Nigeria, by the way. This is a classic example of phishing. Cybercriminals excel at deception, crafting phishing scams to mimic legitimate communications from trusted entities like banks and utility companies.</p><p>These fraudulent emails often contain malicious links or attachments, posing a significant threat to your security.</p><p>Be vigilant for telltale signs of phishing, such as spelling errors, unusual sender email addresses, or requests for sensitive information. By recognizing these red flags, you can protect yourself from falling victim to these insidious attacks.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>In this episode, Matt Prewitt sits down with Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s Cyber Ambassador-at-large and 1st Digital Minister, as well as the star of the new short documentary Good Enough Ancestor. It is a fascinating conversation exploring the profound intersections of technology, spirituality, and democracy.&nbsp;<br><br>Topics they cover include:&nbsp;</p>  Daoism and spiritual practice – and their favorite Leonard Cohen lyrics.  “Laser blended vision” as a metaphor for democracy – integrating different perspectives into a coherent whole.  “High-bandwidth, low-latency” democracy – allowing for real-time collaboration.  January 6 vs. Taiwan’s Sunflower Movement – contrasting two parliamentary occupations.  Marshall McLuhan’s “hot and cool media” – and what it means for how we should build and use AI.  The role of education in democracy – and how spirituality’s place in learning differs between the East and West.  AI’s moral tradition gap – why today’s models lack cultural and ethical grounding.  Trade, sovereignty, and democracy – how to balance open societies with national autonomy.  RadicalxChange – how the movement is like “conservative anarchism” and Daoism in transcending left-right divides.  <p>Watch Good Enough Ancestor at<a href="https://www.combinationsmag.com/good-enough-ancestor/"> combinationsmag.com/good-enough-ancestor</a>.</p><p><br>Bios:<br><br>Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s Cyber Ambassador-at-large and 1st Digital Minister (2016-2024), is celebrated for her pioneering efforts in digital freedom. Named one of TIME’s “100 Most Influential People in AI” in 2023, Tang was instrumental in shaping Taiwan’s internationally acclaimed COVID-19 response and in safeguarding the 2024 presidential and legislative elections from foreign cyber interference. Tang is now focused on broadening her vision of Plurality — technology for collaborative diversity — to inspire global audiences.<br><br>As the first nonbinary cabinet member globally, Tang identifies as “post-gender” and is comfortable with any pronouns. She is a respected community leader and a founding contributor to g0v, an initiative promoting transparency by making information about Taiwan’s economy, history, politics, and culture accessible.</p><p>Tang has been key in developing participation platforms such as Join.gov.tw, leading to practical improvements like enhanced access to tax software and revised cancer treatment regulations. A “conservative anarchist,” Tang is dedicated to boosting digital competence and safeguarding information integrity online through collective intelligence.</p><p>A child prodigy, Tang excelled in advanced mathematics by age six and computer programming by age eight. By 19, she had held significant positions in software companies and worked as an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. Growing up in a large family following Christian and Taoist traditions, Tang embraced pluralism and the internet’s potential to connect people based on shared interests rather than geography, fueling her drive for global impact.</p><p>In Taiwan, Tang’s generation has always intertwined politics with the internet, striving for a more transparent and inclusive society. Despite Taiwan’s martial law history, Tang and her fellow civic technologists have achieved internationally acclaimed progress toward greater governmental transparency.</p><p>During the 2014 Sunflower Movement, Tang played a crucial role in livestreaming protests against a trade agreement with Beijing, facilitating real-time communication that led to more peaceful negotiations and the movement’s success.</p><p>“Democracy can evolve.” Tang says. “We can create innovative policies by simply asking the people, ‘What should we do together?’”</p><p>There is also promising news behind Tang’s grand plan: more than half the world’s population – over 4 billion people – are holding elections in 2024. That’s over 70 countries.</p><p>Says Tang, “I want to be a good enough ancestor for future generations.”</p><p>Audrey’s Social Links:&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://x.com/audreyt">⿻ Audrey Tang 唐鳳 (@audreyt) / X</a>  <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/audreyt.org">⿻ Audrey Tang 唐鳳 (@audreyt.org) — Bluesky</a>  <a href="https://www.threads.net/@digitalminister.one">唐鳳Audrey Tang (@digitalminister.one) • Threads, Say more</a>  <a href="https://www.plurality.net/">Plurality.net</a>&nbsp;  <p>Matt Prewitt (he/him) is a lawyer, technologist, and writer.

<p>Bitcoin’s security and reliability as a store of value are undeniable. However, its liquidity remained untapped for too long due to a lack of trustless bridges and native smart contract capabilities. As BTC is only native to Bitcoin’s L1, any attempt to include it in DeFi relies on the trust assumptions of third party custodians that wrap it. Build On Bitcoin (BOB) aims to expand Bitcoin’s functionality by integrating it with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. BOB operates as an OP Stack L2 with a hybrid design incorporating ZKPs, Bitcoin staking, and Ethereum for data availability. By functioning as a rollup, BOB processes transactions off-chain and batches them for settlement on Bitcoin and Ethereum, significantly improving transaction speed and reducing costs compared to Bitcoin’s base layer.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Alexei’s background  Setbacks for Bitcoin DeFi  Bitcoin bridges  BitVM  BOB operators and trust assumptions  BOB architecture &amp; Bitcoin staking  Bitcoin LSTs  The future of Bitcoin DeFi  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/alexeiZamyatin">Alexei Zamyatin on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/build_on_bob">Build on Bitcoin on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

  Partnering with Reflection: Toward Superintelligence, with Autonomous Coding  <p>Misha, Ioannis and their team are building the AI dream: superintelligent agents capable of doing knowledge work, starting with autonomous coding.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/">Stephanie Zhan</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a>	 



Published March 7, 2025
  



Reflection co-founders Misha Laskin and Ioannis Antonoglou.



 
<p>“It’s not a human move. I’ve never seen a human play this move … so beautiful.”</p>



<p>That was Go champion Fan Hui’s reaction to Move 37—a moment that left the world in awe. It was the move that defined the 2016 showdown between Go legend Lee Sedol and DeepMind’s AI agent, AlphaGo. In that historic match, AlphaGo dominated, winning four out of five games, marking a pivotal milestone for artificial intelligence: that AI could reach superhuman levels of capability.</p>



<p>Ioannis Antonoglou, Reflection’s cofounder and Deepmind founding engineer behind AlphaGo, recalls the moment vividly: “Move 37 was spectacular … a brilliant, unconventional move that showed the system had a deep understanding of the game. It had creativity. It could think of things that people hadn’t thought of before.”</p>



<p>Ioannis continued pushing the frontier. He extended AlphaGo’s capabilities with AlphaZero—an AI that learned entirely from self-play, mastering the game without human guidance. Then, he led the development of MuZero, an even greater breakthrough: an AI that conquered Go, chess, Shogi, Atari and more—all without even being told the rules of the game.</p>



<p>These weren’t just incremental advances. They were seismic shifts in AI that showcased the significance of reinforcement learning in building superhuman agentic systems. Even today, AlphaGo, AlphaZero and MuZero remain amongst the most powerful AI agents ever created.</p>



 From AlphaGo to Reflection AI 



<p>At DeepMind, Ioannis went on to play a key leadership role in post-training efforts for Gemini, where he met Reflection cofounder Misha Laskin, who was leading reward model development. Together, they continued to push the boundaries of two of the most critical fields in AI: reinforcement learning and large language models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their shared vision for superintelligence, and their elite domain expertise in building both the most capable agents and the most powerful LLMs, led to the birth of <a href="https://www.reflection.ai/">Reflection AI</a>.</p>



<p>The vision of Reflection is to build superintelligent agents to conduct all knowledge work. Crucially, Reflection is built on two core beliefs:</p>



 
 That autonomous coding is a crucial step toward superintelligence. 



 That real-world evaluations—not just benchmarks—matter most. 
 



<p>The company’s first focus? Building autonomous coding agents.&nbsp;</p>



 Autonomous coding agents 



<p>We’ve seen the incredible benefit of coding assistants in enabling developers to work with 10x speed and productivity. In parallel to this, we believe that the next leap forward is autonomous coding agents that handle workloads autonomously.</p>



<p>Reflection’s autonomous coding agents integrate directly into an organization’s codebase and engineering workflows, and autonomously tackle well-scoped engineering tasks entirely end-to-end. They read, write, test and deploy code, handling all the infrastructure on your behalf, relieving the burden of entire engineering workloads from developers and teams.</p>



<p>The reality is, rather than writing new code, most engineers spend the majority of their time buried in refactoring, debugging and fixing bugs; code reviews, standups and sprint planning; updating documentation and learning new tools, languages and frameworks; and managing infrastructure, devops and testing. Reflection’s autonomous coding agents start with these sets of tasks: important, yet tedious, time-consuming work that often sits in an engineering team’s backlog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crucially, Reflection is centered on reliability. To start, Reflection’s agents are not all-encompassing software engineers. Rather, they are agents that engineering teams and leaders design to handle specific sets of tasks and workloads, with trusted performance:</p>



 
 Refactor legacy code safely, without breaking dependencies 



 Generate and run test cases automatically 



 Optimize memory usage across pull requests 



 Find and fix security vulnerabilities before they cause problems&nbsp; 



 And more! 
 



<p>As the team advances model intelligence to increase its scope of capabilities, Reflection’s agents take on more responsibilities. Imagine autonomous coding agents working tirelessly in the background, handling workloads that slow teams down. These agents understand your entire codebase, no matter how large or complex. They execute autonomously: planning, writing, testing and deploying code independently. They work continuously, spotting and solving problems proactively, and they improve over time, learning from real-world use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are superintelligent coding agents, deployable instantly and in parallel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a fundamental shift in how software is built and maintained. It’s one massive leap towards a future where developers become directors of autonomous coding agents who build and maintain code on our behalf … and long term, a future where we all become directors of superintelligent agents that conduct knowledge work on our behalf.</p>



 The elite team building this future 



<p>In just one year, Reflection has assembled a world-class team—made up of the very researchers and engineers who pioneered some of AI’s greatest breakthroughs:</p>



 
 Deep Q Networks, AlphaGo, AlphaZero and MuZero—landmark achievements in reinforcement learning. 



 PaLM, Character AI, ChatGPT and Gemini—cutting-edge advances in large language models. 
 



<p>But what makes Reflection truly unique isn’t just its elite technical expertise—it’s the tight integration of research and product, combined with a customer-first approach to AI development.</p>



<p>They’re not just building frontier intelligence; they’re building the future of AI-driven software engineering with real-world impact.</p>



 



 Join us 



<p>Legendary companies are built on solving the most ambitious problems of our lifetime. As CEO Misha puts it:</p>



<p>“We’re working on the root node problem of our lifetime.”</p>



<p>Reflection AI is on a mission to achieve superintelligence, starting with autonomous coding agents that will redefine software development. We have deep conviction in their potential and are honored to have been their first and long-term partner in this journey.</p>



<p>On a personal note—working with Misha and Ioannis has been one of the greatest adventures of our lives.</p>



<p>We’re hiring world-class researchers, engineers and product builders in San Francisco, New York, London and Paris.</p>



<p>Come build the future with us!</p>

<p>Imagine a gifted student whose goal in life is to help people. Her path takes her to med school, and eventually to residency. She begins to see the patients she had always dreamed of helping. But instead of devoting her energy to their care—and to her life outside work—she finds herself buried in documentation and administrative tasks, spending hours charting over late nights and weekends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was the experience of Dr. Gabi Meckler, a family physician in Santa Rosa, California. She wasn’t alone. <a href="https://pnhp.org/news/physicians-spend-two-hours-on-ehrs-and-desk-work-for-every-hour-of-direct-patient-care/">Studies</a> show that for every one hour of patient interaction, clinicians devote two hours to documentation. Almost 50% of doctors reported symptoms of burnout in a <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/physician-health/physician-burnout-rate-drops-below-50-first-time-4-years">recent AMA survey</a>, and <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/physician-health/6-specialties-desire-step-away-or-scale-back-common">nearly one-third</a> are considering leaving the field altogether.</p>



<p>Dr. Meckler knew there had to be a better way—and so did her husband, Erez Druk, then an engineer at Facebook. Erez wanted to free his wife and other clinicians to spend less time on paperwork, so he and co-founder Andrey Bannikov designed a solution: <a href="https://www.getfreed.ai/">Freed</a>, an AI-powered clinician assistant. That solution quickly took off, growing in a product-led motion among small- and medium-sized independent practices around the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Freed completely transforms the daily lives of clinicians. During a patient visit, clinicians use Freed to transcribe audio and generate draft medical notes. They can quickly review and edit the output, and the platform learns as they go, adapting style and terminology for each user—including preferences for phrasing, template layouts and specific medical vocabulary. After the patient leaves, Freed charts the visit and integrates the record into the EHR system. Doctors get less after-hours paperwork, more time and attention for their patients—and more space in their lives. The reviews are glowing: “Thanks to Freed,” one doctor said, “I close my computer and I’m done for the day. My kids get all of me.” Another: “I can focus on what really matters—my patients.” In many ways, Freed is a love letter from Erez to his wife Gabi, giving her—and doctors like her—precious time back.</p>



<p>When we first met Erez and Andrey, we were impressed by their customer obsession and velocity. Erez does everything with 200% intensity. Learning the saxophone at the age of 10 led to a scholarship from the Berklee School of Music; at the Israel Institute of Technology’s prestigious Technion University, he was at the top of his class. After graduation, he joined the team at Facebook—where he and Andrey met on his first day on the job. Their shared passion for innovation led to a years-long partnership, and now to a shared mission to help clinicians and their patients.</p>



<p>Today Freed serves more than 17,000 providers in small- and medium-sized practices across nearly 100 specialties, from mental health to pediatrics, giving doctors peace of mind and hours of time for what matters most. We at Sequoia are proud to support Erez, Andrey and their <a href="https://www.getfreed.ai/careers">growing team</a> by leading their Series A.</p>

<p>The Zcash ecosystem is embarking on a new chapter, and with it comes both challenges and opportunities. As we navigate this transition, I want to take a moment to express gratitude, outline our immediate priorities, and share my approach to ensuring the Zcash Foundation (ZF) operates at the highest level possible throughout this process.</p>



 Thank You, Jack 



<p>First and foremost, I want to extend my sincere thanks to Jack for his four years of service to ZF and countless contributions to the Zcash ecosystem since inception. Leadership transitions are never easy, but Jack’s dedication to ZF and the broader Zcash ecosystem has left an indelible impact that will ensure ZF’s momentum continues as we move forward.</p>



 Appreciation for the ZF Team and Ecosystem Partners 



<p>Also, I am incredibly grateful for the ZF engineers who continue to push forward each day, solving complex challenges and keeping Zcash at the cutting edge of privacy technology. Your expertise and dedication are critical to the success of Zcash, and I deeply appreciate your work.</p>



<p>Beyond ZF, I want to recognize the contributions of other key engineering teams and community organizations in the ecosystem. Zcash’s success relies on collaboration, and the work happening across the broader network of contributors is invaluable. Thank you ECC, Shielded Labs, ZCG, grantees, Zcash communities around the world, and individual contributors for your efforts in making privacy-preserving financial tools a reality.</p>



 My Role and Priorities as Interim Executive Director and COO 



<p>As Interim Executive Director and COO, my primary focus is ensuring that ZF operates smoothly and effectively during this transition period. With the support of the ZF board, I am committed to providing the resources and structure needed for the team to continue their important work without disruption.</p>



<p>One of the most critical tasks ahead is co-leading a strategic planning process with the ZF board. Before we can recruit a new Executive Director, we need to clearly define what skills and experience are required to lead ZF into the future. This process will be collaborative, thoughtful, and designed to ensure the best possible outcome for ZF and the Zcash community.</p>



<p>Additionally, the board seat vacated by Jack will remain open until the new Executive Director is in place, ensuring that the future leadership of ZF is properly aligned with the organization’s long-term vision.</p>



<p>During this interim period I will continue to provide transactional support to ZCG and ZecHub via FPF and I will no longer hold a leadership role within the organization. As of March 1st, the FPF board of directors is solely responsible for all future-focused decision making and strategic planning to ensure there is no conflict of interest across my roles.</p>



 My Approach: Coordination, Communication, and Execution 



<p>I strongly believe that Zcash does not have the time or resources to waste on inefficiencies or misalignment. My approach to leadership during this period is guided by three key principles:</p>



<p></p>



 
 Coordination – We need to maximize the impact of our efforts across the Zcash ecosystem. That means avoiding duplication of work, streamlining decision-making, and ensuring that every resource is used as effectively as possible. 



 Improving Communication – Both within ZF and across the broader Zcash community, communication must improve. ZF will be taking a closer look at how we share information and coordinate efforts, making necessary adjustments to ensure clarity, timeliness, and a cooperative approach to tackling challenges, both new and longstanding. 



 Execution – If you’ve worked with me over the past three-plus years, you know that I take a “get shit done” approach to everything I do. This transition period is no exception. We will move forward with focus, ensuring that ZF remains a strong, reliable, and effective organization. 
 



 



<p>While transitions like this inevitably come with uncertainty, I am committed to ensuring that ZF not only remains stable but continues to move forward with clarity and purpose. We are not here to dwell on the past—we are here to build the future.</p>



<p>To everyone in the Zcash community: I appreciate your work, your effort, and your commitment to our shared mission. Let’s move forward together.</p>



<p>—Alex Bornstein, Interim Executive Director</p>

<p>My first involvement in Zcash was nearly ten years ago. At the time, Zooko was trying to raise funding to build Zcash, and I gave him some feedback on his investor pitch. We stayed in contact, and I became an advisor to the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company (as ECC was then known). About a month before Zcash launched, I joined the ECC team full-time, and so I was there when we launched Zcash from the kitchen of an Airbnb in the Bay Area, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/business/dealbook/zcash-a-harder-to-trace-virtual-currency-generates-price-frenzy.html"></a>The New York Times’ coverage of the Zcash launch



<p>For the next four years at ECC, and then for another four years at the Zcash Foundation, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside some of the smartest and most dedicated people I’ve ever met. In that time, I’ve watched the Zcash ecosystem grow and become decentralised. As well as ECC and the Foundation, we now have QEDIT, Shielded Labs, the Financial Privacy Foundation, ZecHub, ZingoLabs, and a bunch of other teams that are funded by the Zcash Community Grants program, all of whom contribute to or support the Zcash mission in a variety of ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Zcash ecosystem and community grows and evolves, so must the institutions that steward and support it, and that is especially true of the Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Executive Director, it has been my responsibility and privilege to serve the Zcash Foundation team, the Zcash community, and the Zcash mission for the past four years. One of my responsibilities as ED is to recognise when the time is right to step aside, to allow someone else to take the helm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe that time has come, and so I am stepping down from the role of Executive Director of the Zcash Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alex Bornstein is taking over as interim ED. Alex is eminently qualified, with prior experience as ED of a 501(c)(3), and nearly four years as ZF’s COO. In that role, he has ably supported and advised me, and I look forward to returning the favour while the ZF Board begins the process of recruiting a permanent ED who will lead ZF through the coming evolution of its role.</p>



<p>I want to thank the Zcash Foundation team and Board members — past and present — for granting me their trust, support and patience over the past four years.&nbsp;I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work full-time on a project that aligns as strongly with my principles as Zcash does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To preempt any speculation or rumours: I am not leaving to take up another role, and there is no rancour or disagreement between the ZF Board and me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will continue to support the Zcash Foundation in any way I can, and I will continue to support and contribute to the broader Zcash mission as a community member.</p>

Intellectual Property Transfer—In the coming days, ownership of Panther’s codebase will be transferred from Panther Ventures Limited (PVL) to the new foundation.  Asset Consolidation – Resources from the Gibraltar-based foundation will be merged into the newly established Swiss entity.  Canary Network—Amongst the Foundation’s earliest priorities is the launching of Panther’s inaugural Canary Network, introducing real tokens to Panther’s platform for the first time. The Canary Network will provide valuable test results and insights under real-world conditions.  Leadership Appointments—Panther welcomes Reuben Yap and John Marshall as council members.

<p>In the digital networked age, people’s attention often overlooks local problems in favour of global ones, which don’t necessarily impact them in their daily lives, or over which they don’t have a say due to the skewed Pareto distribution of power in modern day societies. Puja Ohlhaver, in her recent research paper ‘Community currencies’, proposes a dual-currency model that prices attention and influence in each community, with the ultimate goal of creating a Gaussian distribution of power, either locally, or globally through the dynamic interaction of multiple local communities. This model allows community members to stake their currency to earn non-transferable governance rights, creating a substrate for decentralised societal coordination that favours social innovation.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Puja’s background  Web3 research  ‘Community currencies’  Pareto vs. Gaussian distributions  Global vs. local power distributions  The community currencies model  Meritocracy vs. influence  Quadratic funding  Governance, bribery and the crisis of legitimacy  Experimenting with community currencies  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/pujaohlhaver">Puja Ohlhaver on X</a>  <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5136037">'Community Currencies' Research Paper</a>  <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">'Decentralized Society' Research Paper</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Last year we launched Brave Search Ads in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Today we share an update on our rapidly growing advertising business on Brave’s independent and privacy-preserving search engine, and preview our plans for expansion in the coming year.</p>
<p>From January to December of 2024, Brave grew search advertising clicks by 15x alongside organic search query growth of 80% (656 million in January to 1.19 billion in December). This initial customer success is the result of targeting the top 1% of paid search advertisers in our primary target regions. These are brands that are hitting the limit of efficiency with Google Ads, and who see Brave Search as a means to unlock additional reach. In most cases, the added conversion volume is in line with Brave’s market share in the region, but in some cases brands see as high as 5% growth on total paid search spend while maintaining their target rate for return on ad spend (ROAS).</p>
<p>Today, over half of the top 20 largest paid search advertisers worldwide are customers of Brave Search Ads, including Amazon Ads Sponsored Products, B&amp;H Photo, Booking.com, CompareCredit, Nerdwallet, Stubhub, and Wayfair. Partnering with these leaders in paid search has been of tremendous value to the development of Brave Search Ads. With their help, we’re discovering new ways to achieve scale and improve the effectiveness of our advertising platform.</p>
<p>Our customers have been overwhelmingly supportive of our entry into the paid search market. Brands unanimously agree there should be more competition. At 90% of market share, Google wields pricing power that their customers have no choice but to accept. Our customers know that by buying on Brave Search, they are contributing directly to the development of a more competitive and fair search advertising market, and reaching engaged users and tech early-adopters who value privacy and independence. Importantly, first-movers on Brave Search Ads have benefited from category exclusivity in what is otherwise a highly saturated market, giving them an edge over competitors who exclusively buy Google Ads.</p>
<p>Overall, Brave Search advertisers are extremely satisfied with their experience; 9 out of 10 customers who started Brave Search Ads campaigns in 2024 have continued to advertise in consecutive months.&nbsp;</p>

 What’s driving success at Brave 
<p>The two key forces behind our success in 2024 were the continued growth of the Brave browser (where in most regions Brave Search is the default), and the effectiveness of search engine advertising for all kinds of businesses.</p>
<p>Brave browser and Brave Search are growing at a sustained pace each month. In January, the Brave browser counted 80 million active users worldwide, and 1.29 billion Brave Search queries. The latest numbers are <a href="https://x.com/BrendanEich/status/1886617512353390979">shared regularly to the public by our CEO Brendan Eich</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Search advertising is a well-established market where ads help users find products they show clear intent for with their search keywords. Advertisers on Brave Search are seeing available keyword volume passively increase each month, with conversion rates remaining steady at 100, 1,000 or 10,000 monthly clicks. Brave Search has achieved a predictable and gradually-growing stream of new Web traffic, and thus conversion volume for advertisers. For the first time since Bing, there’s an independent search engine with high-quality search results that convert customers as well as or better than Google Ads.</p>
<p>While the formula itself is simple—a growing search engine plus good ads equals more advertisers—Brave Search didn’t appear overnight. The project began nearly two decades ago <a>with Cliqz, which became Brave Search</a> with a 2021 acquisition, and that tremendous effort is now bearing fruit. We’re very optimistic for the future given Brave Search’s global growth as well as its new features that make it hugely popular with users, such as <a>Answer with AI</a>, the answer engine with an integrated chatbot, and <a>ReRank</a>, which enables users to customize their search rankings.</p>

 About Brave and Search Ads 
<p>Brave builds a suite of tools—starting with the Brave browser and Brave Search—that give people better choices online with leading privacy and security protections, independence from Big Tech, tools to reduce distractions, and access to innovative features like generative AI.</p>
<p>Search Ads are sponsored results on the Brave Search results page. They are currently available to select advertisers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, and Germany.

 通过迁移到Base,Horizen立即与高度活跃的DeFi和dApp生态系统连接,为$ZEN提供了更大的实用性和可访问性。    <p>该提案的目的是增强Horizen的Base设施,采用潜力和生态系统范围,同时保持其隐私和零知识（ZK）创新重点，迁移到Base的主要好处包括:</p>  <p>前所未有的可扩展性和低费用</p>  Base利用了Optimism的OP Stack,并计划将交易速度缩减到1秒以下的最终结果,而成本低于1美分—是ZK驱动的应用程序的理想选择，    <p>开发人员成长与CoinBase支持</p>  Base提供了蓬勃发展的开发人员社区,丰富的流动性和强大的营销支持,使Horizen具有竞争优势。    <p>机构级安全与信任</p>  作为Coinbase支持的网络,Base增强了ZEN的机构信誉,巩固了其在Grayscale和Coinbase生态系统中的地位,并保持了$ZEN持有人的合规优势。    <p>未来证明和更大的网络效应</p>  预计2025年将有100个+应用在Base上使用,Horizen可以早期采用,更深的流动性和更大的互操作性。    <p>在可扩展的生态系统中增强隐私</p>  Horizen将可扩展性与先进的隐私创新相结合,将保护隐私的技术带入了Superchain。    <p>优化的ZK集成</p>  Base灵活的模块化架构使Horizen可以利用现有的汇总Base架构,同时专注于ZK创新的开拓性。    <p>跨链互操作性</p>  Base强大的桥接功能可促进与其他L2和L1的互操作性,从而扩展了$ZEN的范围和可组合性。    <p>成本效率</p>  与维护独立的基于基板的链相比,Base已建立的Base架构降低了开发成本。      为什么要搬到Base-为什么现在呢？ <p>迁移到Base的建议不仅是技术上的转变,而且是使ZEN的采用,实用性和长期价值最大化的战略举措，</p><p>一年前,此举是不可能的-但今天,区块链景观发生了重大变化:</p>  <p>Base已发展成为一个繁荣的生态系统,超过了TVL和开发人员参与度的主要竞争对手，</p>  <p>第3层解决方案已成为改变游戏规则的缩放模型,可实现超低成本交易和更大的灵活性，</p>  <p>Horizen Labs在L2 / L3生态系统方面获得了第一手经验,有助于将Base确定为Horizen未来的最佳选择，</p>  <p>通过迁移到Base,Horizen可以与Coinbase支持的快速扩展的网络保持一致,同时保留其利用零知识证明实现可信赖的数字未来的愿景。</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  最终思想:视野的确定时刻 <p>此举的目的是巩固Horizen在隐私和可伸缩性方面的领导地位,确保我们保持竞争力,创新性并深入以太坊生态系统。</p><p>Horizen一直致力于为未来建设,这一过渡标志着朝着实现我们的使命迈出大胆而必要的一步。</p><p>保持联系并加入对话:</p>  <p><a
