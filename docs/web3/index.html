<p>The proposal would give far more Web3 users access to Findora’s privacy&nbsp;network.</p><p>The new proposal on Synapse offers to deploy a bridge to the Findora Network. If passed, Findora would become the first privacy-focused chain on Synapse and gain exposure to many new communities.</p> TL;DR <p>❗️Between October 26th and October 29th, Synapse Bridge will vote to integrate the Findora&nbsp;Network.</p><p>❗️Synapse is a major cross-chain bridge linking over 16 ecosystems, exposing Findora to new communities.</p><p>❗️If the proposal passes, the Findora Foundation and Synapse will create high-yield liquidity pools to promote $FRA, $SYN, and $nUSD, Synapse’s stablecoin.</p><p>A cross-chain bridge featuring a DEX and liquidity pools, Synapse connects over 16 EVM and non-EVM chains, including Arbitrum, Fantom, Avalanche, Cronos, BNB Chain, and Polygon. Synapse is a battle-tested project that has handled over $11.45 billion in total bridge transfers. It currently stands at #14 by TVL on Avalanche and #17 on Polygon, according to <a href="https://defillama.com/">DefiLlama</a>.</p> Mutual Benefits <p>The proposal holds many potential benefits for Findora and&nbsp;Synapse.</p><p>For Findora, users on the 16+ ecosystems integrated into Synapse could access Findora and its $FRA tokens with ease, allowing users to exchange their assets for $FRA and experiment with Findora’s confidential transaction functions.</p><p>As an example, users on Arbitrum or Fantom could quickly swap nUSD (Synapse’s stablecoin) for FRA to pay gas fees or for staking. Currently, users can only transfer assets from Ethereum and BNB Chain using the <a href="https://rialtobridge.io/">Rialto Bridge</a>. By promoting new tokens like $FRA in their <a href="https://synapseprotocol.com/pools">Pools</a> section, Synapse would make it easier to discover Findora, helping it attract more&nbsp;users.</p><p>For Synapse, it will get to add a unique L1, the first in its network to be privacy-focused with extensive zero-knowledge cryptography research. High-yield pools featuring Synapse’s native token, $SYN, and nUSD tokens will be set up on <a href="https://fairyswap.finance/farms">FairySwap</a>, giving their users more options for yield&nbsp;farming.</p> Moving Forward <p>The voting will go live on October 27th, and stay open for three days. If the proposal passes, Synapse and the Findora Foundation will both contribute $13,000 to promote their respective $SYN and $FRA tokens through yield farming&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>On the Findora side, Synapse would contribute to FRA/nUSD and FRA/SYN liquidity pools on <a href="https://fairyswap.finance/farms">FairySwap</a>. Synapse would also promote a high-yield FRA liquidity pool on its platform.</p> About Synapse <p>Synapse Bridge is a secure cross-chain communication platform connecting over 16 different EVM and non-EVM blockchains. Employing an Optimistic security model, Synapse allows any arbitrary data to be exchanged between chains, including contract calls, NFTs, and snapshots.

<p>Ron Conway, a well-known American venture capitalist, once said ‘I think for technology and innovation we have to ignore politics.’</p>



<p>Technology is a clear driver for ingenuity and innovation. Politics, on the other hand, is where intrigue, personal agendas, and the pursuit of power by any means necessary conflate to create a turbulent sea of neverending strife. When the two cross over, results are not always good.</p>



<p>Technology has often been implicated in political scandals. In 1971, a Xerox machine became ground zero for the Pentagon Papers affair that would have grave repercussions for the Nixon Administration. (The scandal would, indirectly, contribute to Nixon’s resignation following Watergate.) In Russia, political technology is a euphemism for election rigging. And the 2016 US election was marred by allegations of foreign interference through social media platforms.</p>



<p>Besides, technological devices have also had a positive influence on politics. Data analytics enables political strategists to obtain more accurate information about voter behaviour. Through this, they can mount more effective political campaigns, for example.</p>



<p>Into the political stage now jump non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain. This article explores the potential applications of digital tokens in the political ecosphere, focusing on fundraising and exclusive NFT-led events.</p>



 Fundraising in the age of blockchain 



<p>Fundraising is a vital tool for any political party intending to become a serious contender in any democratic election. But the political spectrum is, few would deny, a murky pond teeming with shady operatives. Such often resort to morally questionable tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponents. And running deep beneath this darkened surface is a layer of political donors and lobbyists who stake absurd amounts of wealth to push their agenda forward. The so-called dark money is the engine that moves the levers of power. Transparency and accountability are anathemas to all this.</p>



<p>The solution to this issue is complex. Often, those involved in such fundraising schemes have little desire for any solution to be found. Preserving the status quo -and the cash flow- tends to override any moral concerns.</p>



<p>In August 2021, NFTs found their way into the political arena when Scott Jensen, a Republican gubernatorial candidate for Minnesota, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/01/candidate-for-minnesota-governor-releases-campaign-nfts/">issued a series of NFTs to support its campaign</a>.</p>



<p>Jensen released two NFTS, with a run of 25,000 each, and a price tag of $5 per NFT. The proceedings would support his campaign for Governor. By purchasing these items, the buyer would also get access to extra perks, such as meeting Jensen in person.</p>



<p>Democrats are not far behind in the NFT race. Early in October, a group of fundraisers for the Democratic party launched a series of politically-themed NFTs through Front Row, an NFT marketplace. The NFTs themselves were digital representations of people from the Texas Democratic Party. Specifically, the group of more than 50 Democratic lawmakers who had fled the State of Texas in an attempt to block a vote restriction bill put forward by the Republican party. Each NFT was priced at $250. The buyer would be considered a ‘donor’ to the party, with the actual platform -Front Row- taking a fee.</p>



<p>Both in Jensen and the Texas examples, there would be a price limitation of $5,800 to conform to existing campaign financing laws. (Political action committees -PACs- and party committees are not subject to the same guidelines, and that’s where ‘dark money’ reigns supreme.)</p>



<p>The use of NFTs turns these partisan fundraising efforts into interesting experiments. While limited in scope, they certainly offer a glimpse into what might become part of future political campaigns, both in the United States and elsewhere.</p>



 NFT-only political events, and beyond 



<p>Grassroots movements are essential to foment democratic principles in the community. These organisations promote participation, engagement, and inclusiveness, and help drive voter turnout. Members meet regularly in church halls, conference rooms in hotels, and even in pubs, to discuss current matters, etc.</p>



<p>A proposed use case for NFT in the political ambit is the celebration of ‘NFT-only’ conferences and other events. These could only be attended by members of any chapter of local or national grassroots groups who hold a scannable NFT. The tokens could unlock perks for the holder, such as meeting a particular speaker (such as the Jenssen NFTs), digital goodies, merchandise, etc. At the time of writing, there is no known political event adhering to this NFT-led initiative. Hence the 2022 VeeCon event will only be open to those who own a VeeFriend NFT.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In the grand scheme of things, NFTs remain a relatively nascent technology. They have only become a thing in 2021, in the wake of the now infamous Beeple NFT sale. Throughout this year, we have seen NFTs enter the popular lexicon and more and more mainstream commercial ventures dipping their toes into this fascinating Pandora’s Box. In 2022, American retail giant Macy’s auctioned off a range of NFTs based on its iconic Thanksgiving Day parade balloons. Comic book publisher Marvel has released several rounds of comic book-themed NFTs. This alone represents a constellation of possibilities.</p>



<p>NFTs for the political stage remain in a ‘try-before-you-buy’ phase, so to speak. But even though the road ahead remains somewhat hazy, the foundations for a larger NFT sphere of influence have been laid in politics and elsewhere.</p>

         Partnering with Evy: Product Protection You Can Trust            <p>Simon, Shana, Tanguy and their team are making product insurance plans effortless—for merchants and customers alike.</p>  <p>By Stephanie Zhan and George Robson</p><p>Published October 25, 2022</p>       



     
	 
		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>You replace your old cell phone with the latest and greatest model—and it falls on the floor and cracks. Or you buy a beautiful new couch—and spill red wine all over it. We’ve all experienced the frustration of seeing a purchase turn into a headache. The more you spent, the more anxiety-inducing those moments can be—even if the seller is down the street, and certainly if they’re half a world away. If you did spring for insurance to replace that dropped phone or wine-stained sofa, it might take hours to dig through old emails for your policy information and navigate the claims process, only to learn the fine print says you aren’t covered.</p>



<p>And in Europe, you likely don’t have a policy at all. Today, only a fourth of top online sellers offer product protection, and offline retailers have plans that could be vastly improved. Consumers are left on their own, and sellers forgo valuable opportunities to increase their sales and customer loyalty.</p>



<p>But now, Evy co-founders Simon Kemoun, Shana Azria and Tanguy Le Stradic are changing all that. Built from the ground up, their platform offers a simple set of APIs merchants can integrate to offer product insurance, allowing them to price customizable protection plans by category and deliver tailored coverage at lower deductibles. What’s more, Evy can handle the claims—often instantly. Sellers get a turnkey solution that helps their business grow, while customers get transparent policies, stress-free customer service and best of all, peace of mind.</p>



<p>When our friends at La Famiglia introduced us to Simon, Shana and Tanguy last year, Evy was just the three of them, and no product. But they did have complementary backgrounds (Simon previously founded a consumer social app and is a former McKinsey consultant; Shana was a senior engineer at Apple; Tanguy hails from rising-star French neobank Qonto) that combined to give them outsider insight on this space, and they had conviction in their technology-first approach. We were proud to lead their seed round earlier this year.</p>



<p>Fast-forward nine months later, and Evy has now grown into a talented and hard-working team of 10 and counting, offers insurance plans across multiple product categories with partnerships rolling out in phones, other electronic appliances, furniture, and more, and is already expanding beyond their roots in France into several other European countries. This week, as we celebrate their new pan-European partnership with e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.manomano.co.uk/">ManoMano</a>, we are as excited as ever about what the future holds for Simon, Shana, Tanguy and their team—and ultimately, for shoppers everywhere. With each expansion into a new product insurance category, Evy is taking another step toward a world where we can all get what we need, worry-free.</p>



<p>Evy is hiring now! If you’re interested in joining the team, please <a href="https://getevy.notion.site/Careers-at-Evy-239e76fd976e4b87960b6b4a45777473">reach out</a>.</p>

 Introduction <p>After the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">Merge</a>’s success, the Ethereum network transitioned from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus model into a Proof of Stake (PoS) one, making it a less energy-intensive blockchain. However, amid the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/17/3-must-know-benefits-of-the-ethereum-merge/">numerous positives</a> that the merge appears to have yielded, a <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/04/21/ethereum-merge-threat-lido-finance-proof-of-stake-dominant-defi-platform/">threat of centralization</a> is beginning to rear its ugly head. Thankfully, the Distributed Validator technology can address most of the problems that are associated to this danger.<br></p><p>The task of validating the blockchain has fallen to staking clients instead of miners. Under PoS, the job of a validator is to confirm or propose to add a new block to the blockchain. If the validator's attestation or proposal is timely and accurate, they receive a small reward in ETH. <br></p><p>In theory, anyone can set up a validator node, stake the required amount of ETH, and participate in the network. Yet, several intending validators are instead going through <a href="https://v1.stake.fish/en/ethereum/services/">staking services</a>, with all their <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">risks</a>. But why?<br></p><p>In this article, we’ll look at the current issues (spoiler: centralization) for validators and stakers on Ethereum PoS and how those problems can be solved with Distributed Validator Technology (DVT).</p> Issues with the Ethereum PoS model<br> <p>There is a range of risks for validators and stakers alike when it comes to the Ethereum PoS model. Let’s have a look at each of these issues.</p> Centralization <p>When it comes to retail users, especially those holding small amounts of ETH (Ethereum PoS requires 32 ETH to run a validator), it becomes a complicated procedure for them to set up a validator or maintain it. Hence, it’s very likely that these network participants are inclined towards staking their ETH via staking services. <br></p><p>Since most crypto users hold their funds on custodial platforms such as centralized exchanges, they’re likely to also use a custodial staking service to stake their ETH. Even though custodial staking services promise ease of use and convenience, there are several risks associated with using them, the chief of which is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-11/biggest-ether-staking-service-has-a-centralization-problem">centralization</a>. A central authority is not exactly good news in a global monetary network, and the idea of handing over your keys to an operator who is not immune to slashing penalties, errors, hacks, or even censorship can be devastating for the whole ecosystem. <br></p>The total value of ETH staked by some of the most important actors and platforms suggests a growing centralization problem. (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/centralization-risks-and-flaws-of-ethereum-merge">Source</a>) Single points of failure <p>When a user runs a solo validator, the custody of a validator's private keys is a crucial matter. If a validator losses access to their private keys, they could lose access to their funds. This represents a difficult user experience and constitutes a single-point-of-failure risk. The Ethereum PoS protocol doesn’t make it easier either, as its rules prohibit redundancies of any kind. Thus, a validator can only sign messages or remain online via a <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/my-journey-to-becoming-a-validator-on-ethereum-2-0/">single machine</a>. <br></p>The process of becoming a validator on Ethereum PoS. (<a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/my-journey-to-becoming-a-validator-on-ethereum-2-0/">Source</a>)<p>If an attacker breaks into a validator’s machine and gains access to the private key, their activities can cause the affected validator to suffer a slashing of their stake. When a stake is slashed, a portion of the validator’s locked funds is deducted by the protocol. Ultimately, this leads to a loss of funds, revealing the massive vulnerabilities of a single point of failure.</p> Validator liveness check <p>Suppose a validator client fails to sign messages for any reason, ranging from breaks in the network connection or cloud failures to software crashes or hardware issues. In that case, they suffer penalties due to inactivity. They will lose a portion of their staked balances. <br></p><p>Penalties due to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/solutions/double-signing-protection">double-signing</a> can also arise, especially if a validator suddenly goes offline while signing a message. Thus, validator clients risk deposit slashing if they sign multiple instances with the same key, sign the same message twice, or go offline when others are offline. This favors professional validators and discourages the average user with the resources to become one from being a validator, therefore leading to a few validators retaining most of the power.</p> Private key custody <p>There’s a well-known saying in the crypto ecosystem, “Not your keys, not your coins.” If you don’t have custody of your private keys, you’re always at the mercy a of custodial service for the safety of your funds. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/staking/saas/">Staking services</a> offer a way out for participants who do not want to face the risks of dealing with a solo validator setup and maintenance directly, but there's a catch. Stakers using these services have to hand over their private keys to the service in a setting that requires them to trust the staking service operator fully. They must trust the operator for the security of their staking private key.<br></p><p>With staking services, key ownership can be a tricky topic. A sense of security comes with having control over your private keys as a solo validator. Using a staking service will require you to give up that sense of security, trusting someone else to do it for you. For systems where anything can go wrong and malicious actors lurk under the guise of honesty, it is not advisable to trust someone else with the custody of your keys.</p> Forking penalties <p>Under the PoS regime, validator clients connect to Beacon nodes. In the unlikely event that a Beacon node to which a validator is connected <a href="https://www.bsc.news/post/ethereum-bug-leads-to-node-failure-and-a-subsequent-fork-in-the-network">develops a fault</a>, a fork will be created. If the validator client is affected by this anomaly, it will follow the forked chain and appear offline to the main PoS protocol, resulting in penalties.<br></p><p>—-------------------------------<br></p><p>Centralization is sufficient to defeat the purpose of a permissionless and transparent blockchain, but the threats to security and loss of deposits due to penalties are enough to discourage anyone from participating. These issues have created the need for the development of Distributed Validator Technology. Let’s understand what is Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) and how it aims to solve the issues mentioned above.</p> What is Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)? <p>Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) is a decentralized open-source protocol that allows the duties of a validator to be distributed among multiple nodes, as opposed to a single machine, leveraging threshold cryptography. DVT provides a decentralized staking layer on Ethereum, allowing anyone to create and share a validator over multiple <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/fault-tolerance">fault-tolerant </a>machines such that, if any one node is offline or faulty, the validator can continue to perform its duties. The fault-tolerance of a system simply refers to the system’s ability to continue operating despite failures or malfunctions.<br></p><p>In essence, DVT adds an additional layer of fault-tolerance for Ethereum validators removing the possibility of redundancies such as a single point of failure, centralization issues, etc.<br></p>A graphical overview of Distributed Validator Technology (earlier known as SSV). (<a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/eth2-secret-shared-validators-85824df8cbc0">Source</a>)<p>Distributed Validator Technology is a blend of distributed key generation, multi-party computation, Shamir's secret sharing, and Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms that permit validator duties to be split across several nodes without violating the staking rules of Ethereum. We’ll understand these algorithms and what role they play in DVT in the below sections.<br></p><p>In case you’re interested, here’s a video explainer of DVT by Aditya Asgankar from the Ethereum Foundation:</p><p>Distributed Validator Technology not only shares a single validator's duties across several machines but also “distributes” its private keys. Remember, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ethereum-competitors-advantages-and-disadvantages/">Ethereum</a> requires a validator to create or sign messages with its private keys on a single computer. By distributing shares of the private key among multiple nodes and utilizing a distributed key generation scheme, DVT eliminates the single point of failure, as we will see below.<br></p><p>DVT emerged as an idea proposed by the Ethereum Foundation in 2019 in preparation for Ethereum's transition to PoS. Ethereum validators operate with an Active-Passive setup in which backup nodes remain offline. When the active node goes offline, downtimes occur before the backup node can come online, as there are no automatic switches. With DVT, validators can now enjoy an <a href="https://kemptechnologies.com/white-papers/unfog-confusion-active-passive-activeactive-load-balancing">Active-Active arrangement</a>, operating like a multi-signature setup and eliminating single points of failure.</p> How does Distributed Validator Technology work? <p>As mentioned, Distributed Validator Technology combines distributed key generation, Shamir's secret sharing, multi-party computation, and Istanbul's Byzantine Fault Tolerance. You can look at DVT as a multi-signature scheme, but instead of confirming <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">transactions</a>, it is used to perform consensus-required validator duties on the blockchain.<br></p>A working overview of steps involved in the DVT consensus mechanism. (<a href="https://rattibha.com/thread/1530589456872271872">Source</a>) The Distributed Validator Technology pillar: Distributed key generation <p>The first and one of the core components of DVT is a <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/what-distributed-key-generation-is-866adc79620">distributed key generation</a> (DKG) scheme. DKGs involve multiple parties contributing to calculating and sharing a private key such that no single group member has full control over the secret key. The private key is encrypted and split among all participants.<br></p><p>Usually, these nodes qualify as non-<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusting</a>, meaning their operators do not need to know one another, creating sufficient room for fault tolerance. DKG makes way for the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">threshold signing</a> scheme.</p> Shamir's secret sharing and threshold signing <p>Next, <a href="https://medium.com/@keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">Shamir's secret sharing</a> allows the private key to be split such that each participating validator client holds only a piece of the puzzle, and no individual share is sufficient to sign messages. Instead of requiring every participant to be available to reform the secret or sign messages, Shamir's secret sharing employs a threshold, usually predefined, giving room for the validator client to remain online even if there is a faulty or malicious member.<br></p><p>For an example, say we have four operators contributing to a DVT setup, and the threshold for signing messages is 3 out of 4. If one computer goes offline or is not trustworthy, three nodes remain active and can sign messages. With the private key split among four nodes, there is no single point of failure.<br></p><p>Note that Ethereum PoS uses <a href="https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/building_blocks/signatures/">BLS signatures</a>, which allow for aggregation, meaning that it recognizes multiple signatures with the same key and can combine these transactions into one. So, when all participants sign a transaction, the BLS signature system combines all signatures without requiring a complete reconstruction of the private key.</p> Multi-party computation <p>Secure <a href="https://web3wednesdays.xyz/multi-party-computation/">multi-party computation</a> plays a critical role in Distributed Validator Technology. Through MPC, contributing operators can use their secret shares in signing messages and performing computation without reconstructing the secret on any single device. With MPC, the threat of centralizing the private key during computation is eliminated, and the decentralized nature of the distributed validator setup remains intact.</p> Consensus <p>The final piece in the puzzle is a consensus algorithm among Beacon nodes that can achieve fault tolerance through threshold signing schemes. Consensus is achieved among the Beacon nodes to which ETH validators are connected. Beacon nodes are responsible for assigning duties to validator clients.<br></p><p>Using <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">threshold cryptography</a>, a private key is encrypted and split amongst Beacon operator nodes. A threshold number (3 out of 4, 5 out of 7, etc.) is required for any commands to be issued to a validator client. This way, no single Beacon node operator would have unfettered power over a validator.<br></p><p>To reach a consensus over a block in a DVT setup, the <a href="https://media.consensys.net/scaling-consensus-for-enterprise-explaining-the-ibft-algorithm-ba86182ea668">Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance</a> algorithm singles out one Beacon node in the DVT setup as the leader who will propose the block and share it with fellow Beacon nodes. If more than 66% of the Beacon nodes agree that the block is valid, it is added to the blockchain.<br></p><p>If the leader goes offline or is compromised in a DVT setting, the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm will reassign the role to another DVT Beacon node within twelve seconds.</p> Use cases of Distributed Validator Technology <p>Since its proposal in 2019, DVT has been successfully developed by two leading actors: <a href="https://ssv.network/tech/">Secret Shared Validator Technology</a> and the <a href="https://obol.tech/">Obol Network</a>. While these are direct projects spun out with DVT as their core, here are the major possible applications of Distributed Validator Technology:</p> The use of Distributed Validator Technology on Decentralized staking pools <p>Most staking pools today are custodial and have single points of failure, relying on a single validator node with a single key., Added to the threat of a single point of failure is the challenge of experiencing slashing and penalties across the board.<br></p><p>Using a <a href="https://docs.obol.tech/docs/dv/validator-creation">distributed validator setup</a>, staking pools can switch to a decentralized model, reduce penalties and slashing by ensuring minimal downtimes and diversify their current offerings.</p> Staking infrastructure providers <p>To understand how staking infrastructure providers can leverage DVT to offer more robust services, we first need to understand the difference between <a href="https://www.jscape.com/blog/active-active-vs-active-passive-high-availability-cluster">Active-Active and Active-Passive</a> configurations.<br></p><p>When it comes to cloud infrastructure, there are essentially two options on how to configure connections – Active-Active &amp; Active-Passive. In an Active-Active configuration, traffic is load-shared between interfaces based on flow. If one connection becomes unavailable, then all traffic is routed through the other connection. In an Active-Passive configuration, one connection handles traffic, while the other is on standby.<br></p><p>Companies that provide infrastructure to meet individual or institutional staking need solutions towards redundancies of cloud providers with Active-Passive configurations. With DVT setups, infrastructure providers can enable Active-Active cluster redundancies and encourage dynamism in deployments and configurations.</p> Solo validator setups <p>Solo validators that were previously discouraged by high barriers of entry and the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/64-of-staked-eth-controlled-by-five-entities-nansen">risks</a> associated with <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">ETH staking</a> can now participate using a DVT configuration. <br></p><p>With a distributed validator setup, in-house validators can distribute their signing power across multiple nodes in an Active-Active cluster redundancy arrangement. Thus, they minimize the risk of failure and penalties due to downtime, double-signing, etc.</p> In summary, Distributed Validator Technology can be a game-changer <p>Distributed Validator Technology addresses the many challenges of ETH staking and lowers the entry barrier for the average person while encouraging true <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a> on Ethereum. With DVT, institutional or retail validators can meet the protocol’s requirements of safety or liveness, or even both, increase resilience, enjoy Active-Active redundancy configurations, and diversify their operations based on several factors.<br></p><p>As Ethereum now operates fully as a proof-of-stake blockchain, its validators will continue to lean towards more secure and practical configurations for their operations. DVT presents an opportunity for staking on Ethereum to become more decentralized and profitable, even for retail participants. Currently, Obol Network is leading the charge in building an ecosystem for trust-minimized staking that enables people to create, test, run &amp; coordinate distributed validators. Hopefully, in the coming months, we’ll see more development in this direction. <br><br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

   Welcome to Devcon 6. The first Devcon for Bankless, the conference was a ton of fun and an amazing cultural experience in Bogota, Colombia.   We’re speaking with Justin Drake about his talk at Devcon—the only conversation about ETH the asset.   What are the next steps for Ether? The value of the asset correlates directly to the health of the network, and maybe it’s time to start talking about ETH

     Q3 was an amazing quarter full of growth and exciting new milestones, including the first-ever Horizen ecosystem summit and the first meme coin on TokenMint!&nbsp; 
<p>We are amazed to see the amount of growth we have experienced in a single quarter. We launched several new products and upgrades, grew the team, welcomed a new meme coin to the ecosystem using our new products and more! We are excited to continue meeting new milestones with our growing community.&nbsp;</p>
 Q3 Highlights 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_OCT22_numbers-2.jpg"></a></p>
 Product and Engineering&nbsp; 
<p>The engineering and product teams focused on releasing upgrades to existing products like TokenMint and Cobalt this quarter to enable a wider variety of use cases on the Horizen ecosystem. This included Cobalt upgrades and <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/">documentation on how to use</a> it in preparation for additional functionality like NFTs on Tokenmint!</p>
 TokenMint 
<p>TokenMint Mainnet Launch</p>
<p>Our no-code tokenization platform, <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/tokenmint-is-live-on-mainnet/">TokenMint</a>, was launched on mainnet in Q3! The platform provides a streamlined process for anybody to launch their own token easily and quickly without having a technical background. An introduction of TokenMint with a user guide was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-create-and-launch-a-cryptocurrency-token-with-tokenmint">featured on Cointelegraph</a>. The leading technology media Venture Beat also featured a story on TokenMint where the author covered the importance of tokenization and the value of platforms such as TokenMint in the effort of making blockchain technology more accessible for the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Punkz Token Launch&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform has already been used to launch the first meme token on the Horizen ecosystem called Punkz Token! The token also has it’s own game called <a href="https://pipeflare.io/all-games">Punkz Hero</a>, launched with our partner PipeFlare! Be sure to check it out and get Punkz for playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team has started to add additional features to TokenMint as well. This includes NFTs! While the functionality is currently available on testnet. The team is working towards the mainnet launch, which is coming soon! This will enable people to create their own NFTs utilizing TokenMint and store them on our Cobalt browser wallet. This was an important step for our project because it is one of the many functionalities requested by our community. We were excited to deliver a product many members wanted to see! If you want to try launching your own NFT on TokenMint, head to the home page now, select the NFT tab and check out the guide on loading<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-load-nft-data-into-an-ipfs-repository/"> NFT data to IPFS.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/NFT-zencon0_D1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Thanks to the new NFT functionality on TokenMint’s testnet we launched the first NFT series in time for ZenCon0! The series, called <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zero-gravity-coming-to-tokenmint-an-exclusive-nft-for-zencon0/">Zero Gravity</a>, was issued to all event attendees as a special surprise for those who joined us.</p>
<p>The NFT functionality was also added to <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-ver-1-4-0/">Cobalt wallet version 1.4.0</a>! This version also added ZEN transactions between Cobalt wallet addresses to further extend the usability of our web wallet for our users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the engineering team has been making great progress on the <a href="https://www.horizen.io/blockchain-academy/technology/advanced/evm-ethereum-virtual-machine/">EVM</a> sidechain. The <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/why-evm-compatibility-matters/">EVM sidechain will open our ecosystem</a> up to existing blockchain developers and projects because Ethereum has the largest and most diverse public blockchain ecosystem. This means that EVM compatibility is one of the key ingredients for blockchains like ours to build a successful ecosystem. The team is currently working on the circuit to ensure that our EVM is as secure as possible and is expecting a launch date in early Q1 2023!</p>
<p>There are many benefits to EVM compatibility including existing Ethereum-based defi infrastructure. There are well-established Ethereum smart contracts for an wide range of blockchain-based products, such as automated market makers, decentralized exchanges, peer-to-peer lending protocols, stablecoins, and more. All of which the team is working on or working with new and existing partners to bring to the ecosystem soon!</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/download-the-mandatory-zen-3-2-0-software-upgrade-today/">ZEN 3.2.0</a>! This mandatory upgrade is the first step to&nbsp; preparing our exchange partners, mining pool operators, and full node users for upcoming ecosystem expansion and included upgrades like:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Upgrading integration test suite to Python 3 
 Updates to build system, compatibility with newer versions of Linux 
 Fix IsInitialBlockDownload false positive error message 
 
<p>The final date to upgrade without disruption is approximately October 21st! So be sure to upgrade soon if you haven’t already!</p>
 Community Growth&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_community.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The community has continued to grow steadily this quarter with the largest growth being seen on LinkedIn. Its exciting to see all of our new community members coming together to share their thoughts on what the ecosystem should look like and actively engaging with the team to provide feedback. We look forward to learning more about our newest community members as we continue to expand what Horizen is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This growth has continued to be seen across not only our community, but the web traffic for Horizen as well. We saw a 13% increase in <a href="https://heap.horizen.io/">HEAP</a> organic impressions, which suggests that a portion of our new community is developer-centric. Another exciting growth number we saw was the Horizen Academy content topic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_OCT22_webtraffic.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Our marketing team is in the process of launching a new Horizen Academy! The academy will include content that expands existing articles and educational resources about upcoming products and ecosystem expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are new articles already on the academy including:&nbsp;</p>

							<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce that we have recently tagged our first release candidate of Zebra (<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.0">zebra 1.0.0-rc.0</a>), the alternative Zcash node implementation written in Rust. This is the first time that there has been an alternative zcash node implementation running on mainnet and that we are excited to see some Zebra nodes now appearing on the <a href="https://blockchair.com/zcash/nodes">Blockchair node explorer</a>!</p><p>We are very happy to share that Zebra also supports the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra#configuring-json-rpc-for-lightwalletd">lightwalletd backend JSON-RPCs</a>, can be used as a lightwalletd backend and is <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zebra-powered-lightwalletd-with-zecwallet-lite/42868">currently an optional backend for ZecwalletLite</a>!</p><p>With this release we have solved the last few outstanding bugs and issues that could have affected the security, performance and stability of the Zcash network and are confident that long-lived Zebra nodes can be run on mainnet. As such, we are looking forward to Zebra experiencing more “production use”, and we will be shortly be engaging security auditors to conduct an audit of the Zebra code to ensure that users can be confident in its security and stability.&nbsp;</p><p>This release of Zebra can be used to join the Zcash peer-to-peer network, which helps to keep Zcash working by validating and broadcasting transactions, and maintaining the Zcash blockchain state in a distributed manner. Zebra’s network stack is interoperable with zcashd, and Zebra implements all the features required to reach Zcash network consensus. Zebra validates all of the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf">Zcash consensus rules</a>.</p><p>So please spin up some instances and let us know what you think!</p>

<blockquote>TL;DR: Introducing a new framework for Sismo governance: Sismo Contributor ZK badge holders get voting power according to their contribution. First use case: the community will curate which badges can be deployed on the main curated environment.</blockquote><p>Sismo has now been live for a few months and the list of <a href="https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/what-are-zk-badges">ZK Badges</a> on the <a href="https://playground.sismo.io/">playground</a> has started to grow since the release of our <a href="https://factory.sismo.io/">Factory</a> — where non developers can create ZK Badges for their users in 5&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>The <a href="http://playground.sismo.io">playground</a> is a permissionless environment where anyone can create their own ZK Badges. Only the best Badges from the playground environment make it to the main <a href="http://app.sismo.io">Sismo curated environment</a>.</p><p>Today we are opening the curation process to the Sismo community through an open governance system, based on contributions.</p><p>We will of course dog-food our own protocol and ZK Badges to track contributions&nbsp;:)</p> Community-based Badge&nbsp;Curation <p>The Sismo <a href="https://playground.sismo.io/">Playground</a> environment is an open sandbox for anyone to create, test and imagine new ways to benefit from Sismo’s protocol privacy-preserving attestation system. This openness means that a lot of different types of badges are created and that some of the highest quality ones are drowned in a mass of other badges that could be deemed low-quality or less aligned with Sismo’s&nbsp;vision.</p><p>On the other side, the Sismo <a href="https://app.sismo.io/">Curated</a> environment core value is to provide a more curated experience for users and applications looking for carefully selected ZK Badges that they can trust. The objective is for the Sismo community to progressively take charge of vetting which ZK Badge will be able to be migrated to the Curated environment from the Playground environment.</p>ZK Badges in Sismo’s Curated environment<p>To help in this endeavour, a set of <a href="https://www.notion.so/Badge-Curation-Guidelines-a62b5d7205734b44b41c603bf1516f4c">Badge Curation Guidelines</a> have been proposed to the community to support them in their decision process. It has the aim to ensure that the Sismo Curated environment only hosts ZK Badges that have been proven to hold a sufficient level of quality, transparency, fairness, and alignment to Sismo’s manifesto.</p> The need for a new governance model  Straightforward token voting is&nbsp;flawed <p>The issues with solely coin-driven governance are&nbsp;known:</p>  It empowers token holders and their interests more than the other type of stakeholders in a project community.  It is susceptible to governance attacks through vote buying or borrowing.  It gives oversized power to wealthy participants compared to small holders and these “whales” can often have conflicting interests in other&nbsp;projects   Lack of private&nbsp;voting <p>The lack of privacy in the current voting system opens the way to bribing or intimidation attacks against specific actors and can prevent some stakeholders from expressing their honest opinions.</p> Exploring the potential of Proof of Contribution <p>An additional metric that should be taken into account in governance systems is the amount of value each voter brought to the system. It seems natural to give more power in the governance to those who contributed the most to the underlying project.</p> Proof of Contribution  Verifying the fact that an account corresponds to a person that has used a protocol, passed some educational training, funded an initiative, contributed to building a system, or performed some useful work in the project ecosystem. Useful participation rewarded with improved governance power is less dystopian than a social credit system because you have a say in the criteria&nbsp;used. Sismo ZK Badges as membership &amp; weighted voting credentials <p>Sismo ZK Badges provide a valuable set of attributes for contribution-based governance models:</p>  They are tokenized attestations of history/activity/reputation packaged as a standard ERC-1155 NFT a.k.a Soulbound Tokens&nbsp;(SBTs)  They preserve the privacy of their owners. They can be minted on a new address that is not linked to the addresses that fulfilled the requirements to get the badge.&nbsp;(<a href="https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/what-are-zk-badges">more</a>)  (Soon) They will allow users to aggregate their reputation by gathering their badges on a single or several pseudonymized address(es) in the&nbsp;future.  They are non-transferable.  <p>This last property allows ZK badges to be less concentrated (no sale/transfer to the rich) and to remain owned by active participants. The non-transferability of badges also limits trustless vote-buying in the sense that any vote-buying will require the seller to hand over his private&nbsp;keys.</p> A new framework for Sismo Governance <p>Check out the new governance process at <a href="https://governance.sismo.io">https://governance.sismo.io</a></p> “Sismo Contributor” badge as core voting power denominator <p>The core voting power denominator is represented by the <a href="https://app.sismo.io/sismo-contributor">“Sismo Contributor” ZK badge</a> (on Polygon mainnet).</p><p>The “Sismo Contributor” ZK badge can be minted by different types of contributors from the Sismo community (check <a href="https://sismo.notion.site/Governance-Overview-5224949448d64bdb81f3d70b3b4cc5f0">Governance Overview</a> for details) and is comprised of 3 tiers assigned according to the significance of the minter contribution:</p><p>Tier 1 contributors (Users): 1 voting point per&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Tier 2 contributors (Community Members): 50 voting points per the&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Tier 3 contributors (Builders): 500 voting points per&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Anyone having minted at least one badge on <a href="https://app.sismo.io/">Sismo Curated App</a> (not the playground) is at least eligible for Tier 1. Community member can easily get to Tier 2 by attending a Sismo event or minting a “Proof of Humanity” ZK Badge, and to Tier 3 by contributing actively to Sismo’s ecosystem initiatives or open source development.</p><p>The voting power assignment to the “Sismo Contributor” ZK badge, the badge group generation rules, and the tier allocation are all susceptible to being modified through governance in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>This badge will attest that its minter has already interacted at least once with Sismo protocol, community, or ecosystem and will act as a first basic Sybil resistance lever.</p> Conclusion <p>The early stages of Sismo Governance are a perfect time to experiment with alternative governance models that could prove themselves to be valuable. Because it uses Sismo protocol at its heart, this experiment can be reused as a template and improved on by other communities, incentivizing more usage of Sismo ZK&nbsp;Badges.</p><p>Get involved:</p>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/sismo">Discord</a>  <p>Read about our current governance process:</p>  <a href="http://governance.sismo.io">governance.sismo.io</a>   Reference   Moving beyond coin voting governance -<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html">https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html</a>

 Verida Q3 2022 Quarterly Update Verida Q3 2022&nbsp;Update<p>The past few months have again been busy for the Verida team and our protocol development. Work has continued on the development of the Verida Vault with the Android release now available, NEAR integration complete and Wallet Connect support implemented. The Verida Acacia testnet which will shortly become fully decentralized too. Despite a volatile market environment, our community remains engaged and new partners continue to join the network as we work to provide user owned data identity solutions for&nbsp;all.</p> Engineering  Verida Vault <p>Web3 apps need to offer the standard of UX that people are used to today. Verida has worked with Excited, a product design agency based in the Ukraine since 2019 for the design of the Verida website and Verida Vault mobile application. Last month, we were thrilled to announce that the Verida Vault was awarded the coveted <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-vault-designers-win-prestigious-red-dot-award-48deb4336813">Red Dot Award</a> for its interface design.</p>The Verida&nbsp;Vault<p>The Verida Vault mobile app acts as both a “data wallet” and “crypto wallet” for end users. It provides private key management and a user-friendly interface with the Verida network and supported blockchains.</p><p>We shipped the Android release of the Verida Vault in August and it is now available in<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.verida.vault"> Android Play Store</a>. This broadens Vault availability beyond iOS which can be found in the<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verida-vault/id1546599632"> Apple AppStore</a>. Both are in developer preview. APIs are stable except where noted in our<a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/intro"> documentation</a>.</p><p>We welcome developers to come build user-centric, decentralized apps with the vast capabilities of the Verida Vault, including identity, user data, messaging, profiles, Single-Sign-On (SSO), rewards, tokens, and transactions. Learn more about the Vault in our release article&nbsp;<a href="https://news.verida.io/the-verida-vault-is-now-available-in-developer-preview-on-ios-and-android-70d0acdce3dc">here</a>.</p> Product <p>NEAR is now supported in the Verida Vault (testnet only). This includes the ability to store your NEAR tokens, send and receive and make crypto transactions.</p><p>WalletConnect is now supported on Ethereum (Wallet Connect v1), Algorand (Wallet Connect v1) and NEAR (Wallet Connect v2) via the <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/single-sign-on-sdk">Verida Connect SDK</a>. dApps supporting WalletConnect can pass the connection details while connecting with Verida, providing their users with a unified Connect experience, i.e. a single QR-code to scan to connect both Verida and Wallet&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>The Verida Vault crypto wallet import feature has now been extended to provide more flexibility for users. In addition to importing an existing Verida multichain wallet, users can now import accounts for individual blockchains (e.g. Ethereum).</p> Protocol <p>A key focus for the engineering team has been working towards the Acacia Testnet protocol release that will be rolling out from November 2022&nbsp;onwards.</p><p>Smart contract development:</p>  We have open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts">protocol smart contracts</a> currently under development.  Significant engineering effort has gone towards our <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">Decentralized DID Registry</a> that will be launched shortly on Testnet. This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry">ethr-did-registry</a> with extensions that support “per application” based service endpoints, a built-in “proof” mechanism that unlocks the ability to create a generic “data bridge” to prove verified off-chain data on any Verida supported blockchain.  The <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-Name-Registry">Verida Name Registry</a> has been developed, tested and is ready for deployment. This enables Verida accounts to have human friendly names as aliases for their&nbsp;DID’s.  Work has commenced on development work for our future token reward&nbsp;systems.  <p>Verida SDK development:</p>  A major refactor of the Verida SDK has been completed that integrates with the new, <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">Decentralized DID Registry</a>.  Enhancements to the Verida DbStore provide more access controls, an enhanced authorization token based security model and the ability to enforce remote deletion of databases.  <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/single-sign-on-sdk">Verida Connect</a> upgrades adding support for the new token based authorization model and remote device access revocation.

<p>Written by Anirudha Bose</p>
<p>Signing DApp transactions for EVM chains is a security nightmare. It’s very common for users to blindly approve a signature request while being completely oblivious to what the transaction is going to do behind the scenes. This is commonly referred to as “blind signing” in the world of cryptocurrency (not to be confused with blind signatures in cryptography).</p>
<p>Blind signing is unfortunately a very common attack vector in crypto, where an attacker tricks the user into signing a transaction that drains their wallet (since there’s no way for the user to distinguish between a legitimate and a malicious transaction). Earlier this year, in a phishing attack on OpenSea users, an attacker stole hundreds of NFTs by simply tricking victims into signing a transaction to sell all their NFTs for 0 ETH. This story is far too common for the crypto ecosystem to ignore.</p>
<p>With Brave browser release 1.45, we are excited to debut a smarter signing experience on Brave Swap for all EVM transactions. With our latest updates to Brave Wallet, our signing experience is getting a redesign that aims to take the stress out of approving transactions. On any trading platform that’s powered by the 0x API (including Brave Wallet internal swaps), you’ll see clear and straightforward descriptions of how the transaction will impact your token balances.</p>

 The perils of DeFi 
<p>Using DeFi apps today is a lot like going to a shop and asking the shopkeeper to take whatever cash they need from your wallet for the purchase. The contracts you interact with already have an approval to spend part or all of your token balances, using the <code>approve()</code> method of the ERC20 interface. Consider the following transaction approval popup on Metamask, which is a Uniswap trade for USDC-ETH on the Optimism network:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>Approving this transaction requires a leap of faith, since none of the original swap parameters like maker and taker assets, quote amounts, etc. are visible on the approval screen. You’re essentially signing complete gibberish. It’s not just poor user experience; it’s&nbsp; unsafe. This info can be spoofed to execute almost anything without your awareness.</p>

 What the hex? 
<p>Transactions are to smart contracts what HTTP requests are to web services. DApps use a data segment in EVM transactions, known as calldata, to indicate which function to invoke in a smart contract and with what parameters. The calldata however is just a sequence of bytes that’s not human readable. You can view the calldata segment of a transaction on Etherscan under the “Input Data” section, as in the following example:</p>



    



    



    
    


 Anatomy of EVM calldata 
<p>The calldata is a read-only, byte-addressable space where the data parameter of a transaction or call is held. This calldata is encoded by wallets and Web3 clients following the Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI). Let’s look at a simple contract with a method to add two <code>uint256</code> numbers, and see how you’d construct the calldata to execute this method:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>The first four bytes of the calldata, known as function selector, specify the function to be called. Method arguments are packed in chunks of 32 bytes, with types smaller than 32 bytes zero padded if necessary. Fixed-size types like <code>uint256</code>, <code>address</code>, etc. are represented within the available 32 bytes. However, dynamic types like bytes and arrays follow head-tail encoding. In this scheme, the data is packaged at the tail-end of the transaction’s calldata. The arguments are references in the calldata to where the content is.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the calldata example above based on the encoding rules to have a better understanding:</p>



    



    



    
    

<p>We can now update our example contract logic with heavily-commented inline assembly (albeit a bit contrived), to demonstrate how EVM parses the calldata behind the scenes:</p>



    



    



    
    


 Parsing complex calldata 
<p>Here’s a more realistic example of how to parse the calldata of the 0x contract function <code>sellTokenForTokenToUniswapV3</code>, involving dynamic types. Recall that dynamic types use the head-tail encoding scheme, unlike fixed-size types. Our example is a swap trade from COW to USDC, using the following path for the order: COW -&gt; WETH -&gt; USDC.</p>
<p>The function we’re trying to invoke is:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>Here’s the same calldata, but broken down and grouped to indicate how we can parse it to extract meaningful insights about the swap trade.</p>



    



    



    
    

<p>Note that parsing the calldata is not enough—we also needed to figure out the information embedded in the <code>encodedPath</code> argument, which is a Uniswap V3 order path. Thanks to our newfound ability to make sense of the entire calldata segment, we can now infer that the raw hex represented the swap trade 1421.74 COW -&gt; 1000 USDC.</p>

 The end product 
<p>Technical improvements can only be appreciated if an impact is felt by users. So the final piece of the puzzle was to design a UX that gives users all the necessary details to confidently approve a swap, while keeping it generic enough that it can be extended to a vast majority of DEX transactions in the future. After brainstorming with our product designers, here’s what the end product looks like:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>A few highlights of this design:</p>
 
 It displays all the security-critical information about the swap, such as sender account, maker and taker assets along with network information, quote amounts, and exchange rate. 
 It works both for swaps from Brave Wallet as well as third-party DApps integrating the 0x API, on all EVM-compatible networks. 
 The UX could easily be extended to support cross-chain bridge transactions, where the networks for maker and taker assets would be different. 
 The origin of the transaction (i.e. eTLD+1 and the site favicon) are displayed to prevent phishing attacks. 
 

 Conclusion 
<p>We implemented an <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/12797">ABI decoder</a> in brave-core for EVM chains to bring safety and transparency to the transaction approval process. This allowed us to reveal insights about what a seemingly opaque transaction is supposed to do, and build a dedicated UX around it to make the signing process more user-friendly.</p>
<p>In the 1.45 release of the Brave browser, we are bringing this capability to 0x swaps on Brave Wallet, and will soon extend it to Uniswap, Curve, PancakeSwap, and Sushiswap, which should cover more than 70% of all DEX volume on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Building a secure and transparent signing experience in Brave Wallet remains a strong focus for us on the Wallet team. We intend to expand on this work to bring similar UX improvements beyond swaps, such as interacting with lending, cross-chain bridges, and staking DApps.</p>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

<p>As we mentioned in our blog posts regarding releases <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a>, the Zcash network is processing a significantly increased number of shielded transactions. The network remains stable and secure, transactions are being processed normally, and we are making additional performance improvements in 5.3.0 to reduce concurrent memory utilization during scanning among other memory and performance related optimisations in the <code>zcashd</code> node.</p>



<p>ECC’s No. 1 priority at the moment is updating the Zcash protocol and our wallet SDKs to help third-party providers fix wallet syncing issues. An increased on-chain transaction load has resulted in unacceptable sync times for many everyday users, and ecosystem partners are also affected. We are focused — across teams — on alleviating these issues as soon as possible, so Zcash users have an experience they expect and deserve. Our immediate objectives are centered on working with third-party wallets that are built on the ECC SDKs (Edge, Nighthawk and Unstoppable) as well as continuing to make improvements to node performance and memory usage.</p>



 Wallet Performance Improvements 



<p><code>zcashd 5.2.0</code> improved the performance of wallet scanning with multithreaded batched trial decryption of Sapling outputs. However, for some nodes this resulted in growing memory usage that would eventually cause an OOM abort. We have identified the cause of the growth, and made significant improvements to reduce the memory usage of the batch scanner. In addition, the batch scanner now has a memory limit of 100 MiB.</p>



<p><code>zcashd</code> now reports the following new metrics when <code>-prometheusport</code> is set:</p>



  (counter) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.outputs.scanned</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.size.transactions</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.usage.bytes</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.synced.block.height</code>  



 RPC Interface 



  The <code>finalorchardroot</code> field in the <code>getblock</code> result and the <code>orchard.commitments.finalRoot</code> field in the <code>z_gettreestate</code> result have been changed to match the byte ordering used for the <code>orchard.anchor</code> field in the <code>getrawtransaction</code> result. These previously produced different hash values from the orchard.anchor field due to having been byte-flipped in their internal representation in <code>zcashd</code>.  



<p>The binaries for the 5.3.0 release will be available on our download site shortly and the <a href="https://z.cash/support/schedule/">Zcash Schedule page</a> has been updated to reflect this release.</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the latest round of partners that joined Brave’s Wallet Partner program this month. Since its June debut, the Wallet Partner program has onboarded 62 DApps, and promoted their use among Brave Wallet users through Brave Ads and other Brave-owned properties. In addition to our program partners, dozens more DApps are following suit by integrating Brave Wallet outside the program, helping to organically spread the word about Brave’s built-in secure multi-chain wallet.</p>
<p>To learn more about our previous Wallet Partners, check out past announcements:</p>
 
 <a>June</a> 
 <a>July</a> 
 <a>August</a> 
 <a>September</a> 
 
<p>This month’s newest additions feature:</p>

 ACryptoS 
<p><a href="https://medium.com/acryptos">ACryptoS</a> is a multi-chain yield optimizer whose core offering is auto-compounding Single-Token Vaults, which use unique strategies to increase DeFi yield without the risk of impermanent loss. The vaults first launched on BNB Chain, but are now deployed across Avalanche, Fantom, Gnosis, Cronos, and more. Their mission is to build a better, safer DeFi world where their users can sleep soundly while their deposits earn yield.</p>

 BadgerDAO 
<p><a href="https://badger.com/">Badger</a> is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate the growth of Bitcoin in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) across multiple blockchains. It is an ecosystem where projects and people from all across DeFi can collaborate and build together. Shared ownership in the DAO incentivizes builders to have aligned objectives, while decentralized governance ensures that those incentives remain fair to all parties.</p>

 Compound 
<p>The <a href="https://compound.finance/">Compound</a> protocol is a decentralized and autonomous interest rate protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. The core use cases are borrowing assets and earning interest. Compound is one of the first DeFi protocols on Ethereum and currently holds ~$2.3 billion worth of liquidity in smart contracts. Compound III, its newest deployment, enables users to supply a supported collateral asset like WBTC and borrow USDC against it, in addition to earning interest if they supply USDC. Governance of the protocol is decentralized such that COMP token holders can propose or vote on code upgrades. Discord, Twitter, and the comp.xyz forums are where the community publicly discusses protocol development.</p>

 Cronos ID 
<p><a href="https://cronosid.xyz/">Cronos ID</a> is the identity and communication layer on top of  <a href="https://cronos.org/">Cronos</a>, the first EVM-compatible chain built on Cosmos. The Cronos ID Domain Service enables users to associate a unique human-readable “.cro” domain with their crypto wallet address. In the coming weeks, the Cronos ID Notification Service and the Cronos ID Messaging Service will enable peer-to-peer and DApp-to-consumer communication using only wallet addresses. Cronos ID is incubated by  <a href="https://cronoslabs.org/">Cronos Labs</a>, the ecosystem accelerator of Cronos Chain.</p>

 DappRadar 
<p><a href="https://dappradar.com/">DappRadar</a> positions itself as the world’s DApp store at the heart of Web3. It tracks more than 12,000 DApps over 50 blockchains, providing reliable and accurate data for the users who want to discover and explore the world of NFTs, blockchain games, metaverse, and more.</p>
<p>“Brave Wallet’s integration to DappRadar is a powerful partnership of two pioneering companies in Web3. Users will be able to track digital assets in Brave Wallet while exploring the world of DApps on DappRadar. Privacy at its best, while discovering blockchain games, NFTs, DeFi, metaverses, and more,” said Patrick Barile, COO of DappRadar.</p>

 Ferro 
<p><a href="https://ferroprotocol.com/">Ferro</a> is the leading stable coin swapping venue on  <a href="https://cronos.org/">Cronos</a>, the first EVM-compatible chain built on Cosmos in partnership with Crypto.com. Ferro has gained even more relevance during the recent bear market months as it works hard every day to optimize the returns that liquidity providers generate from more than $100 million in deposited DAI, USDC and USDT. Ferro differentiates with its clean, modern look and feel and its best-in-class yields.</p>

 Jungle Cats 
<p><a href="https://junglecats.io/">Jungle Cats</a> is an NFT project based on the Solana blockchain—a collection of Lions and Lionesses taking a journey through gamified rewards and on-chain breeding to mirror the life cycle of what they consider a real-life feline family. The Jungle Cats use their voice—$GROAR (SPL utility token)—to venture deep into the Jungle Safari and participate in the ecosystem.</p>

 Matcha 
<p><a href="https://matcha.xyz/">Matcha</a> is a decentralized exchange from 0x Labs, the team behind the 0x protocol.

<p>We’re proud to announce that Panther has joined the <a href="https://www.leadingprivacy.com/">Leading Privacy Alliance</a>, an initiative aspiring to be a DAO unifying leading Web3 companies around the shared goal of improving privacy in crypto and beyond. The Leading Privacy Alliance was launched on October 9th, leading to Devcon Bogota, and Panther is among the first companies to join this initiative.<br></p><p>The LPA has been established to address the issue currently facing everyone involved in the Web3 space –how to make working privacy-first an industry standard. The alliance seeks to educate end-users and clients on the importance of the right to privacy, not because there might be something to hide, but for privacy is essential to freedom.<br></p><p>The alliance was founded by <a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Blockwallet</a>, <a href="https://dusk.network/">Dusk Network</a>, and <a href="https://hoprnet.org/">HOPR</a>. Panther is, alongside Omnia, the first company to join. Panther’s Senior Architect Adam Spiers gave a talk during the launch event, explaining the reasons for Panther to join this movement.</p><blockquote><p>Making <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/private?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#private</a> scalable blockchain protocol for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Web3</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DeFi</a> applications is how <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ZKPanther</a> contributes to an holistic and interoperable approach of privacy, shares <a href="https://twitter.com/adamspiers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@adamspiers</a>. <a href="https://t.co/oarcKILrWJ">pic.twitter.com/oarcKILrWJ</a></p>— Leading Privacy (@LeadingPrivacy) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeadingPrivacy/status/1579246326625488896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>As a project that aims to enable trust and privacy in the DeFi space, it is a natural fit for Panther to join the Leading Privacy Alliance.

 How Online Privacy Concerns Today is Rooted in the Internet’s Early Days<br> <p>Bitcoin is at the forefront of future-thinking approaches to payments, investing and a range of other applications that extend far beyond its role as a digital currency. While Bitcoin represents the future of digital currency, its prioritization of censorship resistance has links back to the cypherpunk movement, which first emerged in the 1980s and became prevalent in the 1990s as internet adoption began to pick up steam. <br></p><p>Tracing contemporary privacy concerns back to early online privacy activists can be an enlightening way to develop a sense of where Bitcoin may be headed in the future. Some of the top figures who advocate for online privacy, including Timothy May, have links to the original cypherpunk movement. Assange penned the 2012 book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cypherpunks-Freedom-Internet-Julian-Assange/dp/1944869085">Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet</a>, which bolstered mainstream awareness of the cypherpunk movement. <br></p><p>Cypherpunks tend to believe in the power of cryptography and other online privacy strategies centered around combating widespread digital surveillance. For decades, cypherpunks have been designing strategies and platforms to preserve online privacy for those who recognize its importance. Let’s dive into the history of the cypherpunk movement and how its adherents and principles are having a continued impact on the Bitcoin landscape.</p> Who Were the Original Cypherpunks? <p>In the early nineties, a group of computer scientists, programmers, and cryptographers assembled with mathematician Eric Hughes in order to discuss what they saw as the looming threat of increased surveillance facilitated by the burgeoning internet infrastructure. These early internet activists shared a libertarian sensibility—believing that the state should hold only minimal involvement in citizens’ private lives. The cypherpunk movement grew out of monthly meetings between this group and its name was a play on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> genre of science fiction coined by Jude Milhon, which itself drew influence from early hacker culture. <br></p><p>The group created the first anonymous remailer, &nbsp;the cypherpunk mailing list, in which they developed visionary ideas about online privacy. Tim May—who previously worked at Intel—was a founding member and prolific contributor to the cypherpunks electronic mailing list. He also put forth the idea of tools enabling anonymous browsing of the web as well as the idea of anonymous online marketplaces and anonymous whistleblowing systems—all of which are ideas that have seen a number of applications in the years since. The cypherpunks communicated in a brash, jargon-laden style, and their mailing list grew into a core hub of the discussion and development of online privacy strategies. The mailing list became defunct in the early 2000s, but by then the movement was fully up and running and had developed anonymous ways of communicating and sharing resources online.</p> Is the Cypherpunk Movement Active Today? <p>In his work “<a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html">A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto</a>” Eric Hughes wrote “Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.” Frequently, politicians and those who run large social media companies assert that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy">privacy can no longer be expected online</a>, and that only those who have something to hide should be worried about being watched. As Glenn Greenwald pointed out in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters?language=en">an influential TedTalk about online privacy in 2014</a>, we make countless choices every day about what we choose to reveal and obscure from others in our lives and we should protect our right to be able to do so online.<br></p><p>Many online privacy-minded applications and initiatives were either created by people with links to the original cypherpunk movement, or were directly inspired by its philosophies. As mentioned, Julian Assange was an active member of the cypherpunk mailing list and his WikiLeaks organization was directly inspired by the cypherpunk focus on the need for anonymous whistleblowing resources. Other influential people associated with the cypherpunk ideologies include Jacob Appelbaum, who was not involved with creating the cypherpunk mailing list but was later a core member of the team that developed the open-source anonymous communication platform, Tor; Adam Back, who created Hashcash (a proof-of-work algorithm) and Blockstream (a company providing products and services built around Bitcoin), and Bram Cohen, who created BitTorrent. <br></p><p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper using concepts that drew directly from the work of Adam Back, with whom Nakamoto had been in contact. In Bitcoin’s whitepaper, Nakamoto referenced the revolutionary concept of a currency in which transactions are publicly viewable while utilizing private keys to sign unique transactions. Bitcoin was a leap forward in the development of the kind of cryptocurrency first posited by the cypherpunk movement.</p> Recent Cypherpunk Developments <p>Much of the appeal of Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies is centered around the values championed by the cypherpunk movement. Decentralized, anonymous currency rooted in cryptography offers resistance to unnecessary (and ultimately corrupt) government interference. Ideally, cryptocurrencies place privacy and transacting power back into the hands of individuals who are able to control what information they share. <br></p><p>Alongside the continued growth and development of Bitcoin—which maintains its cypherpunk-influenced integrity—there has also been a movement towards cryptocurrencies that have moved away from decentralized models. In the interest of mainstream growth and adoption, they stray from the individual privacy efforts that are central to the cypherpunk vision. Converting centralized (fiat) currency into Bitcoin often requires the use of centralized exchanges and the regulations these entail, which typically degrade users’ privacy. Many new Bitcoin users utilize centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, which collect extensive personal information and have policies that threaten transaction privacy. <br><br>Bitcoin is central to the development of a forward-thinking movement towards individuals holding the keys to their own Bitcoin. However, there are aspects inherent to Bitcoin that have <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/why-we-work-on-bitcoin-privacy/">privacy concerns that innovators are taking steps to combat</a>. The fact that every Bitcoin transaction and address balance is viewable to anyone on the blockchain is key to the decentralized authentication of Bitcoin transactions, as it avoids the need for middlemen. When each transaction’s details can be viewed, it ensures nobody breaks the rules.<br><br>While Bitcoin addresses are not directly linked to users’ identities, they certainly can be. Once one active address’ identity is revealed, the privacy of each party that has engaged in transactions with the compromised address can be threatened. Additionally, “know your customer” requirements from online merchants, which verify users’ identities over time as a security function, can disturb users’ privacy when ostensibly anonymous transactions are connected to these transactions.</p> Coinjoin as a Contemporary Cypherpunk Innovation <p>An important concept when it comes to Bitcoin’s ability to provide an anonymous and private payment method is <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-is-the-bridge-to-bitcoin-fungibility/">fungibility</a>. Fungibility refers to the ability of an asset to be exchanged freely for the same denomination of the same asset. For instance, an unmarked $20 bill’s value does not depend on the bill’s provenance. On the other hand, non-fungible stores of value include artworks, which are unique and where previous ownership is factored into an item’s worth. <br><br>Bitcoin is designed to be a fully fungible currency, but this can be threatened when certain coins can be linked through their transaction history to an unscrupulous user or exchange. One technique associated with restoring fungibility for Bitcoin users is <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/how-coinjoins-fix-bitcoin-privacy/">Coinjoin</a>. Coinjoin is an obfuscation strategy that severs the tie between previous transactions by joining coins together, which effectively anonymizes them. <br><br>CoinJoin activity itself can be viewed on the blockchain and there is still a limit to the success of this obfuscation strategy. Some users may feel that coins that have undergone this process are undesirable. For this reason, the widespread adoption of Coinjoin may be necessary in order to create a situation <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/methods-for-the-destigmatization-of-coinjoin/">where obfuscation is destigmatized</a> and seen as a privacy-retaining tool, rather than as a sign of suspicious activity.<br><br>The growing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin is an example of destigmatization of this nature, as the link between Bitcoin and anonymous online marketplaces like Silk Road (wherein users paid in bitcoin for goods and services that were illegal in certain jurisdictions) became less of a focus.</p> Wasabi Wallet as a Tool for Cypherpunks <p>One groundbreaking tool that goes a long way towards making Bitcoin adhere to the privacy standards that the original cypherpunks strove for is <a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/">Wasabi Wallet</a>—a privacy-focused, non-custodial Bitcoin wallet. Wasabi Wallet uses Coinjoin obfuscation and integrates <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> as a strategy to prevent network deanonymization attacks. <br><br>One challenge faced by Bitcoin wallet developers is how to ensure the privacy of users while also making wallets user-friendly and accessible to those without extensive technical knowledge. The original cypherpunk movement was composed of developers, programmers, mathematicians, and cryptographers. The movement’s motto — “cypherpunks write code” — refers both to the programming skills of the community and the focus on encryption. These days, widespread adoption among those without specialized knowledge is the goal of many developers of Bitcoin-related tools. <br><br>Wasabi Wallet is a desktop wallet, which tends to allow for more robust software than mobile offerings. It prevents third party access to users’ wallet information, increased fungibility provided by Coinjoin technology, and offers the privacy benefits of the Tor onion network.<br><br>The recently-launched <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi2-0-released/">Wasabi Wallet 2.0</a> provides a revamped interface. Wasabi Wallet lets users choose between three coinjoin strategies, depending on whether their main priority is maximizing privacy, maximizing speed or minimizing costs. Users can easily view their wallet’s privatization progress and can also implement Discreet Mode, which further hides sensitive information. <br><br>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tend to naturally attract those who value online privacy and who see the benefits of being in control of how information is collected and distributed. Wasabi makes it easy to send and receive Bitcoin with more privacy than other services suited to average bitcoin users. Coinjoin and other anonymization strategies implemented by Wasabi are paving the way towards a landscape in which it’s possible for all Bitcoin users to be cypherpunks, even without specialized knowledge. <br><br><br></p>

<p>Regardless of the industry or vertical, organisations have a huge amount of compliance obligations that must be followed to avoid penalties or closures and ensure continuity of service. How are these compliance obligations managed, and is there any room for improvement?</p>



 Traditional compliance management 



<p>Traditionally, observations and measurements have been captured using manual, paper-based forms. These forms have proven to be difficult and complex to use, and often suffer from inaccuracies as a result of these inherent problems.</p>



<p>Data collection and management with paper forms can be an inaccurate and labour-intensive process. Data is often key punched twice and then reviewed for missed, out-of-range, or erroneous responses — an inefficient validation process that can be time-consuming and inaccurate.</p>



<p>Handheld Computers, A Feasible Alternative to Paper Forms for Field Data Collection, University of Minnesota</p>



<p>Luckily, these paper-based forms quickly got replaced by their digital counterparts as soon as these alternatives became available. This move to digital forms solved many of the problems paper-based forms suffered from and proved to be much easier to use. Better data entry, less use of paper, and a reduced cost are only some of their features.</p>



<p>While digital forms revolutionised the process of being compliant, they did not come without a cost. The recorded data has to be stored and shared with the relevant regulatory bodies for review and sign-off, which sounds simple in theory but has shown to be rather difficult in practice. Records can be erased, servers can become corrupted, data formats change and data loss can become a huge issue for businesses. Organisations are now beginning to harness new and emerging technologies to solve these issues and ensure transparency and compliance.</p>



 Enabling compliance using blockchain technology 



<p>Blockchain technology has been deemed to be critical for the future of data storage by some, and for good reason. It introduces features like immutability, security, and decentralisation, allowing organisations to verify events, timestamp actions, and ensure real-time compliance.</p>



<p>Blockchain is starting to gain adoption and momentum, as new high-powered protocols have emerged. Some of these protocols no longer have transaction fees and are capable of handling much more transactions per second than previous protocols, to support enterprise-grade applications. The potential of blockchain technology seems boundless, but organisations need to be practical in selecting a chain that meets both their compliance and regulatory obligations.</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Europechain by Zaisan</a> is a perfect fit for businesses that have security, compliance, and performance on their requirements list. Europechain delivers trust by allowing organisations to harness the power and scalability of robust blockchain technology while complying with EU legislation &amp; regulation.</p>



 Process Timestamping 



<p>A process timestamping tool like <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">FACT by Zaisan</a> manages business processes, captures proof of compliance, and tracks procedures. FACT delivers a versatile toolbox for the recording of events from a wide range of predefined smart form templates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flexible template builder enables the configuration of all types of checklists, including compliance checklists. These checklists are cryptographically hashed and time stamped on Europechain to increase security, visibility, and transparency. In addition, roles and activities can be assigned to enable task distribution and increase management awareness of task completion.</p>



<p>FACT is a multi-industry application with an intuitive user interface, allowing for fast and efficient onboarding. Furthermore, FACT has flexible team settings to facilitate the segregation of tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below are just some of the use cases for FACT.</p>



  Real-estate technical inspections  Food safety and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) compliance  Equipment maintenance-checks  Asset tracking  Road-safety management programs  Lean-six-sigma routines  Supplier/contractor-performance management  Safety management  



<p>FACT provides businesses with the opportunity to minimise repetitive, paper-based tasks and maximise the efficiency of employees, with the added benefit of having all events timestamped and added to Zaisan to ensure transparency and completion of time-sensitive tasks. The feature-rich system also allows for visibility through notifications and the reporting dashboard, which can aid in providing insight into team performance and task delivery.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



  FACT is a highly flexible, blockchain-based, mobile tool to manage business processes, capture proof of compliance, and track procedures  FACT provides businesses with the opportunity to minimise repetitive, paper-based tasks and maximise the efficiency of employees  FACT offers multiple uses cases, including -but not limited to- HACCP compliance, <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">compliance management</a>, asset tracking, safety management, and many others  Europechain is a perfect fit for businesses whose priorities are security, compliance, and performance

Their discussion is not just a journey through time (long cycles of computing, web2 to web3) and place (LA, SF, NYC), but into "the age of wonders". Are we at the end of (computing) history, or the beginning?</p><p>For more on the latest in web3 trends, be sure to subscribe to our podcast “<a>web3 with a16z</a>” (which is hosted by Sonal Choksi, the longtime former showrunner of this show) wherever you listen to your pods.</p>

 Scala Project — Diardi Elections <p>We know that you’ve all been patiently waiting for news from us regarding Diardi V8 (the next iteration of our network implementation) and the future of our project, and we’ve got something exciting for&nbsp;you!</p><p>As most of you know, we have planned to implement a staked election system for the Diardi Operators since its inception.</p><p>Now, after months of development effort, we present to you the Diardi Election Application as well as the process of how we will let everyone stake their XLA to try and get a spot on the Diardi operators list.</p> What are the Diardi Operators? <p>So if you’ve been out of the loop for some time, the Diardi operators are the ones who will produce blocks on the same chain (every 4th block) using a known address. Contrary to the pure Nakamoto consensus, this brings up the issue of decentralization. That’s where the catch lies: at the moment, if you look at the network, it’s being dominated by 2 or sometimes even just one&nbsp;pool.</p><p>This in itself is not that bad, as all (most) pool operators have been very open and cooperative with us. But the problem doesn’t end there. What if, by sheer chance, this one very large pool were to be attacked? Doesn’t that mean our entire network is now at the mercy of this one lonely server? To combat this, we thought to decentralize this issue by letting a group of members outside of the mining community publish blocks as checkpoint blocks.</p><p>A lot of 51%-attacks revolve around a pool mining a large number of blocks in private and releasing their largest chain to the public network, thereby rendering an entire set of blocks useless. This is very hard to do with Diardi in place, as the malicious pool operator (or the hacker of this malicious pool) must not only have a massive amount of compute power but also have colluded with many Diardi operators as well to conduct an&nbsp;attack.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>It’s pretty simple, actually. To ensure that the Diardi operators applicants are also worthy Diardi operators, we will have staked elections.</p><blockquote>Staked elections involve a user putting up a certain amount of XLA that he holds to showcase that he has the most monetary stake in the chain and thus more than anyone else to lose if the chain may be attacked.</blockquote>A screenshot showcasing the election application<p>We will take a snapshot of the Scala chain with all the user balances on October 31st, 2022. Users will get access to a special remote node that they can connect to with their seeds to send their vXLA (since this is now a forked chain) to our voting application; once the election period of 2 weeks is over, we will select the first Diardi operators (32 or 64) depending on the number of candidates.</p><p>⚠️ IMPORTANT: Please remember that balances sitting on exchanges will NOT be counted as your coins, and you will not be able to send that to the election application. So please move your coins to your own wallet before the snapshot date and move them back to the exchange after, if you’d like to, once the snapshot has concluded.</p> Compensation <p>The Diardi operators who get elected will be allowed to run Diardi nodes, providing them with 25% of all produced&nbsp;blocks.</p> Conclusion <p>If you are curious to know more about how Diardi works, check our Wiki: <a href="https://wiki.scalaproject.io/specifications/feature-desc/diardi">https://wiki.scalaproject.io/specifications/feature-desc/diardi</a></p><p>As usual, let us know on <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">Discord</a> or <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">Telegram</a> if you have any questions or comments.</p> Community 👋 <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact&nbsp;us:</p>  Website: <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">https://scalaproject.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">https://t.me/scalaofficial</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scalahq">https://twitter.com/scalahq</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/</a>  Scala Mining Stats: <a href="https://scalastats.com/">https://scalastats.com/</a>  Email: hello@scalaproject.io   <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/scala-project-diardi-elections-c5467832c4df">Scala Project — Diardi Elections</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 💡Validator Spotlight — Octeka&nbsp;💡  Validator Spotlights showcase the amazing people working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain.  1) Tell Us About&nbsp;Yourself <p>Hello, my name is Patrick, I’m from Quebec/Canada, and I run the Octeka validator on&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>I’ve been in the gaming industry for almost 20 years, working on a lot of well-known titles for companies like 2K and Ubisoft. I’ve worked in various roles, but my main ones were Build Master and Engine/Tools Programmer.</p><p>Also, I have some great experience in cloud computing and building cloud architecture from the bare metal. I do have a full server rack at home running OpenStack with Kubernetes, compiling code, running builds, and yes, also validating.</p><p>I’m very passionate about all technology-related stuff, and cryptocurrencies are one of my main interests.</p> 2) What brought you into crypto/web3 in the first&nbsp;place? <p>In the early days of ETH, a friend of mine was pushing blockchain mining, so I decided to build myself a mining rig and try my hand at&nbsp;it.</p><p>Even though Web3 has grown a lot, I still believe we are in its early days, still exploring/pushing its potential. So, I wanted to be part of the next big thing, and I think this is&nbsp;it.</p> 3) What is your experience in validating or web3 in&nbsp;general? <p>I’ve been playing around with Solidity to interact with smart contracts and went to the bottom of it by creating some&nbsp;.net and golang tools that helped me learn most of it. I might use that knowledge to build an app or a game, not sure which&nbsp;yet!</p><p>I’m also currently running a validator on both Findora and Harmony using multiple nodes at different locations to make sure to have good uptime, with metrics and alerts set up in case of emergencies.</p> 4) What makes your operation unique? Why should delegators stake with&nbsp;you? <p>Like most of my fellow validators, we are here to provide a solid, reliable validating service to anyone who would like to stake with&nbsp;us.</p><p>We have servers located in Canada, the United States, and also in Europe for redundancy and reliability.</p><p>Also, we keep a close look at our servers metrics, to make sure we always have the proper hardware and that everything is running smoothly. We use an alerting system to make sure we respond as quickly as possible to any problem that could&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Right now, we don’t have any commission fees, but when it happens, it will never go higher than 5%, and the gains will be used to stake on other validators.</p> 5) Why do you want to validate with&nbsp;Findora? <p>Like some of us, we learned about Findora from the Harmony.ONE community, and we liked the key idea of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Also, things seem to be moving for the chain, and it seems to have more and more communications every week, so we believe that bringing our validating experience to this chain is a great next step for&nbsp;us.</p> 6) Where can our community go to learn more about you or contact you? Do you have a validator dashboard link? <p>We are currently building our website, but we are always reachable through Twitter or Telegram (@octeka_one). You can see our findorascan profile&nbsp;<a href="https://findorascan.io/node/3E108EA444087E0D804A39A665AEB0D319E94BC0">here</a>.</p><p>Learn more about Octeka on <a href="https://findorascan.io/">findorascan.io</a></p> About Findora <p>Scaling privacy for the future of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography. An innovative layer-1, it combines a native UTXO ledger optimized for privacy with an EVM extension for programmability and interoperability. Developers can leverage either model as they build dApps with auditable privacy.</p><p>We appreciate our developers and would love to onboard you to the Findora ecosystem.

 <br> <p>In his work “<a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html">A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto</a>” Eric Hughes wrote, “Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.” The weight of this comment may not be immediately obvious but is increasingly relevant in our day-to-day lives.<br><br>The importance of online privacy is relevant to everyone—not just users who are looking to avoid the scrutiny of authorities for reasons related to questionable activities. Even users who are comfortable with having their every move online tracked should be aware that large data breaches regularly occur at major companies and governments. These events expose users’ personal data to hackers, which can be exploited in various ways.</p> Everyone on the Internet Should Understand Online Privacy. But do they even care?<br> <p>As a journalist and online privacy advocate, Glenn Greenwald pointed out in a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters?language=en">widely-circulated </a>2014 TED talk that the Internet was, at one time, thought of as a new frontier for democratization and liberation. According to Greenwald, the internet could now be considered a "zone for mass surveillance". <br><br>Greenwald claims that some feel there’s no harm in mass online surveillance because it only threatens those who are engaging in illegal activities. This line of thinking includes the idea that only those who have something to hide should be concerned about their privacy. It frames the notion that some people wouldn’t want to share every aspect of their lives with the government as defensive behavior. In 2010, Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, claimed that privacy should not even be expected online as it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy">no longer a social norm</a>. This is a dangerous belief, which unfortunately seems widely accepted in mainstream narratives despite its negative effects on individual liberties. Why should one care about privacy? Is one truly free to speak without it?<br><br><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/373338/global-opinion-concern-online-privacy/">According to one study published in 2022</a>, more than half of internet users are concerned about their online privacy. Let’s take a look at some key concepts and terms relevant to online privacy and steps users can take to better control and protect their data.</p> Important Concepts Linked to Online Privacy <p>Common concerns that relate to online privacy may include the preservation of sensitive personal and financial data and users having a say in who they are advertised to.</p> Personal Data <p>Personal data is any information that can be used to identify you. It can include your name, address, social insurance number, birthday and can also extend to your entire financial, educational, employment and medical history. Information including online identifiers and browsing history can also be considered personal information. One qualifier that defines personal data is that it is <a href="https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/the-gdpr-what-exactly-is-personal-data">clearly about one particular person</a>. <br></p><p>Personal data is considered valuable by advertisers and regulatory bodies alike, and the collection and sharing of users’ personal data is an important aspect of how many companies and apps are configured. Personal data is collected by websites, social media platforms, employers and more. This data is stored on web servers across the world, often changing hands in ways that are unknown by the users themselves. The selling of data is often part of the fine print and terms of service when using apps and websites, and is defined under things like GDPR or CCPA.Such regulations are often thought of as privacy friendly, but really only state that you have to consent to the sale of your personal data.</p> Online Encryption <p>One step that users can take to make themselves less vulnerable online and to put their privacy more into their own hands, is by focusing on apps and software that offer encryption. Encryption refers to the scrambling of the data stored and shared online, aiming to allow only trusted entities to interact with personal data. <br>Encryption ensures that only those with the relevant access keys are able to view the related content. It allows users to have more, but not ultimate, security over the information they share. Using a secret passphrase known only to the sender and receiver to unlock information is an excellent way to improve your security.<br><br>End-to-end encryption refers to encryption wherein only a user and their intended recipient are communicating without the ability of even the communication service to view or collect users’ data. While some messaging services are said to offer end-to-end encryption, some online security advocates challenge these claims as the services may provide “backdoor” access to government bodies. Oftentimes, the justification for this is to collect data necessary for fighting crime.</p> Threats to Online Privacy <p>When it comes to ways of protecting personal data, there are steps that individuals can take to decrease the risk of security breaches and minimize the amount of information readily available to unwanted external parties. Tools from ethical, security-minded companies can help users store and share data with more control, making use of the latest web security technology.<br><br>While taking steps at the individual level can enhance users’ online privacy, there are policies at the institutional level that can make it difficult to avoid the collection and sharing of personal data. In these cases, simply learning about policies and programs that involve your personal data is a way of being more aware of circumstances when your data could be collected, and of knowing how it could be used.</p> Mass Surveillance <p>Signing up for any new online account or app often involves agreeing to a range of terms and conditions wherein users permit organizations to collect agreed-upon information in exchange for the use of the application. Whether it’s on computers or phones and whether or not users are aware of what information is being collected, government bodies and private organizations alike are able to create detailed profiles of people based on data they willingly provide to websites. Often, users don’t even read the terms and conditions when signing up for a new service. <br><br>Controlling the amount your private data is collected may be increasingly relevant as smart cities that adopt surveillance technologies become more prevalent. Mindful online conduct may include making a list of each of the accounts and online services you subscribe to and determining whether the information you knowingly provide to each of these entities is worth the benefits of each service.</p> Online Privacy Regulations <p>Data breaches affecting companies as large as Facebook have sparked conversations as to the degree of involvement government policies should have regarding the collection and use of personal data. While government regulation is often necessary to lay the foundation for public market participation, the excess of such is also a risk factor that commonly limits progress.<br><br>As whistleblower disclosures have shown, government bodies themselves may also collect and use data in ways that average internet users could not have anticipated or foreseen. In the United States, for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act">all phone and internet data has been monitored by Federal law enforcement since the ‘90s</a>. This data is unfathomably vast, so agencies including the NSA and the FBI create systems that analyze this data for use by intelligence and local law enforcement agencies.<br></p> Software Vulnerabilities and Secure Protocols <p>There are a number of security risks associated with typical internet usage. Free, public Wi-Fi is becoming increasingly available—which is a boon for those who work on the go and those with limited data plans—but these free, public Wi-Fi networks can be easy targets for those seeking access to users’ personal data for nefarious purposes. <br><br>Adversaries can access unsecured devices on public networks, which can provide unfettered access to important personal information including credit card data, passwords and personal documents. When users’ privacy settings allow for file-sharing across a network, it’s an opportunity for hackers to implant malware on users’ devices, further compromising their online privacy.<br><br>There are steps diligent users can take to make themselves less vulnerable when using unsecured networks. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a> (virtual private network) creates a private network on top of an existing public network, improving security. VPNs also often include encryption, making stolen data less useful to hackers. <br><br>HTTPS is a protocol that helps to protect data by preventing access from parties aside from the primary user and the server they’re accessing, using encryption and a series of communication exchanges referred to as a “handshake.” Other security-minded steps include turning off sharing on devices on public networks and keeping Wi-Ffi off, aside from when it’s being used as devices are known to transmit some data even to networks users aren’t connected to.</p> Online Privacy and Bitcoin <p>Bitcoin is seen by many as being a new frontier for digital privacy. Its potential for decentralization means that users have more ability to control their own data and to have more agency in controlling decisions that relate to their privacy. <br><br>However, Bitcoin transactions are, by design, not confidential. Transactions on the block chain are secure, but their details are publicly viewable. When bitcoin is obtained in a way that is linked in some way to a user’s identity, and when information about transactions is shared, its pseudonymity in future transactions is easily negated. For example, if a user makes an online purchase using bitcoin, but does so through a regulated exchange which requires the completion of KYC processes, then pseudonymity can easily be compromised.<br><br>There are inherent issues associated with many bitcoin exchanges and users may be left with a sense of uncertainty with regards to how their personal data is being used. Developers may be able to collect sensitive personal information and the exchanges themselves are vulnerable to hacks, as seen in the Mt. Gox debacle and many since.</p> Wasabi 2.0 <p>Initiatives like <a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/">Wasabi Wallet</a>—which offer anonymous communication using the Tor network, coin mixing and non-custodial personal control over private keys—can go a long way towards putting users in control of their bitcoin and retaining their privacy online. <br><br>The anonymization strategy employed by Wasabi Wallet and other Bitcoin privacy solutions is called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coinjoin.asp">coinjoin</a>. Coinjoins are a collaborative bitcoin transaction. Users send their bitcoins to themselves with other users at the same time to reclaim their privacy. When the transaction occurs, everyone’s bitcoins are mixed with one another to make it much harder, if not impossible, to trace their transaction history.<br><br>As technology continues to grow into nearly every aspect of our lives, privacy as a resource is growing more scarce. We recommend the use of privacy tools, like Wasabi Wallet, to maintain your right to privacy. Consider taking control of your personal information to defend yourself from the intended (and unintended) repercussions of our increasingly digitised society.</p>

    <p>An NFT collection is a grouping of one or more NFTs, with or without images. Before you can create a collection, you must store the data (image and metadata) of your NFT collection in an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). However, the main reason for storing your NFT data in an IPFS is that you don’t lose it. Once your data is lost, your NFT becomes worthless.</p>
<p>So, if you create, sell, or buy an NFT, it is prudent that you make a copy of the NFT’s off-chain data in the cloud of a pinning service.&nbsp; By doing so, you can ensure that the off-chain data is accessible through a specific Base URI address in an IPFS hosting service. This allows you to upload the same data to two different nodes in a network or repeatedly upload/download the off-chain data and still maintain consistency.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we are using <a href="https://www.pinata.cloud/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwhY-aBhCUARIsALNIC07w73iECD--ubIeyIqbZPkyTbtmv-sCa7xEPUE_H8xBr6m5dcKrsJ8aAuIMEALw_wcB">Pinata</a> as the IPFS pinning service for storing your NFT data.</p>
 Prerequisites 
<p>Before you can begin using Pinata, make sure that you have the following:</p>
 
 Pinata Account 
 
<p>Note: We use Pinata as our pinning service to IPFS. If you are using a different pinning service, it is highly recommended that you save your asset locally as a backup.&nbsp;</p>
 
 NFT Assets 
 
 
 
 
 Associated image(s) and Metadata 
 
 
 Text Editor&nbsp;<br><br>
 
 You can use any text editor 
 
 
 
 Preparing your NFT Assets 
<p>Perform the following steps in preparing your NFT assets for IPFS upload:</p>
<p>1. Collect all of your NFT assets in one folder in your localhost computer:</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Convert each asset into ‘Document’ file type by:</p>
<p>a. Right click each file, click ‘Get Info’.</p>
<p>b. Under Name &amp; Extension, delete the file extension (e.g., .png, .jpeg, .mp3)</p>
<p></p>
<p>c. The pop-up, Are you sure you want to remove the extension? appears. Click Remove.</p>
<p></p>
<p>d. After deleting the file extension, the file type is now Document. Repeat these steps for all other assets.</p>
<p></p>
 Uploading your NFT Asset Folder to the IPFS 
<p>3. Upload your NFT asset folder to Pinata to get the folder’s content id (CID) number.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Create a metadata file for each asset with associated CID.</p>
<p>a. Each asset you’ve uploaded needs to have an associated file with metadata attributes (formatted in JSON). Download a sample metadata file <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/sample-nft-metadata">here.</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>b. Check that the image URL is ipfs://{CID of assets}/{name of asset}</p>
<p>c. Format the metadata file with the associated token ID (e.g. 1, 2, 3)</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Upload folder of metadata files to Pinata. Afterwards, copy the CID number by using the copy icon.</p>
<p></p>
 Adding your BASE URI to the Token Generator 
<p>6. Get Base URI for <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">Token Generator</a>. In the Token Generator, paste the CID number into the Base URI field. Make sure you&nbsp; format the Base URI as:</p>
<p>ipfs://{metadata CID}/</p>
<p></p>
<p>Simply follow the remaining steps on the <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">TokenMint Token Generator</a> to create your own NFTs!</p>
 About TokenMint 
<p>TokenMint is an easy-to-use platform for anyone to launch a token using custom tokenomics without having to know a single line of code. It streamlines and simplifies the tokenization process, making creating a fungible token and non-fungible token (NFT) easy and quick.</p>
<p>TokenMint’s NFT creation and minting feature is currently on <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">testnet</a> and is free to everyone to use.&nbsp;</p>

         Augmenting Human Intellect, No Code Required                <p>By Megan Finnerty</p><p>Photography: CAYCE CLIFFORD</p><p>Published October 13, 2022</p>            <p>Notion’s co-founders are growing an enduring business by nurturing the creative community.</p>       



 
 
   
<p>In 2015, Notion co-founders Simon Last and Ivan Zhao had removed from their lives anything that wasn’t writing code and eating noodles. Three years into building their startup, they scrapped the code powering their app. They were running out of money. They’d just laid off their only three colleagues. And to stretch what money they had left, they’d moved from San Francisco to Kyoto, Japan, which was less than half as expensive.</p>



<p>In the downstairs of a rented two-story house so small that only a traditional Shoji screen separated their bedrooms, Zhao says they spent 18 hours a day at their laptops, not bothering to dress, clean or cook. “We were just, code, code, code,” Zhao remembers. “Then, ‘Hey, let’s go out for food.’ Then, we go eat, go back to work, and do it again.” Neither man could speak or read Japanese, but Zhao is from China, and he could read the menus well enough for them to figure out “beef” or “chicken.” (About 70 percent of the writing, Japanese Kanji, was similar to the Chinese Hanzi he grew up reading.)</p>



<p>The 20-somethings didn’t mind the drudgery or the lack of personal space. They were consumed with reinventing a piece of software called Notion, and if they couldn’t figure out how to turn it into an everyday tool people would want to run on their computers or smartphones, they would have laid off their friends, burned through millions in angel investment and wasted years of their lives for nothing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two believed Notion was worth this effort because they were trying to make it into something that would revolutionize people’s relationships with computers and software. They wanted to make software that could empower a global community of everyday people to make their own apps and tools without having to write code, all to unlock new levels of creativity and productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, having added a third co-founder in COO Akshay Kothari and grown from a cult following to more than 20 million users, Notion has a multi-billion-dollar valuation and is aiming to unseat Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace as the enterprise-level collaborative productivity software. By all accounts, the mad dash in Kyoto paid off. The founders have time to dress properly, and even enjoy the occasional home-cooked meal. But, in many ways, their biggest challenges are still ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>In 2013, Zhao and Last raised about $2 million from angel investors—a mix of friends, family and friends of friends. Zhao, who had learned to code as a child, had a big vision—to enable people to use any computing device with the same creativity and flexibility that they bring to their writing, allowing them to approach devices as a new medium, whatever that might mean someday. Zhao was trying to make good on ideas that he describes as romantic, ones developed by his idols: tech pioneers Alan Kay, Ted Nelson and Douglas Engelbart. These men saw computers as a way to help humans be more imaginative, more creative, more capable of leveraging intelligence in ways not yet imagined. In the 1960s and ’70s, these men, particularly Engelbart, envisioned a future in which people used computers to design their own software to accomplish whatever they wanted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, billions of us use computers, yet only <a href="https://www.future-processing.com/blog/how-many-developers-are-there-in-the-world-in-2019/">0.34 percent</a> of the global population are software developers. Most everyone has to download an app or run a piece of software to accomplish a task. Zhao compares this to how, prior to the spread of literacy with the invention of the printing press around 1440, only clergy and scribes could read and write, so the rest of the population never composed great works of literature, soul-stirring poetry or world-changing scientific research.</p>



<p>In San Francisco, while Zhao still believed he was right about his grand vision, he realized he was wrong about his market. It was a crucible moment. The first version of Notion was a tool that non-coders could use to make their own apps. Disappointingly for the co-founders, it turned out, even if they were Last’s and Zhao’s actual friends, non-coders didn’t want app-building software. “It was not really a product,” Zhao says. “It didn’t work because the product was not understandable for most people. It was more for nerdy tech crowds. We realized, in order to be a big software tool, we have to start from a product that is already ubiquitous, that people recognize, and hide the tool-making, hide the programming ability, like how you sugarcoat broccoli. Nobody wakes up wanting to make software. Well, very few people.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most people, he reasoned, wake up and want to use their computers to browse the internet, to write or to solve a work problem. Even though he had started Notion to help humans use computers for more than word processing, he realized this new version would have to be just that, only built with some flexible tool-making capabilities layered in—closer to, he imagined, the kind of software his idols had once envisioned. However, when they rolled out this new Notion to their friends, they saw the framework they’d chosen to build with, a Google web framework called Web Component, crashed constantly. “Bugs came from everywhere,” Zhao says. “It was unstable. People were losing their content.” Zhao and Last would have to start over using the more stable React Libraries (now the market leader), just as they were burning through the last of their investment.</p>



<p>“It was kind of like despair, I would say. I almost never had that feeling before,” Zhao remembers. Things looked pretty bad from the outside, too, says Kothari, who had been one of Notion’s angel investors. He and Zhao met every six months or so, sharing insights and suggesting possible employees. “I thought [investing] was a mistake, because the company didn’t go anywhere,” he says. “It almost ran out of money.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last had joined Notion while in college, so as the older founder, Zhao was left to decide how to save the business: “And that feels like—fuck it. Let’s just reset this.” So Zhao laid off their three colleagues and decided to reimagine Notion with fresh code and a fresh start. He remembers this moment as sad, of course, but he didn’t second-guess the decision. He said it felt like almost an animal instinct. Now just the two of them, Zhao and Last wanted to go somewhere cheaper than San Francisco, and somewhere they’d never visited. They picked Kyoto, almost on a whim, and subleased their spaces in San Francisco.</p>



<p>“It was a lot of fun, some of the happiest times,” says Zhao. “It was very intense and focused. A brand-new code base is always happy. There’s no legacy code. You don’t need to clean up the whole thing. It’s almost like you have a brand-new house—you can decorate however you want, versus the old house, you have to clean, repaint the walls and all that.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Today, seven years after that sweaty, exciting time in Kyoto, Last and Zhao are back in San Francisco and Notion is working as an all-in-one collaborative productivity software. Their bright, loft-style offices have sisal mat floor coverings, Michel Ducaroy’s famously curving Togo couches and Alvar Aalto’s iconic, simple wooden Artek stools. The tones are neutral and warm. Zhao refers to overhead fluorescent lighting as “hell.” He chose all the furniture and finishes, putting as much thought into the offices as he has into the product. A portrait of Engelbart hangs prominently in a first-floor hallway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notion is staking a claim in a market dominated by giants—Microsoft and Google, with more than 2 billion users between them. Yet, Zhao says, within a decade, every software company could be considered a competitor, because Notion will eventually be able to make any kind of tool, or will be able to integrate with countless pieces of software. Today, Zhao estimates Notion can consistently replace about a dozen pieces of software like project-management or list-making tools. This matters because the software-replacement opportunity is massive: companies with more than 2,000 employees use an average of 175 pieces of software, and smaller companies use an average of 73, according to Okta’s 2021 Business at Work study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At its most basic, Notion enables people to use just one interface to make, edit and customize documents; to manage projects; to create information-sharing wikis; and to design all kinds of charts and tables. It set itself apart from competitors—which also include Dropbox, Atlassian and Oracle—through a growing set of clever, built-for-purpose templates such as to-do lists, product roadmaps and client databases. There is a whole Notion-adjacent economy, filled with quirky templates, like this <a href="https://thenotionbar.gumroad.com/l/renaissancealbum">album credit</a> tracker for Beyonce’s “Renaissance,” created by Notion-optimization consultant Frances Odera Matthews. Notion’s design also distinguishes it, with a restrained, black-and-not-quite-white aesthetic. “It’s brown,” Zhao says, pointing to what very much looks like the white background of a Notion page pulled up on a laptop. “You can’t see it, but you can feel it.” Notion’s biggest differentiator is how users tailor it to their personal or professional needs by incorporating whatever mix of blocks—charts, databases, notes, videos, photos, lists, maps—they want to use to accomplish a task.</p>



<p>Sequoia Capital partner Dannie Herzberg is proud to be among Notion’s “power users,” running her work life on it. She was head of enterprise sales at Slack when she met Zhao, who visited the offices often to learn from the company’s startup journey and lay the groundwork to make Slack Notion’s first integration. Zhao had cold-emailed Herzberg, saying he was a fan of how Slack built its product and brand, and, impressed by the energy in the email, she invited him to drop by the office. “He came to the Slack office, which was brand new and very nicely designed in this midcentury-modern way. I’d never had a guest come to the office and touch the tables, and appreciate the quality of the leather of the chairs. I marveled to myself, ‘Who is this man?’ He is so discerning and so curious.” Herzberg liked Zhao so much that she downloaded Notion immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia partner Mike Vernal, a former Facebook vice president, was an original Notion angel investor back in 2013. Soon after joining Sequoia in 2016, he noticed startups increasingly running their businesses on Notion, using it to send memos or make decks. Sequoia led Notion’s 2021 round of $250 million. “For a two- or three-year window, Notion was high on our list of companies that we admired from afar,” Vernal says. His impression of founders flocking to Notion is more than anecdotal. Zhao says that 68 percent of the most recent Y Combinator class ran their companies on Notion. “And they’re the future Fortune 500 companies,” he says. “So it’s less about where we are today, but it’s like, we want to be the place where future companies are operating.” That said, with the new investment money, Notion and its backers also want it to be the place companies are operating today.</p>

<p>***</p>



<p>Zhao grew up with his mom in Ürümq, a city of 4 million in China’s northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, also known sometimes just as Xinjiang. There, he learned how to code as a participant in the International Olympiad in Informatics, a grade school mathematics and computer science competition. He also developed an appreciation for aesthetics as a student of traditional Chinese watercolor. When he was in high school, his mom wanted more for his education, so she moved them to Vancouver. On the west coast of Canada he learned English from watching “Spongebob Squarepants.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao attended the University of British Columbia, and, figuring he already understood computer science, focused on cognitive science and art, having picked up photography his senior year of high school. He says his artist friends helped him hone his sense of aesthetics, watching movies with his film studies friends, helping his then-girlfriend and her friends with fashion school portfolios. In 2012, as he prepared to graduate, many of his friends needed online portfolios. “I’m the nerd of the friend circle, so I started coding people’s websites for them. And there were no good tools,” Zhao said. “They’re all kind of ugly, right?” He made maybe five websites. “Then, I realized, it doesn’t make sense. Those people have taste; they just don’t have good tools.”</p>



<p>Around this time, Zhao read a 1962 paper by Engelbart called “Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework” that crystallized his thinking. Engelbart conceived of computers as a way to increase humanity’s capacity to solve complex problems, not to just run computations, which was the bulk of computer work at the time. He wrote, “Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions….”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While humans were routinely using computers to do this kind of work by the early 2010s, when Zhao was reading this paper, he saw that a crucial element of Engelbart’s vision was still missing. Nearly all people now relied on computers to help them do all kinds of things, yet most couldn’t write their own code. And until more people could do that, Zhao felt that the real promise of human-computer interaction would be limited to the creativity of coders, who tend to write software that solves their own problems, or they write software that people will pay to use. They don’t write hyper-specific code to do a clever, unique thing an individual person wants to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was like, ‘Holy shit. This is what I’m going to do.’ There’s nothing else that has more leverage to use my skill set than to help people to use their computer beyond just a typewriter. At that point, that’s where Notion’s idea got formed.” Zhao became obsessed with democratizing access to the tool-making ability of coding. He saw the idea of people being able to make their own software as integral to their ability to be creative, to shape their own environments, to create culture and value. He wanted coding to stop being a tiny community of specially educated people. He envisioned a tool that could turn the world into a community of no-code software builders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao started working on the first version of Notion while day-jobbing at the ebook startup Inkling in San Francisco. But within a year or so, he left Inkling and started to assemble his team. Zhao and one of his early Notion colleagues were members of a “small scene” of people passionate about visually oriented programming environments who followed each other on Twitter, sharing projects and insights. The colleague mentioned one of the people in the scene, a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, named Simon Last, was doing interesting work. Zhao looked at his portfolio, which featured, among other things, code that enabled people—kids, presumably—to add body parts to a creature based on their answers to either/or logic gates. Zhao reached out and asked Last for a meeting. He offered Last an internship, showing Last the same Notion prototype he’d shown Kothari during the investment conversation. “There is a saying, ‘Education is different from schooling,’ and he understood this,” says Zhao.</p>



<p>Zhao remembers sneaking Last into a nearby bar, the Trick Dog. It shared a bathroom with a coffee shop, so Last would go in the coffee shop and come out via the bathroom into the bar. “And then he decided to drop out of school and just work on this full time with me,” remembers Zhao. Last’s dad visited to appraise Zhao, perhaps suspecting the men were doing things like sneaking into bars. “His dad’s a school principal,” Zhao says with a laugh. “We shook hands, [I had to show] I am not a crazy person.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>In March 2016, after the year in Kyoto testing iterations of Notion’s functionality and design, endlessly pulling up pages on the design software Figma, Zhao editing in one area, Last finessing elsewhere, they launched Notion 1.0. This version had Notion’s iconic, black-and-not-quite-white look, and the ability to do word processing, of course, as well as to make drag-and-drop to-do lists and wikis, and it had more than 30 document templates for things like product roadmaps. The men didn’t yet charge to use Notion; they wanted to grow users first. Zhao’s mom loaned him $150,000 to keep the startup afloat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get users, Zhao and Last hatched a plan to get Notion featured on Product Hunt, a site that lets people submit tech products on daily lists for the community to comment and vote on. The product with the most votes in 24 hours earns additional promotion, as well as international tech-community hype. Their plan involved asking the famed entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant, who had invested in Notion early, to wake up at midnight, when the new day’s list opened, and to tweet to his followers to vote for Notion on Product Hunt.</p>



<p>“And he has a bazillion Twitter followers,” says Zhao. (Today, Ravikant has slightly less than a bazillion, at 1.9 million.) The gambit worked. “That kickstarted our product on Product Hunt. We got a lot of traction there.” Soon, tech insiders, people involved with Y Combinator and other startup incubators, were using it. That’s how Vernal and others at Sequoia started seeing Notion pop up. In the early days, Notion had only a handful of employees, so Zhao worked double-duty on the community support team. He says this helped him understand how to make Notion more useful, and it gave him a sense of Notion’s growing community—people smitten with the minimalist aesthetic, or who loved customizing templates to make book-reading logs or skincare diaries. As he readied Notion for a 2.0 version, Zhao would also reply to users directly on Twitter, building community there by showing that real people were behind the product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vernal said this focus on nurturing community was key to getting a foothold in the product world. “It would be futile and foolhardy to try to compete with Microsoft and Google in a top-down way, to build a similar product and sell against them,” says Vernal. “Instead, they found a small group of really die-hard fans that carried the product with them. They looked for ways to cultivate the community at every step along the way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>***</p>



<p>The Notion community ballooned in March 2018 when David Pierce, then the personal technology columnist at The Wall Street Journal, wrote a glowing review of Notion 2.0. The headline read: “The Only App You Need for Work-Life Productivity.” The article called the updated version a “rare renaissance app.” This new version featured new project management capabilities and relational databases, the kinds of everyday tables and spreadsheets that power countless projects and companies. Notion’s innovation was letting users configure views of those databases in customizable ways, so different people could see the same information presented in different ways. They started charging users monthly subscription fees between $4 and $10, and began turning a profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao was unfazed by this success. He focused instead on evolving the product toward his original vision of empowering people to make their own tools, and on growing Notion as a business. The team was only about eight people, but he had just the person in mind to call to help them grow into their next phase. That summer, Kothari, one of Notion’s angel investors, was working for LinkedIn in India, and was visiting San Francisco. He and Zhao met up, just as they always had. This time, Zhao offered him a job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kothari was born and raised in Ahmedabad, a city of 8 million in India’s western Gujarat state. His parents sacrificed to send him to school in America, so Kothari says he did nothing but study when he got to Purdue University in Indiana. After graduating in 2007 with a degree in electrical engineering, he worked for an alum at a Los Altos, California, investment firm. After a year, he didn’t get the H-1B visa he’d need to stay working in America. As a backup, he’d applied to Stanford University, knowing that if he got in, he could remain in the country as a student. There, Kothari, liberated because he was paying his own way, took a design thinking bootcamp course just because it sounded like fun.</p>



<p>“It’s like, everybody can be a designer. You can be a designer. I can be a designer. And I was like, ‘This sounds amazing,’” Kothari remembers with a laugh. “And we did all sorts of really wonky projects. As an electrical engineer, I was like, ‘Oh my God! What did I sign up for?’ I think the first project was to redesign how people eat ramen noodles. I was pushed to go talk to people in supermarkets when they were buying ramen. And just talk to people in restaurants, observe how they’re eating ramen, and see if you can change something about their experience. And I felt so uncomfortable, but I stuck with it.”</p>



<p>As part of a class project in 2010, he created the news aggregation app Pulse in about six weeks and soon turned it into a business. A year later, Zhao posted on the blog Hacker News that he was moving to San Francisco to find a job. Kothari was a heavy user of the site, visiting multiple times a day to weigh in on conversations, to see what other developers were up to and to recruit. Kothari remembers that when Zhao posted, he shared a game app he’d developed in 2010 called “Three Degrees of Wikipedia,” which is no longer available. Wired wrote about it, and the Apple App Store featured it. Zhao remembers the day when he suddenly started making money from it in $.99 cent increments. “That day felt like Christmas. I was playing basketball and found out, and I was like, ‘What the fuck?!’” he says with a laugh. Kothari said he thought it had a beautiful, clean design, and he happened to be looking for a designer. “I reached out on a whim,” he said. (Kothari still has the email.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao chose Inkling instead. Within three years, Kothari had sold Pulse to LinkedIn for $90 million, and Zhao had started Notion. It would be Kothari’s first investment. “I still remember his pitch. And at that point…it was really just the ambition of the project that resonated with me,” Kothari says. “He’s out there, just trying to democratize software, make it so that everybody can put these building blocks together.” Kothari said he was so impressed with the scope of Zhao’s vision that he thought about Notion for months after the pitch, ultimately calling him and offering Zhao a bigger investment. “He was kind enough to take it,” Kothari says.</p>



<p>Over the years, Kothari rose through the ranks at LinkedIn, becoming vice president of product and moving to India’s tech center, Bengaluru, to help run LinkedIn India as it expanded. So by the time the men met up in 2018, Kothari had built new processes, teams and cultures inside a company with thousands of employees all over the world. He was who Notion needed. After a few months convincing his wife that they could reinvent their lives in San Francisco, Kothari joined as chief operating officer. His first job was six months of answering support-desk tickets. He talked to thousands of customers and grew to understand the use cases and depth of the product—setting him up, he says, to figure out how to build out the rest of Notion. Zhao sees Last as his product co-founder and Kothari as his business co-founder. He refers to Kothari as a human stem cell, a person who can spot any need in the company, design a plan to do the work, master the work and then eventually hire the right person to lead the new team doing that work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around this time, Notion was at just under a million users, and investors were trying to win the founders over by sending cookie dough and dog treats and by showing up at the company’s gated office in the Mission District, according to a 2019 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/technology/start-ups-rejecting-venture-capital.html">New York Times</a> story. Vernal remembers Notion’s first few offices had a no-shoes policy, and when he sent Sequoia partners to learn about the company, he would remind them to wear good socks. Notion was profitable, so the founders didn’t seek official funding rounds. Instead, the company focused primarily on growing the community. They did this, Zhao says, by building relationships with power users. These were the kind of people who took it upon themselves to translate the Notion user guide into Korean because it was only available in English; who ran the Notion subreddit, now with 200,000 subscribers, and who ran the Notion Facebook groups in Korea and the Middle East, both with tens of thousands of members. Zhao saw these people as members of a community, offering them early access to new features, face time with Notion team members and the opportunity to give input on features. He had a hunch that investing in individual users would ultimately get Notion into big companies. He imagined these people would like Notion so much, they’d keep using it at work. Eventually, this hunch would prove right.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>For two years, Kothari did all kinds of jobs, built out playbooks and hired leaders to run the new teams, before moving on to the next business need. By the start of the pandemic, Notion had about 40 employees and they’d raised about $50 million as an insurance policy against pandemic uncertainty, says Kothari. They needn’t have worried, and they haven’t spent it. As the world pivoted to remote work, signups grew. After more than a year of pandemic lockdowns, high school and college students started streamlining the overlap of remote school and remote friendship by using Notion to organize their lives—and they were talking about it on TikTok. In viral videos, Gen Z power users would show off the ways they’d customized Notion to help them get more out of their hobbies and to collaborate on school projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, on New Year’s Day in 2021, as Notion workers were relaxing at home, Kothari and Zhao started getting alerts saying Notion had crashed. They’d seen it coming, says Zhao, like a Doomsday clock. Every day of the pandemic added more users, and they were running out of database storage. They knew they needed to move Notion onto multiple databases, but they hadn’t prioritized it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bleary from the night before, Notion team members suddenly had to explain to their roommates, spouses and kids that they had to work. The site was down for four nerve-wracking hours. “It was pretty much all hands on deck,” Kothari says. Zhao remembers eight-hour Zooms, day after day, after the crash. For the next six months, the company stopped building new features and instead focused on strengthening its infrastructure and migrating to multiple databases. When the work was done, the company celebrated with Zoom karaoke, complete with custom lyrics to “Amazing Grace.” Zhao, of course, has a copy stored on one of his Notion workspaces. “It was probably one of the best investments we made,” says Kothari. “Because the investments we made there allowed us to build Notion in a way that it could serve the teenagers using Notion for their use cases all the way to big enterprises using it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Kothari and Zhao think a lot about those big enterprises. Today, they are transitioning as a business from a startup to a mature company, and transitioning as a product from a tool with a cult following—the kind that people namedrop in Twitter profiles to show tech-design cred—to a tool used by the world’s largest companies. Growth has been rapid since the 2021 investments. As of summer 2022, Notion, which has 70 percent of its users outside of America, had opened offices in Dublin, New York City, Tokyo and Hyderabad, and had onboarded 300 employees, up from about 45 last year. The company is hiring for about 75 more positions. Competition to tell a compelling story to big companies is fierce. Other startups are working to build out similar capabilities; in 2021, Google Workplace added something like Notion’s interconnectivity with the launch of Smart Canvas, and Microsoft has done the same for 365 with its Fluid Framework upgrade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao’s early insights about what makes software ubiquitous—the ability to help people solve everyday life or work problems as easily and intuitively as a document editor—is now a key selling point. Notion leaders focus on explaining how, for the everyday office worker, it can be used “out of the box.” People and teams can customize it to greater and greater degrees, but average users can install it and start working immediately, using templates in the Notion catalog. In another move toward ubiquity, Notion launched the beta version of its public API in 2021, enabling developers to connect Notion to payment systems and customer relationship managers, further rooting it in a workplace software ecosystem. To make Notion more competitive, the company recently acquired the calendaring company Cron, the software-building company Flowdash, and the cloud integration and workflow automation platform Automate.io.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kothari and Zhao talk about this moment as still the “early innings” of Notion, and see Notion 1.0 as about lists, Notion 2.0 as about databases and the upcoming Notion 3.0 as about whole workflows. For example, they want to make Notion capable of publishing into varied content management systems with one click of a button. To do this, within the next 18 months or so, they will improve Notion’s project management capabilities, among other features, giving the software the final “Lego bricks” it needs to take on most SaaS companies, says Zhao.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a perfect world, Zhao sees the next iteration of Notion as changing life as profoundly as the iPhone changed people’s personal and work habits. “The iPhone totally opened up creation,” Zhao says. “There is a before and an after.” To grow the user base enough to drive this change, Zhao says it will take more than 18 months, of course: “In the next 5 to 10 years, Notion could be the front-end infrastructure for the world. Notion takes care of search, notifications, permissions. Just dream of a piece of software, and you should just be able to build that using Notion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao’s vision of creating a community of people empowered to make computers help them be more creative and productive has remained constant. Vernal tells a story about Zhao pitching Sequoia by walking through the last 50 years of computing history, with a <a href="https://www.notion.so/about">narrative arc</a> showing Notion as the next step in decades of iterations. “I thought it was the single best pitch I’d ever seen in my time here, a work of art,” he says. “And multiple other people told me that was one of the best pitches that they had seen at Sequoia.”<br><br>That story he told to Sequoia is the one Zhao started piecing together in college, when he read Engelbart’s paper about how humans could someday use computers to become more powerful problem solvers. It’s a story about how for years before Notion, so many pieces of software were just digitized versions of analog office tools—typewriters, file cabinets, desktop ledgers replaced by online document editors, databases and spreadsheets. Today, with tens of thousands of templates circulating, Notion reflects that when millions of people are empowered to make their own online tools, they mostly design trackers, project management tools and elaborate tables. Already today, some Notion-adjacent businesses are making more than $1 million a year by designing clever templates. On Etsy alone, there are tens of thousands of templates—meal planning, creating an astrology journal, and bootstrapping startup operations. But it won’t always look like this, says Zhao and Kothari. As Notion’s features become more robust, the tools we make with it will become more complex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the early days, 40 years ago, when personal computing started, the lines were blurry. The computing pioneers thought everybody would make their own tools, make their own software,” Zhao says, returning to a favorite idea. “And Notion’s mission is about software tool-making.” Even if those tools just look like black-and-not-quite-white document editors at first.</p>

 Meet our new hire — Kelsey Veldman, Junior Marketing Manager <p>#17 — This is the seventeenth post in our “Meet our new hire” series, where we introduce you to the latest additions to our team here at BlockWallet.</p><p>We’d like to welcome our latest team member, Kelsey Veldman! Kelsey is a well-rounded marketing manager with experience in managing marketing content, overseeing social media accounts, and pushing out project updates to the community. At BlockWallet, Kelsey plays a pivotal role in supporting the day-to-day marketing activities at BlockWallet.</p> What’s your job position? <p>I’m a junior-marketing manager at BlockWallet, and I support BlockWallets mission&nbsp;by:</p>  Working alongside marketing on the latest campaigns  Helping to keep our community up to date on our social platforms  Monitor feedback on our social platforms around user experience and features so our team can consider adding these to our&nbsp;roadmap   Which projects have you worked on&nbsp;before? <p>I’ve been part of the team at a decentralized finance platform, managing the marketing content, social media accounts, and project updates to our community.</p> When did you first get involved in&nbsp;crypto? <p>I’ve been involved with crypto professionally for over a year now. But my personal interest peaked in 2020 when I began following projects, keeping up to date with market trends and the progress crypto was making on the traditional markets. I’ve been investing in crypto since 2020, and I’ve been hooked ever since. I knew I wanted to understand more and grow my knowledge, and there’s nowhere better than with BlockWallet.</p> What made you interested in BlockWallet? <p>I did a lot of research trying to grow my knowledge in crypto, grow my portfolio, and also join an exciting crypto startup like BlockWallet. Overall, the product is what got me really interested. The focus on privacy and security resonated with me, and in addition to that, they had a stunning user experience. I couldn’t wait to jump on board. The team is amazing and everything about the role excited me! Marketing, crypto, and people orientated!</p> Why do you think privacy matters on blockchains? <p>Blockchain technology is built around data security, using both private and public keys to secure our data. Without privacy, we are constantly at risk of hacks and theft. No one wants their personal information freely available for anyone to access, and this is what blockchain promises.</p> Do you have any predictions on where crypto will be 5 years from&nbsp;now? <p>I think crypto adoption is inevitable. We see more and more countries accepting crypto as a form of payment and I think NFTs will find real-world use cases in our daily lives. My belief is that crypto will continue to grow until it’s embedded into everyone’s daily&nbsp;lives.</p> Parting thoughts <p>I’m really excited to have joined such a great team and look forward to connecting with the community more, bringing you all the latest updates, and watching the growth that BlockWallet is on track&nbsp;for.</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a privacy-first self-custodial browser extension wallet where you can store, send or receive crypto and interact with your favorite blockchain apps privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy often translates to security risks. BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating friction and making privacy accessible for everyone.</p><p>BlockWallet protects you and ensures privacy by default. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain apps, BlockWallet routes all node requests through Privacy Proxies, which mask the IP address and other metadata, that can be used to identify and track you on a blockchain. BlockWallet offers integrated Flash-Bot Protection, shielding you from sandwich attacks when you trade on DEXes. Meanwhile, the Phishing Protection feature helps you combat phishing scams by generating unique artwork on all sensitive pages.</p><p>BlockWallet is not a compromise. It’s privacy-first, but it still packs all features you would expect from a wallet. With full Web 3.0 support, the wallet allows you to connect to any&nbsp;DApp.</p><p>Become a part of the BlockWallet community today:</p><p><a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Homepage</a> | <a href="https://blockwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetBlockWallet">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/blockwallet">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/69gvNKatdb">Discord</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EKVZ2xWXEH">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://hello@blockwallet.io/">E-mail</a></p>

 Making privacy features on Findora easier for EVM developers. <p>Developers building on Findora’s EVM can utilize zero-knowledge privacy features of the UTXO layer with an upcoming enhancement currently under development.</p> Simplifying Privacy For EVM Developers <p>Findora currently offers auditable privacy on its UTXO ledger, but how do EVM developers take advantage of Findora’s zero-knowledge privacy features without having to learn new functions? An enhancement under development works to resolve that by allowing a way for developers to conduct private transactions on Findora’s EVM through an&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>At the moment, sending confidential transactions requires routing that transaction through the UTXO layer, which is parallelized to the EVM ledger. The current EVM does not support private transactions, making it necessary to build on the UTXO side with Findora’s zero-knowledge library. Findora’s EVM Privacy enhancement solves this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>To make it easier for developers to integrate Findora privacy features, the teams are working on an SDK solution that relies on pre-compiled contracts for plug-’n-play composability. EVM and Solidity Developers wouldn’t need to know Rust, UTXO, or zero-knowledge proofs, but instead, simply call a function from the&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>With the upcoming SDK, transactions can be automatically sent to the UTXO side for zero-knowledge privacy functions, and then sent to the EVM chain. The EVM developer will only need to use solidity to add privacy functions, using the same familiar calls and&nbsp;methods.</p><p>The architecture is still being developed but, when implemented, will give developers a whole new level of freedom to integrate privacy into their dApps. Simply put, EVM developers won’t need to learn a new language or framework to implement privacy solutions into their dApps on&nbsp;Findora.</p> Why Privacy Does Not Mix with an EVM Environment <p>EVM compatibility requires feature parity with Ethereum. Since Ethereum lacks native privacy features, native privacy features are unable to be directly implemented on Findora’s EVM environment and other EVM-compatible chains. This raises the question, how will Findora accomplish confidential transfers while maintaining feature parity with Ethereum?</p><p>Findora confidential transfers are possible because of the zero-knowledge cryptography on its UTXO chain, and that chain is parallelized with the EVM ledger through <a href="https://docs.findora.org/prism/overview">Prism Transfer</a>. Using Findora, EVM dApps can access private transactions only by being routed over Prism to Findora’s UTXO chain, and that architecture won’t change. However, to prevent developers from needing to understand UTXO and ZK, the team is working on an SDK solution to make life&nbsp;easy.</p> Putting Developers First <p>Once deployed, developers can quickly add privacy functions to their EVM&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>For example, a team might build a confidential version of gofundme on the blockchain that protects donors’ wallet addresses, or set up an on-chain payroll system that won’t broadcast workers’ salaries on-chain. Confidential transfers are an important part of any financial system, and they will be easy to integrate through Findora’s upcoming EVM privacy&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>Findora aims to give developers room for more creativity. Please share your thoughts not only on the proposed architecture but also on how dApps could leverage the technology.</p><p>To join the conversation, make suggestions, or offer ideas on how to improve documentation, please join Findora’s <a href="https://discord.com/channels/789009413976883220/890233521417908255">Developer support channel</a> on Discord or join the official <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Findora_Official/">Findora&nbsp;Reddit</a>.</p> About Findora <p>Scaling privacy for the future of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography.

 “If Science Can Save Us…” — BlueYard Conversations over Dinner in&nbsp;London <p>Scientific discovery drives technological change that leads humans to flourish. From climate breakdown, to shortages of essential resources, to existential threats that imperile our democratic systems, the need for a radical acceleration of scientific progress and breakthrough technology is more urgent than ever, and will be a defining challenge of this decade. Further, not only will scientific breakthroughs be essential, but also bringing these technologies to market and mass adoption, with sustainable economic&nbsp;models.</p><p>But “if science can save us,” we will need to exponentially multiply our science and engineering resources and abilities, unleash more entrepreneurial talent, repurpose vast amounts of long-term oriented capital, and foster a more urgent global political dialogue to increase the probability that we can overcome these challenges quickly enough in our lifetimes to make a difference. We will also need clear security and ethical frameworks to ensure this is not humanity’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter#The_Great_Filter">great filter</a>&nbsp;moment.</p><p>To help foster a conversation and share insights, on Thursday the 13th of October BlueYard is hosting an evening of conversations over dinner in London, with short talks and open conversations with leading entrepreneurs, scientists, and policy makers in the space. As always, attendance is invite-only and limited to 75–100 people, to ensure high-quality interactions.</p><p>The evening will include a keynote address by Astronomer Royal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Rees">Sir Martin Rees</a> centered around his forthcoming book: If Science is to Save Us, and short talks / open conversations with leading scientists, entrepreneurs, and policy-makers including <a href="https://www.silverlining.ngo/executive-director">Kelly Wanser</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lynas">Mark Lynas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryony_Worthington,_Baroness_Worthington">Baroness Bryony Worthington</a>, <a href="https://obifelten.com/about-obi/">Obi Felton</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Seldon">Sir Anthony&nbsp;Seldon</a>.</p><p>The event is at capacity, but we have reserved a handful of remaining seats for entrepreneurs, scientists, and curious minds from all corners of the intellectual world — if you are interested in attending, <a href="https://blueyard.typeform.com/to/pvGx9o0o">kindly register here</a> and we will get back to you&nbsp;shortly.</p><p>BlueYard is committed to keep our events safe and open to all. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OISqevTub7Q1DJO9Cn0bSlS4LHumXGGgLc7yIVI85sg/edit">View our code of conduct&nbsp;here.</a></p>

<p>For the past seven years, a dear friend who’s been in the trenches with me fighting the securitization of vulnerable populations as human data commodities on blockchain got drawn into a two-day webinar with well-known influencers in the crypto-skeptic space. She’d been excited about the opportunity to connect with an international network of people working on shared concerns. I know that hopeful feeling one gets when encountering a new group of folks who seem to get some parts of the puzzle but still have significant gaps. It’s a tantalizing opportunity to think you may be able to help fill in some of those holes, make a difference, and bring clarity to our collective understanding of the problem.</p>
<p>She did a great job. Her ten-minute presentation on ed-tech, impact finance, and blockchain identity starts at timestamp 15 minutes in the video below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This friend was the person who worked with the NAACP at the state and national level to pass a resolution opposing the requirement that any person obtains a blockchain digital identity to access public services, including public education, health services, food assistance, shelter, or legal support in the judicial system. You can find the text of that very timely (July 2019) resolution <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6028594bfa7b4d7d140a17b2/t/602b4d35ab0deb12bbc2b449/1613450551237/2019-Resolutions.pdf">here</a>; simply do a keyword search for “blockchain.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>She gave me invaluable insight into pay-for-success finance and how it presented in Silicon Valley at its earliest stages. I wrote a <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/12/22/silicon-valley-a-laboratory-of-smart-surveillance-and-privatization/">blog post</a> about the early pilot deals in December 2018. At the time, we had no idea that bio-computation and epi-genetics were being woven into prediction markets in human futures (see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO56_VtHPIAbU4Nt1itLeOSn">interview series</a> Jason Bosch, Leo Saraceno, and I did on Atomic Ecologies for background on that). So much has happened over the past five years and so quickly that it’s been hard to catch a breath to reflect on where we’ve been. What’s clear to me is that the ties between global finance, emerging tech, and California’s fraught, unresolved history of eugenics can no longer be ignored. I’m looking forward to the trip Jason and I have planned to the Eureka state to conduct field visits and try and rebalance some of these harmful energies in November. We’ll keep you updated from the road, so be sure to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AlisonMcDowell/videos">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for this friend, I probably wouldn’t have taken the time to dive deeply into this anti-crypto spectacle. But I was curious, and to be honest, the more I looked into who was behind this event, the more curious I got. If you follow my work, you’ll know I am no fan of crypto-currency and see its many failings. My primary concern, however, has always been the smart contract layer, digital identity in “smart environments,” risk analytics tied to “pay for success” financial dealings, and speculation on natural life. While many entered into the blockchain space as a financial hobby, I entered the door where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1BmJKCAR7I&amp;t=7738s">Shaun Conway</a> and impact investors planned to carry out data surveillance on toddlers in government-subsidized <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/08/14/digital-colonialism-south-africa-puts-preschoolers-on-the-blockchain/">South African pre-k programs</a> as a test run for global futures trading in behavioral compliance.</p>
<p>When you enter the “<a href="https://readynation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/db_files/Kauffman-ReadyNation%20PKSE%20Report%2012041922.pdf">invest in kids bonds</a>” door knowing there are plans to create asset-backed securities in toddlers and trade them (and perhaps short them) on global markets, the single-minded interrogation of cryptocurrency exchanges and NFT rip-offs feels woefully inadequate. If the stakes weren’t so high, it might be amusing to watch folks who’ve been swimming in the shark-infested waters of financial derivatives for years point fingers decrying crypto-Ponzi-schemers. Calls for better regulation and professed empathy for those who lost their savings to fraudulent digital money schemes ring a bit hollow once you realize many of the panelists’ livelihoods are intertwined with the same financial interests, journalism outlets, and think tanks that were enmeshed in the crash of the global economy via toxic-real estate debt products. These are the same folks who are now in the process of developing the risk modeling, tokenomics, and APIs needed to run the smart “Ricardian” contract, “sustainably resilient,” open-air prison.</p>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201123225052/https://littlesis.org/oligrapher/5759-securitized-income-sharing-agreements">https://web.archive.org/web/20201123225052/https://littlesis.org/oligrapher/5759-securitized-income-sharing-agreements</a>
<p>Our shared mixed reality panopticon is constantly remade through the cognitive warfare of algorithmic information management. Curated language and narrative tropes are strategically wielded in perpetual skirmishes of semiotics and steganography. Every data point you feed the machine is a psychometric goldmine. They know what you want to hear, manipulate your hopes and fears, and tell you just enough to keep you wondering and coming back for more. We’re wandering around in a Sugarscape simulation, an artificial society where only a fraction of the world’s population comprehends the game’s rules, the stakes, or how deep the illusion goes. That goes for what passes as “the resistance,” too.</p>
<p>The more I research, the more I’ve come to appreciate the challenge of pinning down “reality.” Each of us lives our version of the “reality” story burdened by tragically incomplete access to information, misunderstood motivations, hidden alliances, and communication snafus. The world’s a stage. We are players, whether we realize it or not. The master screenwriter tosses out last-minute script edits with plot twists that demand skillful improvisation and suspension of disbelief. The show must go on, so I keep moving through the next scene, the next act, hoping for moments of clarity as I try to stay ahead of the alt-consensus-reality apparatus. I hope that for the small audience that appreciates my outsider mom perspective, I can pierce the veil here and there to warn of potential misdirection, landmines, and conceptual boxed canyons.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I spent many hours watching videos from the two-day event, scanning the landscape of the people and institutions involved. Among them were <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/adjoint-distributed-ledger-technology-and-smart-contracts-for-real-world-finance-72a5cd83e063">Adjoint, Inc.</a> (smart contract financial settlement), Systemics (Ian Grigg’s <a href="https://cryptome.org/jya/digigold.htm">DigiGold</a> infrastructure, <a href="https://iang.org/papers/triple_entry.html">triple-entry accounting</a>, and <a href="http://www.systemics.com/docs/ricardo/issuer/contract.html">Ricardian smart contracts</a>), Brookings Institute (<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/product/impact-bonds/">educational impact bonds</a> and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Chapter-Five_Breakthrough.pdf">interspecies currency</a>), <a href="https://cebma.org/">Centre for Evidence-Based Management</a> (international NGO promoting data analytics of the kind that will be needed to run social impact deals), Bloomberg News, and The Financial Times. There were mid-level digerati promoting books and blogs whose larger purpose, as I saw it, seemed to be to obscure and dismiss the predatory nature of tokenized life in Web 3.0.</p>
<p>The symposium was organized by self-described crypto-skeptics Steven Diehl and Darren Tseng, finance sector programmers. They’ve been quite effective stepping into their assigned enthusiastic “callow geek” roles. Just a couple of well-intentioned young men looking to save the world from Bitcoin libertarians and Ponzi schemes, right? Pull back the curtain, and the plot thickens a bit. The excerpt below is from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704193305/http:/internetofagreements.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PDF-Stephen-Diehl-Transcript.pdf">transcript</a> of Diehl’s <a href="http://internetofagreements.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PDF-Stephen-Diehl-Transcript.pdf">presentation</a> on October 13, 2017, at Mattereum’s “Internet of Agreements” conference in London, focusing on coded law and smart contracts.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFlu61wJe2Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFlu61wJe2Y</a>
<p>“What does Adjoint Inc. do? I’m the CTO of this company, and we’re here in London. The boring side of our business is we create settlement networks for creating executable forms of industry standard contracts, like ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) and EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) agreements, for modeling the structure of financial products, such as derivatives, swaps, options on mutually distributed ledgers.</p>
<p>I don’t work in the public chain database at Adjoint; I work on private server networks between financial institutions, such as (something missing here, but this is the way it was stated in the transcript). Primarily we look at modeling executable forms of OTC derivatives contracts, and I’m particularly focused on taking a description of the semantics that involve the temporary rights and obligations of counterparties that are party to a derivatives trade, modeling that as code, and then putting that on a distributed database so that we can have more efficient settlement systems. The more interesting part of our business is that we also spend quite a bit of time doing research and development on what I would call third and fourth-generation blockchains. I do a bunch of research and development on verifiable computing and formal methods, things like zk-SNARKs (Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) and reasoning about the semantics of contracts formally.” Stephen Diehl</p>
<p>Vinay Gupta, head of <a href="http://internetofagreements.com/">Mattereum</a> and host of the event where Diehl spoke, was strategic architect of Joseph Lubin’s Consensys, an organization that has been working diligently since 2017 to frame out the infrastructure needed to scale DeFi, ReFi, and “green pill” social impact finance. This isn’t just about making ESG portfolios and stakeholder capitalism more accountable and efficient. A second goal, which may ultimately supersede creative debt finance as a force shaping society to fit cybernetic circuits, is the aggregation of impact tokens meant to fuel the machine learning that will refine artificial intelligence and possibly catalyze the Singularity.</p>
<p>Throughout the conference, most panelists downplayed Web 3 and blockchain, often asserting that there were no viable use cases and that these technologies didn’t solve any existing need. This was repeatedly stated by a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-pritchard-b6a9424/">gentleman</a> who had formerly served as a managing director in JP Morgan’s global technology office and a VP of their derivatives operations. His point was that distributed ledger technology is not new. This is correct; the concept dates back at least to the 1990s. However, at that time, there wasn’t the capacity to scale the sensor networks, unique digital identifiers, NEMs, and MEMs required to build out socio-technical / cyber-physical environments. He left JP Morgan in 2017 for greener fin-tech consulting pastures.</p>
<p>Had he stayed through the 2020 sale of the firm’s Quorum Enterprise Ethereum Platform to Consensys, he likely would have had a better handle on the role the smart contract layer plays in the financial settlement space. It is interesting to consider how derivatives and human capital management could one day interface in a matrix of embedded contracts operating in service of prediction markets and real-time risk analysis. One place to keep an eye on is Dallas, Texas, where the StriveTogether affiliate Commit has partnered with JP Morgan on block-chained cradle-to-career pathways for “opportunity youth.” For now, most people don’t recognize these pathways as cybernetic governance systems mediated by blockchain technology. Greenlight Credential’s competency-based transcripts store health and mental health data as badges. RedCritter NFT “good behavior” tokens train children to jump hoops for scrip at the ed-tech equivalent of the company store. Both are twenty-first-century upgrades to B.F. Skinner’s pigeon pellets. Rather than being trained to guide missiles with programmed pecks, tomorrow’s children will be taught to code immersive “reality” and digital “trust.”</p>
<p>The world planned by the technician class is meant to run on tokens, and Eric Schmidt and Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2kOmSh4h84&amp;t=147s">super excited about that</a>. In such a future, we would have infinite contracts with the built environment that would require us to deposit the proper token to activate X, Y, or Z “opportunity.” It is a whole new perspective on the “payment” space that requires us to reimagine “money” more abstractly – more like my friend Jason Bosch’s idea of “freedom tokens.” As such, the payment space is something we should all be keeping an eye on, especially now that “cross-border” payments get muddier in an extended reality where we may end up exchanging tokens with virtual machines living “in the cloud.”</p>
<p>I found it interesting that the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-ruth-wandh%C3%B6fer-523b22/?originalSubdomain=uk">former chair of PSR</a>, the Payment Systems Regulator, was a symposium panelist. PSR is an NGO created as part of the UK Treasury’s Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act of 2013. This woman moderated a discussion about crypto regulation with a <a href="https://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/diamond-stephen/">corporate governance law professor</a> based at Santa Clara, the Jesuit University embedded in early California pay-for-success pilots, and a <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1509876128508526592">SEC cybercrime investigator</a> who teaches at Georgetown and Duke Law. All three schools are major promoters of social impact finance. The cybercrime investigator didn’t seem to realize Web 3 is about digital ID and the industrial internet of things, prerequisites for ushering in globalization 4.0 and remote robotic labor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto wallets and Bored Ape NFTs have been offered as Hegelian-dialectic appetizers, delectable snacks, and a caloric boost to fuel narratives to nudge us towards “solutions” we’re told will restore civil society’s “social contract.” Such an approach could meld distributed ledger technology and ubiquitous edge computing to “serve” us “better”! All the fraudulent greed and crassness we find assaulting our senses promises to be cleared away as so many crumbs on fine linen tablecloth before the main course, UN Sustainable Goal-aligned e-government solutions wedded to Microsoft’s Planetary computer and Ervin Laszlo’s World Homeostat, arrives. That is the end game, managed life (Kubernetes, cybernetics) using nano-tech track and trace energy economics interwoven with infinite unseen contractual arrangements.&nbsp; Maybe the guy’s long thread making a case for blockchain and Web 3 being inconsequential was an inside joke.</p>

<p>It was posted on April Fool’s Day, and these folks love signaling each other, presuming the rest of us are dupes and oblivious to the ongoing rotten game. If and when the Web 3 rollout will become viable remains an open question. However, in my opinion, it would be folly to imagine the financial interests standing behind Adjoint, Inc. aren’t pouring money into blockchain, machine learning, sensor networks, molecular engineering, and quantum computing to realize this mechanical delusion. Throughout those two days, there was sleight of hand uplifting blockchain and Bitcoin as straw men to be gleefully knocked down. These people are experts and must know where things are headed with DLT (distributed ledger technology) in the financial derivatives space. Or, if they don’t, they should have their salaries and book royalties held back until they get up to speed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/havellrodrigues/">Havell Rodrigues</a>, a hedge fund manager interested in impact finance and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, launched Adjoint, Inc. in 2016. By 2018 it had expanded internationally with offices in Houston, London, and Zug, Switzerland, the hub of the crypto valley. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andras-miklos/details/experience/">Andras Miklos</a>, formerly senior project manager at Credit Suisse, where he “developed a business intelligence and benchmarking model for assessing the strategy of the UK Private Banking business” and a “financial planning model for the Luxembourg Platform enhancement strategy of the Private Banking and Wealth Management division,” briefly headed Adjoint’s Zug office before climbing the ladder to become treasurer of the board of the Swiss Finance and Technology Association and vice president of digital custody systems for State Street Digital in Zurich. It is unclear if Adjoint is still operating. I could not find a website; there was a dead end on the company’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/adjoint/">LinkedIn page</a>, “<a href="http://adjoint.io/">nosuchbucket</a>,” and Rodrigues’s profile dates his tenure there from August 2016 to August 2021. Tseng’s LinkedIn features Adjoint as his current employer, and it seems logical that if that had changed, he would have made those updates in advance of this much-lauded event.</p>
<p>At a 2017 Mattereum conference Diehl and another panelist Ian Grigg who developed third-party accounting and Ricardian Contracts, legally enforceable smart contracts for financial instruments, in the 1990s were interviewed by Jason Louv. Someone gave me a heads-up in the comments of one of my videos that Louv is an Austin-based practitioner of Enochian chaos magic at Ultraculture. He has written for Vice, Boing Boing, Motherboard and authored several books, including one on John Dee. Last year Louv interviewed Vinay Gupta, head of Mattereum, for his <a href="https://podcast.magick.me/ep-15-vinay-gupta-on-meditation-enlightenment-and-saving-the-world/">podcast</a>. Gupta, a consultant to the military, corporations, and the Open-Source community on how to save the world with blockchain and micro-insurance spackle, was among the presenters at the Mormon Transhumanist Association conference on Blockchain this past March.</p>
<a href="https://ultraculture.org/blog/2016/04/18/vinay-gupta-global-resilience-guru/">https://ultraculture.org/blog/2016/04/18/vinay-gupta-global-resilience-guru/</a>
<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/04/09/utahs-sacred-harmonies-and-human-hubris/">https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/04/09/utahs-sacred-harmonies-and-human-hubris/</a>
<p>I sense that the Diehl, Grigg, Gupta triangle is significant. Web 3 is meant to become a matrix of energetic entanglements where “money” and eventually “compliant behavior impact tokens” will be exchanged to make social values and relationships visible to the machine where they can be analyzed and regulated. Grigg was experimenting with complementary currencies as “beautiful money” back in 2005-2006 with a <a href="http://www.monochrom.at/flowerbank/index-en.htm">Digital Pressed Flower Currency</a> project carried out in association with media artist <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3654931/">Johannes Grenzfurthner</a> and philosopher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO9afSeA15g">Stefan Lutschinger</a> in Amstetten, Austria. I made a six-minute video about their project linking it to Mexico’s conditional cash transfer program and Julian Huxley’s research into the metamorphosis of the axolotl a few weeks ago.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the symposium’s panelists was affiliated with the Brookings Institute, a think tank promoting Johnathan Ledgard’s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Chapter-Five_Breakthrough.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1665283702162835&amp;usg=AOvVaw0LBSNrbhhh8_cEbayl1lm4">interspecies currency</a>. Energy exchanges through meta-data tagged digital currency will be mediated through invisible contracts like all those “terms and conditions” boxes you click through to use digital products. You know, the ones most of us don’t read, but we click “agree” anyway? And if we did read ALL the text and didn’t agree with some aspect of the arrangement, then what?</p>
<p>Another participant represented the Center for Responsible Lending; an NGO set up to protect low-income people from predatory debt traps. The organization spun out Self-Help, a community development operation active in the affordable housing space, read Opportunity Zones, where histories of redlining are now being turned into money-laundering vehicles for giant real estate portfolio holders. A few years back, Martin Eakes, founder of the Center for Responsible Lending, lauded Bank of America, with whom he had partnered, for creating SafeBalance Banking, where people would not be able to overdraw their accounts. The spin was about saving people from costly fees, but in the back of my mind, I’m thinking about <a href="https://www.iedigital.com/resources/press-releases/worlds-first-internet-of-things-bank-helps-you-take-control-of-your-finances-and-kerb-overspending">ieDigital’s shocking wearables</a> that zap a person when they get close to their balance or turn down the heat in their homes. Such things are now possible with Web 3 Internet of Things banking. Who is being protected? Families falling into the ever growing pit comprising the working poor? Or “too big to fail” banks?</p>
<a href="https://www.wareable.com/fitness-trackers/worlds-first-connected-bank-will-shock-you-into-saving-money-2746">https://www.wareable.com/fitness-trackers/worlds-first-connected-bank-will-shock-you-into-saving-money-2746</a>
<p>What if you don’t want a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://informationsecuritybuzz.com/articles/worlds-first-internet-things-bank-gives-electric-shock-spend-much-cash/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1665283766167416&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_D-T64hn91OQFp44WnNpl">Pavlok shock bracelet</a> linked to your Universal Basic Income debit card? It’s not as though you will be able to ask for a custom contract to which you would agree. It’s all being rigidly coded into the “open,” “distributed,” and “resilient” Metaverse ledger – <a href="https://www.lamina1.com/">Lamina1.</a> That ledger isn’t a person by design. They don’t want us to trust people who may tap into their humanity, opt to make exceptions to the rules, and not carry out the dictates of the code with fidelity. So many of the mind games being played out, the polarization and betrayals of confidence and shifting alliances, are intended to break ground for the coming mathematical reality written about in 1921 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Zamyatin">Yevgeny Zamyatin</a> in his novel about totalitarian world order in “We.” Trust mathematics, not humans. That is the prevailing message.</p>
<p>What do you do if you don’t agree to the terms but are compelled to use the product anyway? Eventually, those terms won’t just be for apps but will be necessary for access to buildings, “mobility solutions,” payment systems, public spaces, and so on. We all check those boxes and hope our agreement doesn’t come back to haunt us in the future. We have no idea about all the things to which we’ve technically agreed. They know to hide everything in the fine print. Sometimes they even change the terms and conditions later, sending a courtesy email to keep you advised on the rules of the updated game.&nbsp; I’ll bet Stanford’s smart toilets will have lots of fine print. These contracts will be linked to simulation modeling and predictive analytics around risk. In a presentation given by Gupta at a 2017 Dutch Blockchain Coalition gathering, “Deep Dive into Identities,” titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDR1UOU-YEE">How Blockchain Can Change Our World,</a>” he describes a future scenario where our digital identities are patched together with sets of “claims” about us backed by insurance guarantees. One of his slides states: “As long as someone will insure you, you exist.” Think about that.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDR1UOU-YEE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDR1UOU-YEE</a>
<p>That is the world we’re allowing to be built for nature and future generations, because we cannot or will not make the time to understand what is unfolding, look at the labyrinth’s walls, grab the string, and walk out. Another crypto-skeptic panelist, an affiliate of the Oxford Internet Institute, wrote the textbook on in-game virtual economies, not unlike a labyrinth, and how they were a good thing and could teach us many lessons. That, of course, is the logical end game for the growth imperative of capital. The next generation, the children, the refugees, the prisoners, and the working poor, will be coerced into coding a cloud-based empire interwoven with cutting-edge military psychological technologies. It will be B.F. Skinner’s maze of tokenized behavior pellets. Thanks to Google, Niantic, and In-Q-Tel, we can continue to grow our consumption of goods and services while generating data to fuel the machine learning that seeks to steal the sacred and substitute flimsy, profane simulacra.</p>
<p>Of course, no one will want to live inside that story. So, to drive the plot forward, the focus must be kept on use cases around unregulated digital money, ludicrous assets, and toxic celebrity. My friend’s presentation shone a light off this narrow path, but a person can only do so much with ten minutes of airtime. Unpacking the implications of what it will mean to live on the blockchain through digitally twinned social constructs mediated by artificial intelligence in an in-depth manner would probably result in most people walking out of the theater prematurely. They can’t have that, right?</p>
<p>Those bigger-picture conversations, for now, are primarily had in smoky back rooms among the deep-pocketed backers of the big show – the ESG social impact investor crowd. I’ll note here that the event included the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jprangaswami/details/experience/">former head data scientist</a> for Salesforce and Deutsche Bank, simply listed as a financial technologist on the video, as well as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-pritchard-b6a9424/?originalSubdomain=uk">former Managing Director in derivatives for JP Morgan</a> and the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deteran/details/experience/">head of corporate affairs for SWIFT</a> from 2013-2019 who’s more recently been serving as a member of the Bank of England’s Central Bank Digital Currency Engagement Forum. While it may appear a low-budget enterprise with videos that have under a thousand views, this symposium was definitely within the sphere of influence of powerful players in the derivatives finance and data analytics space.</p>
<p>The event included a keynote by a colleague of Robert Hertzberg, the state senator proposing California’s digital identity legislation. This US Representative from Sherman Oaks, CA has come out strongly against crypto currencies while being silent on Web 3.0. A former Berkeley professor quit over the amount of crypto money flowing into his department. As a theoretical example, the self-described mad scientist offered an “institute of demonology” in his remarks about sketchy crypto funding sources in the academy, which called to mind a <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Golem-of-Prague-The-Golem-of-Rehovoth-Gershom-Scholem-Commentary-Magazine.pdf">1966 article</a> about Chaim Pekeris and the Golem of Rehovoth supercomputer. I emailed him to see if he knew of it, but I never got a response. I found it interesting that he named his firm, one that provides cybersecurity for the UAVs that will patrol our shared extended reality prison, Skerry (Scary?) Technologies. This refers to tiny islands of individual consciousness in Neil Gaiman’s Sandman Series “The Game of You.” Make Bitcoin the bogeyman. Stop short of extending one’s analysis to cyber-physical environments designed to “learn” us through digital surveillance, including from the bird’s eye view. Life is less complicated, and the story holds together better, with more explanatory coherence, if you can silo off uncomfortable information and make it someone else’s concern.</p>
<p>Seeing a black swan at the beginning of the UK MP’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZl-R8y92C8">presentation</a> was odd. He’s with the Cooperative Party, which took advantage of the lockdowns to push Universal Basic Income in April 2020. He also just happens to be a leader in sustainable finance and leans towards the Malthusian population control side because it’s, well…” green.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Several folks from El Salvador were brought in to attest to the ineffectual Bitcoin rollout in their country in tandem with increasingly brutal-authoritarian tactics by President Bukele. No mention of the 2007 Interamerican Development Bank arrangement setting up conditional cash transfers tied to low-income women and children’s education and health compliance in El Salvador. Better to keep everyone focused on the Chivo wallets, wallets that most citizens only activated to get the sign-on payment and then discarded, rather than explore what is on the horizon with blockchain digitization of Latin America’s public benefits systems. Once these skeptics get rid of unregulated, predatory crypto wallets the World Bank will sweep in and give the youth of Latin American (Africa, India, Polynesia) some variant on The Learning Economy Foundation’s UN Sustainable Development Goals “Learn Card.” In the new blockchain education economy “opportunity youth” will play online games and be psychometrically profiled as social impact data commodities while stacking up educational badges and tallying up the digital scrip their families need to survive. </p>

<p>It is these youth that the producers of the masque have tapped to do the grunt work of coding and securing the empire for the digital conquistadors. No one mentioned <a href="https://nftportal.co/salesforce-launches-nft-cloud-program-for-brands-to-mint-and-sell-nfts/">Salesforce stepping into the NFT space</a> (panelist JP Rangaswami’s old firm). Can Soulbound Tokens be far behind? Probably not, given the planned role of the company’s <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3000000B5dm5EAB">Social Suite dashboard services</a> for ESG impact finance reporting. Speak of Bukele but not of the next iteration where structural adjustment demands poor nations mortgage their children as improvable human capital. Stay silent about tech <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/18/18097398/salesforce-contract-customs-border-protection-marc-benioff-immigration">companies that operate in the social impact space</a> while maintaining contracts with Customs and Border Control. </p>
<p>In this crypto spectacle, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert gleefully play over-the-top, villainous “ugly Americans” shilling Bitcoin alongside Bukele, the young, malleable leader tapped by digital conquistadors to create conditions, through brutal measures and generous payouts no doubt, that will pave the way for a new kind of leader, one who will transparently facilitate the implemetantion of billionaire-backed universal basic income, an efficient and accountable socio-technical infrastructure intended to enmesh El Salvador’s children and their families in Web3 “progress” as digital compliance assets. The greed and crassness of volcano-powered Bitcoin is a perfect foil against which to roll out UBI in an attempt to pull Latin America’s robust informal economy into the digital enclosures.</p>

<p>One of the more meta conversations involved a two-part discussion of storytelling in the crypto-sphere by an actor who grew up in Austin, earned a degree in politics and economics at UVA, and became the main protagonist in the show Gotham. Gotham is also an AI data analytics platform developed by Palantir for government agencies. Through its low-bono technical assistance “philanthropy,” Palantir” was the third-party verifier for early pay-for-success finance deals in mental health and homelessness. The Gotham actor described crypto as an energetic social contagion. On that point, I wholeheartedly agree.</p>
<p>While some participants situated the crypto discussion within a context of past and ongoing harms to communities of color, the Global South, and the poor, few were able to apply those lessons to the new forms of predatory finance that are emerging with Web 3 and digital identity. There was talk of exorbitant fee structures, predatory loans, and losses of uninsured assets. What was left unsaid, however, is that hundreds of NGOs, think tanks and academics (Impact Management Project) are working furiously to sketch out marketing campaigns that seek to legitimize the tokenization of people and the environment as alternative asset classes / creative collateral for “beautiful blockchain money,” not to mention micro-finance schemes targeting aspirational entrepreneurs, often low-income women. Do they imagine we will embrace the “green-pill” regenerative finance pitch with public goods tracked on ledgers so the machines can “see” what our communities value? Charles Eisenstein is constantly pushing the “sacred economy.” Since he’s “teamed up with Sep “I put IoT sensors in the slippers of Wildflower Montessori students to track their social behaviors,” Kamvar, <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sdkamvar/overview/">former head of MIT’s Social Computing Group</a>, how long will it be before we see&nbsp; blockchain impact deals where instead of coins, you have tokens tied to the economic prospects of toddlers. Sadly, I can envision James Heckman, JB Pritzker, Paul Tudor Jones, Steve Ballmer, and Stanley Druckenmiller making champagne toasts to that.</p>

<p>New realities of telepresence and haptic robotic labor were downplayed, even though the plan is for blockchain identity to evolve into an accumulation of digital wallet tokens subject to review by non-human agents set up to oversee the legitimacy (or not) of pre-programmed economic and social transactions. We are meant to assume that living under the Global Brain’s benevolent gaze will be democratic, humanized, safe, trustworthy, and accountable. They want us to embrace governance algorithms that know us better than we know ourselves and promise to protect us from unchained life’s sinister and exquisite extremes. It is the dark side of the liberal politics of social care to realize that perhaps the safety net of public welfare was actually set up so that it could be run, decades later, by Palantir and Salesforce and Microsoft’s planetary computer. This program runs on polarity and serves the interests of power to tag, trace, and reinforce oppositional ideology. The boxes they have set up for us make it far less likely that we will question the most basic assumptions of our reality. The progressives can never imagine the government or non-profits would seek to harm the vulnerable, and the conservatives can never imagine the same of their churches or the chamber of commerce.</p>
<a href="https://www.sanctuary.ai/product/">https://www.sanctuary.ai/product/</a>
<p>In my opinion, those at the top are hoping that this Radio-Eugenics World War Three will be a mostly bloodless coup of natural life where a majority agree to willingly embrace distributed ledger chains of “progress” as if the behaviorist, cybernetic enclosures to “save the world” had been the peoples’ and the patriots’ idea all along. The goal is to find the sweet spot where those espousing collective global progressive materialism might be able to strike an uneasy balance with the anti-government, free market, religious crowd. The producers of this play believe they can thread that needle. Imagine you can zoom out and see it as a polarized, emergent structure of domination rather than the ideological struggle the talking heads are making it out to be. In that case, it’s fascinating to watch them try. Picture puppet masters on the left and right contorting themselves in an uncomfortable yet necessary, synchronous dance routine as they attempt to manifest Oliver Reiser’s “World Sensorium,” an outcome they imagine will ultimately benefit both ends of the dipole that is global social physics.</p>
<p>We’ve made our way through the exposition phase of this grand Maya illusion, an all-encompassing techno-masque in which the Earth’s inhabitants have unwittingly been drawn in as both audience and cast. With the dramatic arc established, we’re now enmeshed in structured narratives meant to draw our attention to the manufactured harms of crypto-currency and ridiculous NFTs. I don’t mean in any way to dismiss the actual damage caused. The “crypto bubble,” as these folks describe it, has been devastating for both human victims and the environment. Yet anyone who understands how systems of power operate recognizes tactical sacrifices are made to advance ever more ambitious aims. Those seeking full spectrum dominance don’t give a damn who they crush on their march into delusions of a digital empire where atoms are replaced by bits that can be shaped to the metaphysical whims of billionaire sorcerers and their mad scientist acolytes.</p>
<p>We are being pushed towards a climax where the audience/actors aligned with adversarial parties are supposed to coalesce behind a resolution that will be falsely uplifted as one that restores trust, reinvigorates democracy, ensures freedom and choice, mobilizes grassroots participation, enables shared prosperity, uplifts marginalized communities through the coordinated efforts of a data-driven civil society, and saves the world. This is a plan laid out by the same people enabling the continued operation of the world’s largest financial derivatives portfolios.</p>
<p>Act one established the context and set the mood: wealth inequality, technological disruption, social strife, environmental degradation, and anticipated labor automaton. Act two built dramatic tension with fin-tech crooks, selfish and foolish speculators, extravagant energy consumption, decadent digital property, and authoritarian puppet leaders. Act Two is where the Crypto Symposium ended with a cliffhanger. My prediction is that the final act brings resolution through tokenization of the commons with a shift to “green” proof-of-stake and next-gen nuclear. Before the curtain falls, there will be agreement on proper regulation of digital payments and property to benefit all citizens of extended reality in alignment with a global truth and trust commission. With Pierre Omidyar’s “Good ID” in place, a world of peace and collective harmonization can be regulated through the One World Homeostat, assuming human rights are respected within the terms and conditions imposed by the smart contract layer of international arbitration.</p>
<p>At the end of the two-day symposium, Darren Tseng and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akalin/details/experience/">Jan Akalin</a>, a youthful management consultant formerly with Adjoint whose LinkedIn indicates business ties with Russian firms, announced the launch of a 501(c)4, Center for Emerging Technology Policy. This new think tank is intended to advise officials by working internationally through public-private partnerships, connecting policymakers with knowledgeable technologists to advance inclusion and strengthen “democracy” in an “increasingly interconnected world.” You know the saying, in the Web 3 matrix of digital identity and decentralized ledger technology, “no one is left behind” to rock the boat or question the presumption that living within cybernetic circuits is a future to which we should aspire.</p>
<a href="https://emergingtech.center/">https://emergingtech.center/</a>
<p>Now raise your hand if you think BlackRock and the venture capitalists behind the Impact Management Project have invested billions into creating the vast Web 3 cyber infrastructure network to stop harming poor people and endangered species. No? That’s what I thought. It’s about setting up regulatory procedures to properly measure harm and enact socially acceptable predictive profiling using “evidence-based” protocols and digital twinning. The game of mixed-reality social impact requires ameliorating some of the most egregious harms even as new channels of trauma are devised and branded as solid investment opportunities that no coincidentally expand the influence and power of global NGOs and faith communities.</p>
<p>Austerity, adversity, and crisis drive the impact-data economy, opening the door to a new financial system meant to supersede the neoliberal policies that enabled it. The new paradigm will derive value from tokenizing compliant behavior demonstrated through attestations and networked digital agreements. Tokens will be leveraged to “humanize” the Singularity machine through outfits like Ocean Protocol. The digital exhaust of our biology, intellect, emotions, and social interactions is the supreme sacrifice to the anti-life parasitic force that inhabits the extended reality matrix run on Ricardian contracts and distributed ledgers. Remember, it’s all “for our own good” so we can be “safe.” That is how Hal 9000 intends to create order from chaos – holons with cyber-physical integration that force submission to global sustainable development goals. Meanwhile, Palantir’s all-seeing eye will be looking on to verify that all is “trustworthy” and in alignment with BlackRock’s wishes.</p>
<p>The 2018 white paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tapscott_DeclarationofInterdependence_NewSocialContract_BlockchainResearchInstitute1.pdf">A Declaration of Interdependence: Towards A New Social Contract For The Digital Economy</a>,” by Don Tapscott of the Blockchain Research Institute, is setting up this planned future. It’s the same vision depicted in Institute for the Future’s 2017 foresight road map, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iftf_blockchainfutures_map.pdf">Blockchain Futures 2017-2027: A Blockchain Decade From Currencies To Computing And The Commons</a>,” only with a slightly rosier lens.&nbsp; On the one side, they’ll be selling Florida and Texas libertarian tech investors on the wonders of DeFi, school choice digital vouchers, reduced government techno-efficiencies, and deregulation; while on the flip side, they’ll be pitching Left Coast progressives on tokenized cooperatives, blockchain Universal Basic Income, and digital ID for undocumented people and marginalized communities. Decentralized ledger technology (DLT) is being set up as the winning option across the political spectrum.</p>
<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iftf_blockchainfutures_map.pdf">https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iftf_blockchainfutures_map.pdf</a>
<p>The digital conquistadors have unimaginable amounts of money to throw at this, and they are, because DLT and smart contracts integrated with internet of things tokenization IS their new empire. They won’t tell people that living in extended reality means satellites and drones will always know where you are. And not just your location; the global computer will evaluate your bio-stats, financial liquidity, preferences, and movements in real-time to assess and mitigate risk based on parameters encoded in its mechanical hive mind consciousness. They won’t tell you that “liberation” left or right may mean competing for gig work in another country where you are hired by an HVAC machine, not a person, a machine. This radical participatory voting? They won’t lead with the fact that the machines will have tokens, too, and legal rights like people.</p>
<p>Information warfare is about deft curation and personalized storytelling to a known audience. I’m suggesting it’s possible to view this two-day event as a storytelling marathon where presenters gave their intended audience, one groomed for outrage for several years by many outrageous things associated with Bitcoin and NFTs, what they wanted, which was an outlet to grouse and demonstrate ethical superiority over “the other.” In this case, the others were consistently framed as fraudulent, Ayn Rand libertarians, sometimes racist, sometimes expats, engaging in dark activities, ducking regulations and taxes to pursue tacky, superficial, self-aggrandizing agendas of greed and chaos.</p>
<p>My awareness of the Web 3 blockchain space is centered around friends with ties to gatherings like ETHDenver, where the players, while still enmeshed in the venture capital power structure, craft identities meant to evoke a decidedly more altruistic and egalitarian vibe with much talk of advancing the common good through shared tokenized assets and redistributive governance protocols. While there were a few mentions of Ethereum at the Crypto Symposium, the presentations certainly did not equally interrogate the potential pitfalls of smart-contract, tokenized progressivism. No, the villain of this tall tale was meant to be a greedy libertarian populist with nefarious intent, not a Silicon Valley multi-millionaire looking to hook folks up with tokenized Universal Basic Income so he could siphon off their behavioral data to run futures markets and train his robot army.</p>
<p>As I watched the videos and saw big holes in content and what felt like strategic omissions in the narrative framing by many people who should have known better, I became angry. It triggered memories of a naive Alison who poured her heart into fighting terrible tests that were being weaponized against children in schools, only to realize the battle was so much larger than tests and that one of the key people who’d been set up to “lead” the resistance, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2017/09/20/when-someone-shows-you-who-they-are-believe-them-the-first-time/">Diane Ravitch</a>, had a well-connected venture capitalist son whose company, Raine Group, was heavily invested in alternative credentialing systems and extended reality educational environments. It was the first time I realized that it was not enough to gird yourself against outside opponents. Often the threat comes from the inside, which hurts because you don’t want to harden your heart in the face of such duplicity.</p>
<p>I made several dozen short clips of 1-4 minutes each from these presentations,&nbsp; pulling out specific cases where presenters whose background indicated they should know what we were dealing with was far more than Bitcoin fraud and unregulated pump and dump schemes pull punches and direct people away from how decentralized ledger technology, sensor networks, impact tokens, and smart contracts would be used to upgrade traditional financialized debt products to meet the demands of ESG investment portfolios. In a few cases, I added scrolling bars that pointed out what was NOT being said.</p>
<p>Only then did I realize the bear I’d been poking had ties to financial behemoths with their histories of corruption, mismanagement, and authoritarian government systems. To look at Diehl and Tseng, it might not occur to you that their Boston headquarters was in the <a href="https://explorebostonhistory.org/items/show/2">John Hancock Tower</a> in the Back Bay, a 1970s modernist nightmare whose stability is perhaps only slightly better than the derivatives products for which they’d been developing automated settlement systems at <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171010005550/en/Smart-Contracts-Platform-Company-Adjoint-Joins-ISDA">Adjoint, Inc.</a> Cliff says when confronting such systems, it’s best to stand obliquely in a calm, firm manner rather than advance in anger, because it feeds off of that energy and can use it against you. I’d made a tactical miscalculation, a mistake, taking an assertive stance. Mind you, this was a free conference and ostensibly meant for the public good. Diehl responded by asserting copyright claims on three of those clips, enough to take down my channel, though the third was simply removed, and the final, fatal claim was not made.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus, I continue to hang on to my hundreds of hours of content for the time being. I have it all backed up, and since I’m not into blockchain media, it’s a bit of a puzzle about where to relocate. If I disappear from YouTube, I encourage you to subscribe to my <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/">blog</a> (see email box in the sidebar) and send me an email to timpsila at protonmail dot com, and I will put you on my list for new posts and live streams. Live and learn. I deleted all those clips. Instead of a blow-by-blow, I gave you a broad-stroke overview and included over a hundred screenshots with links in an appendix at the end. Feel free to explore and compare this additional context with the panelists’ commentary. Consider what was left out of their narratives. It can often reveal more than what was said aloud.</p>
<p>When I started my education activism, I struggled when I shared information on pay-for-success finance and emerging technologies like blockchain identity and wearable technology. It was a rare gift when someone understood what I was saying immediately. When it happened, you could see the lightbulb go off for them as the missing piece was inserted, and everything fell into place. That didn’t happen often. It was more likely that someone would listen to you, and then in the weeks and months following, it was apparent that none of the information had any impact on their thinking. They were simply continuing to walk the same well-trodden path.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would try to ascertain where a particular person fell on the spectrum. I had three categories. The first was people who were too busy or stressed and simply did not have the bandwidth to let the information sink in. That was a large percentage. The second group was people who could understand what I was saying, the time, and the knowledge base but could not accept it because it would make it too difficult to continue their life without making substantial changes. For them, it was about cognitive dissonance, discomfort, and fear, maybe with a bit of laziness thrown in. The last category was the people who knew exactly what they were doing and were extremely good at playing their role as enablers of the new paradigm.</p>
<p>Trying, often unsuccessfully, to ascertain the degree of complicity in people used to take up a lot of time in my headspace. I’ve since come to realize it probably doesn’t matter. We can never fully understand people’s motivations, the realities they inhabit, or the stories they tell themselves to get out of bed and face the day. Most of us are touched by some part of this domination structure through our actions or those of our loved ones, colleagues, neighbors, or people in our social circles. The only way to escape the labyrinth is to see it, situate ourselves, and make peace with it. Ariadne’s thread is there for us to walk out of the labyrinth once we can acknowledge the walls, look down at the floor, and pick it up. Any person can make a goal of becoming oriented to one’s position in the tangle of energetic contracts we’ve unknowingly entered into, wash ourselves clean of those terrible bonds, and step out of the play. Until that happens, we will continue to find ourselves caught in a dramatic back and forth – sometimes the actor, sometimes the audience, sometimes a willing participant, sometimes not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I continue to learn and practice, even as I stumble and fall. I was frustrated with many of these crypto-skeptics – with their inability to see and articulate the clear and present danger that I see. They didn’t understand that their event, their focus, and their new think tank were designed as a vehicle to bring about a gentler, soul-killing, cybernetic dystopia of tokenized, programmed “goodness.” Initially, I tried to make them wrong, which was a mistake. I can’t presume to know their story. I can only seek clarity in mine.</p>
<p>As a mother, I know that securitized toddlers, giraffes, and rivers will never create “beautiful” block-chained money or “green” liquid assets. That is not what it means to be a good relative. I’ll chant it over and over in the hope that understanding may one day sink into the consciousness of the derivatives traders, the mathematicians, and the blockchain coders of social and environmental “justice.” I believe that can happen; I am not a nihilist. Until then, I’ll keep lines of communication open, calling on the cosmos beyond the limits of the material in the corners where the barbed hooks of micro-insurance can never reach. </p>
<p>There, divine chaos sings a song of life, wholeness, and healing. It is there that our hearts are truly seen.</p>

 Introduction <p>Threshold cryptography is one of the most secure techniques for carrying out cryptographic operations. For context, cryptography is a field of study in computer science that emphasizes secure communication between two or more parties without external influence. <br></p><p>In practice, cryptographic techniques are targeted at keeping information or secrets between the concerned parties away from adversaries. Looking at the bigger picture, cryptography aims to create secure ecosystems that can remain functional with or without the participation of trusted entities.<br></p><p>In 1994, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/195058.195405">Alfredo et al.</a> proposed one of the earliest proof-of-security systems based on threshold cryptography. In the early years, the military, governments, and organizations that held confidential information were the only major users of threshold cryptosystems. Since then, there have been several applications of threshold technology.</p> What is threshold cryptography? <p>Threshold cryptosystems protect information by encrypting and distributing secrets amongst a cluster of independent computers that qualify as <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/fault-tolerance">fault-tolerant</a>. The fault-tolerance of a system simply refers to the system’s ability to continue operating despite failures or malfunctions.<br></p>Artist Natasha Hanacek’s conception of threshold cryptography through an analogy of a lock that can only be opened by three people working together. (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2020/07/nist-kick-starts-threshold-cryptography-development-effort">Source</a>)<p>As the name suggests, threshold cryptography enables individual keyholders to lock a secret in a way that no single keyholder can open the lock individually. Instead, it requires a minimum number of keyholders out of all keyholders (a threshold number) to unlock the secret.<br></p><p>Since the general idea is to assume that the participating entities are susceptible to compromise, decrypting the shared secret or signing a message requires the cooperation of some, not all, participants, usually above a minimum number. Threshold encryption also ensures that keyholders are able to collaborate without seeing other participants’ parts of the key.<br></p><p>With a minimum threshold, it can be ensured that even if some of the participants collude, the secret remains secure. In essence, threshold cryptography makes sure that a single individual doesn’t have the full authority, which can lead to vulnerability in the system. It also ensures that even if one or more individuals are unavailable, the secret can be unlocked and doesn’t cause bottlenecks. This makes the system fault-tolerant.</p>A diagram showing the process of breaking a key into several parts. The system then requires a threshold number (2 out of 3) to reconstruct the key. (<a href="https://medium.com/poa-network/poa-network-honey-badger-bft-and-threshold-cryptography-c43e10fadd87">Source</a>) How does threshold cryptography work? <p>To understand how threshold cryptography works, let us assume we have a secret (S). After encrypting S using a public key, we split up the corresponding private key among a fixed number of participants, say N.</p><p>After setting the number of participants N, threshold cryptography introduces a new variable, which we call K, representing the minimum number of participants required to reform the secret or sign a message. As we mentioned earlier, threshold schemes consider fault tolerance and assume that a single point of failure is not ideal for any functional system. Therefore, in a threshold cryptosystem, the number of participants required to decrypt the secret has to be greater than or equal to K but less than N, where K is also less than N.<br></p><p>Let's say you are a member of a board of trustees of ten people. The secret you’re trying to safeguard is encrypted with its private key split up into shares and distributed amongst the board in secrecy. No board member knows what other fractions exist and who holds them, except the piece in their possession. <br></p><p>To sign a transaction using the private key, the board chooses a threshold of seven persons. This means that seven out of the ten board members must agree and cooperate if the need to carry out any operation that involves the private key arises. Thus, even if half of the board is compromised, they will not be able to reconstruct the secret without at least two more people. Getting 7 out of 10 points of failure is not exactly something that often happens. Furthermore, even if one bad actor can corrupt another six actors, it would anyway be equivalent to a direction taken by a clear majority. This thereby suggests that the system is secure as long as the majority (higher than a threshold number) of participants are acting in a democratic way.</p> Applications of threshold cryptography <p>Threshold cryptography offers more security than many other cryptographic techniques. As a result, several cryptographic protocols, operations, and applications adopted threshold schemes. <br></p><p>Applications of threshold cryptography can be found in various sectors such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, authentication, ad-hoc and sensor networks, etc. Here are some of the most common applications of threshold cryptography today:</p> Mitigating MEV <p>MEV, short for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">Maximal Extractable Value</a>, is a “tax” that miners, validators, and other blockchain actors extract by reordering transactions before confirming them on the blockchain. Although MEV extraction has been used for good causes like balancing token prices across decentralized exchanges, most MEV extraction techniques are outrightly malicious, profiting from a user’s trades without their knowledge. <br></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/modular-vs-monolithic-blockchains/">Blockchains</a> like Ethereum do not require transactions in a block to be processed in any specific order. Thus, validators can rearrange transactions in it however they like. The validators profit from this reordering or rearranging of certain transactions so that they can extract a profit via liquidation or arbitrage.<br></p><p>In a threshold cryptosystem built on the blockchain, the participants collaborate off-chain to create a single transaction and submit it to the network. Since the private keys are split up among multiple computers or nodes, the transaction leaves no on-chain trail behind. <br></p><p>Some protocols, like <a href="https://blog.ruby.exchange/how-skale-solves-the-front-running-problem/">SKALE</a>, have applied threshold cryptography schemes to combat MEV. SKALE’s S-Chain validators create a key collectively. Senders use this key to encrypt transactions before submission to the network for validation. When encrypted transactions lie in the mempool, their details are shielded from validators. After they are posted to the blockchain, transactions remain encrypted until validators decrypt them.<br></p><p>While transactions are in transit, they retain their encrypted form. Validators cannot decrypt them until they have approved them on the blockchain, thus blocking any opportunity for front-running, sandwich attacks, or reordering according to preference. <br></p><p>Even if some network nodes become compromised, the system remains functional because a single node cannot decrypt transactions. Both encryption and decryption are spread across the validators and require a minimum number (threshold value) of validators. As long as the majority –above the threshold– remain honest, the system remains secure.<br></p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://medium.com/@totalblockchainemail/osmosis-will-soon-be-frontrunning-mev-free-b7da89f04ce9">Osmosis</a> also intends to leverage threshold cryptography to mitigate MEV. Osmosis plans to encrypt the transactions in the mempool before they’re included in a block. This would hide the transaction information and prevent validators from re-ordering or censoring the transactions for their profit. Once transactions are encrypted, the shards of the private key are shared among all validators and the key can only be reconstructed by ⅔ validators. That way, Osmosis will be able to mitigate the MEV, since the block will be almost simultaneously decrypted while it’s being confirmed. Validators will not be able to extract value at the cost of users’ profit.<br></p>Simplified illustration of Shutter’s transaction execution environment. (<a href="https://blog.shutter.network/introducing-shutter-network-combating-frontrunning-and-malicious-mev-using-threshold-cryptography/">Source</a>)‌ ‌<p>Another platform mitigating MEV by leveraging the threshold cryptography is <a href="https://shutter.network/">Shutter Network</a>. Shutter Network is an open-source project that aims to prevent front-running (a type of MEV) on Ethereum by using a threshold cryptography-based distributed key generation (DKG) protocol.<br></p><p>Similar to SKALE &amp; Osmosis, Shutter also uses threshold cryptography to send encrypted transactions in a way that protects them from front-runners on their path through the <a href="https://medium.com/@danrobinson/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest-ecc5f0505dff">dark forest</a> (the metaphorical hunting ground of front-runners that each transaction must cross).</p> Improving MultiSig <p>Multisignature schemes, popularly known as MultiSig(s), require two or more participants to sign a message or approve a transaction before the transaction can be executed. Using the earlier “'board of trustees” example, if all board members had to vote on transferring funds in their treasury to a charity, all ten board members would need to contribute their signatures to the MultiSig scheme to approve the transaction. <br></p><p>MultiSig schemes are similar to threshold cryptosystems, as they are distributed systems. Yet, MultiSig participants each have a complete public key, while participants on threshold schemes receive only a share of a single common public key. <br></p><p>Threshold signature schemes are <a href="https://sepior.com/blog/top-5-reasons-threshold-signature-wallets-are-better-than-multisig">replacing</a> MultiSig applications. While MultiSig schemes are more secure than single signature schemes, threshold signature schemes cost less because they are computed off-chain. They relay a single transaction to the blockchain, while MultiSig relays all the individual contributions separately.<br></p><p>MultiSig schemes are a kind of threshold scheme without the threshold feature. They need all participants to contribute, as opposed to threshold signature schemes which only require a preset number of participants to sign transactions. To be clear, we can refer to MultiSig schemes as a threshold cryptosystem built on a blockchain’s application layer.<br></p><p>MultiSig schemes have been used in developing secure blockchain interaction infrastructure like wallets. Several cryptocurrency wallet providers are developing wallet infrastructure based on threshold schemes instead of MultiSig. Threshold schemes are more secure as they offer better privacy than MultiSig, consume less block space, are easier to deploy on any blockchain (unlike MultiSig schemes that several blockchains do not support), and are more flexible.</p> Multi-party computation (MPC) <p>Multi-party computation, also called secure multi-party computation, is a simple cryptographic scheme that involves multiple participants. If a secret is split into shares and distributed amongst participants in an MPC protocol, each participant only knows the share in her possession and must do some collective computational work with each using their share.<br></p><p>An average threshold cryptosystem splits the private keys among participants such that a minimum number of participants must contribute to decrypting the information or signing transactions. In practice, a threshold scheme is only similar to multi-party computation in being a distributed system. When you combine a threshold scheme with a partially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic</a> protocol, it can function effectively as a secure multi-party computation scheme.<br></p><p>Homomorphism allows participants to perform computation while retaining encryption, while the threshold feature ensures that decryption is only possible when dishonest participants are less than the threshold value. Thus, the scheme becomes a threshold multi-party computation protocol. <br></p><p><a href="https://www.qredo.com/">Qredo</a> is a blockchain protocol that uses a threshold multi-party computation scheme, combining a threshold signature scheme with multi-party computation. When signing transactions on Qredo, each separate node contributes to signing the message.<br></p><p><a href="https://silencelaboratories.com/">Silence Laboratories</a>, on the other hand, leveraged threshold multi-party computation schemes to offer not only singing a message with multiple shards, but also <a href="https://coinyuppie.com/ambire-ceo-is-web3-wallet-better-for-multi-party-computing-or-smart-wallet/">social recovery</a> in Web3 wallets. Using the threshold MPC scheme, Silence Laboratories enables the Web3 wallet providers to break a private key into multiple shards, which can be combined to reconstruct the key in case a user loses access to her part of the key.</p> Trusted setups<br> <p>A <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusted setup</a> is a procedure that involves more than one party. Its aim is to produce the standard parameters that a proof system or similar cryptographic protocols rely on. Trusted setups can also be called exceptional cases of multi-party computation, that require randomness, multiple individuals, and at least one honest party.<br></p><p>Earlier, we spoke of how some contributions in threshold schemes are usually completed off-chain or offline before submitting the results online. Threshold cryptosystems can be used to create trusted setups, as their formations' processes are inherently similar. Threshold signature schemes (schemes that utilize threshold cryptography) require a trusted setup phase.<br></p><p>The setup phase in a threshold signature scheme is called <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/what-distributed-key-generation-is-866adc79620">Distributed Key Generation</a>, usually the most important part of a threshold scheme. In a Distributed Key Generation setup, participants have to contribute to the key generation and distribution process. Each participant sends their portion of the private keys to the DKG function, which hands over the public key to everyone and splits the private key such that each participant receives a portion that must be kept secret.<br></p><p>While such trusted setups are similar to the average distributed system approach, they have a threshold. Only the threshold number of participants will be required to generate new parameters in a threshold-trusted setup. However, there is a risk of failure if the number of participants that conspire to betray the system is up to the threshold value. Also, some participants may receive incorrect shares, rendering their participation invalid. The latter problem is only valid if contributions stay offline, as participants can validate their shares on-chain.</p> Electronic Voting <p>According to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pRru5o4AAAAJ&amp;hl=es">Gallegos-Garcia</a> et al. in a 2009 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=es&amp;user=pRru5o4AAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=pRru5o4AAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC">paper</a>, the security of electronic voting protocols needs to evolve to represent true democracy. When it comes to electronic voting, &nbsp;the existing security algorithms at the time had so far always been based on public key schemes. <br></p><p>This paper, on the other hand, proposed providing security to electronic voting protocols via threshold cryptography and blind signatures as a less expensive alternative. Not only do threshold cryptography and blind signatures cost less, but they also offer better <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/oliver-gale-digital-dollar-project/">privacy</a>, accuracy, and robustness.<br></p><p>Another paper titled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2663036_A_Practical_Electronic_Voting_Protocol_Using_Threshold_Schemes">A Practical Electronic Voting Protocol Using Threshold Schemes</a> presents a novel secret voting scheme that fully conforms to the requirements of large-scale elections. <br></p><p>The participants in this scheme would be voters, candidates, an administrator, and a counter. The scheme uses threshold encryption to preserve the privacy and accuracy of the votes against the dishonesty of voters, candidates, the administrator, and the counter. Executed well, this could ensure the verifiability, fairness, and soundness of the voting process, and neither administrator, candidates, nor the counter would be capable of producing a false tally, affecting the voting result, or corrupting/disrupting the election.</p><p><br></p> In summary <p>Threshold cryptography is a field of cryptography that involves secure secret sharing while eliminating single points of failure usually associated with most distributed systems. In threshold schemes, the system remains functional as long as the majority, usually above the minimum number required to sign a message, remain honest. Even if one or two entities become compromised, the network will retain its integrity. <br></p><p>Several cryptographic protocols have adopted threshold schemes for different purposes, including inhibiting MEV extraction, building secure multi-party computation protocols, trusted setups, replacing MultiSig applications, etc. Threshold cryptography can pass as untested waters in computer science, and extensive research will continue to increase its applications and security potential. In the coming year, we might many more innovative techniques leveraging threshold cryptography to improve the security of systems with more than one party involved.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>After 18 months of development we’re thrilled to introduce Noir: the language of zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Noir is a Rust-based domain specific language (DSL) for creating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs. It’s the easiest way to write zk applications that are compatible with any proving&nbsp;system.</p><p>We’re also announcing two new Typescript libraries, NoirJS, which enables the compiling of Noir circuits in the browser, as well as Barretenberg.js, which enables proving and verifying those circuits in the&nbsp;browser.</p><blockquote>Get started with&nbsp;Noir</blockquote> What’s Holding Back ZK App Development? <p>The current zk stack is cumbersome and hard to understand. Our zk circuit-building counterparts like Circom and ZoKrates are powerful and flexible, but they require knowledge of cryptographic concepts, creating a barrier to widespread developer adoption.</p><p>Existing circuit compilation languages require two&nbsp;brains:</p>  a cryptography brain that understands proving systems, trusted setups, and some low-level cryptography, and:  an application developer brain that can reason intuitively about public and private state to create novel blockchain applications  <p>Not many people have two brains! And that means the number of zk app developers today is a small subset of the total number of blockchain devs.</p><p>The simplicity of Noir means that having one brain is&nbsp;enough.</p><p>By abstracting away underlying cryptographic complexity while retaining all the power and flexibility of other circuit-building languages, Noir allows any developer–not just those with cryptography knowledge–to construct zk apps. Developers can now focus solely on designing the logic behind private applications.</p> The Single-Brain Solution: the Noir&nbsp;Language <p>Noir makes the creation of zk circuits–and applications–easier than&nbsp;ever.</p> Simple, Familiar&nbsp;Syntax <p>Noir’s likeness to Rust makes it simple, familiar, and easy to understand.</p><p>Creating a conditional is as simple as writing “if.” Using other zk circuit writing languages entails downloading circuit libraries, reading them to understand their underlying logic, and then calling library implementations of basic features.</p><p>Many basic functions like Pedersen hashes don’t have to be reimplemented in Noir circuits–they’re baked into the language&nbsp;itself.</p><blockquote>Example: <a href="https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/master/circuits/mux1.circom">Circomlib’s implementation of a multiplexer</a></blockquote><p>Noir’s simplicity also means there are myriad quality-of-life improvements over alternative circuit writing languages.</p><p>Headache-free dependency management. Noir has its own package manager, nargo, that mocks Rust’s crate and package management system. nargo supports using dependencies uploaded to Github, allowing devs to separate the dependencies of their Noir circuits and the project integrating those circuits.</p><p>Simpler circuit debugging. Rather than writing scripts and downloading proving and verifier keys, developers can also use nargo to prove and verify circuits.</p><p>Autonomous execution. Finally, straight out of the box Noir allows you to build a compiled Solidity contract to verify proofs on any EVM-compatible blockchain. Smart contract developers can now execute logic based on Noir&nbsp;proofs.</p> Standard Crypto&nbsp;Library <p>Noir also possesses a standard library of highly optimized functions commonly used in circuit development.</p><p>The stdlib gives developers access to widely used, complex algorithms that are hand-written and tightly optimized by the Aztec team. There is always a trade-off between the simplicity of an abstraction layer and its efficiency — in this case, how efficiently programs are converted into constraints.</p><p>The standard library grants developers a high level of circuit efficiency while interacting with a simple, easy to use abstraction layer.</p> Proving System&nbsp;Agnostic <p>Finally, because Noir doesn’t compile directly to circuits but to an intermediary representation (akin to LLVM), it is compatible with multiple back-end proving systems including PLONK, Groth16, and&nbsp;Marlin.</p><p>We call this intermediate representation an ACIR (Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation).</p><p>Aztec Network has a proving system back-end called Barretenberg that runs on Plonk. But developing with Noir means you can plug in any SNARK-based proving system according to your&nbsp;needs.</p> Noir in&nbsp;Practice <p>The intuitiveness of Noir has to be seen to be believed, so we’ve created some sample implementations of circuits in Noir to show you what they look like against common reference code:</p> 🧠 Mastermind <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermind</a> is a simple number-guessing game, akin to the wildly popular puzzle game Wordle. Our implementation of Mastermind in Noir is approximately half the length of existing reference implementations.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/vezenovm/week3/blob/master/Part1/contracts/circuits/hitandblow.circom">Mastermind in&nbsp;Circom</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/vezenovm/mastermind-noir/blob/master/circuits/src/main.nr">Mastermind in&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote> 🌪️ Tornado&nbsp;Cash <p>Tornado Cash under the hood allows users to prove they possess a given note in a Merkle Tree. Below we show a sample implementation of a similar Merkle membership proof in only 10&nbsp;lines.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/tornadocash/tornado-core/blob/master/circuits/withdraw.circom">Tornado Cash in&nbsp;Circom</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/vezenovm/simple_shield/blob/master/circuits/src/main.nr">Tornado Cash in&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote> Barretenberg.js <p>Finally, alongside today’s release of Noir, we’ve developed and published Barretenberg.js–a Noir Typescript wrapper for Aztec’s Barretenberg back-end. It allows application developers to create proofs in Javascript rather than through Rust commands.</p><p>The wrapper allows for proof construction straight in the browser, allowing zk developers to quickly and easily create full-stack Noir programs.</p><p>Noir abstracts away a lot of cryptography, enabling developers to use cryptographic functionality without concerning themselves with safety, thus lowering barriers to development.</p> Noir: The&nbsp;Language <p>The Noir language, being Rust-like, comes with features out of the box that should look familiar to any app developer:</p>  Functions  Submodules  Structs / user-defined types  If statements  Loops  Global constants  <p>And there are a few features we are working on but have yet to implement, like generics and higher-order functions.</p> Use Cases <p>Noir can be used today to build zk games much faster than was previously possible. Implementations of Wordle, Battleships, and Mastermind can be done in an afternoon.</p><p>With the Barretenberg.js library, developers can also create proofs of membership and identity, blind auctions, and proofs of action on Aztec Connect that can enable private airdrops.</p><p>We are convinced that Noir is a transformational step for practical zk development. As such, we’re currently working toward rewriting Aztec’s core circuits using Noir, and we’re continuously working to improve its usability.</p> Getting Started <p>You’ve heard of zero-knowledge proofs. You’ve even heard of SNARKs and PLONK and zkRollups. But you’ve never gotten started, because you don’t have a spare brain to dedicate to learning cryptography.</p><p>That all changes today. Here’s how to install Noir, compile your first zk program, and verify it in a Solidity contract, all in 15&nbsp;minutes:</p><blockquote><a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">Getting started with&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote><p>Once you’ve gotten off the ground, show us what you’ve&nbsp;built.</p><p>We also have a portion of the Aztec Grants Program dedicated to funding Noir developers with experience writing circuits in languages like Circom, Zokrates, or Leo. If you’re interested in actively participating in Noir development as an early tester, check out our <a href="http://aztec.network/grants">Grants page</a> for more information.</p><p>And if you’re headed to Colombia Blockchain Week, we have $20,000 in prizes we’re bringing to ETHBogota for novel zk applications built with&nbsp;Noir.</p><p>We’ll be publishing more guides on development with Noir and adding to the tooling infrastructure behind it, with a singular goal — making Noir the universal language of zero knowledge.</p> Ecosystem <p>The Noir ecosystem has just gotten off the ground. But now that we’ve shown you what we’re working on, we want you to contribute.</p><p>The goal is not a wanton <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">proliferation of standards</a> but a language stack whose universality and flexibility reinforces its utility across ecosystems.</p><p>And that means we want to hear from you. Contribute to the language and Barretenberg library, and join us on Discord to talk directly to the Noir team: <a href="http://discord.gg/aztec">discord.gg/aztec</a></p> Join Us <p>We’re on the lookout for talented engineers and applied cryptographers.

From supply chain to entertainment, decentralised technology is finding its way into more and more use cases every day. The gaming industry is no exception. Blockchain now supports the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model, in which gamers can monetise their assets. This article explains the history of P2E and its mechanics and offers a comprehensive guide to help developers understand the concepts that underpin P2E models.</p>



 A look back in time 



<p>The year 2013 was chock-full of quirks. Onesies, those one-piece, often colorful jumpsuits for adults, became a thing this year. Also, selfie was named as word of the year by the Oxford Dictionary. US President Barack Obama -who, incidentally, was inaugurated for his second term in office in early 2013- became one of the high-profile personalities taking to the selfie craze with gusto. Hillary Clinton did, too.</p>



<p>In the crypto world, Bitcoin was on the rise, though its valuation fluctuated wildly throughout the year. The mother of all cryptos started 2013 with a worth of $13 per coin before reaching a peak price of $1,100 by December. As Bitcoin floundered, a related concept made its appearance: blockchain gaming. Huntercoin, the precursor of the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model, was born.</p>



<p>Huntercoin is built on the concept of ‘human mining.’ Whereas traditional Bitcoin mining requires powerful computer rigs and vast amounts of power to mine new coins, Huntercoin distributes coins around its gaming world. Players create Hunters (for a fee) to move around the map collecting coins, which must be deposited into banks that are randomly generated at regular intervals. From there, the coins can be redeemed into the Hunter’s (the player) wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project proved that the combination of blockchain -a technology still relatively new in 2013- and gaming could work. But just as the P2E industry was starting to find a solid footing, the <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mt-gox-hack/">Mt. Gox hack</a> happened. Though specifically related to Bitcoin exchange facility, the popular perception of blockchain as a ‘fraud’ or ‘scam’ took hold. The consequences of the spectacular fall of Mt. Gox rippled out across the industry. Many nascent P2E projects were halted or canned altogether, as blockchain became almost toxic. It would be several years before P2E made a significant comeback.</p>



 2017: the year of the virtual cat 



<p>Cats are immensely popular animals on social media. ‘Funny cat videos’ tend to accrue hundreds of thousands of videos on TikTok or YouTube. And back in 2017, felines spread their domain into the crypto space through CryptoKitties, a P2E game that enabled gamers to purchase NFTs depicting cute cats. Over time, players could breed their NFT pets to create new ones, and so the cycle continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CryptoKitties became the first more or less mainstream blockchain game. And it made some respectable amount of money, too. The most expensive CryptoKitty ever sold, a purple creature by the name of Dragon, fetched $1.3m (around 600 ETH at the time.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advent (and success) of the virtual cat game reignited interest in blockchain gaming, opening the floodgates for a rush of P2E games that continues to this day.</p>







 But what exactly is P2E? 



<p>In other gaming models -notably, Pay to win (P2W) and Free to play (F2P), the revenue generated only goes one way: towards the game’s developers. Gamers themselves do not benefit financially. P2E turns this one-way street concept on its head by enabling gamers to financially benefit from the value they create.</p>



<p>P2E leverages the power of blockchain to create a fair and open economic environment where value is distributed among gamers.</p>



<p>This model centers around the ownership of in-game assets. A core tenet of P2W and F2P is that, while gamers can purchase assets like weapons, skins, magic items, etc., they do not actually own them. The game’s developer retains ownership. What the gamer is purchasing is the right to use those assets in their game only. This means the gamer cannot trade these assets, and crucially, cannot use them in any other game.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology subverts that concept. Blockchain is decentralised technology, which means there is no one single authority in control. And it further means that in-game assets are not stored in a centralised server, as is the case with P2W and F2P. Instead, assets are stored on all the nodes (computers) running that blockchain.</p>



<p>In P2E games, the gamers own the assets, which can increase in value in the game’s open economy. The more you play the game, the more value is generated, and the bigger the rewards for the player. These rewards can be additional in-game assets or resources or cryptocurrencies, all of which are tokenised in the blockchain. This is a key point. By tokenizing assets, the gamers can use them elsewhere. In another blockchain-based game, for instance, or by creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can be traded. All this generates more and more value for the blockchain gaming environment and the players.</p>



 Zaisan as the nexus for providing comprehensive P2E services 



<p>Considering all the aspects explained above, companies require great expertise and understanding of the space to be able to provide efficient, comprehensive services.</p>



<p>Zaisan`fields that expertise, which enables the company to become the preferential choice for developers intending to create a P2E ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zaisan can:</p>



  Deploy <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/">backend infrastructure</a>  Offer <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/blockchain-consultancy/">consulting services</a> to assist the client in choosing the right chain  <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/blockchain-as-a-service/">Set up test environments</a>  <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/blockchain-as-a-service/">Set up a blockchain</a> customised to specifications  Build <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/bridge/">blockchain bridges</a>  Provide <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft/project-management/">NFT project management</a>  Establish a <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft/staking-platforms/">customised staking platform</a>  



<p>Additionally, identity is a key component of many aspects of life, and this includes blockchain environments, of course. Zaisan has developed my.D, a proprietary <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">Know-Your-Customer (KYC) service</a>, which enables clients to verify the identity of their potential clients. This streamlines the onboarding process and removes fraud from the equation.</p>

  KILT Protocol's migration from Kusama to Polkadot is an important technical milestone and the first parachain migration. Polkadot's 'canary network' model allows Web3 projects to test their technology in a real-world environment before upgrading to stable production networks.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>On October 3rd, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a> made history by becoming the first parachain to accomplish a full migration from the Kusama Relay Chain to the Polkadot Relay Chain. Besides marking an important technical milestone, the migration also represents the first instance of a parachain taking the upgrade path from Kusama to Polkadot. This demonstrates an important use case for the ‘canary network’ model pioneered by Polkadot, giving Web3 projects a place to stress-test their technology in a real-world environment and mitigate risk before upgrading to a more stable production network. Polkadot’s technology stack helped make the historic transition from one network to another possible.</p><p>Kusama has always been a natural starting point for teams building in the Polkadot ecosystem. As <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/kusama-polkadot-comparing-the-cousins/">Polkadot’s canary network</a>, it provides an experimental proving ground for Web3 innovation. It’s a space for teams to roll out novel features and see how technologies will perform under live network conditions before they’re deployed to the more secure, stable environment of the Polkadot Relay Chain, helping mitigate risk and providing the right conditions for parachains to evolve and mature. </p><p>Some projects have used Kusama as a network for experimentation on new ideas, where they can move fast and break things. Many teams have also used it as a pre-production environment, running a parachain on each network and using their Kusama parachain to deploy, iterate, and stress-test new technologies and features before pushing them to their production network on Polkadot.<br><br>However, some teams may decide they don’t want to run and maintain two parallel networks. In cases where the stability and bank-level security of Polkadot is integral to a parachain’s ultimate design and purpose, Kusama is very beneficial as an initial development environment that presents an upgrade path to Polkadot. It allows teams to complete their early-stage development, stress-test their technology, engage their community and launch partnerships before upgrading to the Polkadot Relay Chain.<br><br>“Happy to see KILT Protocol showing, for the first time ever, the live transition of an entire parachain ecosystem from one Relay Chain’s security umbrella to another. This is another demonstration of the power and flexibility of the Relay Chain model for decentralized application platforms,” said Dr. Gavin Wood, founder of Polkadot.<br><br>Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol, said, "It’s always exciting to do things nobody has done before. With this step, KILT becomes a business-ready decentralized network. Polkadot technology made it possible to transfer all achievements from the experimental phase to the production phase. Try that on any other technology base!"</p> Why KILT chose this path <p>KILT, a blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers (DIDs), is the first parachain to take this migration path, paving the way for other teams to follow. This decision was spurred by large-scale enterprises starting to implement business cases on KILT. These use cases require high levels of stability and security that cannot be guaranteed within the more experimental Kusama network, so following a governance decision by the KILT community, it was decided to make the logical move to Polkadot. <br><br>Kusama proved to be the right environment for KILT to develop applications quickly and try things out. Thanks to Kusama’s fast iteration cycles, KILT quickly became decentralized and added many new functionalities, allowing the network to prove its efficiency and utility. In the year since it went live, KILT partnered with many Kusama and Polkadot teams to integrate digital identities composed of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials. Five services “built on KILT” were launched, gaining tens of thousands of builders and users. Since Kusama runs around four times faster than Polkadot, with almost the same code, this greatly reduced the time needed to build and test secure KILT identity solutions now running on Polkadot.</p> How the migration was done <p>KILT won the 6th Kusama parachain slot auction, which ended on September 8, 2021. It transitioned to a decentralized network on November 10th, 2021, run by community governance. After 11 months of live deployment on Kusama, KILT secured their Polkadot parachain slot in the 24th parachain slot auction, which ended on August 11th, 2022. On August 16th, 2022 the plan to fully migrate the KILT parachain from Kusama to Polkadot was <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-moves-to-polkadot-b5d4b56f8040">announced</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-is-now-a-parachain-on-polkadot-56b9206c2114">historic migration</a> was made possible by Polkadot’s tech stack, in particular the cross-chain interoperability standard XCM and the Solo-to-parachain pallet developed by Parity Technologies. XCM allowed KILT to generate the final block on the Kusama parachain, followed by the first block on the Polkadot parachain. The Solo-to-parachain pallet allowed the KILT parachain to switch networks. All data and services built on KILT remained unchanged.</p><p>KILT not only proved the viability of using Kusama for early stage deployment and risk mitigation, but also demonstrated the technical path for migrating a parachain from one relay chain to another. By taking the upgrade path from Kusama to Polkadot, KILT is paving the way for future Web3 projects to also benefit from the valuable canary network model. Congratulations to the team and community on this accomplishment!</p> About KILT <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a blockchain identity protocol for generating self-sovereign, verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers (DIDs), providing practical, secure identity solutions for enterprise and consumers.</p><p>Interested in building on Polkadot? <a href="https://info.polkadot.network/contact">Get in touch here</a>.</p>

 Press Release: Nym amongst first industry signatories for the ‘Geneva Declaration on Targeted Surveillance and Human&nbsp;Rights’ <p>Call for industry privacy projects to sign the Declaration which was launched at the United Nations 51st Human Rights Council with signatories from government, civil society, academic and technology organisations.</p><p>NEUCHÂTEL, SWITZERLAND, 4 OCTOBER 2022 — Nym, the leader in network layer privacy, announces their signing of the new Geneva Declaration on Targeted Surveillance and Human Rights, a collective commitment to human rights in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>Led by civil society organisation <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/">Access Now</a> and the <a href="https://catalangovernment.eu/catalangovernment/">Government of Catalonia</a>, the Declaration was officially launched in Geneva during a roundtable discussion on “Spyware: A Threat to Human Rights and Democracy”, taking place in conjunction with the 51st session of the Human Rights Council. Nym CSO Jaya Brekke participated in this session as an industry representative, effectively leading Nym to be amongst the first signatories of the Declaration.</p><p>This is a solid first step in condemning the proliferation and use of surveillance technologies to target communities engaging in protected activities. Following the moratorium, urgent concrete action needs to be taken for any real change to better security for human rights and democracy. This includes the adoption of and regulatory support for privacy-preserving rather than surveillance prone technologies.</p><p>Brekke says, “It was a pleasure to come together with eminent people across sectors who share the vision that privacy as the default is in fact the very foundation for open democratic societies. The surveillance industry has, for too long, managed to make false claims that surveillance is necessary for security. The recent Pegasus attacks against environmental, human rights activists and politicians have finally made it obvious that the opposite is in fact&nbsp;true.”</p><p>“Surveillance technologies undermine security and democracy by turning anyone into a potential target. It is time to change the narrative, advocate and build strong privacy for everyone,” she&nbsp;adds.</p><p>The Declaration highlights that any export, sale, transfer, servicing or use of targeted digital surveillance technologies denies individuals fundamental privacy&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Director-General for Digital Nation and Urban Agenda at the Catalan Ministry of Digital Policies and Territory, Maria Galindo says, “Technology must provide new means to defend and improve human rights, not limit them. Right now there is no international framework to regulate spyware. So we must come together [all actors] to defend our digital rights, encourage transparency and accountability among those who sell and those who&nbsp;buy.”</p><p>“I am extremely satisfied to see private companies, like Nym, join forces in signing the Declaration of Geneva. I hope we can truly change how things work in the spyware market if more companies, governments, institutions and individuals join us,” she&nbsp;adds.</p><p>“It hurts the tech industry as a whole when bad actors enable the surveillance of individuals” says Senior UN Advocacy Officer at Access Now, Laura O’Brien. “It is important for all companies within the industry to work together — and in collaboration with civil society and governments through initiatives like the Geneva Declaration — to raise the floor for rights-respecting behaviour across the tech industry.”</p><p>Collectively, governments, civil society, tech professionals and academics worldwide need to join forces to fund, promote, build and support privacy in the digital realm. When given a viable choice, people will choose services that use privacy technologies.</p><p>Nym urges the tech, privacy and security industries to sign the Declaration and integrate privacy as a default within their infrastructure. The Declaration can be signed here: <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/geneva-declaration-end-spyware-abuse/">https://www.accessnow.org/geneva-declaration-end-spyware-abuse/</a></p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralised platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance.

<p><br>October is here, which means that it’s time to share our progress and achievements in the previous month. Let’s look at what happened in September and what we’re preparing for this one!</p> Tech and Product <p>Thanks to many advances on the contracts’ side, the front-end, and updated documentation, Advanced Staking’s launch is within an arm’s length. Throughout its development, we’ve defined several new ideas and strategies that will be crucial to Panther’s v1 functioning.<br></p><p>In the first week of September, we identified a potential DoS attack vector within the Advanced Staking redemption mechanisms. After iterating through a few solutions, we’ve settled on a design that left no window for attacks and approved by our auditors. This fix required a few UI/UX changes, which were promptly handled. We are preparing a document about this fix that also explains how Panther will deal with this and a specific type of front-running attack.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, we’ve expanded the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/token/staking/phase-2-advanced-staking">documentation on Advanced Staking and Panther Reward Points (PRPs)</a>, highlighting the difference between Advanced and Private Staking, the components that make Advanced Staking Panther’s v0.5, a straightforward explanation of the rewards involved, and more. Also, as hinted upon on last week’s weekly mini-update, we implemented a calculation feature that involves stakers minting an NFT to timestamp their stakes. This is purely a functional feature. Another article in the works will break down how PRP rewards will work.<br></p><p>Progress is simultaneously being made towards Panther’s v1. As protocol architects settled upon APIs, work on the front end progressed to the last stages of UI internal testing and bug-fixing. <br></p><p>On a minor note, our governance token $ZKP, formerly listed as "$ZKP Token", is now labeled "Panther" on <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x909E34d3f6124C324ac83DccA84b74398a6fa173">Etherscan</a>. $ZKP remains as its ticker symbol.</p> Community  AMA on Panther’s contribution to ZPrize <p>Back in May, we proudly <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-joins-zprize-and-industry-leaders-to-further-the-zero-knowledge-industry-391a494a58d6/">announced our participation in ZPrize as a Silver Partner</a>, intending to contribute to the acceleration of zero-knowledge cryptography’s future. Panther embraced the task of architecting the challenge of “<a href="https://www.zprize.io/prizes/accelerating-the-poseidon-hash-function">accelerating the Poseidon hash function</a>.”<br></p><p>On September 8th, our Co-Founder Anish Mohammed and Head of Product Saif Akhtar got together with team members of Aleo and Polychain Capital, the other ZPrize Partners collaborating towards the Poseidon hash function prize. <br></p><p>They held an AMA on the Poseidon hash function and the role of each partner in the challenge’s funding, design, and execution. <a href="https://youtu.be/IIkwHFSfwvs">The recording is available on YouTube</a> for those interested in learning more about this promising building block of zero-knowledge applications.</p> Shyft’s Office Hours <p>On September 13th, Panther's Co-Founder Oliver Gale joined Shyft Network’s Office Hours with Juan Aja and Thomas Borrel, the Co-Founder and COO of Shyft Network.<br></p><p>The conversation centered around the theme “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBStZNWjvig">Regulations on the Rise</a>,” touching on the recent regulatory moves, compliance’s role in Blockchain, and the ways Panther and Shyft are working together to address these issues without compromising trust.</p> Panther zTalks #4: Privacy Regulations in Blockchain &amp; Product Updates <p>The 4th episode of zTalks, published on September 19th, was hosted by Carlos Cano (Content Creation), Saif Akhtar (Head of Product), Natalie Cheng (regulatory SME), and Emile Josselin (Head of Community). <br></p><p>The status of privacy in blockchain in the face of the Tornado Cash crackdown, the middle ground between privacy and compliance, and updates about Advanced Staking development were a few topics discussed in this month’s episode. If you haven’t caught it yet, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmrtrAA7y9Y">zTalks #4</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PantherProtocol">Panther’s YouTube channel</a>.<br></p>Can't miss this episode!<p></p> Events <p>September 2nd, the last day of the <a href="https://cbr.stanford.edu/sbc22/">Stanford Blockchain Week</a>, had Anish joining <a href="https://republic.com/crypto">Republic Crypto</a> alongside other guests for a panel discussion on the economics of privacy.<br></p><p></p><p>On September 9th, Anish participated in a specialist panel by Tech Florida Advocates on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgyF5ok8JF8&amp;t=2s">Innovations in the Blockchain &amp; Cyber</a> as Panther’s Chief Scientist. At the Open Security Summit on September 15th, he joined their <a href="https://youtu.be/UhkMDyZy6RU">panel discussion on Blockchain and its security</a>.<br></p>Anish seriously got everyone thinking on this panel.<p></p><p>Our co-Founder delivered a 25-min talk on <a href="https://nearcon.org/">NEARCON</a> addressing “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-qg7eRlLtE&amp;t=2417s">The Economics of ZK Proofs</a>.” Taking place on September 14th, the talk explored zero-knowledge proofs’ evolution and their computational and economic costs.<br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.zebulive.xyz/">Zebu Live</a> invited Oliver Gale to attend the conference on September 23rd as a speaker. There, he delivered a 15-minute long talk titled “<a href="https://youtu.be/t030nDaOPnA?t=26330">Arrested Development: The Risks and Opportunities in The Private DeFi Space</a>.”<br></p>Looking good!<p></p> Panther in the media <p>On the 9th, Oliver was invited to join <a href="https://twitter.com/TradeTalks/status/1568290870880833536">Nasdaq TradeTalks</a>, where he discussed blockchain interoperability’s pivotal role in the future of finance and privacy in the digital realm. We have published <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/oliver-gale-nasdaq-tv-privacy-and-zero-knowledge-proofs-will-save-the-financial-system/">a recap on our blog</a> that summarizes the main points brought up by our Co-Founder.<br></p><p>Due to his participation in <a href="https://nearcon.org/">NEARCON</a>, Anish and Coindesk’s CCO Michael J. Casey got together in Lisbon and exchanged thoughts and insights on the long-term effects of the Tornado Cash ban. Casey quoted some of Anish’s remarks in his September 16th editorial “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/16/tornado-cash-ban-will-aid-chinas-ai-goals/">Tornado Cash Ban Will Aid China’s AI Goals</a>,” an insightful view of how the U.S. Government’s crackdown on financial privacy could backfire.</p> Hirings <p>This month new hires joined us as Graphic Designer and Machine Learning Intern.

<p>Fungai joined the Foundation at the beginning of this year, as our interim Engineering Project Manager, while our Engineering Manager was away on sabbatical. He quickly settled in, and began making a positive contribution, helping the team review and improve our engineering processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fungai shepherded the Zebra project through NU5 activation, and the implementation of support for lightwalletd. He also oversaw the beginning of the transition of the FROST from the research phase to implementation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Pili’s return from sabbatical, Fungai is leaving the Foundation. We are all sad to see him go, and wish him the best of luck in his future adventures!&nbsp;</p>

<p>While opinions about the actual impact of web3 are widespread, <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/web-3-0-blockchain-market-10746">web3 is certainly gaining traction</a> and will continue to do so in the coming years. Various web3 technologies have the ability to disrupt the status quo and have also highlighted new ways of managing data, while encouraging decentralisation. All in all, while the future for web3 is bright, more and more companies will have to adopt the technology in order for it to be the success it can be. Let’s take a deeper dive!</p>







 A brief overview of web1 and web2 



<p>To understand web3 and everything it is, and is not, it is important to first understand web1 and web2. As the name suggests, web1 and web2 are the technologies preceding web3. We will explain each of them below.</p>



 Web1: Simple, static, uninteractive 



<p>Web1 is an umbrella term for all the first web technologies. Unlike current web pages, pages in the web1 era, pages were simple, read-only, and anything but interactive.</p>



<p>This era was the start of the world wide web, allowing everyone around the world with an internet connection to access all the available information online. During this period many people created their own websites which contained all kinds of information, from vacation pictures to encyclopedias. The website owner maintained these pages and they contained no such things as a social aspect, dynamic content, or smart features.</p>



 Web2: The social revolution 



<p>As technology moved forward, web pages started getting more and more advanced. This allowed developers to create more interesting and interactive web pages, which marked the start of the web2 era.</p>



<p>In the web2 era, people are not just reading pages, they are also interacting with them and with other people. Websites that embrace the social aspect of the web like Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube were founded in this period and have become incredibly popular.</p>



<p>Another key part of web2 is e-commerce. While web1 pages occasionally offered products through awkward catalogue-like pages, web2 pages feature easy-to-navigate webshops with integrated payment methods. This led to online shops like Amazon gaining massive popularity.</p>



<p>All in all, the web2 era is characterised by interactivity.</p>







 What is web3? 



<p>Now you are familiar with the past and present, it is time to move on to the future. Web3 is a relatively new term, and there is no consensus on what it means exactly. However, it is universally agreed upon that web3 refers to the next generation of web technologies that will likely dictate what our digital future will look like. But what does this mean exactly?</p>



<p>One of the core values of web3 is decentralisation,&nbsp; and web3 has various key blockchain technologies that enable this vision of decentralisation, such as cryptocurrency, <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">self-sovereign identity</a>, NFT, and more. In order to get a better understanding of what this means, let’s explain what each of these terms mean in the web3 context:</p>



  Blockchain: The underlying technology of many web3 applications. In essence, blockchains are nothing more than a constantly growing list of transactions.  They are linked together using cryptography, often being managed by a network of decentralised entities.  Cryptocurrency: The finance layer on top of blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies are tokens on top of a blockchain that can be exchanged between people using a blockchain. These kinds of cryptocurrencies are often managed in a decentralised way. This means the network (and its participants) decide how the tokens are created and distributed.  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): The ability for individuals and organisations to own and control their identities, without intervention or interference from any third parties. In this context, ‘self-sovereignty’ refers to the ability of the individual or the organisation in control of the identity to share it and present it to other agencies with no intermediaries.  Non-Fungible Token (NFT): In short, a non-fungible token is a token that represents a unique object. An NFT is unique, meaning there is no 100% similar NFT. They are the opposite of regular/fungible tokens, which are all similar and interchangeable. Another key difference between regular tokens and NFTs is that NFTs are non-divisible. NFTs allow the tokenisation of both digital or physical objects.  



<p>In essence, web3 is nothing more than an umbrella term for the next generation of (web) technologies. And together, the technologies described above form the basis for web3. However, the definition of web3 and all the concepts and technologies associated with it are not set in stone. As time and technology move forward the definition and impact of web3 will become more clear.</p>



 The technology of the future? 



<p>Technology is moving forward at a fast pace. The first smartphone with internet connectivity was introduced only 20 years ago, yet a world without smartphones seems almost unimaginable these days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same goes for web technologies. What started as a simple way for people to access information, has grown to become an integral part of our lives. Web technologies have evolved a lot over the years, with the latest and greatest technological advancements being referred to as web3. Only the future can tell whether it will actually be impactful. But one thing is certain, it is exciting to see technology moving forward!</p>

 Introduction <p>As Ethereum emerged to provide smart-contract functionalities that the Bitcoin network could not support, Ethereum competitors rose to provide alternatives to its lingering problems.</p><p>So-called “Ethereum killers” may pride themselves on being novel ideas but, until now, most of their success is largely attributed to the limitations of the second most valuable blockchain network in the world. As they attempt to outperform the smart contract giant, valuable trade-offs have enabled them to make unexpected progress.</p><p>We have lately seen developments that indicate that Ethereum competitors are on the verge of taking steps that will forever differentiate them. Even though Ethereum has a roadmap with upgrades and transitions that will address its current challenges in the long term, its competitors have been able to make huge inroads at its expense.</p><p>In this article, we will look into Ethereum and its different issues. We will also explore how its competitors address these challenges while highlighting the tradeoffs they have had to make along the way.</p> Ethereum's challenges <p>In 2015, Ethereum emerged as an alternative to Bitcoin and its perceived simplicity as a general-purpose blockchain. Although <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-crypto-projects-bitcoin-competitors-or-not/">Bitcoin</a> was a breakthrough blockchain innovation, it was limited to payments and serving as a store of value. Ethereum changed the narrative of the crypto space when it introduced smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications on its network.</p><p>After powering the 2017 ICO craze, Ethereum began to experience exponential growth. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">Decentralized</a> applications sprung up rapidly on the network, and the price of its native token, Ether (ETH), began a steady climb (although it isn’t immune to the crypto market’s characteristic swings). Since its early years, Ethereum has witnessed massive adoption, boasting a majority of the dApps in the ecosystem and powering the growth of Decentralized Finance.</p>Ethereum’s average transaction fees through hype cycles. (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum/chart/txn-fee-avg">Source</a>)<p>Ethereum's widespread adoption has turned out to be a bittersweet occurrence. On the one hand, its growth drives innovation and users towards the crypto space, allowing ideas to become a reality. It is also the ideal framework for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-defi-privacy-suite-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary/">DeFi</a>, blockchain gaming, the metaverse, and other blockchain applications. On the other hand, the network’s first attempt at mass adoption exposed its frailties, as it struggled to remain scalable and economical due to the increased adoption.</p><p>Let’s take a look at Ethereum’s main challenges:</p> Scalability <p>The lack of scalability on Ethereum is probably the most talked-about problem the blockchain network faces, mostly because it is more evident than others. Through the ICO boom and DeFi summer, transaction volumes on Ethereum surged astronomically, as expected with widespread adoption. One small problem, however, arguably stopped further expansion: the network’s speed, or lack thereof.</p><p>Ethereum today can only process about 15-30 <a href="https://ethtps.info/">transactions per second</a>. With surging transaction volumes, slow TPS figures will lead to network congestion, resulting in delayed transaction finality and humongous transaction fees (see below). With dApps like games or decentralized exchanges needing instant transaction finality, Ethereum's processing power is a real challenge for applications built on the network, and arguably a reason many use cases haven’t found adoption on Ethereum.</p><p>Back when Ethereum first launched, many believed that it could increase its number of transactions per second by ramping up its node size (the amount of data a user needs to store to run a node) over the long term. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/">Nodes</a> are active participants that run the blockchain and store its data. Increasing node size to combat scalability challenges will lead to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-dev-addresses-node-centralization-concerns-in-runup-to-the-merge">centralization</a>, as only a few powerful entities can participate in a “huge node” system.</p><p>It’s worth noting here that increasing the block size to scale a network is a thing of the past. In recent years, the scalability conversations have moved on to Layer-2s and Rollups as solutions to scale the network without the challenge of centralization. However, centralization fears <a href="https://beincrypto.com/80-of-ethereum-blocks-were-relayed-by-flashbots/">still persist</a>, especially with the recent transition of the Ethereum network’s consensus mechanism from PoW to PoS.</p> Increasing Transaction Costs <p>Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/crypto-made-easy/vitalik-buterin-says-transaction-fees-need-to-reduce-to-5-cents-to-remain-acceptable/75941/1">claims</a> that Ethereum's gas fees should be around $0.05, ideally. During the DeFi boom and the gas wars that followed, average gas fees on Ethereum <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/defi-boom-fueling-eth-gas-fees-threatens-viability-of-smart-contracts/">soared</a> to around $60-$70. Within the Ethereum ecosystem. gas fees are simply bids for including a set of transactions in the limited block space. In case of high demand, these bids go up as users attempt to fast-track their transactions to gain an edge. This results in extremely high transaction costs.</p><p>At such levels, interacting with applications on Ethereum is beyond the reach of the average Web3 user, making developers opt for cheaper blockchain networks like Solana and BSC.</p><p>It is important to note that <a href="https://blockchain.news/opinion/opinion-why-ethereum-merge-wont-lower-gas-fees">the Merge</a> has not solved Ethereum's gas fees challenges. However, recent upgrades and the crypto market mood have seen average gas <a href="https://thedefiant.io/ethereum-gas-fees-low-level">prices drop</a> from around $40 to $15.55 as of the second half of 2022.</p> Centralization Fears <p>When Ethereum existed as a <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-proof-of-work-pow/">proof-of-work</a> blockchain, some mining pools were considerably larger than others and, as such, had more consensus power. Of course, this model sparked talks of centralization, which defeats everything Ethereum represents: a secure, scalable, and decentralized blockchain network.</p><p>Today, Ethereum has completed its transition (known as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">The Merge</a>) to a proof-of-stake model after launching a Beacon chain in 2021 in preparation. The new arrangement has phased out the miners, replacing them with validators who staked Ether (ETH). More centralization fears have emerged as institutional capital and large exchanges vie for a large chunk of ETH staking power.</p> Privacy <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/is-privacy-a-human-right-philosophy-economics-legality/">Privacy</a> is almost non-existent on Ethereum and many other Layer-1 blockchains, which presents a problem. Ethereum is a fully transparent blockchain, which means that every interaction is not only stored on the ledger but accessible to the public. While transparency may be a good thing, it is extreme, especially for institutional players and DeFi traders.</p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">Zero-knowledge rollups</a> built on Ethereum have solved the privacy challenge to some extent, but these solutions cannot pass off as traditional blockchains. Many of them are limited and unable to support smart contract deployment. For example, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zkevm-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/">zkEVMs</a> are still in a work-in-progress stage, and without EVM compatibility it would be impossible for Layer-2 privacy solutions to reach mass adoption.</p> MEV <p>MEV stands for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">Maximal Extractable Value</a>, a concept regularly associated with the Ethereum network (however, MEV is not Ethereum-specific). MEV represents the highest value that miners can extract from changing the position of transactions when creating an Ethereum block. MEV is <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/#the-good-side-of-mev">not exactly a bad thing</a>, although malicious attempts are now common. Protocols have used MEV to balance prices across decentralized exchanges.</p><p>While MEV was known as Miner Extraction Value in the proof-of-work era, Ethereum has since become a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">proof-of-stake</a> blockchain. Still, the network is susceptible to several kinds of tactics for extracting MEV, like sandwich attacks, liquidation, and front-running. Due to how profitable MEV is for validators, independent searchers, and other network participants (MEV extraction since 2021 was allegedly worth over $600 million), MEV is not going away anytime soon.</p> Ethereum competitors <p>So-called Ethereum killers have sprung up everywhere in the crypto space, each addressing one or more of Ethereum's lingering problems. Here are how the most prominent Ethereum competitors line up and the challenges they mitigate:</p> Ethereum competitors that aim for scalability (Solana, Polkadot, Near) <p>Ethereum averages 15 to 30 transactions per second, making it less scalable than several Ethereum competitors. Chief among Ethereum's competitors that prioritize scalability include Solana, Near, and Polkadot.</p><p>Solana uses a <a href="https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274">proof-of-history</a> mechanism, as opposed to Ethereum's proof-of-stake, to validate transactions. With an emphasis on scalability, Solana transacts at breakneck speed, boasting TPSs of up to 65,000 per second. It’s worth pointing out that Solana's claimed TPS numbers are vastly inflated due to consensus voting messages being included on-chain. As of a report in January 2022, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/new-data-shows-how-solana-transactions-compare-against-ethereum/">Solana’s actual TPS</a> stands at around 3000.</p><p>Gas fees on Solana are usually less than a fraction of a cent, making it a more scalable option than Ethereum. As a tradeoff, Solana has few validators and is a less decentralized network than Ethereum, and its speed and low transaction fees make it susceptible to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-hit-with-another-network-incident-causing-degraded-performance">DDOS attacks</a>. Solana Labs' Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko has repeatedly denied the network's susceptibility to DDOS attacks. Yakovenko blames Solana's network congestion and halts issues on its <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1478414400339939331">cost model</a> for computing which requires the transactions to specify all the resources they use up-front.</p><p><a href="https://near.org/">Near</a> is a Layer-1 blockchain solution that uses a proof-of-stake model and a powerful <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3336187/sharding-what-it-is-and-why-so-many-blockchain-protocols-rely-on-it.html">sharding</a> technology that ensures the network is never congested, even during peak periods. As a result, block finality on Near takes under two seconds, making it more scalable than Ethereum. As with Solana, Near trades decentralization for scalability, as it has fewer validators than Ethereum and Solana.</p><p><a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> is another highly scalable blockchain, although it employs a different approach than Solana, Near, and Ethereum. Polkadot's infrastructure connects multiple parallel blockchains, and it achieves transactional scalability by spreading the transactions across the parallel blockchains. When all <a href="https://www.prolitus.com/blog/what-are-parachain-and-parathread-in-the-polkadot-blockchain/">parachains and parathreads</a> on Polkadot go live, it is expected to achieve speeds of up to one million transactions per second (it’s always recommended to always take TPS estimation claims with a pinch of salt).</p> Aiming for interoperability (Cosmos, Cardano) <p>Interoperability means interactions between blockchains. Most traditional blockchains do not have infrastructure that allows them to speak to one another. Although Ethereum supports <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/cross-chain-defi-possible-or-forever-limited/">cross-chain</a> bridges, the network's interoperability pales compared to Cosmos and Cardano.</p><p><a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a> defines itself as "A decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by a BFT consensus algorithm like Tendermint consensus." This means that, unlike Ethereum or other Layer-1 competitors, Cosmos is not just a blockchain but a network of many of these blockchains operating in parallel with one another.</p><p>Cosmos typifies interoperability with its framework of Cosmos SDK, the <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/tendermint-explained-bringing-bft-based-pos-to-the-public-blockchain-domain-f22e274a0fdb">Tendermint</a> BFT (<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/byzantine-fault-tolerance-explained">Byzantine fault-tolerant</a>) algorithm, and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.</p><p>Since every blockchain in the Cosmos network is powered by the same BFT consensus mechanism called Tendermint, these blockchains can operate independently and yet interoperate with each other. That way, Cosmos network aims to create an internet of blockchains. Presently, blockchains built on Cosmos do not enjoy their underlying layer's security, although the introduction of <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-security-is-coming-to-the-cosmos-hub-f144c45fb035">interchain security</a> will solve this problem.</p>A diagram of Cosmos’s “Hub and Zone” model that lets Cosmos scale communication across all app-chains. (<a href="https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/how-does-cosmos-work-how-does-it-compare-to-bitcoin-and-ethereum-part-2">Source</a>)<p><a href="https://cardano.org/">Cardano</a> is another blockchain network geared towards interoperability. While Ethereum's interoperability is valid within its ecosystem and based on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC-20</a> standard, Cardano uses side chains to facilitate blockchain-to-blockchain communication. Currently, Cardano does not have any notable tradeoff for its interoperability functionality.</p> Aiming for security (MEV Mitigation) (Solana &amp; Osmosis) <p>MEV extraction threatens Ethereum's viability, and here's how Ethereum competitors have managed to combat MEV extraction on their networks.</p><p><a href="https://osmosis.zone/">Osmosis</a> is a decentralized exchange built on Cosmos, and it has introduced a threshold cryptography mechanism that effectively limits validators' ability to MEV. Using threshold cryptography, Osmosis encrypts trade values before they hit the mempool, ensuring that front-running is impossible.</p><p>Learn more about how Osmosis aims to leverage threshold cryptography to mitigate MEV in this video podcast of Osmosis Labs’ co-founder Sunny Aggarwal:</p><p>Solana's infrastructure also makes it <a href="https://chainstack.com/what-is-mev-and-how-does-solana-solves-its-mev-issues/">less susceptible</a> to MEV extraction techniques like front-running or the utilization of searchers, as there is no mempool. The lack of mempools also prevents sandwich attacks. On this network, front-running bots can be mitigated with taxes on invalid transactions and increasing the cost of sending spam requests.</p><p>Also, only leading validators in a cluster can access transaction information before finality. If any validator engages in malicious activities, they will be penalized. As said earlier, Solana trades decentralization for speed, MEV mitigation, and scalability.</p> Aiming for privacy (Secret Network, Oasis, Panther) <p>Privacy concerns on Ethereum are valid, seeing that Ethereum is a fully transparent network. Two blockchain networks that have made inroads into privacy are <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> and <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Protocol</a>.</p><p>Secret Network has strong claims to be the first privacy-first Layer-1 blockchain solution. The network is built with the Cosmos SDK, and it leverages a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.</p><p>With encryption protocols, key management, and a Trusted Execution Environment, Secret Network provides a form of privacy known as <a href="https://scrt.network/blog/programmable-privacy/">Programmable Privacy</a>, which supports smart contract deployment. While Secret Network prides itself as a privacy-first blockchain, it does not improve on Ethereum's scalability challenges and has suffered <a href="https://forum.scrt.network/t/discuss-network-issues-w-shade-airdrop-2-21-22/5475">congestion</a> with even lesser transaction volumes than Ethereum.</p><p>Oasis is another privacy-first concept, and it uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and <a href="https://www.trustonic.com/technical-articles/what-is-a-trusted-execution-environment-tee/">Trusted Execution Environments</a> to achieve confidential computing. The privacy features on Oasis allow the network to support data tokenization and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">private DeFi</a>, protecting sensitive user information and allowing for reputation-based under-collateralization. While Oasis is also more scalable than Ethereum, it has fewer validators, making it somewhat susceptible to centralization.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Panther protocol</a> is a cross-chain, privacy solution. It provides transactional privacy to DeFi users using a combination of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">zero-knowledge proofs</a> and game theory, thus, programmatically protecting their alpha. Panther also supports <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">KYC</a> and selective disclosures between trusted parties, enabling various services such as ID, authorization, and data verification services.</p>Blockchains in Trusted Execution Environments. (<a href="https://medium.com/@nadeem.bhati/blockchains-in-trusted-execution-environments-tees-9343b6c3f9e8">Source</a>) Ethereum competitors ain’t a threat… for now. <p>Ethereum's competitors have been around for a long while. While many can lay claim to fixing some of the lingering issues plaguing the Ethereum network, none has successfully wrested a significant portion of Ethereum's market share.</p><p>Ethereum has a loyal community, and the abundance of developer resources plus its popularity gives it a significant advantage compared to its competitors. However, some feel like the clock is ticking for Ethereum to solve its scalability issues before another blockchain eats a piece of its proverbial pie.</p><p>Solana, Near, and Polkadot are more scalable options, Secret Network and Oasis offer programmable privacy, Cosmos and Cardano support better interoperability, and MEV extraction is less of a worry on Solana and Osmosis. It’s certainly within the leading smart contract’s roadmap to fix some of these issues while on others (such as privacy), it’s practically a given that the network has forfeited them.</p><p>Over the next years, we should see how Ethereum performs as a Proof-of-Stake network with full sharding abilities. In the meantime, no one can discard the sudden emergence of a qualified player to (either temporarily or permanently) contend for the top spots in Layer-1 adoption.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in Decentralized Finance using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.<br><br>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Web3 game developers can access key functions to integrate assets on Findora into their games using Defungify. <p>Developers can now seamlessly connect their Web3 game to the Findora blockchain with Defungify, a middleware company focused on making Web3 game development as easy as possible.</p>Defungify Is Now on&nbsp;Findora<p>The integration will make life much easier for game developers building on the Findora network. They will have access to an easy-to-use system that integrates NFTs into games with functions like fetching NFT metadata, querying an NFT from the blockchain, and much&nbsp;more.</p><p>From Defungify:</p><blockquote>Every blockchain operates differently, and the technology isn’t trivial to integrate with. If a game developer decides to add a new chain, the game developer would be essentially starting from scratch. Once Defungify is installed, you’re instantly multichain for your game. It’s a way to futureproof the game so it has the best chance of success long&nbsp;term.</blockquote><p>💡Follow Findora on <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">Twitter</a> or join the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Findora_Official/">Reddit Community</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p><p>Defungify focuses on integrating with new blockchains so developers can focus on building a fun game. Its extensive toolkit includes NFT minting, a game launcher, testnet support, native cross-chain convertible NFTs, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Findora offers a way for gaming platforms to work privacy into their games and protect player data. This can open a whole new realm of possibilities for game developers as players can hide what NFTs are in their wallets and what competitive advantage they may&nbsp;have.</p><p>But the innovation isn’t limited to GameFi. A leader in Web3 privacy, Findora is finding new ways to apply zero-knowledge proofs, including building a <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/adding-privacy-to-blockchain-identity-management-through-zkdid-6adb12a50a3f">zk-DID system</a> and adding <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/the-findora-improvement-proposal-that-could-bring-auditability-to-privacy-a21952ca4f55">auditability to confidential transactions</a> for institutional adoption. Findora is actively preparing its chain for GameFi activity.</p><p>Learn more about Defungify on their <a href="https://www2.defungify.app/">website</a> and follow their <a href="https://twitter.com/DefungifyApp">Twitter</a> for updates on their progress.</p> About Findora <p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography. An innovative layer-1, it combines a native UTXO ledger optimized for privacy with an EVM extension for programmability and interoperability. Developers can leverage either model as they build dApps with auditable privacy.</p><p>Interested in developing on Findora?

Below is a highlight of the features brought to Findora with&nbsp;v0.3.30.</p><blockquote>💡 Follow Findora on <a href="http://twitter.com/findora">Twitter </a>and visit the <a href="https://findora.org">website </a>for more information.</blockquote> Findora 💜 on Twitter: "Release v0.3.30 is now deployed to Anvil testnet 🙌Progress is being made towards a mainnet deployment as the stability of the release is vetted in the testnet environment.Stay tuned for more as v0.3.30 moves closer to mainnet, bringing increased decentralization to #Findora. https://t.co/DoQ0J34PeF / Twitter" <p>Release v0.3.30 is now deployed to Anvil testnet 🙌Progress is being made towards a mainnet deployment as the stability of the release is vetted in the testnet environment.Stay tuned for more as v0.3.30 moves closer to mainnet, bringing increased decentralization to #Findora. https://t.co/DoQ0J34PeF</p> v0.3.30 Highlights <p>An almost 2x increase in consensus decentralization.</p>  The active validator count on Findora will increase from 58 to&nbsp;100.  <blockquote>💡 Interested in running a validator on Findora? <a href="https://t.me/findora_validators">Join the community-led validator support group on Telegram</a>.</blockquote><p>Increased the mempool of the validators and full&nbsp;nodes.</p>  This change increases the number of transactions full nodes can&nbsp;accept.  <p>The consensus layer is enhanced to be multi-threaded.</p>  Reduced serialization and reduces transaction queuing.  <p>Transaction validation is optimized.</p>  We are driving towards full compatibility with Ethereum standards in terms of how transactions are validated and accepted into the&nbsp;mempool.  <p>Reduce memory allocation and&nbsp;release.</p>  This change optimizes how memory is allocated and released.  <p>Removed redundant checking.</p>  We are removing redundant privilege checks.  <p>Improved SessionCache</p>  We are enhancing memory management for all nodes on the network by optimizing the SessionCache logic, moving from a multi-simulator method to a single-simulator, delta-based method.  <p>Reduction of Verbose&nbsp;Logs</p>  Reducing log printing to improve resource consumption.  <p>Improvements to Recover_Signer</p>  We will cache the signer to reduce the number of look-ups for transactions who have the same signer in the&nbsp;block.  <p>Findora Substate</p>  Increasing the speed of inter smart contract calls and brings full compatibility with Ethereum exception handling for those&nbsp;calls.  <p>These features and enhancements are separate from the privacy-focused initiatives coming to the Findora network, such as EVM Privacy, a decentralized identity (DID) solution powered by zero-knowledge (coming via FIP3), and auditability on a new asset class called Auditable Privacy-Preserving Assets, or APPA (coming via&nbsp;FIP2).</p> About Findora <p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography. An innovative layer-1, it combines a native UTXO ledger optimized for privacy with an EVM extension for programmability and interoperability. Developers can leverage either model as they build dApps with auditable privacy.</p><p>Interested in developing on Findora? See our developer documentation for more information.</p><p>We appreciate our developers and would love to onboard you to the Findora ecosystem.

<p>We’re happy to announce the release of Samourai Wallet 0.99.98f. <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/download/wallet">You can download the APK from our website </a>or on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samourai.wallet">Google Play</a>. You can find <a href="https://docs.samourai.io/en/wallet/releases#v09998f">release notes</a> on our documentation site.</p><p>This is a big update with dramatic UI changes, new functionality, the release of a brand new feature, and improvements for our power&nbsp;users.</p> PayNym Bot &amp; Toolbar&nbsp;Menu <p>You’ll notice that the Samourai logo in the top left of the toolbar has been replaced with your individual PayNym Bot image. A PayNym Bot is a visual representation of a BIP47 Reusable Payment Code. A Bot is created by taking a BIP47 code and applying a hashing algorithm which produces a unique fingerprint used to create the Bot image. So each bot image is unique to each wallet. If you tap your PayNym bot image you will open the new toolbar&nbsp;menu.</p><p>In the Toolbar Menu you’ll notice some new options such as Collaborate and Tools. So let’s move on to the next major UI update we have made, Collaborative Transactions (Cahoots) has had a major UI&nbsp;rework.</p> Collaborate <p>The collaborative transaction has a long history in Samourai. In March 2019 we released our first iteration of collaborative transactions. It required users to manually scan and share at least 5 QR codes with their collaborator. It was just a start but we knew it would develop into a key&nbsp;feature.</p><p>In November 2020 <a href="https://medium.com/samourai-wallet/wallet-update-0-99-96-introducing-soroban-adc9a36a7ddb">we released our new open source app-agnostic, Tor based encrypted communication protocol called Soroban</a>. This allowed us to automate the coordination of small 2 person collaborative coinjoin transactions to make them much quicker than before and without using a centralised coordinator. These transactions, STONEWALLx2 and Stowaway enjoy heavy use among our user base and have even been implemented along with Soroban in third party wallets such as <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow&nbsp;Wallet</a>.</p><p>In this update we have created a brand new UI for both initiating and collaborating in STONEWALLx2 or Stowaway transaction.</p><p>Up until now the collaborative transaction workflow and UI were somewhat of an afterthought, and users needed to be pretty savvy in navigating around the app to make use of the&nbsp;feature.</p><p>This update should make it even easier for anyone to participate or initiate a new collaborative transaction. Both initiation and participation are located in one easy to reach location (before this update there could be 4 different places to go to initiate or participate in a transaction like&nbsp;this!)</p><p>For those that need a quick primer on STONEWALLx2:</p><blockquote>This type of transaction is a two person coinjoin that the sender and a third party collaborate to send to an external wallet. This is a great choice when sending to someone who doesn’t have Samourai Wallet, for instance a merchant using BTCPayServer. Using a STONEWALLx2 transaction to make your payments undermines the Common Input Ownership Heuristic — a bedrock of blockchain snoops and&nbsp;spies.</blockquote> Introducing JoinBot <p>One of the problems that remain with Collaborative Transactions in Samourai Wallet is that you need someone to collaborate with. This can be a problem for many users, especially new users. They may want to explore the feature, or benefit from the privacy enhancements that Collaborative Transactions offer but be unable to do so because they don’t have anyone they can collaborate with.</p><p>This is the perfect time to introduce our newest feature, JoinBot. For a small spam prevention fee you can have JoinBot act as the second participant in a STONEWALLx2 collaborative transaction</p><p>There are some benefits choosing to use JoinBot as your STONEWALLx2 collaborator.</p>  Joinbot is always online, so it is great for time sensitive payments where you might not have time to find a collaborator who is online and able to help&nbsp;you.  Joinbot only uses UTXOs directly from Whirlpool postmix, so you do not need to worry about the history of the collaborating UTXOs and how they have been handled by the collaborator.  Since JoinBot is online 24/7 it always has UTXOs registered for remixing, so there are very good odds that you collaborating with extremely well remixed&nbsp;UTXOs.   JoinBot fees <p>There is a small anti-spam fee in addition to the usual miner fees when using JoinBot. The service fee is set at 3.5% of the send amount or 0.01 BTC, whichever is&nbsp;less.</p><p>For example, if you are sending 0.1 BTC using JoinBot as a collaborator the fee would be 0.0035 BTC, meanwhile sending 1 BTC would use the capped maximum fee of 0.01&nbsp;BTC.</p><p>The fee is paid in a second transaction automatically using another type of collaborative transaction called Stowaway.</p><p>The fee transaction is not associated with the JoinBot transaction on the blockchain. This makes sure the STONEWALLx2 transaction made with JoinBot looks like every other STONEWALL transaction out there, you cannot tell any difference.</p> Some caveats   You will need to have at least two unrelated UTXOs available in your wallet in order to successfully perform a STONEWALLx2 with&nbsp;JoinBot.  STONEWALLx2 requires that both participants each pay half of the transaction miner fee. This is respected with JoinBot, but you will reimburse JoinBot for that half of the miner fee within the anti-spam fee transaction.  For this initial release we are only allowing a maximum transaction amount of 1.5 BTC using JoinBot as a collaborator. The minimum amount you can send is 546&nbsp;sats.   Tools <p>We’ve also introduced a new screen in the wallet activated from the new Toolbar Menu. This screen is called ‘Tools’ and contains new UI for sweeping private keys and calculating addresses for your wallet. Most casual users will not have much need to use this section of the wallet, but will be a big upgrade for our power&nbsp;users.</p>  Sweep Private key — You now have full control of the miner fee you pay for sweeping a private key, as well as what address derivation you wish to sweep to. The final big change here is you can now sweep Taproot addresses into your Samourai&nbsp;Wallet.  Sign Message — We moved this from where it was buried in the settings. You can now very easily sign a message using any address on any derivation within your&nbsp;wallet.  Wallet Address Calculator — Again, we moved this from buried deep in the settings. You can now derive address, redeem script and private key from any address in your wallet on any derivation path.   Authenticate using&nbsp;PayNym <p>A few years ago we came up with a specification for allowing users to login to websites/apps without needing to provide a username or password, just by using their PayNym. Sparrow Wallet has already added this specification into their wallet. Keep tuned for further announcements about this feature in the near&nbsp;future.</p> Thank you <p>Download Samourai Wallet 0.99.98f today.

Sharding and the expanding ecosystem of Layer 2 solutions that make more efficient use of blockchain resources will be essential to bringing more users to Web3. Additionally, the regulatory landscape may need to adjust to dealing with specific types of applications, versus trying to control layer 1 blockchains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data sells. A common notion out there. Yet it is oblivious to many of us, or we merely undermine the underlying value of our data.</p>



<p>The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data – <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data">Economist</a></p>



<p>Many companies leverage the acquired data to make big bucks, while one on an individual level is left to wonder how he is shown advertisements that correspond to his intent or interests. Almost everyone is a victim of targeted advertisements, but targeted advertisements are merely the tip of the iceberg. Remember getting that loyalty card from your local supermarket to get reward points? Or how about signing up for the Starbucks loyalty program to get free coffee? All they took in return were some key credentials such as your name, phone number, email, date of birth, and address. Similarly, giving consent to a mobile application to access your contacts, location, messages, and gallery or enabling a website to access cookies. It leaves us with a simple question: should we be handing over all this data? A simple photography application might require access to your location and contacts. What could be the reason for that?</p>



<p>All these credentials are used to store data, which comprises personal, behavioral, and engagement information. This data helps in generating user profiles, which in turn are sold to companies ultimately generating revenue. Every offline and online transaction gives away data that holds a monetary value. Everyone is getting their fair share of the pie and the only person missing out from the whole equation is the one giving out his data voluntarily for a free coffee or some discounts. It is not the companies hacking into your data: you are providing it of your own volition.</p>



<p>Terming it as a “Faustian Bargain”, Jeff Wiles states that it is a tradeoff we have to make in the digital world, adding on to that he stated one cannot be an “online hermit” these days.</p>



<p>Most of our daily life transactions are either carried out online or offline through various identity instruments or credentials, which comprise physical — a national ID card, passport, college degree, bank details — and digital credentials — email logins, and social media accounts. These transactions are essential to carry out day-to-day activities. But by providing these details, one also shares information that is entirely irrelevant. People feel more in control using their physical credentials. But what if they go missing or become inaccessible? Certainly, disadvantageous, as it is time-consuming to get them made again, or to pay the delivery fee again in the case of sending the documents abroad. In some cases, missing identity credentials could also lead to fraudulent activities — identity theft or manipulation — geared towards malignant designs. In a transformative world where paperless means of communication are becoming more popular, physical means of information sharing pose a great hurdle</p>



<p>One might say digital credentials are much more secure. Think again.</p>



<p>In earlier times, signing in using your digital credentials was done in silos, which meant creating unique identities and passwords for every single domain or application. A rather cumbersome task. Managing all these credentials became even more arduous, with so many usernames to remember. This later changed to a centralised alliance between the companies and third-party identity — login with Google, log in with Facebook—with each party having bits of autonomy.</p>



 Data losses and the stolen identity dilemma 



<p>Digital onboarding undeniably helped with the issue of password management and identity management. But what many did not realise was that, in doing so, they were handing over the access to their data to third-party companies, entrusting them with even more data.</p>



<p>The problems pertain not only to an individual level. Enterprises suffered a huge number of losses owing to data breaches for more than a decade. Personally identifiable information — IDs, passports, names, addresses, credit cards — all had been compromised by hackers who mainly hacked into the central databases of not just enterprises, but government systems also.</p>



<p>The data of Equifax, the largest U.S-based credit bureau, was compromised in 2017. The data breach comprised personal credentials, including social security numbers, birth dates, and addresses. The initial figure quoted contained 143 million consumers; 209,000 consumers also had their credit card data exposed, which was later raised to 147.9 million. Dubsmash, a popular video app, had its data put up for sale by the hackers on Dream Market: a dark web market comprising 1162 million email addresses, usernames, and passwords stolen. Personal data of users of the Under Armour-owned fitness app MyFitnessPal was among the massive information dump on Dream Market as well, resulting in the leakage of 617 million customer accounts.</p>



<p>Even the hospitality industry was not spared. The biggest hotel chain, Marriott International, declared that data of 500 million customers had been stolen. The breach started in 2014, and it took the company 4 years to realise its data was compromised. Once again, the primary intent was to hack personal identifiers and credentials (credit card numbers and expiration dates).</p>



<p>The backlash that Uber had to face following a data breach sank the company’s stock. Uber had chosen to keep the breach secret, until it became publicly denounced. It later emerged that Uber had acceded to pay ransom money to hackers. If that is not enough, wait until you come across “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizon-yahoo/yahoo-in-new-117-5-million-data-breach-settlement-after-earlier-accord-rejected-idUSKCN1RL1H1">The biggest data breach</a>” of the decade: the popular search engine and webmail company, Yahoo, had its data breached too. The figures came down to 3 billion in 2016.</p>



<p>The average total cost of a data breach in the U.S. for the companies studied had grown from $3.54 million in 2006 to $8.19 million in 2019, a 130 percent increase over 14 years – IBM (2019)</p>



<p>Identifying the root cause of breaches, IBM reported malicious attacks to be a major contributor – 51 percent of data breaches were because of malicious attacks. The report conducted entailed 17 sectors from housing and entertainment, to the healthcare industry. The average total cost of a data breach in the healthcare industry was $6.45 million</p>



 GDPR to the rescue 



<p>To safeguard the individual’s data, the European Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into action. Companies with clients in the European Union were told to be prepared in advance to strengthen measures to keep data intact and to allow transparency to be in place – consumers should be aware of the data that is being acquired and the underlying reason behind the acquisition. Furthermore, they would gain the right for them to revoke their data.</p>



<p>Altruistic in its fundamental motive – to give control of an individual’s data to themselves and protect their data – the European GDPR regulations came into existence. The United States adopted a similar model and came up with the California Consumer Privacy Act. Companies started gearing up for GDPR compliance back in 2018.</p>



<p>According to the report published by IAPP, around 1.1 billion was spent on the preparation of GDPR alone in the UK — Forbes</p>



<p>The cost of continuous compliance reported for small and medium enterprises surpassed $100,000. A reported figure of $1 million was spent by 20% of the companies to be prepared for GDPR. Many companies had to dump their data and start from scratch, as the amount of capital for getting technical and legal expertise to remodel their existing system seemed inordinate and transcended their financial solvency.</p>



 Debunking the centralisation dilemma 



<p>Although driven by an altruistic cause, GDPR still operates on centralisation. With the introduction of GDPR, an idea of data security and data ownership was instilled amongst the masses, reaffirming our faith in enterprises, yet centralisation remains the biggest hurdle.</p>



<p>Centralisation itself is the biggest risk. No matter how secure you make it, or how much companies spend on cybersecurity measures regardless of the type of encryption level, hackers will find a way to break in.</p>



 Self-Sovereign Identity and Distributed Ledger Technology 



<p>If centralisation is the issue, would it be possible to make data more secure and increase personal data ownership using a decentralised solution? One of these possible decentralised solutions is <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI). SSI is essentially an identity base layer, which operates on blockchain technology, making it decentralised by nature.</p>



<p>A common question may arise, how does decentralisation avert security breaches and data hacks?</p>



<p>Decentralisation implies that data is being stored on distributed channels instead of one, meaning it is not stored in a centralised database. This makes it more secure, and data autonomy is not centralised. That means enterprises will not have to pay a hefty amount of money to cybersecurity companies to keep their data intact. While it sounds rather utopian, it is quite the contrary and it is very simplistic and attainable.</p>



<p>Imagine going to a car hire company and renting a car in another country. Now this company does not need to know about your date of birth or the expiry date of your licence. All it needs to know is that the permit is valid for the time duration the car is being hired for, is issued by a trusted authority (government of the country), and whether that issuing authority has legal credentials or strategic alliance with the country of the car hire company. As soon as the car is returned safely to the car hire company the information provided initially should be wiped out from their system unless there are security concerns.</p>



<p>To fully comprehend the alternative paradigm -SSI-, one must be familiar with the ecosystem in which it operates: blockchain. Before moving on to blockchain, one must be familiar with two key terms that the SSI incorporates:</p>



  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable credentials (VCs)</a>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)</a>  



<p>Now, it all appears to be very complicated with the technical jargon involved, but it is a very simple model to understand.</p>



<p>Verifiable credentials imply that your personal information has been issued by an issuer, a governing body, an authority — say a government, an educational institute, or a bank.</p>



<p>Once you get a hold of these digital credentials, you become the subject or holder of these credentials. When you apply for something, these credentials need to be verified —Identity Interactions — hence the need for a verifier, be that a bank loan, a mortgage, or traveling abroad. These digital credentials can be verified across different companies.</p>



<p>Say you want to apply for an academic program in another country based on your qualifications. Your previous educational institute would be the issuer of the verified credential, once that credential has been issued to you it can be verified by the educational institute where you plan on studying, thus making them a verifier.</p>



<p>In the real world, our primary identifier is our face. The other ones are our national IDs, driving licences, or passports. Now think of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">DID</a> as a digital face. Each verifiable credential is attached to a unique DID, which is distributed, making it self-sovereign in nature. Think of DIDs as a mode of communication or the exchange of peer-to-peer information. It allows associating multiple claims to a single layer, can be accessed from any system, and the identity owner is in complete control to revoke them. The generated DID is always in pair with a public key and a private key. A DID can have many public keys. Everything is fragmented. A DID itself does not hold any information itself and merely resolves the issue of having an identifier linked to the credentials with public keys.</p>



<p>It should be noted that these verifiable credentials are not stored on the distributed ledger system. Think of blockchain as a giant spreadsheet where transactions are taking place, but that spreadsheet is not saved on a single database, in fact, it is an open-source spreadsheet, held within distributed storage, with information registries that correspond to transactions or exchange of public keys using DIDs.</p>



<p>The credentials are stored in a digital wallet that corresponds to a physical wallet. You only use the credentials that are required. What grants a user more power is the control of his/her identity. He does not have to reveal all the information present in his credential, only the information that obviates the need of providing additional information. In the SSI framework it is referred to as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs">zero-knowledge proof</a>: disclose information that is relevant – as mentioned earlier, a car hire company should not be concerned with your date of birth but should know that the permit you hold is valid. Furthermore, it gives you more control as you can revoke the information provided or allow it to be present in a system for a certain limit of time. For instance, an application wants to access your phone’s location. You allow it to do so for that time duration and then you simply revoke the access with the click of a button.</p>



 But are these digital wallets safe? 



<p>Yes, these digital wallets are created using an asymmetric coding technique, which usually helps in creating a pair of keys. One is the public key and the other one is a private key. The public keys, as the name implies are there to view anytime and are used for exchanging information and can be revoked, however, the private key is for the account holder himself, be that an issuer, a verifier, or a subject. It is only through a private key that one can pass on his credentials using his DID to an issuer who then validates the credentials and sends them to the verifier using his DID. In this way, a quick and efficient way of peer-peer information can be established.</p>



<p>It can be established that SSI gives complete control of public identity, safeguards personal data, and is accessible with the click of one button from anywhere in the world. Furthermore, it establishes trust between parties that guarantees the authenticity of the data being provided. It operates within the realm of ethical information sharing ultimately keeping your identity intact.</p>



<p>It will be interesting to see what the future holds for SSI, but given the growing societal need for a secure SSI solution, it seems like it is only a matter of time before one of these solutions is widely adopted.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



  Every offline and online transaction gives away data that holds a monetary value  Digital onboarding helps with credential management, but its downside is that, by using this method, the individual hands over the access to their data to third-party companies  Major data hacks have compromised the personal and financial data of millions of customers  GDPR aims to protect the right of an individual to safeguard their privacy. Yet, the GDPR framework is inherently centralised  SSI enables an individual to retain control of their data, and share only what’s relevant  SSI is based on Verifiable credentials (VCs) and Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) principles  Verifiable credentials imply that an individual’s personal information has been issued by an issuer, a governing body, an authority — say a government, an educational institute, or a bank.  You can think of a DID as a digital face that helps you identify yourself to others  Through the my.D product, <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">Zaisan offers a secure SSI solution</a>

<p>HOPR is a decentralized and incentivized peer-to-peer mixnet open to anyone who wants to join and run a node. The network allows people, companies, and devices to exchange information online with its metadata stripped. People who communicate and transact using HOPR — or apps and services which run on top of the platform — can be sure that no-one can find out what data is being shared, who is sending or receiving it, or even how much data is being sent. HOPR gets its name from the fact that it provides metadata privacy by sending data packets through multiple nodes - or “hops” – in the network. Decentralization ensures that the network is fully independent and there is no entity that can control it or intercept the traffic.</p><p>We were joined by HOPR founder Sebastian Bürgel, who chatted about the need for a platform such as this in the space, how it works by sending packets through nodes, the HOPR token, and The DecenGov DAO.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Sebastian's background  An overview of HOPR  Mixnet vs onion routing  Who is the HOPR user?  How packets move through the network  The distribution requirements for HOPR nodes  The costs involved  The HOPR token  The DecenGov DAO  Why privacy systems in crypto have such a hard time finding traction  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://hoprnet.org/">HOPR</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/hoprnet">HOPR on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/SCBuergel">Sebastian on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://careers.chorus.one/o/epicenter-community-manager">Join the Epicenter team!</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Tally Ho: Tally Ho is a new wallet for Web3 and DeFi that sees the wallet as a public good.

<p>This afternoon I logged into the end of the <a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/IEEE-Metaverse-Congress-Series-3.html">IEEE’s Third Metaverse Congress Webinar</a>. I missed the morning session and keynote by Philip Rosedale, formerly of Second Life and Linden Labs. I was, however, able to watch a lunch-hour session promoting the decentralized, open Metaverse, an effort spearheaded, at least in part, by Cesium based in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>After the first question, I was the only person posting in the chat. Below are comments and questions I posed to the panelists. They can be read in the clip below if you watch and pause intermittently. Lee Stogner, head of the IEEE Blockchain Standards Working Group for Consumer Electronics, stated during the discussion something to the effect that he could see based on the chat that there were some people out there with “another agenda, their own agenda” and therefore it was important that the group come together quickly. My take is that militarized-pharma-debt finance interests intend to manifest their planned “open metaverse” mind game before people know what actually happened. There is no informed consent. This isn’t being done behind closed doors; it was a free event for which anyone could register. They want it that way, because the structure implies consent. I made it clear to them that they don’t have mine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My comments in the chat:</p>
<p>I was wondering if people are aware of the plans in ESG global finance to leverage “human capital” as a backing for “complementary currencies?” The “quality” of the human capital portfolio will relate to the blockchain twin avatar of the person and of the community. Optimization around mobility in poverty tied to tokenized behaviors in Internet of Bodies surveillance is not far off. Look at Learning Economy’s new proposal for Learn Card digital wallets working with World Bank and Brookings.</p>
<p>Also, what are your positions on the Japan Science and Technology Agency’s Moonshot Goal 1 – Society 5.0, Cyborg Avatar Capitalism? The US Department of Energy and the NSF and many tech companies are part of this effort to push us into “avatar” life. I don’t think people recognize that as a new empire built on military tech and steeped in behavioral psychology. Immersive reality is an open air prison / Skinner Box. If the story is good enough, they think we won’t resist it.</p>
<p>Augmented reality in my city, Philadelphia where Cesium is based, is advancing with support from Niantic. Niantic, of course, is a program of In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA. Do we want to live in the CIA’s video game of “good behavior” aligned to the UN SDGs – under satellite / drone surveillance with nano-tech?</p>
<p>In a tokenized world the data can be “private,” but with Ricardian contracts machine rules will govern how we interact with the built environment and other people. Think Black Mirror’s “Nosedive” episode – Intel and MIT’s Secret Network.</p>
<p>Look into the Impact Management Project – they are developing new forms of debt finance products tied to behavioral data in education, health, justice, food, housing, etc. Once those smart impact bonds are securitized vulnerable people will be pushed into a mixed reality “game.” Global hedge funds can literally bet on life outcomes – toddlers, people in addiction, those who are housing and food insecure. These funds can bet AGAINST people.</p>
<p>After they brought up NFTs…</p>
<p>Really, we should be talking about Soulbound Tokens. SBTs will be meta-data tags on digital identity linked to social impact programs. This is needed to deploy contracts with the Secret Network to assess real time impact data. Do we really want to be linking things to our souls?</p>
<p>Then they brought up “safety” and good governance.</p>
<p>What is coming is futarchy, liquid democracy, augmented democracy where you have a digital twin vote for you via radical participation using blockchain tokens.</p>
<p>Are you all thinking about what it will be like to live in the smart contract layer?</p>
<p>Living in mixed reality will require us to have a digital ID that is connected to satellites – the panopticon.</p>
<p>We will literally be the content of our digital wallet. Even NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) says they are concerned about what it will mean to have your digital twin impact the real world person.</p>
<p>Lee, your comment indicates that your intention is that people not know what is coming. There is no informed consent for any of this.</p>
<p>Digital twins will not be any kumbaya moment.</p>
<p>The most vulnerable people are being targeted as data commodities for human capital portfolios.</p>
<p>This was IEEE’s third webinar on the topic of the Metaverse roll out. The <a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/IEEE-Metaverse-Congress-Series.html">first session was July 2, 2022</a> and can be viewed below. The following week IEEE hosted <a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/IEEE-Metaverse-Congress-Series-2.html">a webinar for Chinese audiences</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Participants in the panel included <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ramesh-ramadoss">Ramesh Ramadoss</a>, moderator with an expertise in micro-electronics and IoT; Kavya Pearlman, an extended reality “safety” advocate working with the World Economic Forum; Denisa Ganea, a young Romanian artist working as a Web 3 partnership manager for an NFT company; James Thomas who appears to have been a fill-in for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marccrandall/">Mark Crandall</a> head of privacy for Google Cloud formerly with the FBI and Department of Justice; and <a href="https://entrepreneurship.ieee.org/speaker/lee-stogner/">Lee Stogner</a> an affiliate of IEEE since the mid-1970s who runs a consulting firm supporting high-tech manufacturing in the Carolinas and beyond.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramesh-ramadoss-phd-5130b54b/details/experience/">Ramesh Ramadoss,</a> originally from India, trained in electrical engineering at University of Colorado Boulder and later <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=Yoo-L-sAAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;pagesize=80&amp;citation_for_view=Yoo-L-sAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC">taught</a> at the <a href="https://www.eng.auburn.edu/amstc/">Auburn Micro/Nano Science and Technology Center</a>. His Crunchbase profile states he carried out projects for NASA, DARPA, the US Army and Air Force and the Department of Energy’s Sandia National Labs as well as for Motorola. Ramadoss’s <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yoo-L-sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar page</a> indicates an expertise in MEMS microelectromechanical systems refined while working at Applied Nanostructures in Mountainview, CA. Ramadoss co-chairs the IEEE blockchain Initiative and leads the Blockchain Standards Working Group.

<p>During the discussion, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavya-pearlman/">Kavya Pearlman</a> asserted the need for a “safe” decentralized Metaverse. Trained as a network cyber analyst, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavya-pearlman/details/experience/">Pearlman</a> imagines a future where all of us, including children, navigate a “safe” and diverse Metaverse where everyone feels “included.” She was credentialed this spring by the World Economic Forum as a global member of their global digital safety coalition. Kavya launched a Singularity Watch timeline and is active in the extended reality space for the health-tech sector.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/denisa-bau-bau/details/experience/">Denisa</a> did her undergraduate in Bucharest then attended business school in Manchester, home of the National Graphene Institute. She worked in a variety of sales positions where she gained experience in psychometrics and behavioral psychology, leveraging that experience and an interest in emerging tech to gain access to a blockchain accelerator program. In her Twitter profile she describes herself as a traumatized nerd environmentalist with an inverted portrait against a banner image featuring the word “pointless” in that coded magenta / blue that is part of the universal Metaverse imprinting. Her role in the panel was to discuss NFTs (but not Soulbound Tokens). She is currently employed by <a href="https://niftyz.io/#/">Niftyz.io</a>, a platform that turns real things into “digital property.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leestogner/details/experience/">Lee Stogner</a>, the gentlemen who responded to my queries in the chat by exhorting his fellow open Metaverse blockchainers to hurry up, is based in Greenville, SC and styles himself as a digital transformation expert with a focus on internet of things. Trained as an electrical engineer, Stogner worked in manufacturing efficiencies early in his career with stints at Fluor and Rockwell Automation. He did business development for Milliken, a pioneering South Carolina textile concern that expanded through research into synthetics for the military in WWII and is now advancing specialty chemicals and health-tech, in their Performance Solutions Division. In recent years Stogner became vice president of Chinese augmented reality firm Dreamerse and a partner in global alternative asset firm Liquidax. He launched Vincula Group consulting in 2008 shortly after becoming the chair of the Carolina Engineering cluster.</p>
<p>Vincula is the plural form of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vinculum">vinculum,</a> Latin for “bond,” vincire “to bind, fetter, chain.” Today the term can be used to refer to a ligament in the fingers or a mathematical expression – a bracket over a group numbers to which the same function is applied – think Soulbound Token drops and Ricardian contracts in Web 3 immersive reality. In popular culture vinculum is an operating system for Borg ships in Star Trek Voyager. It is the vinculum that assimilates individuals into a socially cohesive entity through transneural transmissions.</p>
<p>From the outlook of the Borg, I can see why my assertions of individual agency and refusal of the Metaverse may have been triggering for Mr. Stogner.</p>

<p></p>
<p>And it if wasn’t unsettling enough to face off against the DARPA MEMS-Borg duo, I ended the day being pulled into a Clubhouse “chat,” briefly. It’s not something I generally do, but there was a global finance <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Daniel-Matalon-Impact-Finance.pdf">impact investor</a> trolling the group and someone requested my presence. In short order I got worked into a fit of rage after this off-shore sustainable finance schemer claimed to not see any problem in putting toddlers on surveillance play tables to score their behaviors for pay for success deals. This is not normal people; toddler-backed complementary currencies are an abomination.</p>
<p>You can try and call it “beautiful” money, but we know these are the tentacles of the Borg.</p>
<p>Cling to your dandelions and feathers and cattail fluff. Hold on to the real and imagine beyond the material. Creativity and intuition will not be geofenced.</p>

<p>This is the twenty-first post in an <a>ongoing, regular series</a> describing new and upcoming privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by (in alphabetical order): Filter List Enginer Ryan Brown, Principal Engineer Brian Johnson, Android Engineering Manager Deep Pandya, Senior Product Designer Agustín Ruiz, and iOS Privacy Engineer Jacob Sikorski. This post was written by Senior Director of Privacy Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>





    


    
    







    


    
    
</p>
<p>Starting with the current Brave Nightly, and in version 1.45 when it releases in October, the Brave browser will block cookie consent notifications on Android and Desktop (and, soon after, on iOS). Cookie consent notifications are an infamous and near-constant annoyance on the Web. They break and disrupt one of the main benefits of the Web: the ability to browse content across many sites and publishers conveniently and easily. And, what is ironic, <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/papers/Matt-etal-20-SP.pdf">many cookie consent systems actually track users</a>, introducing the exact harm the consent systems were supposed to prevent.</p>
<p>New versions of Brave will hide—and, where possible, completely block—cookie consent notifications. Brave’s approach is distinct and more privacy-preserving than similar systems used in other browsers (such as the “auto-consent” systems used in other browsers), and helps keep the Web user-first.</p>

 Enabling and managing cookie banner blocking in Brave 





    


    


    
    

<p>On start up, the Brave browser will ask if you’d like to block cookie banners. If you choose to enable this feature, Brave will download <a href="https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/fanboy-cookiemonster.txt">a set of rules</a> designed to block and hide cookie consent notifications. The browser will start applying the rules as quickly as possible, within a minute or less of enabling the feature on most devices.</p>





    


    


    
    

<p>If you accidentally choose not to enable cookie banner blocking (or you enabled it but then changed your mind), you can update the setting at any time. Just visit brave://settings/shields/filters in the Brave browser and enable / disable the EasyList-Cookie List option.</p>
<p>Note: If you’re not prompted to block cookie dialogs, you may need to restart your browser and update to Brave version 1.45.</p>

 Comparison to other systems 
<p>There are several ways browsers and extensions try to block cookie banners. Brave’s method maximizes the privacy benefit to users, while still blocking as many banners and annoyances as possible.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are two general ways to block cookie banners.</p>
<p>One approach (which Brave uses) is to block cookie banners, and to hide and to modify pages to remove any additional annoyance such systems include (such as overlays, preventing scrolling, etc.). Other Web-privacy tools (such as uBlock Origin) can be configured to use this same approach. This approach provides the strongest privacy guarantees: it doesn’t require trusting that the cookie consent systems will respect your choice, and prevents your browser from needing to communicate with consent-tracking systems at all.</p>
<p>The other approach is to trust and work with cookie banners. Instead of blocking these systems (as Brave does), this alternate approach automates the process of clicking “no” in cookie-banner systems. While this approach may reduce the number of cookies sent and the overall nuisance of banners, it still records your preference with the cookie banner providers. This creates a situation of requiring the browser or extension to repeatedly ask the cookie banner provider to leave you alone. Worse, researchers have found that <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/papers/Matt-etal-20-SP.pdf">many cookie-and-consent systems still track people</a>, even when users reject all cookies.</p>

 Google proposals will make it harder to block cookie banners 
<p>Brave’s approach to blocking cookie banners requires Brave to stay one step ahead of trackers and the companies that run the (nightmarishly titled) “consent-management systems.<a>1</a>” Brave keeps ahead of trackers in several ways, including <a>supporting crowd-sourced filter lists such as EasyList</a>, and conducting research to <a>help privacy activists stay one step ahead of trackers</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Google has been pushing changes to the Web that would make it more difficult to block cookie banners and, more generally, to filter out unwanted Web content (such as intrusive images, videos, ads, and tracking scripts). Google’s <a>WebBundles</a> proposal, for example, will make it easier for sites to evade content blockers. Their <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security">Manifest v3</a> changes remove vital capabilities from privacy-protecting browser extensions. And many aspects of Google’s sprawling <a>Privacy Sandbox</a> proposal would generally give users less control–and sites more control–over how people use and experience the Web.</p>
<p>Ironically, cookie banners (a universally-despised Web annoyance) shows both i) the Web’s uniquely democratic, user-first platform, and ii) what will be lost if the Web continues in the direction Google is pushing it.</p>
<p>The Web is built to be open. On the one hand, that’s great: It means privacy-protecting Web tools like Brave can act on behalf of users, and protect them from Web abuses and annoyances. On the other hand, cookie banners highlight how much worse the Web will get if Google (and others) succeed in weakening users’ ability to block such annoyances.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Sometimes called “preference management systems”.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>Brave’s latest desktop release (version 1.44) is packed full of exciting updates in the integrated Brave Wallet for NFT collectors, crypto traders, and anyone who uses Brave Wallet. We’ve added a new fiat-crypto on-ramp for US users, enabled support for Solana token swaps, and added two new features in the wallet itself: an NFT gallery and a market tab with real-time price feeds. Initially rolling out on desktop, all four new features are planned for mobile in the near future as well.</p>

 Built-in NFT gallery 
<p>Brave’s exciting new NFT gallery feature is making its debut on Brave Wallet for desktop—giving you a simple and unified experience to view and manage NFT collections. Initially the gallery will support NFTs on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. Keep an eye out for future updates when we bring the NFT gallery to mobile—and add support for more blockchains, so all you multi-chain NFT collectors can enjoy a one-stop view of your collections across ecosystems.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 Solana swaps 
<p>Solana users rejoice! You can now seamlessly swap between SOL and your other favorite SPL tokens right from Brave Wallet on desktop. Using Jupiter, we aggregate trading liquidity from all of the major exchanges across Solana—offering a single endpoint for you to get the most depth, best fees, and up to date pricing in one convenient place. This update builds upon existing swap functionality for Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, BNB Chain, and many other EVM-compatible chains.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 Sardine ACH 
<p>Brave Wallet on desktop now offers US-based users a new fiat-crypto on-ramp to make crypto purchases via ACH. Sardine joins our existing partners, Ramp and Wyre, to offer more flexible ways for Brave Wallet users to get crypto into their self-custodied wallets. Sardine ACH lets you purchase 40+ crypto assets directly from your bank account in just a short few steps, starting right in your wallet.</p>

 Market tab 
<p>Brave version 1.44 on desktop also includes a brand-new feature in the expanded Brave Wallet page—called “market”—which pulls market data from Coingecko for accurate, up-to-date price feeds for all your favorite crypto assets. The feature is designed to offer more value to Brave Wallet users, so you can be better informed on trends and activity in the crypto market. The market tab and the other new features in this release bring us closer to our vision of a one-stop shop—built right into the browser—to securely manage crypto assets and NFTs across all of the most active blockchains.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 
<p><a>Download Brave</a> today to try all of these new <a>Brave Wallet</a> features: show off your NFTs, swap on Solana, and more!</p>

 Your Decentralized ID Deserves&nbsp;Privacy Restoring data ownership to&nbsp;users<p>An innovative new technology, called decentralized ID (DID), stores sensitive information like your credit score or GPA on the blockchain, allowing you to own your personal data. But blockchain is known for transparency — so how can we ensure your personal data remains confidential?</p><p>Findora proposes a solution through <a href="https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/FIPs/blob/main/FIPs/fip-3.md">FIP-3</a>, allowing you to reveal your data on your&nbsp;terms.</p> The Power of Decentralized Identity Management <p>Traditional online platforms collect users’ personal data. When you hand over personal data to your favorite website, how can you be sure your personal information won’t be exploited and remains confidential?</p><p>Decentralized ID (DID) leverages encryption and decentralization to provide individuals with ownership of their personal data. Through DID, information such as date of birth, GPA, and credit score is owned and managed by the individual — Access to their personal information is controlled by the user, not the dApps it is shared with or the companies that store&nbsp;it.</p> Findora’s DID&nbsp;Proposal <p>Blockchain identity management is coming to the Findora ecosystem through <a href="https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/FIPs/blob/main/FIPs/fip-3.md">Findora Improvement Proposal 3&nbsp;(FIP-3)</a>.</p><p>FIP-3 is one of the first practical applications of zero-knowledge proofs to DID, allowing users to control who sees their data and how much gets revealed. It allows users to encrypt their data with their personal keys and issue proofs of that data to dApps and other third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Essentially, FIP-3 allows users to control what private data that Web3 applications can access by encrypting it inside a zero-knowledge proof. When a third party, like a dApp, requests private data, the user can create and share custom proofs of that data to share and, as a result, share as little or as much as they want. In layman’s terms, it is the difference between providing your date of birth and providing proof that you are over a certain age. This is done using zero-knowledge technology on&nbsp;Findora.</p> FIP-3 Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Findora’s DID system brings a wide range of practical use cases. Below are some examples of what this zero-knowledge technology brings to Web3&nbsp;users:</p> Credit Score Verification <p>Suppose <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a> is offering better loan rates depending on a user’s credit score. TransUnion has issued this user a score of 750, encrypted the information in a credential, which is then stored on <a href="https://ipfs.tech/#how">IPFS</a>, a decentralized blockchain for storing and managing&nbsp;files.</p><p>Using Findora’s DID solution, the user can qualify for the better rate without disclosing the actual score, all done using zero-knowledge technology. Instead of giving Aave complete access to their TransUnion credential, they can simply issue a proof to Aave that contains as much or as little data as they&nbsp;choose.</p> Age Verification <p>A Web3 gaming platform requires that users be above 21 in order to access their platform. Instead of revealing their actual date of birth, the user can issue a proof showing their age is above 21, giving the platform the needed information but in a zero-knowledge fashion.</p> GPA Verification <p>Universities can issue credentials containing a graduate’s GPA, certificate of graduation, and other data. Users could prove their qualifications to jobs and recruiters when they request it because the credential from the university has the university’s signature.</p> A Step Towards a Decentralized Data-Ownership <p>FIP-3 brings data ownership into the hands of individuals by relying on decentralized chains like Findora and IPFS for privacy and data storage. No internal team or external agency can arbitrarily delete, query, expose, or control your encrypted personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Similar zero-knowledge systems can be used to certify votes, verify supply chains, and reduce the burden of data storage on companies. Storing proof of data is easier and safer than storing the actual data — exploited platforms that received your proof would have no actual data to expose. FIP-3 is the first step toward restoring user control over their personal data and fulfilling the original Web3 promise of data ownership.</p><p>Share your thoughts and feedback with the Findora community on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/findora">Discord</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Findora_Official/">Reddit</a>.</p> About Findora <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">Findora</a> builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography.

These bridge a number of categories: parachain scalability, parachain development, relay-chain governance, cross-chain communication, common-good parachains, bridging to other ecosystems, and staking. We’ve been hard at work on delivering the code for these features and upgrades and look forward to having them accepted by the Polkadot community.</p> <br>Asynchronous Backing <p>Asynchronous Backing is the first set of major optimizations to Polkadot’s parachain consensus protocol since its launch on Polkadot in December 2021. Scalability is a huge topic in the blockchain ecosystem, and the goal of Parity and the Web3 Foundation as protocol designers is to meet the demand of parachains by providing each parachain with a large increase in block capacity. If Asynchronous Backing is enabled by the network, the block time of 12 seconds for parachains will be shortened to 6 seconds, which will mean lower latency and faster finality for transactions executed on parachains. Furthermore, the parachain blocks themselves will be allocated more time for execution, meaning that they get even more throughput.</p><p>Asynchronous Backing is a large upgrade spanning the runtime, the networking protocol, and the logic of collators which is designed to do 3 things: decrease the parachain block time to 6 seconds, increase the amount of block space available to each block by a factor of 5-10, and allow parachain blocks to be ‘reused’ when they don’t make it onto the relay chain in the first attempt. This is a major scalability improvement which will both increase the amount of work every parachain can do and will optimize network performance to allow for more parachains to be registered. We estimate that this update will bring the TPS capacity of the network in aggregate to between 100,000 and 1,000,000, without affecting the security guarantees made by the network.</p><p>We estimate that Asynchronous Backing will be ready for deployment on Kusama by EOY 2022 and then on Polkadot, pending the results of audits and testing.</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/3779">GitHub Issue 3779: Asynchronous Backing Spec &amp; Tracking</a><br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5022">GitHub PR 5022: Asynchronous Backing MegaPR</a></p> Parathreads / Next-Generation Scheduling <p>One of the main goals we’ve set is to make it as easy as possible to build in the Polkadot ecosystem. While smart contract parachains have made it possible to easily build for the network and leverage its interoperability, we’re aiming to improve this developer experience at all levels of the stack. The early parachain auctions on Polkadot were significant events which gathered enormous amounts of community support. Each auction winner earned the right to launch a chain with guaranteed regular execution for the next 2 years. Over time, it’s become much cheaper to acquire a parachain slot as the supply has expanded, but the mechanics of building a community of supporters, waiting for the next auction, opening a crowdloan, and competing against other projects to win a slot still represent a significant barrier to entry for projects looking to join the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Parathreads are the solution to this issue. <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/parathreads-parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains/">Parathreads</a> are pay-as-you-go parachains. Parathreads give you the power of starting a blockchain with the ease of launching a smart contract. They can be launched and operated without waiting for the next auction or doing anything more than uploading their code to the relay chain and spinning up a few funded collator nodes. Parathreads are built for fast-iterating teams of committed professionals as well as tinkerers and hackathon participants, and are designed to be well-suited to the rapidly evolving blockchain developer ecosystem.</p><p>They represent a simple, easy, and accessible entry point for launching an L1 chain on top of Polkadot and Kusama. Parathread blocks are just as secure as parachain blocks. The parathread architecture is something that’s only possible on Polkadot and not on a solo-chain, because of Polkadot’s unique market mechanisms for allocating block space, data availability, and execution.</p><p>Parathreads also allow for a seamless upgrade path to become a full parachain with guaranteed capacity. While in operation, it’ll be possible for a parathread to participate in parachain auctions and upgrade to a full parachain.</p><p>We estimate that parathreads will be ready for launch in Q1/Q2 2023.</p><p>We are undertaking ongoing R&amp;D work to explore something we currently term Next-Generation Scheduling. Next-Generation Scheduling is something related to parathreads: the ability for parachains which have won slot auctions to ‘boost’ the amount of block space and execution time they have access to. This is a category of protocol changes intended to make Polkadot into the most efficient blockspace market by allowing both parachains and parathreads to adapt the amount of consensus resources they make use of based on their requirements. Parachains and parathreads should be able to save on consensus and security costs by avoiding paying for more than they need. Furthermore, this would ensure those resources are available for other chains to purchase, increasing the efficiency of the network in aggregate.</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5492">GitHub Issue 5492: Parathreads: Take II</a></p> XCMv3 <p>As Polkadot’s core thesis of blockchain interoperability has become a reality over the past 2 years, we understand the impact and importance of <a href="https://polkadot.network/cross-chain-communication/">cross-chain communication</a> in the multichain future better than ever.</p><p>Polkadot’s XCM, short for Cross-Consensus Messaging, is having its third major release.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm">XCM</a> is a universal language for cross-chain communication that can be used inside or outside the Polkadot ecosystem. Combined with the transport protocol XCMP-Lite (aka HRMP) or other future transport protocols, it can be used to communicate securely and trustlessly between parachains.</p><p>XCM is already being used within the Polkadot ecosystem. With the release of XCMv3, parachains, as well as the contracts and applications deployed to them, would benefit from additional functionality. This includes support for bridging, e.g. to external networks, improved fee payments for operations, NFTs, and APIs for querying and invoking pallets on other chains.</p><p>XCMv3 depends on Weights V2, and we aim for it to be ready to deploy by EOY 2022</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/4097">GitHub PR 4097: XCM v3</a></p> FRAME: Weights V2 <p>Since the early days of Ethereum, there have been conversations about altering the notion of ‘gas’ payments to become multi-dimensional in order to accurately reflect the usage of different kinds of resources in order to set and adjust fees more accurately. Polkadot is now implementing these ideas with Weights V2.</p><p>Weights are the mechanism by which Substrate transactions and actions are measured against block capacity. The work on Weights V2 introduces a notion of multi-dimensional weights, which measure not only execution time but also the amount of state accessed by a particular operation. This is of particular interest to Polkadot, where the amount of data necessary to validate a particular parachain block is a key determining factor and must be limited to sizes accepted by the relay chain’s on-chain configuration. Essentially, Weights V2 makes Substrate runtimes more amenable to stateless client approaches and therefore marks a key step in making it easy to write parachains (and other kinds of rollups) using Substrate. This is also a precursor to XCMv3.</p><p>Weights V2 will be ready to use by mid-October 2022</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/12176">GitHub Issue 12176: The rest of the way to Weights v2</a></p> Governance Overhaul <p>Polkadot’s governance system is getting ready to evolve. We’ve been keeping an eye on the developments of the blockchain space and predict that the future will allow for projects which are either fully decentralized or which are not decentralized. Partial decentralization is a category which is fading quickly. To that end, <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/gov2-polkadots-next-generation-of-decentralised-governance/">Governance V2</a> has been designed as the next step in making the on-chain, binding decision-making processes of Polkadot as decentralized as possible.</p><p>Our novel governance system removes the council and technical committees, introduces the Polkadot Fellowship, and moves every decision in Polkadot to referendums by the community. Its agile delegation system allows for community leaders to gather delegations either for all decisions or for some specific area or areas of focus. The acts of voting in a referendum, submitting a referendum, or becoming a delegate are all totally permissionless. Governance V2 exemplifies the ability of Polkadot’s on-chain governance mechanisms to upgrade themselves, in what we refer to as the ‘meta-protocol’. To read more about the design considerations and mechanisms involved in this overhaul, refer to the long-form blog post by Gavin Wood, linked below.</p><p>The novel governance system is scheduled to be deployed on Kusama at the beginning of Q4 2022 (most likely with runtime upgrade v.0.9.30). The proposal to deploy the new model will be proposed to the community and needs to be voted on and approved in the referenda queue by token holders.</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://youtu.be/EF93ZM_P_Oc">YouTube: Gavin Wood on Governance v2 at Polkadot Decoded 2022</a></p> Collectives Parachain <p>The Common Good Parachains team has been working on final testing for a new parachain, Polkadot Collectives. This parachain will be home to numerous collectives that form in the service of the Polkadot network, including the aforementioned Technical Fellowship after its incubation phase on the Kusama Relay Chain.</p><p>The first collective expected to launch is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXlVDDQj6v8kOTvbMXBmenBZ3Sfn5zZf0ipQbYvdipo/edit#">Polkadot Alliance</a>, a community initiative to create an on-chain body to defend fair use of the Polkadot brand and open source code.</p><p>Estimated launch is in late October.</p> Bridge Hub <p>Parity’s bridges team has been working on a Polkadot&lt;&gt;Kusama bridge for some time, and is preparing to start the launch process. Several other teams in the ecosystem also have bridge protocols, like Snowfork and Centrifuge. The Common Good Parachains team will work on launching parachains on both Kusama and Polkadot to serve as bridge hubs to each network.</p><p>The bridge hub will be a message routing service within each network. That is, it will not store much state about the bridged chains (e.g. wrapped assets), but rather forward messages to other parachains like Statemint to handle.</p><p>The launch plan is being worked on, with a planned launch by end of year.</p> Nomination Pools &amp; Fast Unstake <p>Polkadot is happy to lead the march toward a future full of proof-of-stake blockchains. We’ve been ahead of the curve and have already shifted our mindset from "getting to PoS" to "super scaling the PoS system”. Nomination pools will expand the reach of who can participate in Polkadot’s staking system to anyone and the staking dashboard (see below) will make it easy for everyone to learn how to do that.</p><p>Nomination pools are a major upgrade to Polkadot’s staking system. Nomination pools allow users to permissionlessly create “pools” of stake which others can join, and which will all be used together to nominate the same validators. The votes issued by the pool will automatically be balanced across the validators which were nominated for maximum effect. This enables more nominators, especially smaller ones, to join the staking system.</p><p>Pools have been <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5447">live on Kusama</a> since June, and they have indeed fulfilled the purpose of being the real-value experimental playground of Polkadot, with more than 64 pools being created.</p><p>Nomination pools <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5582">will be added</a> to Polkadot as of the 0.9.28 release, but with the default parameters, no pools can be created yet. Once this runtime is enacted, a governance proposal can set the initial configurations, such as how many pools can be created, how many members can join, etc. The pools are designed to be infinitely scalable, meaning that there is no technical limit on the number of pools and members that can participate therein. Soon afterwards, we are aiming to add a <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12129">fast-unstake feature</a> to the staking system, to facilitate the migration of nominators who are not earning rewards to nomination pools.</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/10694">GitHub PR 10694: Nomination Pools</a><br><a href="https://youtu.be/_wjAYivFQBU">YouTube: Nomination Pools &amp; Polkadot NPoS at Polkadot Decoded 2022</a><br><a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-august-september-2022/">Staking Updates: August-September 2022</a></p> Staking Dashboard <p>Alongside the work on extending the capabilities of the staking protocol itself, we also recognize the need to make staking maximally accessible to end users and regular people.</p><p>To that end, Parity Technologies has developed a <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/">Staking Dashboard</a>, which is currently in an open beta. This dashboard allows users to explore and nominate validators, and view metrics about their staking returns.</p><p>The Staking Dashboard also makes use of Polkadot’s <a href="https://substrate.io/developers/substrate-connect/">best-in-class light-client technology</a>, which allows users to interact with the blockchain without ever having to ‘phone home’ to a centralized service provider like Infura, which could either go down, restrict access, or collect data on users.</p><p>Parity’s approach to blockchain UI development is to allow the user to choose from a gradient of different options, so they can opt-in to using centralized services to augment the application with more features and data, while maintaining confidence that the application will continue working even if those centralized services stop working for them.</p><p>This is the first of many such products we are working on developing.</p><p>The Staking Dashboard will exit its open beta shortly, but is feature-complete and can be used already.</p> Disputes Slashing <p>The Polkadot parachains protocol went live in December 2021. Parity’s approach to software development is to ship early and often, and the initial version of the parachains protocol does not enable the slashing logic. This has given the validator community the chance to upgrade alongside the network and to make sure to configure their nodes in such a way that they won’t be slashed mistakenly once the slashing code goes live. Once disputes slashing is enabled, validators which submit invalid parachain blocks will be slashed for their entire stake, and validators which create faulty disputes will be slashed for a small amount to discourage spam. This greatly increases the economic security of the network as a whole.</p><p>We estimate that disputes slashing will be ready to go live by EOY 2022</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-v1-0-sharding-and-economic-security/">Polkadot v1.0: Sharding and Economic Security</a><br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5535">GitHub PR 5535: runtime/disputes: slashing</a></p> <p>Interested in building on Polkadot? <a href="https://info.polkadot.network/contact">Get in touch here</a>.</p>

 Index <p>See the full list of monthly staking updates <a href="https://polkadot.network/tag/staking-updates/">here</a>. These updates have been written by <a href="mailto:kian@parity.io">Kian Paimani</a> and <a href="mailto:ross@parity.io">Ross Bulat</a> from <a href="http://parity.io">Parity Technologies</a>.</p><p>Check out the new staking landing page at <a href="https://polkadot.network/staking">polkadot.network/staking</a>!</p> Democracy Proposals <p>A number of noteworthy governance proposals and runtime upgrades have been proposed and/or executed in the last two months in the world of staking.</p><p>First, the <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/261">motion to upgrade Polkadot to 9.28</a> is enacted and executed. This means that nomination pools code is live on Polkadot! However, no pools can be created yet and this will be up to the governance of the chain to decide.</p><p>This means that the nomination pools will be usable very soon on Polkadot! Those stakers who wish to join pools should consider starting the 28 day unbonding process.</p><p>That being said, we are preparing a new system to facilitate the migration of nominators to pools as well. Read more in the “Fast Unstake” section further down.</p><p>Next, <a href="https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/534">a proposal was made to Kusama</a> to increase the limits of the nomination pools deployment. Note that these limits were only set there in response to a number of bugs that were found earlier. Now, these limits can be removed as the aforementioned bug has been fixed in the 9.27 release.</p><p>Secondly, <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1224">a suggestion has been made to Polkadot governance</a> to slightly increase the limits of the nomination intention, namely to increase the minimum number of DOT needed from 10 to 50 DOT. The reason for this is twofold:</p>  Polkadot already has a lot of “inactive” nominators. <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-february-2022/#staking-terminology">Recall from our February update</a> that active nominators are those who end up backing a validator, both earning rewards and being exposed to slashes. Inactive nominators are exactly the opposite of that: those who have had enough DOT to set their intention, but don’t have enough DOT to actually become active. A slightly higher DOT limit for nomination intention will hopefully prevent too many inactive nominators from being created.  More importantly, now, with the enablement of nomination pools just around the corner, these inactive nominators can now join pools and actually participate in staking in a fruitful way. Therefore, it is sensible for Polkadot to adjust its staking parameters such that there is less incentive for inactive nominators to exist.   Fast Unstake <p>Speaking of inactive nominators wanting to migrate to pools, there is finally a PR that addresses a <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/8436">long anticipated feature</a> in Polkadot’s staking system: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12129">Fast Unstake</a>.</p><p>Don’t let this fool you: Polkadot’s staking system is still strict (and therefore secure) regarding slashing: Any staker who wishes to unstake needs to wait for the full bonding duration, because a historical slash might be detected. The point of the fast-unstake feature is to allow “those stakers who are known to NOT have actively backed any validator (i.e. have not been exposed) in the previous bonding duration” unbond in a quick way.</p><p>A typical example of this would be someone that bonds, but immediately changes their mind. Such a staker would ideally no longer have to wait a full 28 days. More importantly, all of the aforementioned inactive nominators also fall into the same category: they are almost certainly not actively backing any validators, and are therefore free to unstake quickly.</p><p>The fast unstake process is therefore as follows: Any stakers who are certain that they are not exposed in the full bonding duration can register themselves for the fast-unstake process. The checking process is beyond what can fit in a single block and is scheduled to happen over multiple future blocks (No ordering guarantees such as FIFO are provided by the pallet in case of congestion, and all unstake requests are processed in random order). If the check is successful, the staker is unbonded, and if configured to do so, they are automatically added to a nomination pool. If the staker is proven to actually have been exposed, they lose part of their bond as slash.</p><p>The fast unstake PR is still ongoing and we hope to see it go live on Polkadot soon, at which point it will be supported in the staking dashboard and can provide a swift 1-click migration path for inactive nominators to join nomination pools.</p> Nomination pools resources <p>Here is a short recap on everything you need to know about nomination pools:</p>  <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">Polkadot Wiki page about nomination pools</a>  <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-march-2022/">March Staking Update</a>: Contains extensive details about pools  <a href="https://youtu.be/ubs8ZDFCzLc?t=743">April Twitter space recording</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_wjAYivFQBU">Nomination Pools and The Story of The Polkadot's NPoS</a> at Polkadot Decoded  A lot of <a href="https://support.polkadot.network/support/search/solutions?term=Pools">support articles</a> around nomination pools  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T9WXuMmXIJ4UKdnl7sf8btE4MPfk0gGn-1C9FmgipmQ/edit?usp=sharing">Implementers' guide</a>  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!pXhsIqCSnUniflVQbq:matrix.parity.io?via=matrix.parity.io&amp;via=matrix.org">Nomination Pools Discussion room</a> in Matrix   Notable contributors <p>The staking system of Polkadot, albeit being a critical system, has proudly been open to external contributors and has seen a lot of pull requests from the Polkadot community, many of which have been successfully reviewed and merged.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11831">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11831</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Szegoo">https://github.com/Szegoo</a>  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12185">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12185</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12058">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12058</a> by <a href="https://github.com/NingLin-P">NingLin-P · GitHub</a>  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12069">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12069</a> by <a href="https://github.com/hzy1919">hzy1919 (ZhiYong) · GitHub</a>  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33">Substrate (Nominated) Proof of Stake project board</a> to follow the development in more detail!</p> Staking dashboard updates <p>Additional functionality, advancements in existing modules and polished UX are the themes of this September update for the staking dashboard.</p><p>We’ll explore some of the notable updates including full nomination pool support, new nomination generation methods, and some nice UX updates to some key app components.</p> Nomination pools now fully supported The Pools page interface for a pool owner on Westend<p>Nomination pools are now fully supported in the staking dashboard, and users can now play with the feature on Westend and Kusama.</p><p>When pools are enabled on Polkadot, the staking dashboard will be ready and allow users to create and join pools, along with all the management options of running/participating in a pool.</p><p>All nomination pool logic is natively hosted on-chain. Polkadot does not rely on a third party network, bridging, or layer-2 mechanisms like rollups to get pools working. Pools are a part of the Polkadot runtime, making them upgradable, secure and fully embedded as part of the Relay Chain.</p><p>So what else is there beyond joining or creating a pool? Let’s break down exactly what you can do in a pool.</p> What you can do in a Pool <p><br>Anyone can claim rewards<br>Pool rewards are generated per era. In fact, each pool has a stash address that is assigned as a nominator in exactly the same way as nominators do in solo staking. Pools are nominators.</p><p>So once a pool receives payouts, they are immediately claimable by all pool members. When claiming rewards you can either:</p>  Withdraw them to your account’s free balance.  Re-bond the rewards back into the pool.  <p>Anyone can bond and unbond<br>Bond more funds to the pool, or unbond down to the minimum required deposit. This amount differs between pool members and pool owners.</p><p>Unbonding from a pool is still subject to the unbond period, so once your unbond chunk is unlocked, you’ll be able to withdraw that chunk. This is exactly how solo staking works.</p><p>Pool owner can rename the pool<br>Renaming a pool actually sets the pool’s metadata attribute on-chain. This value is used as the pool’s display name. It supports any utf8 character including emojis, so pool owners can be creative in naming their pool.</p><p>Pool owner and nominator can nominate<br>When we say pool owner we are referring to the account who created the pool. The pool owner inherits the root and depositor roles of a pool, and these cannot be changed.</p><p>By default, the owner will also have the nominate role too, unless configured to another account on pool creation.</p><p>So the pool owner and whoever has the nominate role is able to, as the name suggests, manage the pool’s nominations. The tools staking dashboard offers for nominating have been updated this month — we’ll explore these nominating options further down.</p><p>Pool owner and state toggler can manage pool state<br>The state toggler is able to change the pool state to locked or destroying.</p><p>New members are not able to join while a pool is locked. The pool owner can also permissionlessly unbond and withdraw other pool members in this locked state.</p><p>The destroying state of a pool is the state a pool is changed to when it is being closed down. While a pool is in destroying state, members can be permissionlessly unbonded and withdrawn from the pool (minus the pool owner).</p><p>Once all members have left the pool and the pool is no longer nominating, the pool owner can then unbond and withdraw their funds from the pool — at which point the pool will be deleted from chain state.</p><p>The entire process of destroying a pool is now supported in the staking dashboard.</p><p>Pool owners can change the nominator and state toggler pool roles<br>As the title suggests, the nominator and state toggler roles can also be updated within the dashboard.</p> Other noteworthy nomination pool support <p>Along with the above management functions, the staking dashboard attempts to make pool management intuitive and useful with dedicated UI, such as:</p>  A step-by-step pool creation process, similar to the nominator setup process for solo staking.  A pool stats module outlining the current state of the pool, featuring the total bond amount, total members, outstanding unclaimed rewards, and more.  A list of all pools along with their member count, bonded funds, and the pool’s nomination status. This is very useful for determining whether a pool is actively earning rewards at a glance.  Pools are searchable via a dedicated search bar alongside the pools list.  Once you join (or create) a pool, a dedicated pool members tab allows you to browse all pool members, along with the amount they have bonded in the pool.  The ability to delve into a pool’s nominations list and browse each of those nomination’s status, so users can view how many of the pool’s nominations are active.  The ability to add favorite pools, that are housed in a separate tab on the pools page.  <p>This is not an exhaustive list of nomination pool support within the dashboard, but hopefully communicates the attention and thought given to supporting pools as a 1st class citizen in the dashboard.</p><p>As always, nomination pool support will continue to improve and evolve with the rest of the dashboard.</p> Enhanced Methods of Generating Nominations <p>Staking dashboard attempts to make it easy to discover and nominate validators.</p><p>One of the problems of nominating on Polkadot is that of finding a balance between choosing a mix of active and inactive validators while maintaining a high probability of being an active nominator every era.</p><p>Economically, Polkadot rewards those who back less popular validators as the share of that validator will be larger than that of a popular validator. This is subject to a validator’s era points, but in general, the less nominators backing a validator, the greater your share of the payout.</p><p>So it makes sense to at least back some less active validators on Polkadot as part of your nomination strategy to maximize potential rewards. This was a consideration during this iteration of the nominate feature, with various options now present for generating and choosing validators.</p><p>Generation methods have now been expanded to 4 main methods:</p>Nomination generation methods in staking dashboard<p>Breaking down these methods:</p>  Optimal Selection selects a 75% share of currently active validators and a 25% share of currently inactive validators.  Active Low Commission selects a range of currently active validators prioritizing low commission.  From Favorites selects validators from your favorites list.  Manual Selection does not generate any nominations, allowing the user to fine-tune their selection manually.  <p>For validators to be a part of the generation process, they must have an on-chain identity, not be in blocked state, and not have 100% commission. Each generation method then adds additional requirements to be a part of the pool from which validators are randomly selected..</p><p>Once you have selected a generation method, you are then able to fine tune that selection. The following screenshot is what is presented after selecting the Optimal Selection method:</p>Interface for fine-tuning generated nominations<p>There are a few useful tools in this interface, most notably:</p>  The ability to re-generate the list using the same method, that totally replaces your nominations in one-click. This is done by the Re-Generate button above the validator list.  The ability to select and remove validators from the list, and add from favorites; these functions were already present prior to this update.  The ability to generate a single active parachain validator, a single active validator (non-parachain), or just a single random validator that could be active or inactive.  <p>These buttons give users more tooling to mix up their nomination set in the way they see fit. If the maximum number of validators are met (16 in Polkadot’s case), or if there are no more validators available in a particular subset, then the corresponding buttons will be disabled.</p><p>Users can also cancel and start again with a new generation method if they choose to do so.</p><p>UX Enhancements</p><p>Various improvements have also been made to the staking dashboard UI this month. This section lists the most notable of them:</p>  A redesigned help modal, that rethinks how the previously featured Assistant modal should be implemented. The new interface solves accessibility and readability issues that the previous iteration highlighted.  A redesigned full-screen help overlay now replaces the Assistant button.  A new Help icon that invokes the new help overlay is now present in the side menu.  A dedicated Accounts button is now always present in the top right corner of the app. The account bubbles beside the button are no longer interactive, and simply provide guidance to which accounts are actively staking (both nominating or via pools).  The “reserve amount” for transaction fees has been completely removed, and tx fees now dynamically adjust bond amounts and display warnings when tx fees cannot be fulfilled.  Animated icons are being rolled out, the first of which now live in the side menu.  The new <a href="https://unbounded.polkadot.network/">Unbounded Polkadot font</a> has been installed and applied to top page and modal headings.  The main app font has been changed to Inter, a more screen-friendly font and keeps consistency with the main Polkadot branding.  More border-radius and spacing consistency between the various button styles.  The Validators page is now searchable with a dedicated search bar.  The default validator list and pool list ordering is now shuffled on every page reload.  The Community page is now populated with over 20 validator entities, providing their bios, social media links and list of validators.

 Cosmos History — Part I — Inception to PreLaunch <p>The constellation of core Cosmos and Interchain development organizations has a complex history. Its details are scattered across the internet, in blog posts, news articles, tweets, github repositories, and even blockchains. What has emerged out of this history is a truly remarkable collection of smart, passionate, and thoughtful contributors that have together made manifest the vision of the Internet of Blockchains. This post outlines the origin story of Cosmos up until just before the launch of the Cosmos Hub. A subsequent post will outline the history since then. As the Cosmos ecosystem continues to expand and flourish, we believe it’s important to reflect on how we got here to remind us of where we want to go and how we bring the learning from the past into the opportunities of the&nbsp;future.</p> Pre History <p>One could say that blockchains became too big to ignore once Bitcoin crossed the $1B valuation mark in early 2013 during the Cypriot financial crisis. By the end of the year, Bitcoin’s market cap had 10x’d again, before famously crashing and collapsing the Mt Gox exchange shortly thereafter.</p><p>There were already adaptations of Bitcoin — like Litecoin, which launched in 2011, and Dogecoin, which launched by the end of 2013¹ — and there was a significant amount of protocol design activity and experiments. There were hundreds of cryptocurrencies, many of which never reached widespread adoption. But it was difficult, expensive, and unsustainable to continuously secure new networks using Proof of Work, and the early crypto community was researching alternatives. By 2012 and 2013 the idea of Proof of Stake was floating around, but the early Proof of Stake protocols — like those used by Peercoin and Nxt — had quite limited security guarantees because there was no cost to re-writing history. This came to be known as the <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/31/pos_faq.html#what-is-the-nothing-at-stake-problem-and-how-can-it-be-fixed">“Nothing at Stake”</a> attack and was considered a fundamental problem for Proof of Stake. The core problem remains, though it is now handled in practice by <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity">adjusting the security&nbsp;model</a>.²</p> 2014: Jae Kwon invents Tendermint <p>2014 was a formative year for Proof of Stake and blockchain more generally. By early 2014, Vitalik had invented Ethereum and the first implementations were being worked on. He was also publishing a lot about protocol design, and conceived an approach to handling the Nothing at Stake problem using security deposits — what he called <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm">“slasher”</a>. In this version of Proof of Stake, validators would “bond” their tokens in such a way that they could be “slashed” if they misbehaved (ie. tried to re-write history illegally).</p><p>Inspired by the ongoing research on Proof of Stake, by the spring of 2014, Jae Kwon invented <a href="https://tendermint.com/static/docs/tendermint.pdf">Tendermint</a>. It was unique in that it was the first blockchain system&nbsp;to:</p>  Use a classical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm  Implement Security-Deposit-Based Proof-of-Stake (“slasher”)  <p>Both of these components are now staples of nearly every modern Proof of Stake&nbsp;system.</p><p>The original PoS systems, before Tendermint, didn’t actually solve the consensus problem securely. Tendermint was the first system to build on the decades of academic research in Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, in particular by developing a variant of the <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf">1988 DLS algorithm</a> for partial synchrony that “upgraded” it to use blockchain data structures and a stake weighted voting power. By combining this approach to BFT with Vitalik’s “slasher” idea, Tendermint came to both epitomize a new model of Proof-of-Stake and provide the first serious implementation you could really start to build&nbsp;with.</p><p>By the end of 2014, a growing community of cryptocurrency researchers had come together online in the form of the CryptoCurrency Research Group (CCRG, now defunct)³, largely convinced that Proof of Stake cryptocurrencies were the future of blockchains. They set off to build that future. Among them were Vitalik Buterin, Vlad Zamfir, Ethan Buchman, Jae Kwon, Zaki Manian, Dominic Williams, Arthur Brietman, and others. Vitalik had invented Ethereum, and Vlad had been working as a leading researcher there. Ethan worked closely with Vlad and was contributing to go-ethereum. Jae Kwon had invented Tendermint. Dominic was working on the ideas that would become Dfinity. Arthur had invented Tezos. Zaki was running a supply-chain focused blockchain startup called SkuChain at the time, and was otherwise already everywhere.</p><p>Jae Kwon had begun an initial implementation of the Tendermint software in Go around spring 2014 under his company All in Bits Inc, which did business as Tendermint Inc. He chose Go because the language was gaining popularity, especially for distributed systems projects and blockchains. What would become the main Ethereum software was also being written in Go. At the same time, Ethan was working for Eris Industries (now <a href="https://monax.io/">Monax</a>) as the lead blockchain developer, with a mandate to bring Ethereum to enterprise, and was looking for a Proof of Stake solution to integrate with. Tendermint was the leading candidate.</p> 2015: Ethan Buchman&nbsp;Joins <p>In early 2015, the CCRG held a conference in Silicon Valley called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHRJAd29VhyhLVT5tEOvhIw">CryptoEconomicon</a> where much of this early R&amp;D community attended. It was here that Ethan and Jae, the founders of Cosmos, first met. They discussed possible attacks on Jae’s Tendermint algorithm, and shortly thereafter began closely collaborating on the Tendermint software.</p><p>Ethan and Jae spent the better part of 2015 working closely on the Tendermint software. They implemented the Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the Tendermint application state (technically the first iteration of “Ethermint”), implemented various features to make Tendermint more useful, and made various improvements to the consensus algorithm.</p><p>Ethan was also completing a Masters Degree at the University of Guelph at the time. His thesis, <a href="https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10214/9769/Buchman_Ethan_201606_MAsc.pdf">Tendermint: Byzantine Fault Tolerance in the Age of Blockchains</a>, focused on Tendermint — its consensus algorithm, software architecture, and performance under test. The thesis is widely regarded as an essential introduction to the historical context of blockchains and Proof-of-Stake in the tradition of classical Byzantine Fault Tolerance.</p><p>In the second half of 2015, discussions between Jae and Eris Industries over copyright of the Tendermint codebase (which included an implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine), led Jae to introduce an abstraction between the Tendermint consensus engine and the application state machine it replicates, a programming interface we now know as the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI). This interface made it possible for application logic to be completely separated from the Tendermint consensus engine, to be run in a different process, and even written in a different programming language,⁴ making Tendermint the general purpose state-machine replication engine it has become today. This allowed the components related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and to any cryptocurrency elements at all, to be refactored out of the Tendermint code base. In particular, at the time, ownership over the Ethereum Virtual Machine components moved to Eris Industries, and that code evolved into what is now the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-burrow">Hyperledger Burrow&nbsp;Project</a>.</p><p>By the end of the year, Ethan decided to leave Eris Industries to build a company around the Tendermint codebase with Jae. He became a formal co-founder of All in Bits Inc and served as its&nbsp;CTO.⁵</p> 2016: Cosmos and&nbsp;Adoption <p>In early 2016, All in Bits (AiB) was trying to raise money from venture capitalists for Tendermint-based enterprise products and Proof-of-Stake application hosting. The VCs were only just starting to understand Bitcoin, and were certainly not ready for this. During this period, Ethan and Jae started working with Peng Zhong, a designer and web developer that Jae had worked with on a previous project. Peng started working on early blockchain explorers and wallet designs to support possible products. They realized after a few months that the timing was not right, and so Jae and Ethan revisited their original motivations: to solve a number of outstanding problems in the security, speed, flexibility, and usability of public cryptocurrency systems, to lay a foundation for a more sustainable approach to money and&nbsp;finance.</p><p>After iterating through a number of designs and debating different ways to raise capital, they hit on the concept of Cosmos and wrote the <a href="https://cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper">Cosmos whitepaper</a>, which proposed an “Internet of Blockchains’’, based on the Tendermint consensus engine, the ABCI application interface, and a TCP-like protocol for reliable communication between untrusting blockchain networks called the InterBlockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Jae had written the very first specification of the IBC protocol, which was included in the whitepaper. The first blockchain in the network was to be known as the Cosmos Hub; it would be a Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency system with a native token called ATOM that would be allocated to participants in a future fundraising event held by a to-be-created non-profit.</p><p>The Cosmos Whitepaper was well received by the cryptocurrency community, and Tendermint was gaining adoption as a flexible and mature platform for building blockchain applications. By the end of summer 2016, Ethan and Jae received some initial funding to build&nbsp;Cosmos.</p><p>Meanwhile, All in Bits was engaged by Votem Inc to host the Rock N’ Roll Hall of Fame’s annual vote on a Tendermint blockchain, which it completed in the fall. That means the 2017 inductees into the Rock N’ Roll hall of fame (which included Tupac!) were actually voted for using a Tendermint blockchain, lending more credibility to the project and helping further boost adoption. (See the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210724065702/https://votem.com/news/press-releases/largest-ever-online-vote-using-blockchain/">Votem press release</a> for more details.)</p><p>The user base of Tendermint was growing considerably at the time, and the Cosmos project was gaining in recognition. Cosmos <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tendermint-wins-innovation-award-and-announces-cosmos-at-international-blockchain-week-1474657507">won an award for Most Innovative Project</a> at the International Blockchain Week in Shanghai, September 2016, which was co-hosted with Ethereum’s Devcon&nbsp;II.</p><p>By the end of the year, Jae and Ethan were hiring their first developers at All in Bits. A list of employees and when they joined can be found in the Appendix. The list is notably incomplete and will be updated over&nbsp;time!</p> 2017: Early&nbsp;Growth <p>By February 2017, with the initial funds raised for Cosmos, and following the model set by Ethereum, a non-profit was established in Switzerland called the Interchain Foundation (ICF). The ICF was governed by a Foundation Council (FC) consisting initially of Jae, Ethan and a local Swiss board member named Guido Schmitz-Krummacher. In the meantime, All in Bits was ramping up development of the Cosmos software — the team was already running testnets of Tendermint based chains with a simple account system sending tokens between each other with a prototype of&nbsp;IBC.</p><p>In April 2017, a fundraiser was conducted for the Cosmos project. The Cosmos and Tendermint projects had already developed significant grassroots reputation and adoption over the years among early blockchain developers. AiB grew to some ~20 people over 2017. They were working on wallets, an application framework, improving Tendermint, and designing proof of stake algorithms. They were iterating on early versions of the Cosmos-SDK and Cosmos Hub software. They were sketching designs for Ethereum bridges and Decentralized Exchanges and smart contract languages, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>A number of core team members joined AiB in 2017, many of whom are still active in the Cosmos ecosystem today. See the Appendix for more details on who joined in 2017 and what they’re up to now! These were the formative days of what would come to be known as the <a href="https://ali-the-curious.medium.com/the-tendermint-mafia-348bacd1c352">Tendermint Mafia</a>.</p> 2018: Cosmos-SDK and&nbsp;Testnets <p>By early 2018 the Cosmos-SDK really started to take shape and the early pieces of the Cosmos Hub started to make use of it. The Cosmos-SDK was aspiring to be the Ruby on Rails for blockchains — a “batteries included” application framework and toolkit for programming blockchains.</p><p>Around spring 2018, Zaki Manian officially joined AiB. Zaki had been around since the beginning of Cosmos — he worked through many of the early ideas with Ethan and Jae, he reviewed the whitepaper, was one of the firsts to fund the project, and was always around to provide advice and insight. Zaki would go on to lead the Cosmos testnet program, culminating in the Game of Stakes and the launch of the Cosmos Hub. He would later lead the major Stargate upgrade, and he continues to play a key role in Cosmos strategy and development today.</p><p>Over the course of 2018, the testnet program grew considerably and became increasingly decentralized. By Summer 2018, there were decentralized testnet launches with over 100 validators. The team was breaking ground in the deployment of large scale BFT consensus systems. Many of today’s top validators learned the ropes in the early Cosmos testnet program. The technology matured considerably during this period. A new business model — the Proof of Stake validator — was being&nbsp;born.</p><p>The team grew and lots of great people were joining (see the Appendix!). Everyone was united by a shared vision to build a sovereign interoperable future for blockchains, a vision that motivates them still, to continue innovating on the frontier.</p><p>At the ICF, Michael Niederer was hired to be the CFO, and took over operations in Switzerland. The ICF began an initiative to start funding research more broadly, especially on consensus systems, cryptography, and formal verification. The ICF helped found the <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/icf-supports-5-year-research-program-led-by-professor-dan-boneh-f0992c333129">Stanford Blockchain Research Center</a> and initiated collaborations with researchers in Switzerland and elsewhere. The ICF started to grow its broader funding program too, expanding the ecosystem by contributing to some early Cosmos-based <a href="https://interchain-io.medium.com/ecosystem-expansion-189e9534038">projects</a>.</p><p>By the end of 2018, serious preparations were being made for the imminent launch of the Cosmos Hub. Most notable of these was Game of Stakes, the first Proof-of-Stake, incentivized, decentralized tesnet which served as the culmination of the Cosmos tesnet program and which put the Cosmos software through its most <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/let-the-games-begin-21e66e34e2fd">rigorous test to date</a>. Game of Stakes set a new standard for incentivized and decentralized testnets whose legacy is felt across the ecosystem today.</p><p>Throughout most of 2018, the Cosmos Hub was famously “two months” away from launch. Chris Goes did offer a prophetic software estimation when in early summer 2018 he predicted that the Cosmos Hub would launch by the end of February 2019. He was off by about 2&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>Stay tuned, for launch and the years that followed, in Part&nbsp;II.</p><p>Thanks to the many reviewers who contributed to this history. It has been reviewed and accepted by Jae, Ethan, and&nbsp;Zaki.</p> Endnotes   Fun piece of trivia: Jae Kwon (co-founder of Cosmos), and Jehan Tremback (Interchain Security lead, at Informal Systems) contributed to early debates about Dogecoin monetary policy in this <a href="https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/23">github&nbsp;issue</a>.  The security model for Tendermint (and its light client) is defined more formally in<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07031"> this paper</a> by Informal&nbsp;Systems.  A cryptoeconomics google group was created. Jae later created a second cryptofinance group to continue discussions.  See the <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/abci-the-application-blockchain-interface-f1bd8278cdd7">original blog post</a> announcing ABCI (which was originally called TMSP, the TenderMint Socket Protocol)  A third co-founder, Dustin Byington, was also brought on to All in Bits Inc to lead finance and operations, though he would part ways with the company soon after in&nbsp;2016.

 Meet our new hire — Martin Lecam, Front-End Developer <p>#16 — This is the sixteenth post in our “Meet our new hire” series, where we introduce you to the latest additions to our team here at BlockWallet.</p><p>We’d like to our latest team member, Martin Lecam! Martin is a talented front-end developer that brings his versatile experience from working in various industries. And now, he’s bringing his expertise to BlockWallet — helping the team continuously improve our premium user experience.</p> What’s your job position? <p>I’m a Front-End developer that is helping construct the BlockWallet browser extension. My background consists of being a full-stack developer, but I wanted to focus on Front-End to improve my knowledge of blockchain technology — BlockWallet gives me this opportunity. I’m someone who seeks challenges which is why I decided to join BlockWallet!</p> How long have you worked as a developer? <p>I’ve been working as a developer for more than 8 years. I started as an intern and then became a full-stack developer. I also had the opportunity of working as an RPA developer for an oil company, we were asked to create automations for the finance team. These automations included copying human actions in the computer, downloading files, and making calculations. After those calculations were done our automations pushed that data back to the&nbsp;system.</p> Which projects have you worked on&nbsp;before? <p>I started as an intern in a SaaS company and worked there for 5 years. My role there was as a full-stack developer consisting of front-end/back-end work. It also gave me the opportunity of visiting customers and presenting our product — something that really helped my communication skills. In this company, I worked with a SaaS system and also contributed in the first offline product, designed for companies who have limited internet&nbsp;access.</p><p>After my full-stack developer position in the SaaS company, I worked as an RPA developer for an oil company. In this experience, I learned a lot about the oil business and&nbsp;finance.</p><p>My most recent position was at a bank working as a Python developer — I was assigned to create end-of-day reports that indicated profit and losses for traders. Overall, this was a really exciting job since it was my first time as a Python developer.</p> When did you first get involved in&nbsp;crypto? <p>I first got involved in crypto about a year ago, messing around with the basics. What really intrigued me with this space, was the fundamental concept of crypto. Particularly with decentralized finance, and how we could take ownership of our own financial assets. And after some time I started ‘playing’ with crypto to learn about it, which is what ultimately led me to get this&nbsp;job.</p> What made you interested in BlockWallet? <p>The first thing that made me interested in BlockWallet was the idea of preserving privacy in a decentralized ecosystem. By simply having someone’s wallet address, you are able to track their entire Web3 footprint due to the transparent nature of the blockchain. And while there are certain levels of transparency we cannot avoid, BlockWallet provides the tools to help remain private on public&nbsp;chains.</p><p>The second thing was the team. After doing a couple of interviews, I quickly realized the quality of people that are working here and I knew it was going to be a great experience.</p><p>Accepting the offer was a no-brainer. Cutting-edge privacy technology, a fantastic team, and the opportunity to work in&nbsp;Web3.</p> Why do you think privacy matters on blockchains? <p>Privacy is vital in each aspect of our life, so why should be different in Web3? In fact, it should matter more because of how your entire financial history is accessible on the blockchain. If someone can link your wallet address to your actual identity, it’s equivalent to accessing your entire bank account&nbsp;history!</p> Do you have any predictions on where crypto will be 5 years from&nbsp;now? <p>5 years from now, I believe crypto technology will be engrained into every part of our lives. Even for the ones that don’t believe in crypto or think it’s a scam. It’ll be similar to the internet where you don’t have a choice — everything will be built on blockchains.</p> Parting thoughts <p>I’m really happy to be part of the BlockWallet team and the amazing community that we’ve built. I can’t wait to see what the future&nbsp;holds.</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a privacy-first self-custodial browser extension wallet where you can store, send or receive crypto and interact with your favorite blockchain apps privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy often translates to security risks. BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating friction and making privacy accessible for everyone.</p><p>BlockWallet protects you and ensures privacy by default. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain apps, BlockWallet routes all node requests through Privacy Proxies, which mask the IP address and other metadata, that can be used to identify and track you on a blockchain. BlockWallet offers integrated Flash-Bot Protection, shielding you from sandwich attacks when you trade on DEXes. Meanwhile, the Phishing Protection feature helps you combat phishing scams by generating unique artwork on all sensitive pages.</p><p>BlockWallet is not a compromise. It’s privacy-first, but it still packs all features you would expect from a wallet. With full Web 3.0 support, the wallet allows you to connect to any&nbsp;DApp.</p><p>Become a part of the BlockWallet community today:</p><p><a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Homepage</a> | <a href="https://blockwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetBlockWallet">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/blockwallet">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/69gvNKatdb">Discord</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EKVZ2xWXEH">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://hello@blockwallet.io/">E-mail</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet/meet-our-new-hire-martin-lecam-front-end-developer-43d7b87e5db7">Meet our new hire — Martin Lecam, Front-End Developer</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet">BlockWallet</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

reddot winner 2022: interface design<p>Web2, even with all its problems, got a lot of things right. It set the tone for a high standard of User Experience (UX). For the masses to move over to Web3, we need to mirror what people have come to expect from online: smooth, stunning, enjoyable experiences.</p><p>Given the technical world of Web3 with its own language of acronyms, memes and slang, simplified design is more important than ever. <a href="https://www.excited.agency/works/verida">Excited</a>, Verida’s design agency, winning the Red Dot Award is a step forward in making Web3 more accessible and accepted.</p> The coveted Red&nbsp;Dot <p>The <a href="https://www.red-dot.org/about-red-dot">Red Dot Design Award</a> is an international design competition that best distinguishes business activities through excellent design. The award is judged on three disciplines: Product Design, Communication Design, and Design&nbsp;Concept.</p><p>Running since 1955, the award originally highlighted works in industrial design. As the design world has evolved, so has the award. Today, it celebrates new expertise such as UX and UI design. The esteemed winners are deemed the best in the business.</p>The Verida&nbsp;Vault The award-winning Verida Vault&nbsp;design <p><a href="https://www.excited.agency/">Excited</a>, a product design agency based in Ukraine, have worked with Verida since 2019. Their two main projects include designing the website and Verida Vault — the work that won them the coveted 2022 Red&nbsp;Dot.</p><p>“The judges look for work with consumer appeal — an interesting design approach, a problem worth solving or something that looks new and unique,” said Oleksandr Perelotov, Excited’s Design Director and Co-Founder.</p><p>Perelotov said there was a strong education piece involved in designing Web3 products.</p><blockquote>“This is still very new technology. It was different from designing an e-commerce project, where there’s an abundance of examples. What we found helpful was putting real-life examples to abstract ideas. For example, while envisioning the data requests or data sharing, we created a Covid vaccination certificate.”</blockquote><p>Designing to solve real-world problems and improve the lives of end users obviously worked. We share this sentiment at&nbsp;Verida.</p> Enjoyable, personalized online experiences <p>Our mission is to empower users to own and control their personal data. To transfer the power from institutions to individuals. It’s not just an era where data is consensual and self-sovereign.</p><p>We’re building on this to create new products and services to enhance our lives through wonderful, hyper-personalized digital experiences.</p><p>To achieve this, Web3 apps need to offer the standard of UX that people are used to today. Excited gets this — you can <a href="https://www.excited.agency/works/verida">see it in their&nbsp;designs</a>.</p><blockquote>“It’s an honor to have our name and blockchain data wallet attached to such a notable award. We hope Excited’s incredible design work sets the tone for bold, beautiful, yet friendly and non-threatening UX/UI in Web3,” said Verida CEO, Chris&nbsp;Were.</blockquote><p>This is the fourth Red Dot Award for Excited. The agency won the 2022 and 2021 Interface Design category and took home two awards in 2020 for Corporate Design and Identity, and Brand Design and Identity.</p>The Excited&nbsp;team Get started with the Verida&nbsp;Vault <p>The Verida Vault is now available to download from the<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verida-vault/id1546599632"> iOS App Store</a> and<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.verida.vault"> Google Play&nbsp;Store</a>.</p><p>Learn more about the Verida Vault and get&nbsp;started:</p>  <a href="https://www.verida.io/get-started">Verida Getting Started&nbsp;Guide</a>  <a href="https://community.verida.io/user-guides">Vault User&nbsp;Guides</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tyR5VjeaPs&amp;list=PLrEaGKs7Ni9CnWP62xpw88jXSv33FT6PF">Vault Video&nbsp;Guides</a>   <p><a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-vault-designers-win-prestigious-red-dot-award-48deb4336813">Verida Vault Designers Win Prestigious Red Dot Award</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.verida.io">Verida</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An update on the tokenomics of the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Nym is a decentralised privacy mixnet. The Nym mixnet has an associated NYM utility token that grants usage rights to the privacy&nbsp;network.</p><p>The <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-cryptoecon-paper.pdf">tokenomics of the Nym mixnet</a> is intended to incentivise people to provide privacy, rather than surveillance.</p><p>Not only that, the tokenomics has been designed and engineered to incentivise good privacy protections: the better the service in terms of mixing packets, the better the reputation of a mix node in Nym will be in the overall infrastructure. In essence, Nym serves a ‘reputation’ token for mixnetworks.</p><p>Recap on token milestones</p><p>A total supply of one billion NYM tokens was generated on the decentralised mainnet Nyx chain in February 2022. The NYM token comes in two flavours: Native tokens on the Cosmos ecosystem (used within the privacy infra) and ERC20 tokens - as much software does not include support for Cosmos, so a bridge allows them to be ‘wrapped’ as ERC tokens. Transfer between the two versions is done via <a href="https://www.gravitybridge.net/">Gravity Bridge</a>.

<p>Every startup has a startup story. Apple was two hackers in a Los Altos garage. Google was two grad students in a Stanford dorm room. Alameda Research was just one guy in a Berkeley apartment, making a single cryptocurrency trade. That guy was Sam Bankman-Fried, or SBF to his friends. Yet the trade he made, which eventually led to the crypto-trading platform FTX, is far from the standard Silicon Valley creation tale. In 2017, when he was merely 25, SBF collapsed the so-called kimchi premium, an anomalous delta between the price of Bitcoin in much of Asia and its price in the rest of the world. It was a daring feat of arbitrage—SBF is the only trader known to have pulled this off in any meaningful way—one which quickly made him a billionaire and achieved the status of legend.</p>



<p>Among Wall Street’s financial elite, SBF’s Bitcoin arb is mentioned in the same hushed tones as Paul Tudor Jones’s 1987 shorting of the entire American economy, or George Soros’s 1992 raid on the Bank of England, or John Paulson’s 2008 bet against subprime mortgages. Alameda’s capture of the kimchi premium (and other trades like it) gave SBF the grubstake he needed for his next move: founding the crypto exchange FTX—a company that may very well end up creating the dominant all-in-one financial super-app of the future. Nothing is a sure bet in crypto, but just the possibility that FTX could join—or even eclipse—the big four of American banking (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank) means it’s already valued at $32 billion. SBF himself has amassed more wealth in a shorter period of time than anyone else, ever. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/">2022 Forbes Billionaires List</a> pegs SBF’s net worth at $24 billion. He’s now 30 years old. But we get ahead of ourselves.</p>



<p>SBF learned to trade at Jane Street, an under-the-radar high-frequency trading shop in New York’s financial district. The firm recruits from the smartest students in math and physics at MIT. SBF, a physics major at MIT, had interned at Jane Street in the summer of 2013 and was one of the few such recruits invited back for a full-time job. He was put to work as a market maker trading global ETFs—more difficult than simply making a market for a single stock, in the same way Tri-Dimensional Chess is more difficult than the bog-standard variety.</p>



<p>Not long before interning at Jane Street, SBF had a meeting with Will MacAskill, a young Oxford-educated philosopher who was then just completing his PhD. Over lunch at the Au Bon Pain outside Harvard Square, MacAskill laid out the principles of effective altruism (EA). The math, MacAskill argued, means that if one’s goal is to optimize one’s life for doing good, often most good can be done by choosing to make the most money possible—in order to give it all away. “Earn to give,” urged MacAskill.</p>



<p>EA traces its roots to philosopher Peter Singer, who reasons from the utilitarian point of view that the purpose of life is to maximize the well-being of others. Singer, in his eighth decade, may well be the most-read living philosopher. In the 1970s, Singer almost single-handedly created the animal rights movement, popularizing veganism as an ethical solution to the moral horror of meat. Today he’s best known for the drowning-child thought experiment. (What would you do if you came across a young child drowning in a pond?) Singer states the obvious—and then universalizes the underlying principle: “Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, but what we ought to do.” In a nutshell, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_You_Can_Save">Singer argues</a> that it’s a moral imperative of the world’s well-off to give as much as possible—10, 20, even 50 percent of all income—to better the lives of the world’s poor.</p>



<p>MacAskill’s contribution is to combine Singer’s moral logic with the logic of finance and investment. One not only has an obligation to give a significant percentage of income away, MacAskill argues, but to give it away as efficiently as possible. And, since every charity claiming to save lives has a budget, they can all be ranked by cost-effectiveness. So, how much does it cost for a charity to save a single life? The data says that controlling the spread of malaria and worms has the biggest bang for the buck, with a life saved per every $2,000 invested. Effective altruism prioritizes this low-hanging fruit—these are the drowning children we’re morally obligated to save first.</p>

Effective Altruism founder will macaskill



<p></p>



<p>Though EA originated at Oxford, it has found most of its traction in the Bay Area. Such fixtures in the Silicon Valley firmament as Dustin Moskovitz and Reid Hoffman have publicly endorsed the idea, as have tech oracles like Eric Drexler and Aubrey de Grey. The EA rank and file draws from the rationalist movement, a loose intellectual confederation of scruffy, young STEM-oriented freethinkers who typically (or, perhaps, stereotypically) blog about rationality and live gender-fluid, polycurious lifestyles in group houses in Berkeley and Oakland.</p>



<p>SBF is from the Bay Area—the eldest son of two Stanford law professors, Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried. His parents raised him and his siblings utilitarian—in the same way one might be brought up Unitarian—amid dinner-table debates about the greatest good for the greatest number. One of SBF’s formative moments came at age 12, when he was weighing arguments, pro and con, around the abortion debate. A rights-based theorist might argue that there aren’t really any discontinuous differences as a fetus becomes a child (and thus fetus murder is essentially child murder). The utilitarian argument compares the consequences of each. The loss of an actual child’s life—a life in which a great deal of parental and societal resources have been invested—is much more consequential than the loss of a potential life, in utero. And thus, to a utilitarian, abortion looks more like birth control than like murder. SBF’s application of utilitarianism helped him resolve some nagging doubts he had about the ethics of abortion. It made him comfortable being pro-choice—as his friends, family, and peers were. He saw the essential rightness of his philosophical faith.</p>



<p>Highly mathletic, SBF breezed through Crystal Springs Uplands, an elite prep school in Hillsborough, California. Though he earned top marks, he kept to himself, spending most of his free time playing computer games (StarCraft, League of Legends) and a trading card game, Magic: The Gathering. But at MIT he found his tribe: fellow pledges at Epsilon Theta, a coed fraternity of supergeeks similarly interested in Magic, and video games. Thetans are <a href="https://web.mit.edu/thetans/www/about.html">fond</a> of debating math, physics, computer science, linguistics, philosophy and logic problems—for fun—at alcohol-free parties.</p>



<p>It was his fellow Thetans who introduced SBF to EA and then to MacAskill, who was, at that point, still virtually unknown. MacAskill was visiting MIT in search of volunteers willing to sign on to his earn-to-give program. At a café table in Cambridge, Massachusetts, MacAskill laid out his idea as if it were a business plan: a strategic investment with a return measured in human lives. The opportunity was big, MacAskill argued, because, in the developing world, life was still unconscionably cheap. Just do the math: At $2,000 per life, a million dollars could save 500 people, a billion could save half a million, and, by extension, a trillion could theoretically save half a billion humans from a miserable death.</p>



<p>MacAskill couldn’t have hoped for a better recruit. Not only was SBF raised in the Bay Area as a utilitarian, but he’d already been inspired by Peter Singer to take moral action. During his freshman year, SBF went vegan and organized a campaign against factory farming. As a junior, he was wondering what to do with his life. And MacAskill—Singer’s philosophical heir—had the answer: The best way for him to maximize good in the world would be to maximize his wealth.</p>



<p>SBF listened, nodding, as MacAskill made his pitch. The earn-to-give logic was airtight. It was, SBF realized, applied utilitarianism. Knowing what he had to do, SBF simply said, “Yep. That makes sense.” But, right there, between a bright yellow sunshade and the crumb-strewn red-brick floor, SBF’s purpose in life was set: He was going to get filthy rich, for charity’s sake. All the rest was merely execution risk.</p>



<p>His course established, MacAskill gave SBF one last navigational nudge to set him on his way, suggesting that SBF get an internship at Jane Street that summer.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>In 2017, everything was going great for SBF. He was killing it at Jane Street. He was a trader’s trader: so fluent with transactions that others would come watch him work, like one might watch an esports athlete streaming on Twitch. He was giving away 50 percent of his income to his preferred charities, with the biggest donations going to the Centre for Effective Altruism and 80,000 Hours. Both charities focus on building the earn-to-give idea into a movement. (And both had been founded by Will MacAskill a few years before.) He had good friends, mostly fellow EAs. Some were even colleagues. Jane Street was a great place to work, with an enviable corporate culture, plenty of perks, and some of the most generous pay packages in the industry. SBF had launched himself on a trajectory that would make him a very wealthy man. He was extremely happy at Jane Street—and content to stay there forever.</p>



<p>Still, when SBF analyzed the bright future that lay before him, something wasn’t right. He was, he realized, too secure. SBF’s mind had been trained almost from birth to calculate. As a schoolboy the hedonic calculous of utilitarianism had him trying to maximize the utility function (measured in “utils,” of course) for abortion. During his teenage gaming years, his mathematical abilities allowed him to sharpen his tactics—and win. And, of course, every trade SBF ever made at Jane was the subject of a risk/reward calculation. All of it boiled down to expected value. The formula is fairly simple. If the amount won multiplied by the probability of winning a bet is greater than the amount lost multiplied by the probability of losing a bet, then you go for it—irrespective of units. Utils, euros, dollars were all subject to the same reckoning.</p>



<p>But, at Jane, SBF osmosed another trading principle. He learned to be “risk-neutral”: In simple terms, a trader, given a choice between $50 and a 50 percent chance at $100, must be agnostic if they want to maximize the expected value of earnings over a lifetime. Those who prefer the sure win are “risk-averse,” and those who would rather gamble are “risk-lovers.” But both risk-lovers and the risk-averse are suckers, equally. Because, over the long run, they lose out to the risk-neutral, who take both deals without prejudice.</p>



<p>Here, SBF realized, was the rub: When he applied this principle to his own life, he came up short. There was little chance he’d get himself fired from Jane Street. Thus the decision to stick with Jane was a risk-averse preference. It was the logical equivalent of being offered a choice between $50 and 50 percent of $100, and saying, “Give me President Grant.” SBF was risk-neutral on behalf of Jane Street, but not, he realized, for his own life. To be fully rational about maximizing his income on behalf of the poor, he should apply his trading principles across the board. He had to find a risk-neutral career path—which, if we strip away the trader-jargon, actually means he felt he needed to take on a lot more risk in the hopes of becoming part of the global elite. The math couldn’t be clearer. Very high risk multiplied by dynastic wealth trumps low risk multiplied by mere rich-guy wealth. To do the most good for the world, SBF needed to find a path on which he’d be a coin toss away from going totally bust.</p>



<p>Pressed on how he justified the decision to gamble with his future, SBF turns the question around, imagining a world where operating this way is commonplace. In that world, “There’s a thousand of you. Some of you are going to do good, but the starving child doesn’t give a shit about which person it is who does that good. So why are you concerned about this little term in the equation?” To be clear: that “little term” in SBF’s equation is “you”—in other words, the specific person who saves the starving child. SBF is making a distinction between the selfish desire to be a savior and the selfless desire that children be saved—and choosing selflessness. “Obviously, I care about impact,” he says, and by “impact” he means “maximizing the overall chance that someone saves the child.” Thus, logically, it follows that “I am risk-neutral on overall impact.”</p>



<p>In the wake of this epiphany, SBF gave his notice. Caroline Ellison, a friend and colleague who was trading on the equities desk at Jane Street during that time, remembers the moment well. “It was unusual,” she says, “because he decided to quit—not to do anything in particular, but just under the premise that there were a lot of other options out there.”</p>



<p>SBF made a list of possible options, with some notes about each:</p>



  Journalism—low pay, but a massively outsized impact potential.  Running for office—or maybe just being an advisor?  Working for the movement—EA needs people!  Starting a startup—but what, exactly?  Bumming around the Bay Area for a month or so—just to see what happens.  



<p>“They all felt kind of compelling,” he remembers, “and I had no idea which was going to be the best.” But he also knew that the only losing choice was to not make a choice, so he closed his eyes and walked through door number five.</p>



<p>That’s when Caroline Ellison lost track of her friend.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Ellison is a freckle-faced redhead with a personality that splits the difference between bubbly and nerd-ball. She’s partial to a pair of designer frames that make her look a bit like Edna Mode, the superhero stylist in The Incredibles.</p>



<p>About six months after SBF dropped out, Jane Street sent Ellison on a recruiting trip to California, so she decided to call on her old friend. They’d been office buddies at Jane, but they’d also occasionally socialized outside of work, too, being fellow EA acolytes. Ellison wanted to catch up, but from the get-go, SBF was acting uncharacteristically shifty. There were several canceled coffee dates, and when the two finally did get together—at Jumpin’ Java, an old-school Berkeley coffeehouse with hand-painted murals on the wall and whimsical art in the windows—SBF evaded even the most innocuous of questions.</p>

<p></p>



<p>“So,” Ellison asked after joining SBF at a table, “what have you been up to in the last few months?” Ellison, it should be noted, was dressed as a sultry wood nymph—she was on her way to a LARP (Live Action Role Play) party.</p>



<p>“Oh,” SBF responded cryptically, “I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.”</p>



<p>“Okay, that’s fine,” Ellison said, sipping her tea.</p>



<p>Uncomfortable silence.</p>



<p>“Well, I guess I could tell you if you really want…” SBF offered after a moment.</p>



<p>“Nope. It’s okay.” Sip.</p>



<p>An awkward beat later, SBF broke, slayed by the silent force of Ellison’s four-eyed gaze.</p>



<p>“I’ll just tell you,” he said.</p>



<p>The story was pretty remarkable. After SBF quit Jane Street, he moved back home to the Bay Area, where Will MacAskill had offered him a job as director of business development at the Centre for Effective Altruism. He rented a modest apartment near CEA HQ in Berkeley, he still had a couple of weeks to just explore before his job started. This was his first vacation in, well, ever. In the years working at Jane, SBF had never taken any significant time off.</p>



<p>He spent his vacation just soaking everything in: It was his first time in the Bay Area as an adult, and he found his home turf unexpectedly thrilling. It was where all the new technology was. It was where all the startups were. It was where the bulk of the EA community was starting to congregate. SBF ended up hanging out a lot with his younger brother Gabe, who was living in an EA commune on nearby Stuart Street.</p>



<p>At that time, everyone in the tech world was talking about crypto. In the Bay Area, you couldn’t escape the chatter. The crypto community had been roiled by a “hard fork” earlier in the year, when what had been known simply as Bitcoin underwent a mitosis to become Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Cash. Later that year, Bitcoin (Classic) looked like it was going to cross the psychologically important $10,000 mark. Crypto was becoming a thing.</p>



<p>Curious, SBF had started looking into crypto—and almost immediately noticed something strange. Bitcoin was trading at a higher price in Japan and Korea than it was in the U.S. In theory, this should never happen because it represents a riskless profit opportunity—in other words, a free lunch. One simply buys Bitcoin at the lower price, sells it at the higher price, and pockets the difference. Jane Street built an empire on high-frequency trades that took advantage of fraction-of-a-cent price differences. But here was Bitcoin, trading at around $15,000 in South Korea: an unheard-of 50 percent price premium.</p>



<p>SBF was incredulous at the numbers he was seeing on his screen. This is probably not real. But then came the second thought: If it is real, then there’s $5,000 just lying on the ground. Instead of wasting time on internal debate, SBF decided to create some accounts on different exchanges and see if he could execute the trade. He couldn’t. But, interestingly, it wasn’t because the arbitrage opportunity wasn’t there—it was. But there was so much red tape with the banking system and currency controls that it was a difficult trade to execute.</p>



<p>Another day of work dealing with the red-tape problem netted SBF a single round-trip trade—to Asia and back—for a $20 profit. That was it: the proof of concept. There was an opportunity to be had. SBF immediately put $50,000 of his own money to work. The first job was just getting the money into the system. The operational challenges were huge. Not just anyone can walk into a foreign bank and start wiring money out of the country every day. There are know-your-customer rules, caps on withdrawals, citizenship requirements. Even worse, to any normal bank, the constant zeroing out, then maxing out, of a cash account—with the money coming and going overseas, to and from fly-by-night Bitcoin exchanges—raised every red flag in the book. It looked like laundering. It looked like drug money. There were even monetary policy concerns: The liquidity of the South Korean won is sharply limited by the country’s central bank.</p>



<p>Fortunately, SBF had a secret weapon: the EA community. There’s a loose worldwide network of like-minded people who do each other favors and sleep on each other’s couches simply because they all belong to the same tribe. Perhaps the most important of them was a Japanese grad student, who volunteered to do the legwork in Japan. As a Japanese citizen, he was able to open an account with the one (obscure, rural) Japanese bank that was willing, for a fee, to process the transactions that SBF—newly incorporated as Alameda Research—wanted to make. The spread between Bitcoin in Japan and Bitcoin in the U.S. was “only” 10 percent—but it was a trade Alameda found it could make every day. With SBF’s initial $50,000 compounding at 10 percent each day, the next step was to increase the amount of capital. At the time, the total daily volume of crypto trading was on the order of a billion dollars. Figuring he wanted to capture 5 percent of that, SBF went looking for a $50 million loan. Again, he reached out to the EA community. Jaan Tallinn, the cofounder of Skype, put up a good chunk of that initial $50 million.</p>

<p></p>



<p>With a goosed-up capital account, the money started piling up so fast that SBF placed what he refers to as “a market order for employees” to tend to the Rube Goldberg operation that kept the capital spinning. There were constant blowups with banks, which are wary of anything crypto. Crypto was so new that regulators in South Korea and elsewhere were constantly changing their mind about regulations—then making those changes retroactive. It was a swirling mess. Pulled into the vortex was Nishad Singh, a friend of SBF’s brother Gabe, and a fellow EA member. Singh is a bespectacled and baby-faced young man with an earnest mien. He often wears a T-shirt with the words “compassionate to the core” printed, in a diminutive all-lowercase font, over his heart. After just one conversation with SBF, Singh decided to leave Facebook to take on the more meaningful work of building FTX. Caroline Ellison came, too, quitting Jane Street and moving to California only weeks after SBF described the operation to her over tea. The first 15 people SBF hired, all from the EA pool, were packed together in a shabby, 600-square-foot walk-up, working around the clock. The kitchen was given over to stand-up desks, the closet was reserved for sleeping, and the entire space overrun with half-eaten take-out containers. It was a royal mess. But it was also the good old days, when Alameda was just kids on a high-stakes, big-money, earn-to-give commando operation. Fifty percent of Alameda’s profits were going to EA-approved charities.</p>



<p>“This thing couldn’t have taken off without EA,” reminisces Singh, running his hand through a shock of thick black hair. He removes his glasses to think. They’re broken: A chopstick has been Scotch taped to one of the frame’s sides, serving as a makeshift temple. “All the employees, all the funding—everything was EA to start with.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>The Bitcoin arbitrage didn’t—and couldn’t—last forever. The Japanese appetite for overpriced Bitcoin withered (or, more likely, another shadowy arbitrage outfit also found its way to the trade and collapsed it). Either way, the spread narrowed to almost nothing. But there were other trades to be had. The simple fact that crypto was new, and that the tools traders needed to handle it were still under construction, meant that there were market inefficiencies all over the place. And behind every market inefficiency is an arbitrage opportunity.</p>



<p>The biggest headache for Alameda wasn’t finding the opportunities, but executing the trades. At that time, when it came to crypto exchanges, the choice basically boiled down to Coinbase or Binance. Coinbase makes a point of being regulated by authorities in the U.S., but as a consequence, didn’t offer the kinds of options contracts and derivatives professional traders need to hedge their bets. Binance, on the other hand, offered the kinds of derivatives SBF was familiar with when he traded for Jane Street—but as a company, it was continually moving from country to country in an attempt to evade all jurisdictional authority. Neither exchange was particularly good to trade on.</p>



<p>“Everything was rickety—there was no avoiding the ricketiness. Obviously, the line between rickety and shady is a little unclear at times, but the places that seemed like they were going to steal customer funds outright, we didn’t touch,” Singh says. “Even the best players in the space were having big problems.”</p>



<p>At this point, mid-2019, SBF decided to double down again—and scratch his own itch. He would bet Alameda’s multimillion-dollar trading profits on a new venture: a trading exchange called FTX. It would combine Coinbase’s stolid, regulation-loving approach with the kinds of derivatives being offered by Binance and others. He only gave himself a 20 percent chance of success, but, in his mind, SBF needed extreme risk to maximize the expected value of his lifetime earnings—and, therefore, the good his earn-to-give strategy could do. The fact that he was, by his own lights, overwhelmingly likely to fail was beside the point.</p>



<p>The point was this: When SBF multiplied out the billions of dollars a year a successful crypto-trading exchange could throw off by his self-assessed 20 percent chance of successfully building one, the number was still huge. That’s the expected value. And if you live your life according to the same principles by which you’d trade an asset, there’s only one way forward: You calculate the expected values, then aim for the largest one—because, in one (but just one) alternate future universe, everything works out fabulously. To maximize your expected value, you must aim for it and then march blindly forth, acting as if the fabulously lucky SBF of the future can reach into the other, parallel, universes and compensate the failson SBFs for their losses. It sounds crazy, or perhaps even selfish—but it’s not. It’s math. It follows from the principle of risk-neutrality.</p>



<p>“I think it’s hard to justify being risk-averse on your own personal impact,” SBF told me when I quizzed him about it—“unless you’re doing it for personal reasons.” In other words, it’s selfish not to go for broke—if you’re planning on giving it all away in the end anyway.</p>



<p>And, with that, he moved the nascent company to Hong Kong, a jurisdiction with a crypto-friendly regulatory regime. Hong Kong also happens to be conveniently located next door to the country that, at the time, had the largest and most enthusiastic crypto user base in the world: China.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>As Covid-19 descended, Michelle Bailhe, a young gun at Sequoia Capital, and veteran partner Alfred Lin were starting to closely examine the crypto space. Lin, a no-nonsense workaholic if there ever was one, had little patience for the kind of utopianism that motivated the first wave of cryptopians. Lin’s intellect was tempered in graduate school at Stanford, where he studied statistics and price options, swaps, and derivatives. And when he thought about crypto, the question he asked himself was: What is it good for?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes, crypto eventually could replace money, and, yes, it can eventually decentralize the web,” Lin says with a dismissive wave of his hand. “But all those things are not true today. And, so, what is the thing that people do today? They trade. And if people trade, and people like trading, what is the business model that will make tons of money? It would be an exchange.”</p>



<p>Bailhe spent months researching the space full time, focusing her energies on the exchanges. She met with every founder and every company that would have her. And she built a map—a landscape, as such a document is called at Sequoia—of the entire market.</p>



<p>“Of the exchanges that we had met and looked at, some of them had regulatory issues, some of them were already public,” Bailhe says. “And then there was Sam.” The exchange that SBF had started to build, FTX, was Goldilocks-perfect. There was no concerted effort to skirt the law, no Zuckerbergian diktat demanding that things be broken. And, yet, FTX wasn’t waiting to get permission to innovate. The company had based itself offshore precisely because it aspired to build an advanced risk engine that would support all sorts of hedging strategies. SBF himself seemed to be bred for the role of crypto exchange founder and CEO. Not only had he been a top trader at a top firm—and, thus, the ideal customer—but both his parents were lawyers. “And, so, he is committed to making the right chess moves for FTX to eventually be able to legally do everything they want to do in the U.S.,” Bailhe says—“not by asking forgiveness, but by asking permission.”</p>



<p>The problem, as Bailhe saw it, was that FTX didn’t appear to need any money. She was correct, but what she didn’t know was that SBF was starting to think about raising money anyway. Alameda had some unexpected losses due to so-called counterparty risk. Arbitrage is, in theory, riskless. But not when the rickety exchange you’re using to place your trades suddenly locks up and refuses to disburse your money. Or, worse yet, when two crypto exchanges can’t even agree on what a crypto transfer looks like, and so the act of sending crypto from one exchange to another results in tokens just disappearing into the ether. And don’t even ask about futures contracts that see their terms unilaterally changed mid-agreement: the dreaded “clawbacks.” Alameda was not immune to the exchange-level shenanigans that gave crypto as a whole its sleazy reputation. But FTX had an ambition to change that. It was built to be the exchange traders could count on. SBF needed to get the word out. He wanted FTX to be known as the respectable face of crypto. This required ad campaigns, sponsorship deals, a charitable wing—and a war chest to pay for it all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX did need money, after all. And it needed that money from credible sources so it could continue to distinguish itself from the bottom-feeders who came to crypto to fleece the suckers. So, in the summer of 2021, when FTX started to raise its Series B from a who’s who of Silicon Valley VCs, Bailhe and Lin hit the “Don’t Panic” button. “Embarrassingly, we had never tried to reach out to Sam, because we figured he didn’t need us,” Bailhe admits. “I thought they were just minting money and had absolutely no need for investors.” Learning otherwise, they quickly contacted SBF and organized a last-minute Zoom call between him and the partners at Sequoia—at four California time on a hot July Friday afternoon. Bailhe was adamant, putting her reputation with the other partners on the line: “I’m like, ‘No, it’s worth it. Cancel your afternoon.’”</p>



<p>The Zoom went well for all concerned. SBF looked relaxed as he answered questions, talking, as he usually does, in complete paragraphs about topics of extreme complexity. Ramnik Arora, FTX’s head of product and another ex-Facebook engineer, remembers the meeting clearly: “We’re getting all these questions from Sequoia toward the end. He’s absolutely fantastic.” Arora locks eyes with me, and I am mesmerized. Arora is intense—calling to mind a Bollywood version of Adrian Brody. “Unbelievably fantastic,” he says, shaking his head.</p>



<p>Bailhe remembers it the same way: “We had a great meeting with Sam, but the last question, which I remember Alfred asking, was, ‘So, everything you’re building is great, but what is your long-term vision for FTX?’”</p>



<p>That’s when SBF told Sequoia about the so-called super-app: “I want FTX to be a place where you can do anything you want with your next dollar. You can buy bitcoin. You can send money in whatever currency to any friend anywhere in the world. You can buy a banana. You can do anything you want with your money from inside FTX.”</p>



<p>Suddenly, the chat window on Sequoia’s side of the Zoom lights up with partners freaking out.</p>



<p>“I LOVE THIS FOUNDER,” typed one partner.</p>



<p>“I am a 10 out of 10,” pinged another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“YES!!!” exclaimed a third.</p>



<p>What Sequoia was reacting to was the scale of SBF’s vision. It wasn’t a story about how we might use fintech in the future, or crypto, or a new kind of bank. It was a vision about the future of money itself—with a total addressable market of every person on the entire planet.</p>



<p>“I sit ten feet from him, and I walked over, thinking, Oh, shit, that was really good,” remembers Arora. “And it turns out that that fucker was playing League of Legends through the entire meeting.”</p>



<p>“We were incredibly impressed,” Bailhe says. “It was one of those your-hair-is-blown-back type of meetings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only that, Arora says, but League of Legends is the kind of multiplayer online battle arena video game where every four minutes or so of tactical maneuvering is punctuated by ten seconds of action known as a gank—gamer slang for “gang killing”—where you and your team gang up on an enemy. “There’s a fight that happens, basically,” says Arora, who was watching over SBF’s shoulder as he answered that final question from Sequoia, “and I’m like, This guy is fucking in a gank!”</p>



<p>The B round raised a billion dollars. Soon afterward came the “meme round”: $420.69 million from 69 investors.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>SBF took the money, and soon after moved FTX headquarters from Hong Kong to Nassau. Covid-19 was raging, and the city’s Beijing-inspired zero-Covid policy was making business in Hong Kong untenable. The Bahamas had more relaxed Covid rules and are only 20 minutes away by plane from the crypto industry that was starting to coalesce around Miami.</p>



<p>I fly out to see the company for myself in the spring of 2022. Walking through the terminal in Nassau, I happen to see a copy of The New York Times. The headline on the front page says it all: “As Cryptocurrencies Melt Down, $300 Billion Evaporates in Days.”</p>



<p>It’s a survey of what’s been happening in the crypto market. The price of Bitcoin had plunged to its lowest level since 2020. A so-called “stable coin” lost its peg and became worthless overnight. The price of Coinbase shares, a publicly traded rival of FTX’s, collapsed. The markets were in mayhem.</p>



<p>Next to the Times is a copy of The Nassau Guardian: Hurricane warnings, a record Omicron surge. This ought to be an interesting week, I think to myself.</p>

<p>The following Monday, I brave the flooded roads of New Providence to the FTX campus. It’s a Walmart-sized parking lot hacked out of the canebrake. FTX operations are housed in five 2,000-square-foot stucco-walled and steel-roofed pavilions: identical structures so new they look as if they’ve popped out of the parking lot like mushrooms after a rain.</p>



<p>The HQ building is distinguished by a reception desk in the microscopic lobby. The door is unlocked. There is no receptionist. I peek around the corner and into the FTX command center—29 desks in a room designed to hold 8, at most. Every desk touches two or three others. There are no aisles. To get across the room, you have to wade through (and, at times, climb over) a sea of office chairs. Walls of wide-screen monitors—two, four, even six per desk—stand in place of cubicle walls. The screens erupt like palm leaves from aluminum uprights and are oriented willy-nilly: up, down, sideways. Some screens are mounted so high they seem to hang down from the ceiling. It’s office environment as jungle, and the oddest thing about it is that no one seems to be home.</p>



<p>Then I hear a rustling. A nasal NorCal drawl rings out from the far corner of the room: “Yup… Yup… Yup…” Giggle. “Oh, totally.”</p>



<p>It’s SBF himself, working early—or late, as the case may be. I recognize the man because right beside his desk is a giant blue-velvet beanbag chair, which SBF famously uses as a napping spot during the weeks-long work binges when he doesn’t leave the office.</p>



<p>He’s on a Zoom call. And, from what I can overhear, he’s chatting with someone about acquiring shares of a competitor “How much do we have? How much can we buy? How much are we legally allowed to buy?”</p>



<p>It sounds like an important strategic conversation, and SBF’s questions come rat-a-tat with an overclocked diction I recognize from listening to too many podcasts at 2X. Yet, in the middle of it, he peers around his sheaf of liquid crystal to silently greet me with a big smile and an outstretched right hand while simultaneously making a wavy-pointy gesture with his left, which means “Have a seat over yonder.” He’s nothing if not efficient.</p>



<p>Over the next hour or so, people trickle in, and the room fills up. They’re all friendly, but also focused. They seem to be used to having a stranger in their midst. Word comes that there’s an all-hands meeting scheduled, and I’m invited. To my surprise, it turns out to be on Zoom—even though half the assembled audience is within ten feet of SBF. At the appointed hour, everyone switches on their screens and adjusts their cameras. SBF appears in the corner of the Zoom grid to talk about the situation at hand.</p>



<p>To sum up, much of the crypto world was panic-selling to try to get out ahead of the market, to make a margin call, or just out of plain old fear. And that volume hit FTX, since it’s a major exchange—the fifth-largest—in the crypto space. There’s really no good way to simulate such an event, but FTX’s trading platform held together under the strain. So SBF’s first order of business is to congratulate the dev crew for building a robust system: “Overall, I think the platform handled the crash relatively well, which is good. Thank you to everyone.”</p>



<p>There are some modest smiles in the Zoom windows, including one from Singh, FTX’s director of engineering. He knows firsthand, from his trading days at Alameda, how frustrating a rickety exchange can be. “As always, we have some changes to make going forward,” SBF says, “but nothing really huge.” The next order of business is a round of belt-tightening. “In general, money is going to be tighter for everyone in our industry and other industries too—it’s not super-crypto-specific,” SBF says. “So, if you are thinking about expenses that are, say, above $100 million, we should have a chat about that,” he continues. “That’s our new set of takeaways,” he says, wrapping up his portion of the meeting. “Oh, and yeah: Ten-second updates!”</p>



<p>With that, the floor is open. And indeed, various FTX execs take over the presenters’ mic, updating the company, in ten seconds or less, about what is going on.</p>



  FTX Stocks is now open for a private beta.  An independent FTX fan club has emerged: the FTT DAO.  Time-weighted average price functionality is being tested.  The sponsorship deals of the Met Gala and the amfAR Gala have been successful—so far.  The NBA Eastern Conference final starts tonight at the FTX Arena: the Miami Heat versus the Boston Celtics.  



<p>That last item is the only one that provokes any kind of comment from SBF: “Go, Heat!” he shouts.</p>



<p>All-hands adjourned. Total meeting time? Ten minutes.</p>



<p>I remark to the person sitting next to me that that was rather quick for an all-hands. “That was actually an unusually long one,” she says. “They’re usually five minutes.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>I’m embedded in FTX headquarters—a reporter sitting at a desk ten feet away from SBF—for a full week. I interview people, take notes, hang out, and soak up the vibe. I was expecting pandemonium in the wake of the market collapse, but the atmosphere is almost relaxed—except for the fact that SBF just keeps working and working. He’s working when people arrive. He’s working when people leave. It’s Zoom after Zoom after Zoom, and, because SBF wears a headset, he’s literally plugged into his computer all day. The only time I ever see him unplug is to collapse on that supersized beanbag chair next to his desk for a catnap.&nbsp;</p>



SBF napping in Nassau



<p></p>



<p>At first blush, the scene is classic startup—the kitchen full of snacks and soda; the free catered breakfasts, lunches, and dinners; the company bathroom stocked with everything you’d need to actually live at the office: Q-tips, disposable razors, Kotex. In keeping with the fashion aesthetic of senior management, the dress code is marketing-swag-meets-utilitarian-merch: gift-bag T-shirts featuring the FTX logo, nylon athletic shorts, white-cotton gym socks.</p>



<p>But, as the week wears on, it’s the differences that start to stand out. FTX is not your ordinary startup. Most noticeable is the average age of the employees. Among senior management, SBF himself has just turned 30; Singh is 28; Arora is the old man of the group at 35. The company is also remarkably international. You hear the rapid-fire rhythm of Mandarin as often as English, but even that lingua franca comes in a wide variety of flavors—everything from a Bahamian lilt to the broken argot of ESL.</p>



<p>I often step out of the pressure cooker of FTX HQ and into the frying pan of the company parking lot—a macadam patch that fairly sizzles under the Bahamian sun—in order to stretch my legs. I meet a bunch of FTX employees that way. They’re taking walks, too. In general, the people I meet are overworked but happy. A few are overworked and unhappy—or at least too busy to be able to enjoy their good fortune. To a person, they’re unfailingly polite and helpful. FTX has a remarkable corporate culture, and, like the fashion choices on display, that comes right from the top. There’s a guilelessness, an openness, that makes for interesting conversations.</p>



<p>Can Sun, FTX’s in-house legal counsel, tells me that his main job is to cement the many deals SBF makes on a handshake. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, Sun says, the terms favor the other side. It’s another corporate policy derived from a rigorous logical argument: In an iterated prisoner’s dilemma, the best first move is always to cooperate. And, if the counterparty defects, “it’s better that I know this guy will screw me over now,” Sun says, “rather than later.”</p>



<p>A woman who helps run marketing for FTX (and who prefers to be anonymous), briefs me on the Crypto Bahamas event that took place the previous month. Tony Blair and Bill Clinton showed up, as did Michael Lewis, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom. Her mission is to try to broaden the brand’s appeal. “When I first joined, we had endorsement deals with Tom Brady, Steph Curry, Major League Baseball—it was like a frat house,” she says. “That’s why we signed the Naomi Osaka deal.”</p>



<p>Adam Jin, who’s in charge of strategic investments for FTX, tells me about one of his favorite Web3 projects, a health app called STEPN that comes with its own crypto wallet. “Once you download the app, you go to the marketplace and buy shoes,” Jin says, showing me his shoes—virtual sneakers—on the STEPN app. Jin must sense my confusion because he continues: “You can use the app without the shoes, but having the shoes will entitle you to earn tokens by walking around.”</p>



<p>STEPN is an example of the hottest new trend in crypto: the “play-to-earn” game. With STEPN, you have to make an upfront investment. Jin’s virtual shoes cost him $800 (although he paid in Sol, the cryptocurrency associated with the Solana network.) But Jin can get a return on his shoe investment by walking: STEPN will pay him back, in crypto naturally, for every kilometer he walks in them. The exact ROI depends on the ever-fluctuating rates between Sol and the STEPN in-game currency, as well as on shoe-maintenance costs. (I’m surprised to learn that virtual shoes do wear out and have to be replaced.) But focusing on what it takes to win the game is missing the point, according to Jin. “It changed my lifestyle,” he says, noting that he’s lost all of his pandemic weight since he started using the app: “I went five kilometers on my lunch break yesterday—just running around and being healthy.”</p>



<p>I kind of get it. STEPN adds motivation, in the form of money, to the usual boatload of reasons people have for getting fit. And, for some people, that’s the motivation they need to get out there and start exercising. Is this the killer app for crypto? I’m skeptical—until, several days later, the truth finally dawns on me. It’s not just Jin: Many—perhaps most—of the FTX employees I meet while walking around the parking lot are not simply on break, stretching their legs. They’re earning crypto, through their STEPN app.</p>



<p>At first I assumed that only the financial types who work in crypto could possibly be motivated by such convoluted carrots. But the FOMO hit me at about the same time that I realized that everyone except me was wearing invisible sneakers. I find myself—a non-financial type if there ever was one—getting drawn by the funny math of play-to-earn.</p>



<p>“Adam,” I say, intercepting Jin on one of his five-kilometer lunch walks, “since the STEPN app uses the GPS on your phone to track your movement, couldn’t I just give my phone to someone else to take my walks for me?”</p>



<p>Jin catches my drift without losing his stride. “Sure! You could pay someone 20 bucks to take your phone,” he says with a cheery agreeableness I now recognize as an FTX thing. “And then you would get paid for their steps.”</p>



<p>“It could be a good arb,” I observe.</p>



<p>“I’d get more healthy that way, too,” says Jin with a chuckle.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>I clock in at FTX HQ at nine and clock out at five for most of the week—until, one day, I’m invited to live in what amounts to the FTX dorms. Many employees take advantage of subsidized corporate housing at a nearby development called Albany. The heart of the development is a yacht basin and marina surrounded by half a dozen residential towers. The area is so new that several towers are still under construction. FTX owns a passel of the multi-bedroom apartments in the towers and rents them out as crash pads to employees. There’s a collegiate feel to the whole setup. Indeed, Albany could be mistaken for an institution of higher learning: Behind the gatehouse is everything you could ever ask for on a campus—restaurants, cafés, a health club, golf and tennis facilities and, of course, classrooms.</p>



<p>And what a campus! Albany is one of the most stunningly gorgeous places I’ve ever set foot in. The boat basin is filled with superyachts, megayachts, even a glittering gigayacht or two. The apartment towers that look down at the yachts below are, if it’s even possible, more immaculate than the boats. Befitting “serious architecture,” the buildings aren’t numbered but named: Squire, Tetris, Cube, Honeycomb, Lantern, Charles, Gemini, Orchid. Each was designed by a starchitect of note: Manhattan’s Morris Adjmi, the noted postmodernist, did two. The community markets itself as a second-home destination for wealthy young people—in other words, for pro athletes and pop stars. Cardi B has a place here, as does Steph Curry. Justin Timberlake and Tiger Woods are, nominally, the developers of the property. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the Albany amenity package includes a top-notch sports-training facility (with the only cryotherapy chamber in the Bahamas), as well as a state-of-the-art recording studio.</p>



<p>I’m quartered in an FTX-owned Tetris condo for a few nights. Each of the four bedrooms has an en suite bath, its own climate control and a stout panel door with its own lock and key—features that make each of the bedrooms feel like small hotel rooms. The common area is fronted with 26-foot-high glass walls that slide away to reveal a commanding balcony, complete with a sunken infinity edge pool. The kitchen is worthy of a private chef, and fully stocked (although, from the looks of it, no one has ever cooked a meal in it.)</p>



<p>As I fry up an omelet for myself—with an egg of uncertain age—my thoughts drift until they shoal in the lee of The Great Gatsby. The peerless American novel, written a century ago, seems especially relevant to the here and now: The Roaring Twenties are back, certainly. And I’ll be damned if Albany is not West Egg. But is crypto the new jazz? And, if it is, does that make Sam Bankman-Fried the new Jay Gatsby? Both are very young; both are self-made; in inflation-adjusted dollars, both are equally wealthy; and both are enigmatic in the extreme. On the other hand, the differences between Jay Gatsby and SBF are vast. Literary types still argue about just what motivates F. Scott Fitzgerald’s most memorable character—but one thing is certain: Altruism, effective or not, is not a factor. So, while SBF may be Gatsbian in some important ways, he’s no Gatsby. Still, I wonder if there isn’t a deeper resonance. A literary type myself, as I tuck into my solo meal, I find the novel’s closing lines tiptoeing into my consciousness:</p>



<p>Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning—</p>



<p>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</p>



<p>***</p>
   



   
meanwhile, FTX is hard at work…

<p>The next day, I finally get a chance to interview Sam Bankman-Fried. We meet in a tiny conference room. I’m prepared with a mic and an MP3 recorder at the ready. SBF comes in with his laptop and opens it to start playing his new favorite computer game, Storybook Brawl, before he even sits down. It’s an obscure title, an “auto-battler”: an emerging genre that combines elements of trading card games (like Magic: The Gathering) with chesslike moves and strategy. The game was released only a few years ago by an equally obscure low-budget “indie” game company, Good Luck Games.</p>



<p>Though we’re face-to-face, SBF makes no eye contact at all—zero, not even a glance. His eyes are glued to his screen. His fingers are tapping on the keys, sometimes furiously, sometimes hardly at all. His right knee is bouncing at 100 bpm: a nervous tic, the result of a forgotten fidget spinner. The interview starts.</p>



<p>I open with a doozy: “Am I,” I ask, “talking to the world’s first trillionaire?”</p>



<p>Although it’s admittedly a stupid question, it’s not as stupid as it sounds. SBF has a net worth, as estimated by Forbes, that’s higher than the vast majority (80 percent) of the world’s billionaires—and, yet, he’s only gotten started. FTX is a company in its infancy.</p>



<p>I first tried out the trillionaire question on Michelle Bailhe, the Sequoia partner who, along with Lin, knows SBF and his company the best. “It’s a juicy question,” she said, wavering for a moment while calculating the odds. “I think he has a real chance at that.”</p>



<p>There’s no such hesitation from SBF. But he does quickly demur, making self-deprecating mouth noises questioning his own capacity to make such a pile, before he really starts to answer.</p>



<p>“Maybe let’s take a step back,” he says, only to launch into an explanation of his own, personal utility curve: “Which is to say, if you plot dollars-donated on the X axis, and Y is how-much-good-I-do-in-the-world, then what does that curve look like? It’s definitely not linear—it does tail off, but I think it tails off pretty slowly.”</p>



<p>His point seems to be that there is, out there somewhere, a diminishing return to charity. There’s a place where even effective altruism ceases to be effective. “But I think that, even at a trillion, there’s still really significant marginal utility to dollars donated.”</p>



<p>This interview has morphed into my own personal economics seminar, and Professor Bankman-Fried is my tutor. He’s as good at explaining the principles of macroeconomics as anyone out there in the world today—and I know this for a fact because I’ve subsequently watched YouTube’s best on the same subject. But SBF teaches me Macro while simultaneously playing round after round of Storybook Brawl.</p>



<p>Still, I’ve got my answer. And it turns out that I’ve aimed too low. A trillion isn’t enough money to fix the world’s problems, so SBF won’t stop at merely a trillion. It’s an answer that begs the next question, which SBF, ever helpful, has already anticipated: “So, is five trillion all you could ever use to help the world?”</p>



<p>SBF is now interviewing himself. He slows down for a moment, and I assume that’s because of the cognitive load of doing three things at once. He’s asking good questions (my job); he’s formulating answers (his job); and he’s playing Storybook Brawl (no one’s job). But then I hear the tap-tap-tapping from his fingers start to accelerate, and I realize he’s not slowing down under the load at all. Just the opposite, in fact: This guy is in the Storybook Brawl equivalent of a gank!</p>



<p>And, just like that, he’s back with an answer to his own question: “Okay, at that scale, I think the answer might be yes. Because, if your spending is on the scale of the U.S. government, it might have too weird and distortionary an impact on things.”</p>



<p>Now that we’ve explored the far end of SBF’s utility curve, the seminar moves to a discussion of discount rates. “The world is decaying at—we’re all making it up—but, say, 5 percent a year as a minimum bound,” he says. “And compare that to the effective interest rate which I’m working under—which you can think of as the rate we can turn more capital into more capital—which is more like 20 percent a year,” he continues, “and that’s likely true for a while, so it makes sense for me to keep working.”</p>



<p>All this is still with not even a glance at me—his true focus is on the screen. He’s playing the video game. But, to be fair, perhaps “playing” is the wrong word here. Perhaps he was play-testing: looking for ways to incorporate crypto into his favorite game because, unbeknownst to me at the time, as we were talking, Good Luck, the indie game company behind Storybook Brawl, was being absorbed into the FTX empire—the latest in a string of FTX acquisitions.</p>



<p>“But that doesn’t mean we can’t also be giving during that time,” he continues. “And we are starting to scale that up.”</p>



<p>This strikes me as typical SBF understatement. The scale of his giving, even now, before he has really started to divest, is massive. Alameda Research, the company that generated the FTX grubstake, still exists, and its purpose seems to be to generate profits—on the order of $100 million a year today, but potentially up to a billion—that can be stuffed into the brand-new FTX Foundation. Similarly, even now, 1 percent of net FTX fees are donated to that same foundation, and FTX handles nearly $5 billion dollars’ worth of trades per day. The foundation, in turn, gives to a diversified group of EA-approved charities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you might expect, having read this far, there’s a reason for doling out some cash now instead of doubling down in the expectation of giving more later, and the reason hinges on math. Simply put, there are aspects of the world, as SBF sees it, that are decaying faster than 20 percent a year—and, so, money spent now will be more effective at making the world a better place than money spent later. “I think there are some things that are pretty urgent,” SBF says. “There’s just a long series of crucial considerations, and all of them matter a lot—and you can’t fuck any of them up, or you miss most of the total value that you could ever get.”</p>



<p>To be clear, SBF is not talking about maximizing the total value of FTX—he’s talking about maximizing the total value of the universe. And his units are not dollars: In a kind of GDP for the universe, his units are the units of a utilitarian. He’s maximizing utils, units of happiness. And not just for every living soul, but also every soul—human and animal—that will ever live in the future. Maximizing the total happiness of the future—that’s SBF’s ultimate goal. FTX is just a means to that end.</p>



<p>But, back to the now-things you can’t fuck up—the tipping points. SBF ticks off his list:</p>



  “When we build super-powerful AI, it’s likely to be one of the points where, all of a sudden, what we do will matter a lot.”  “We should start thinking about how to prepare for the next pandemic now, before it comes—because, at some point, it’s just going to come.”  “I think we might be at a tipping point right now for U.S. politics. It matters a lot what we do over the next, say, two to ten years. Right?”  



<p>And, indeed, SBF puts his money where his mouth is. SBF is personally backing a slew of so-called AI alignment nonprofits and public-benefit corporations including Anthropic and Conjecture. He’s also the big money behind a new nonprofit called Guarding Against Pandemics, which, not coincidentally, is run by his brother Gabe. And SBF was the second-largest donor—behind only Mike Bloomberg—for Biden’s successful attempt to dethrone Trump.</p>



<p>With SBF doing the hard work of interviewing himself, I’m free to think. And, finally, just as the clock is running out on my allotted hour, I ask what might be the first non-stupid question of the entire interview.</p>



<p>“So,” I summarize, “you are young and vital and peaking at precisely the point where the world is at, as you see it, peak crisis.” SBF nods in agreement, deep in another round of Storybook Brawl. “Does that strike you as just a lucky coincidence, or does that strike you as perhaps a signal that your thinking is flawed and you have a savior complex?”</p>



<p>“It’s an interesting question,” he says, stalling.</p>



<p>I double down: “You just happen to be alive in the most important time in the history of the future race. The existential point! Really?”</p>



<p>SBF hedges: “It certainly would not be one’s prior—at least, not naively.”</p>



<p>“Prior”—that’s a term of art. There’s more math to explain (in this case, Bayes’ theorem), but in the interest of you, dear reader, I will skip it.</p>



<p>“But,” SBF continues, “if you want to really needle on that, there are some anthropic considerations by which that might not be as crazy as it sounds.” With the mention of “anthropic” we’ve reached conversational escape velocity and head into the nosebleed regions of modern metaphysics. Again, I’ll spare you the trouble. Suffice it to say that, while SBF is willing to consider the idea that he might be delusional, as a kind of thought experiment, he ultimately dismisses it.</p>



<p>Game over.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>After my interview with SBF, I was convinced: I was talking to a future trillionaire. Whatever mojo he worked on the partners at Sequoia—who fell for him after one Zoom—had worked on me, too. For me, it was simply a gut feeling. I’ve been talking to founders and doing deep dives into technology companies for decades. It’s been my entire professional life as a writer. And because of that experience, there must be a pattern-matching algorithm churning away somewhere in my subconscious. I don’t know how I know, I just do. SBF is a winner.</p>



<p>But that wasn’t even the main thing. There was something else I felt: something in my heart, not just my gut. After sitting ten feet from him for most of the week, studying him in the human musk of the startup grind and chatting in between beanbag naps, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this guy is actually as selfless as he claims to be.</p>



<p>So I find myself convinced that, if SBF can keep his wits about him in the years ahead, he’s going to slay—that, just as Alameda was a stepping stone to FTX, FTX will be to the super-app. Banking will be disrupted and transformed by crypto, just as media was transformed and disrupted by the web. Something of the sort must happen eventually, as the current system, with its layers upon layers of intermediaries, is antiquated and prone to crashing—the global financial crisis of 2008 was just the latest in a long line of failures that occurred because banks didn’t actually know what was on their balance sheets. Crypto is money that can audit itself, no accountant or bookkeeper needed, and thus a financial system with the blockchain built in can, in theory, cut out most of the financial middlemen, to the advantage of all. Of course, that’s the pitch of every crypto company out there. The FTX competitive advantage? Ethical behavior. SBF is a Peter Singer–inspired utilitarian in a sea of Robert Nozick–inspired libertarians. He’s an ethical maximalist in an industry that’s overwhelmingly populated with ethical minimalists. I’m a Nozick man myself, but I know who I’d rather trust my money with: SBF, hands-down. And if he does end up saving the world as a side effect of being my banker, all the better.</p>

<p>As the success of FTX seems like a foregone conclusion, my interest gravitates to SBF the person. He’s like no other billionaire I’ve ever met, and I’ve hung out with quite a few. It’s like the brain of Spock has been transplanted into the shambolic body of Fozzie Bear. He’s a bit of both: instantly lovable—with the guilelessness, kindness, and openness of a Muppet—and so abstract that he seems more like a super-advanced AI than flesh and blood. I want to know what makes SBF so unusual, so, as we both pack up in the conference room (me coiling up the long cord that leads to my lapel mic, him folding up his laptop), I decide to just ask him about his evident weirdness directly.</p>



<p>“So, you are obviously what they call ‘neurodiverse,’ but you are not spectrum-y or Asperger-y,” I observe.</p>



<p>“No,” he agrees.</p>



<p>“So—what’s your diagnosis, doctor?”</p>



<p>“There’s certainly some ADD there. I get distracted very easily if something is not engaging enough. And, so, I find myself doing things to occupy myself.”</p>



<p>It makes sense, yet it doesn’t—so I follow up with another question.</p>



<p>“I grew up kind of like you”—SBF and I went to rival high schools in Silicon Valley, albeit decades apart—“and while there were a lot of rich fuckups in high school, there were a lot of really smart kids, too. And, yet, no one was ever like this. ADD wasn’t a thing. But now it’s everywhere. What is your theory of why?”</p>



<p>“Part of it’s probably social media retraining our brains how to think and act,” he says. “But I think that some amount of boredom with things that are dumb or not productive or not very useful is healthy. And, along with this sort of move toward lower attention spans, people just become more productive. And that is important and good.”</p>



<p>I nod. Certainly that’s true in the case of FTX, I think, remembering the ten-minute all-hands meeting.</p>



<p>Sensing an opportunity for connection, I chip in with my own two satoshi: “I don’t pay any attention to social media—not because I have any moral case against it,” I say, “but because, for me, reading books is the highest-bandwidth way I know to get quality information into my brain, which just craves the stimulation. I’m addicted to reading, which explains how I ended up being a writer.”</p>



<p>“Oh, yeah?” says SBF. “I would never read a book.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m not sure what to say. I’ve read a book a week for my entire adult life and have written three of my own.</p>



<p>“I’m very skeptical of books. I don’t want to say no book is ever worth reading, but I actually do believe something pretty close to that,” explains SBF. “I think, if you wrote a book, you fucked up, and it should have been a six-paragraph blog post.”</p>



<p>So there you have it: Books are for losers.</p>



<p>Does he really believe it? Do I believe it? Is the price of SBF’s genius boredom in the face of literature, literary nonfiction—books in general?</p>



<p>Whatever the case, I find myself sad for the man. And it occurs to me that my reaction is exactly what might be expected from a beta in the brave new world crypto is creating.</p>



<p>So, I think again. What, I wonder, does he think I think? Wouldn’t someone with IQ points to spare realize that dismissing books—all books—as essentially worthless might rile a writer? Was he playing with me? Is this fun? Is this humor?</p>



<p>I’m satisfied with my meta-analysis until I realize that one can always increment the level of strategic play in this sort of game. It’s like poker. Level one is just thinking about how to strengthen your own hand. Level two is thinking about what your opponent’s hand is. Level three is thinking about what your opponent thinks your hand is. And so on. And, since SBF is obviously a genius, I should simply assume that, compared with me, SBF will always be playing at level N+1. Which makes my analysis of the intent behind SBF’s “books are for losers” idea spiral into infinity and crash, like a computer program stuck in a loop.</p>



<p>That evening, I spend some time sitting on a beautiful Bahamian beach, watching the sun set and interrogating my own confused thoughts and feelings. The answer comes to me like the final reel of a so-bad-it’s-good apocalyptic teen comedy from the ’80s:</p>



<p>GREETINGS PROFESSOR FALKEN</p>



<p>HELLO</p>



<p>A STRANGE GAME.</p>



<p>THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Near the end of a long week, I notice a party shaping up in Building 30, on the edge of FTX’s little corporate compound. I’m curious because even though Building 30 is kitted out as a lounge—filled with couches and big tables and board games—I’d never seen anyone actually lounging inside. I decide to check it out.</p>



<p>A cocktail party is in full swing, with about a dozen people I don’t recognize standing around. It turns out to be a mixer for the local EA community that’s been drawn to Nassau in the hopes that the FTX Foundation will fund its various altruistic ideas. The point of the party is to provide a friendly forum for the EAs who actually run EA-aligned nonprofits to meet the earn-to-give EAs at FTX who will fund them, and vice versa. The irony is that, while FTX hosts the weekly mixer—providing the venue and the beverages—it’s rare for an actual FTX employee to ever show up and mix. Presumably, they’re working too hard.</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s the beer, but everyone I meet is smart, charismatic and funny. I end up mostly talking to Josh Morrison and Kat Woods, two OGs in the EA movement. Morrison is a serial nonprofit founder. Woods has a similar CV, but now she runs a meta-charity that incubates other charities. They tag-team as they try to explain the movement that drives them—and what drives them to the movement.</p>



<p>“Imagine nerds invented a religion or something,” says Woods, stabbing at my question with vigor, “where people get to argue all day.”</p>



<p>“It’s… an ideology,” counters Morrison. The argument has begun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Woods amiably disagrees: “EA is not an ideology, it’s a question: ‘How do I do the most good?’ And the cool thing about EA, compared to other cause areas, is that you can change your views constantly—and still be part of the movement.”</p>



<p>I can’t help but interrupt. I get the religion part. Morrison and Woods are nothing if not evangelists. But why nerds?</p>



<p>Woods serves up an answer to my question. (Fittingly, she’s wearing tennis whites.) “EA attracts people who really care, but who are also really smart,” she says. “If you are altruistic but not very smart, you just bounce off. And if you’re smart but not very altruistic,” she continues, “you can get nerd sniped!”</p>



<p>Nerd sniped? This is a new one to me. I’m intrigued.</p>



<p>“You can snipe a nerd by putting out an interesting puzzle in front of them, and they’re like, ’I love this,’ because not only is EA the most interesting puzzle in the world,” Woods says, “it’s also the most meaningful.”</p>



<p>Nerd sniping, I learn, is the practice of attracting brainpower by presenting problems as puzzles.</p>



<p>“This ties into the way FTX is doing its foundation,” Morrison says, helpfully knocking the ball back to my true interest. “The foundation wants to get a lot of money out there in order to try a lot of things quickly. And how can you do that effectively?” It’s a rhetorical question, a move worthy of a preppy debate champ who went to a certain finishing school in Cambridge—which is exactly what Morrison is. “Part of the answer is to give money to someone in the EA community.”</p>



<p>“Because EA is different from other communities,” Woods continues, picking up right where Morrison left off. “They’re like, ‘This is the ethical thing, and this is the truth.’ And we’re like, ‘What is the ethical thing? What is the truth?’”</p>



<p>Those are big questions, and I’ll leave them to SBF and his fellow travelers to answer—they’re too big for me. I resist the temptation to be nerd sniped. Besides, I have a different set of questions:</p>



<p>Who is SBF? And what is he made of?</p>



<p>Those are the questions that brought me to the Bahamas. And meeting him in person only deepened the mystery.</p>



<p>What makes him so different from anyone else I’ve ever met?</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>There’s no question that SBF was nerd sniped as a young man at MIT. Indeed, just before he got sniped, SBF had a personal blog where he wrote about his search for life’s meaning. In the blog, he declares his allegiance to utilitarianism over and over, carefully outlining his reasoning before concluding, “And so I am a total utilitarian.” Later writings refine that statement, making it clear that he’s a utilitarian in its purest—Benthamite—form, and that there will be no saving himself from the implications of the Benthamite Way. Every action since then has been a principled puzzling-through of the implications of that philosophy. Even now, even when directly challenged, SBF maintains that he brooks no limit in following the philosophical implications to their logical end: “If I did, I would want to have a long, hard look at myself.”</p>



<p>So when, that next summer, MacAskill sat with SBF in Harvard Square and carefully explained, in the way only an Oxford-educated philosopher can, that the practice of effective altruism boils down to “applied utilitarianism,” Snipe’s arrow hit SBF hard. He’d found his path. He would become a maximization engine. As he wrote in his blog, “If you’ve decided that some of your time—or money—can be better spent on others than on yourself, well, then, why not more of it? Why not all of it?”</p>



<p>Why not all of it, indeed: SBF was under my microscope for a full week. There was never a moment when he wasn’t actively involved in some sort of important meeting—with a key employee, a regulator, a business partner, a mentor—charting the future of FTX. I’ve seen SBF’s own parents queue for a moment of his time, only to give up because the wait was too long.</p>



<p>In devoting every waking moment of his life to work, SBF doesn’t feel he’s doing anything unusual or extraordinary. He’s doing what he feels every right-minded person should do—if they were big-hearted and clear-headed. He’s attempting to maximize the amount of good in the world. Yet the same could be said of Woods and Morrison and, indeed, of all the EAs I’ve met in the Bahamas. Like SBF, they’re all in love with the idea of saving the world in an efficient and rational manner —except they’re obviously having a great time doing it. As one of them said to me, “I came for the cause, I stayed for the people.” SBF, on the other hand, seems qualitatively different: He seems utterly driven, as if by a lash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s hard to see SBF in a clear light. The glitter of the self-made billions are blinding. His intellect is as awesome as it is intimidating. But, once I’d hacked past the piles of money and the IQ points to spare, I found something unexpected: impoverishment. In spending everything he has on others, SBF spends nothing, it would seem, pursuing his own pleasure.</p>



<p>It’s not just that great books aren’t worthwhile. The great movies aren’t worth watching. Citizen Kane, he asserts, is “an unwatchably empty film.” Food gets the same treatment. SBF favors bogus burgers and vegan fries. As for fine dining, he’s never seen the point: “I really don’t think of meals as that memorable.” There’s no pleasure taken in his own presentation—his affect—either. He didn’t own a suit until he had to buy one to testify before Congress. He drives a Corolla. He’s publicly sworn off ever owning a yacht. As for the more carnal pleasures (presumably SBF has a private life), he’s so private that even his own parents don’t even know who—or if—he’s dating. It’s a mystery.</p>



<p>SBF’s rejection of pleasure is so profound it got me wondering if that absence of pleasure—as opposed to his philosophy—was the key to understanding him. Is he so deep in his head that he’s incapable of feeling pleasure? Is SBF effectively being held hostage by his own frontal cortex, caught in a Stockholm syndrome of the mind? Or is he just anhedonic—at the sharp end of the normal human capacity-for-pleasure distribution? Is that what made SBF feel so different, so alien?</p>



<p>I don’t know. But I did ask the people closest to him.</p>



<p>Ramnik Arora is the closest thing to a number two that SBF has: they’ve worked side by side for years. “Do you think,” I ask Arora in a candid moment over lunch one day, “that SBF might actually be incapable of experiencing pleasure?”</p>



<p>Arora puts down his fork and thinks for a moment. “It’s a fair question,” he says, turning it over. “He’s happy playing games,” Arora says after a long pause, remembering a company padel tennis tournament a few weeks before. How did he do? I wonder. “Sam came in second,” Arora reports. “He hated that.”</p>



<p>Joe Bankman is a prominent tax lawyer who also happens to be a psychologist and therapist. He’s also SBF’s dad, and he’s very close to his son. I ask him about SBF’s capacity to experience pleasure.</p>



<p>Bankman rejects my theory, but not completely. “So, Sam doesn’t take pleasure in the things some other people take pleasure in,” Bankman concedes. “But I think Sam gets a lot of pleasure out of a lot of things—they’re just all work-related.” I push back. Satisfaction doesn’t count, I say. By “pleasure,” I mean something more primitive and hardwired: fleshly desires. “He wasn’t always vegan,” offers Bankman, “He loved a good steak as a kid, for example.”</p>



<p>Arguably, the person who knows SBF the best is George Lerner, the FTX company therapist. Lerner’s psychological services are available to everyone in the company, and he’s on speed dial for more than a few. Lerner strikes me as an excellent shrink, the kind I’d want in my head, so I ask him about SBF’s seeming rejection of earthly pleasures.</p>



<p>“It’s interesting,” Lerner says, “because I’ve spoken to Sam at length about this particular topic.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not some pathological thing,” he continues. “For some bizarre reason—and I don’t get it—they want to help.” We’re talking about EAs in general, but also about SBF in particular. “They want to make a difference, and they want to devote their lives to doing that,” says Lerner, who is definitely not an EA. “But that still doesn’t clarify why, or if, that somehow diminishes the pleasure drive.”</p>



<p>SBF is a mystery even to his own therapist.</p>

<p>It’s my last night in the Bahamas, and I spend it in Tetris, relaxing by the pool at the edge of the terrace, far above the marina below. The sun starts to set: a fiery ingot of gold, subsumed by the onrushing lip of the world. And as it does, my gaze is drawn to the tower closest to the water. Orchid is Albany’s flagship building, and its southern tip cuts toward the sandy beachfront like the prow of a ship through a wine-dark sea. Wraparound verandas provide views of both the harbor and the ocean. It’s a six-story layer cake, the entire mass wrapped with aluminum latticework, a sheath of laser-cut filigree, a historic facade but a modern building. The architect, Morris Adjmi, cites his upbringing in New Orleans, as well as sculptors like Rachel Whiteread and Do Ho Suh, as inspiration. The overall effect is nothing less than spectacular: a contemporary take on creole style.</p>



<p>The penthouse atop Orchid—Apartment V—is likely the most expensive condo in all of the Bahamas, and it’s the home of Sam Bankman-Fried. He lives there* with nine roommates: fellow travelers in the EA movement. It’s a dorm situation—but, to paraphrase Scott Fitzgerald, a billionaire’s dorm is different from the ones familiar to you and me. V is palatial—11,500 square feet—with six bedrooms and spectacular views out every window. Two elevators service the apartment, opening directly into the space. Every bedroom has an en suite bath and opens directly onto the veranda. The common areas include the lobby, media room, dining room and a party room at the tip of the building: Curved glass walls slide away, opening up the entire space to the world outside.</p>



<p>After the sun sinks below the horizon, Apartment V lights up. Dramatic wash lighting bathes the veranda in blues and purples. The wraparound porch becomes a rainbow, a beacon. A party is under way, and the entire penthouse glimmers.</p>



<p>I imagine the scene. Board games. Laughter. An intimate crew. It’s just SBF, his family (his mother, father and brother are all in town) and close friends. A small team dedicated to fixing the world—via the magic of quantitative reasoning and the overwhelming force of goodwill. All of them are united by the mission.</p>



<p>It’s odd: the roommates, the dormlike life at the age of 30—an age when many have married, bought houses, had children. But I also think that I’ve tunneled far enough into SBF’s head to understand it. I, like Fitzgerald, do think the very rich are different. Yes, because they have more money. But also, pace Hemingway, because they often have fewer friends. It’s not worth the salt in one’s tears to be sad for the plight of the oligarchy—but there is a downside to billions. Reciprocity becomes difficult between the post-economic and the merely civilian. What do you give a man who has everything and wants for nothing? What do you expect to get?</p>



<p>But within the inner circle at Apartment V—a community of family and friends united by a philosophy that’s almost Pythagorean in its rule—there’s no unit of account. Love is the currency. Love is infinite. And infinity is a problem.</p>



<p>I’ll leave it to SBF to unpack the math: “As soon as you say, ‘What are the odds that there’s a way to be infinitely happy? What if infinite utility is a possibility?’” he explains, “now, all of a sudden, we’re comparing hierarchies of infinity. Linearity breaks down.”</p>



<p>But infinity is also the solution, because it provides a shield from the spartan logic of utilitarianism. There’s no way to do an expected value calculation when one of the terms is infinite. The very incalculability of the love that exists in Apartment V makes it the one refuge from the whip that drives him. SBF can escape, if only for an evening. He can ditch the beanbag for an actual bed and fall blissfully asleep in the lap of superluxury.</p>



<p>Before I retreat to my own cloud nine, I take a long last look at Orchid’s Apartment V. A figure emerges and stands at the rail on the deck regarding the silver pepper of stars in the balmy Bahamian night. He stretches out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling.</p>



<p>Yet again, I’m reminded of a certain novel. In Fitzgerald’s day, there was the real-life character of John Pierpont Morgan, who steered the nation as it made the transition from the 19th to the 20th centuries—the transition from an agricultural economy, powered by horses, to an industrial economy, run on rails. Who is going to do the same for us, in this new century?</p>



<p>Awakening from my reverie, I look back at Orchid for the last time. The figure I saw had gone, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.</p>



<p>*&nbsp; SBF has since moved on, and currently lives without roommates.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Zcash Foundation SHOULD endeavor to use the Community Advisory Panel (or successor mechanism) as advisory input for future board elections.</p>— <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014">ZIP 1014</a></blockquote>



<p>The Zcash Foundation is governed by a six-person board of directors, consisting of five independent directors, and the executive director. While the board is self-electing, it seeks input from the Zcash community (represented by an advisory poll of ZCAP) regarding who should be elected to the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we announced during Zcon3, two of the Zcash Foundation (ZF) board members’ terms are expiring this year (Amber Baldet and Ian Miers). Concurrently, we are formalizing and expanding the ZF’s Technical Advisory Board, which has, to date, been an informal group, consisting of Andrew Miller, Ian Miers, and Matthew Green.</p>



<p>Ian Miers will not be seeking re-appointment, and Matthew Green will be resigning his seat on the ZF board. However, both will continue to contribute to the ZF mission as members of the Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the interest of continuity, and in recognition of her excellent advice and guidance, the board intends to re-appoint Amber. Additionally, the board intends to appoint a new board member who has appropriate expertise and experience that is relevant to ZF at this point in its growth and evolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the recommendation of ZIP 1014, we will be soliciting nominations from the community, and consulting ZCAP regarding who should be appointed to the remaining seat.</p>



<p>We invite members of the Zcash community to nominate people they believe would be good candidates for the ZF board. Nominations should be made on the Zcash Community Forums, under the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/25">Governance category</a>, in the form of a new topic titled “X for the ZF Board”. People may nominate themselves.</p>



<p>Nominees must explicitly accept the nomination, and should post some information about themselves, and why they would be a good board member.</p>



<p>Community nominations must be submitted by 23:59 UTC on Monday 17th October 2022.</p>



<p>We plan to host one or more community calls, during which nominees can introduce themselves to the Zcash community, and answer questions from the community. If there are a large number of nominees, we may hold an initial “filtering” poll of ZCAP before these community calls, to reduce the field to a manageable number.</p>



<p>In due course, we will conduct an advisory poll of ZCAP, and the Board will take the results of that poll into account when deciding who to appoint to the board.&nbsp;</p>



 Being on the Zcash Foundation Board: Duties and Expectations 



<p>Members of the ZF board share fiduciary responsibility for ZF, acting as trustees of its assets, and ensuring that ZF is well-managed, and remains financially sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In practise, these responsibilities can be summarized as:</p>



  hiring, firing and supervising the Executive Director (ED),&nbsp;  providing guidance and advice to the ED, and  having bold visions about the Foundation’s mission and future, and working with the ED to assist him execute on them.  



<p></p>



<p>Membership of the ZF Board is an unpaid position, as is the norm for 501(c)(3) boards. The expected time commitment is one 60-90 minute meeting (conducted by video call) each month, with occasional additional meetings, and sporadic email and Signal communication. Board members are also expected to attend our annual conference (Zcon), for which their expenses are covered by ZF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Board members must not be anonymous or pseudonymous. They are required to undergo the Foundation’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest declaration, and their name will be published as part of the ZF Form 990.

<p>Consensus, execution, data availability, and settlement are said to be the four primary functions of a blockchain network. When a blockchain network executes all four of these functionalities in its base layer, it’s called a monolithic blockchain. Whereas, if a blockchain network handles only a few out of the four functionalities at the base layer while outsourcing the rest of its functionalities to other layers, it’s called a modular blockchain. <br></p><p>The pace of innovation in the blockchain scene makes it hard enough to keep track of developments. Despite its importance and relative novelty, the topic of the design of blockchains and their consensus mechanisms often lies behind the scenes. However, the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">transition</a> of the Ethereum network from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm put it right back on the map.<br></p><p>In this article, we’ll dive into modular vs. monolithic blockchains, the difference between these two blockchain architectures, how they work, and lastly, their benefits and tradeoffs.<br></p> The blockchain scalability trilemma<br> Tradeoffs of a monolithic blockchain architecture among the three core properties. (<a href="https://bitscrunch.com/blogs/modular-vs-monolithic-blockchain">Source</a>)<p>First of all, let’s have a look at the need for different blockchain architectures, such as modular and monolithic, a story that starts with the blockchain scalability trilemma. This trilemma points out that blockchains in the way we often think about them can only meet two out of the following three properties:<br></p><p> 1. &nbsp;Security<br></p><p>Security refers to the capacity of the network to survive an attack. This precept is a middle tenet of blockchains (no chain would advertise itself as unsafe!) and ought to in no way be compromised, so the real tradeoff is usually among scalability and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a>.<br></p><p> 2. &nbsp;Decentralization<br></p><p>Decentralization in the context of blockchain systems points to the level to which a single user (or entity, or group) can take over the network and enforce their will. For a blockchain to be decentralized, hardware necessities ought not to be a hindrance to participation, and the resource necessities of verifying the network need to be low. <br></p><p> 3. &nbsp;Scalability<br></p><p>Scalability refers to the potential of a blockchain to handle an increasing amount of transactions while keeping resource necessities for verification low. Even if you increase the block size and the potential of transactions that may be covered in a block, sadly, larger block sizes result in the centralization of the community as the hardware requirements of jogging complete <a href="https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/blockchain-nodes/">nodes</a> will increase in response to the need for better computational output. Scalability is often measured in how fast a network can process transactions while keeping costs low.<br></p><p>Now, <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html">scalability</a> has been a major challenge for blockchain systems. In essence, it’s practically impossible to optimize a single-layer monolithic blockchain network for all three core properties. The idea of using multiple layers instead of a single base layer to execute all four functions (consensus, execution, data availability, and settlement) emerged in answer to this. <br></p><p>Instead of optimizing for all three properties on a single layer, some proposed to design a system that optimized for one or two properties on one layer and optimized for the third property on another layer. This gave origin to the concept of monolithic vs. modular blockchains.</p> What is a monolithic blockchain? <p>In a monolithic blockchain, all key features or responsibilities of a blockchain system are addressed internally. A monolithic blockchain, in its base consensus layer, undertakes key features such as data availability, settlement, and execution. Usually, settlement and execution are tied together. <br></p><p>Every single task is carried out within a specific (limited) space, from data availability to transaction execution. Bitcoin and Ethereum (without considering layer-2 or rollups) can be said to be the two most prominent examples of monolithic blockchain architectures.<br></p><p>A monolithic blockchain is, therefore, a blockchain that possesses nodes for data availability, transaction execution, and <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/">consensus</a>, all within a block. Let’s examine this architecture design along with some key features of a monolithic blockchain design.<br></p> Data availability <p>A monolithic blockchain usually has many transactions in the same block for high throughput and the expansion of block space. Once node service providers do not have the required storage space, a monolithic blockchain is designed to cut them off the network.</p> Execution <p>With a monolithic blockchain, it is very easy to bypass transactions with fewer nodes when all of them arrive at a consensus, as opposed to passing them to several random nodes in the network. <br></p><p>The higher the number of transaction validators made available within the system, the longer its transaction validation time is. However, the number of nodes in the network may be reduced to enhance throughput or the number of transactions carried out each second.</p> Consensus <p>In monolithic chains, consensus is achieved by nodes agreeing on what transactions to be processed for new blocks, including the order of transactions. This establishes a common state of the network at any given point in time.</p> Settlement <p>This characteristic of the monolithic blockchain guarantees the commitment of transactions to the chain’s history to guarantee the integrity of each block. In a proof-of-work blockchain, miner energy is expended on new blocks, while validators are needed in the case of a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">proof-of-stake</a> blockchain. <br></p> Benefits and drawbacks of monolithic chains <p>Let’s have a look at the benefits and drawbacks of monolithic chains.</p> Benefits  Protection/Security <p>Monolithic blockchains can put secure transactions in force on their own nodes. The nodes see transactions achieved on the blockchain and validate them after confirming a consensus. This additionally solves data issues when the blockchain data is saved in many nodes. <br></p> Usage <p>A monolithic blockchain can offer extra value in the long run, provided users continue to use the token. They are easy to recognize and relatively simpler to implement and design.</p> Drawbacks<br> <p>Some of the major disadvantages of using a monolithic blockchain include:<br></p>  Nodes on a monolithic chain may occasionally require re-executed transactions for verification of validity, leading to delays.<br>  Node source limits, including bandwidth and storage, can affect blockchain efficiency.<br>  They are inflexible in comparison to modular blockchains, affecting production quality. They do not allow for an outsourcing function even when there is downtime resulting from overload.<br>  If big block sizes are applied, high throughput becomes a trade-off for high hardware costs, decreasing the variety of validators on the chain. This will cause <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/why-centralized-crypto-mining-growing-problem/">centralization</a> (a great risk for most chains under this setting), considering that blockchain validation powers stay within the arms of a few users.<br>  When transactions are stored on chains, this can cause the exponential growth of the blockchain size in time, resulting in heavy hardware requirements on nodes besides disrupting the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364/">decentralization</a> function.<br>   What is a modular blockchain?<br> <p>As we established above, if you try to run all four functionalities (consensus, execution, data availability, and settlement) at a chain’s base layer, this ultimately limits the system's capacity and, subsequently, its total throughput. A modular chain separates the system into several possible parts or additives that are independently developed. <br></p><p>In a modular blockchain structure, the execution layer is independent of the bottom consensus and data availability layers, permitting nodes to execute transactions separately rather than performing all the transactions to test validity within a limited space or block. Cosmos and Celestia can be said to be the most prominent examples of modular blockchain architectures.<br></p>The transition from a monolithic to a modular structure. (<a href="https://celestia.org/learn/basics-of-modular-blockchains/">Source</a>)<p>Let’s examine the architecture design and some of the key features of a modular blockchain design. In modular chains, three core layers work independently to make its output easier and quicker:</p> Consensus layer <p>The consensus layer establishes the set of guidelines to be observed through nodes for verifying and validating blocks and reaching consensus. This ensures that there is an agreement among all of the nodes connected with the installed blocks and transactions, thereby guaranteeing true security and decentralization.</p> Data availability layer <p>The data availability layer manages the on-chain and stale-chain blockchain records, making sure that records are available and public for everybody to look at. Numerous blockchain tasks, including <a href="https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-avail-launches-on-testnet-to-turn-monolithic-chains-modular/">Polygon Avail</a>, are presenting data availability solutions to convert conventional (monolithic) blockchain designs to modular ones.<br></p>Polygon’s Avail allows developers to turn monolithic chains into modular ones. Execution layer <p>The execution layer executes all of the transactions to supply top-rated records, which are then saved on the blockchain network.<br></p> Further breakdown of a modular blockchain <p>Modular blockchains consist of layers designed for a particular action. There is a division of labor for better results. Consequently, the main advantage of a modular blockchain is fixing the “scalability trilemma,” a major challenge with blockchain technology:</p> Scalability <p>Modular blockchains allow for decentralization, protection, and scalability. Within the real world, this translates into users being able to avoid <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">Bitcoin’s</a> long confirmation time or high Ethereum gas fees, for example. <br></p><p>Assigning each layer or section a single mission or task ensures security, speed, and efficiency.<br></p> Decentralization <p>Despite a modular blockchain being split into distinctive layers, it nevertheless ensures consensus and, as a result, security. No single server can solely manipulate the network even if overloaded. <br></p><p>Social consensus is used to make even essential selections regarding transactions, helping to grow an absolutely decentralized platform.</p> Efficiency <p>A developer can introduce Layer-2 answers to resolve the blockchain’s hassle. As an instance, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">Optimism &amp; ZK rollups</a> for Ethereum make use of robust security while lowering its fee and latency.<br></p> Different use cases for the modular blockchain architecture<br> <p>In a modular blockchain, every project is handled by a separate group of layers which might be closely-associated chains working at the identical layer. For example, each <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/dev-foundations/application-specific-blockchains">app-chain</a> in the Cosmos network leverages the read-made modules provided by the Cosmos Stack. The Cosmos Stack includes <a href="https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/tendermint/">Tendermint Core</a>, a pre-constructed consensus engine, <a href="https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk">Cosmos SDK</a>, a software development kit, and <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/deep-dive-how-will-ibc-create-value-for-the-cosmos-hub-eedefb83c7a0">IBC</a>, a network communication protocol. This enables developers to use these modules and easily build an application-specific chain in a modular-blockchain ecosystem.<br></p><p>The network of interconnected blockchains handles each transaction just like a typical blockchain would. Transactions are verified and delivered to the main (base) pool or dropped. <br></p><p>A miner/validator can broadcast a block to peers if they are successful in locating the unique identification for the candidate block as required through the proof-of-work/proof-of-stake requirements. Once all transactions are confirmed as authentic via the various nodes, the brand new block is added to the chain. Different miners retain this technique, steadily lengthening the chain by adding new blocks on top of the ones which have already been mined.<br></p> Benefits and drawbacks of a modular blockchain<br>  Benefits <p>The most noticeable benefits of the modular blockchain include scalability, ease of design, and flexibility.</p> Scalability <p>A monolithic blockchain allows a user to have all the expected functions of the blockchain in just a single layer called “<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-layer-1-in-blockchain">Layer-1</a>”. This makes blockchain creation uneasy to achieve because it tries to deal with all functions at a time within a single layer. With a modular blockchain, the functions are shared among different layers, improving scalability and preventing possible network disruption.<br></p> Blockchain Creation <p>To launch a brand new blockchain, miners must face several issues related to security and decentralization, which may equally prevent some from optimizing the out-of-network <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/">hash</a> rate (opportunity). <br></p><p>When miners concentrate less on particular functions like consensus, it gives them the ability to leverage the layout and create new blockchains more quickly, regardless of the blockchain architecture.</p> Flexibility <p>In comparison to the monolithic blockchain, the modular blockchain layout is significantly more flexible. It is designed to provide miners with features they cannot find in the monolithic blockchain. <br></p><p>Every blockchain in cryptocurrency shares a few simple characteristics, like ensuring data availability, security, consensus, and transaction execution. Typically, blockchains manage this kind of function at the identical layer. Modular blockchains ensure more efficiency by offloading work to other layers.</p> Drawbacks <p>Even though modular blockchains solve various issues where monolithic blockchain lags behind, modular architecture comes with its own set of drawbacks. These are:<br></p> Security <p>Unlike monolithic blockchains, which execute each blockchain function in a single layer, modular chains may lack protection-related characteristics.</p> Complexity <p>It is often difficult to design without the involvement of expert operators due to their design’s complexity.</p> Implication on token value <p>Some modular chains may not be able to draw interest to their native tokens due to restrained use cases. For example, when compared to an execution layer, a layer dedicated to consensus and data availability will, in all likelihood, see much less use for its <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-a-utility-token/">utility token</a>. This makes it very difficult to attract users to these networks.</p> Conclusion Modular vs. monolithic blockchain landscape considering Ethereum’s different layers as part of a modular structure. (<a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x3DcB6592B35097Df3A98FDBf9e6ec9f05436Aeda/hRwo3A0fISmv5EbvjYPu6e0p5EYNwklKqo3-SudijsU">Source</a>)<p>As the blockchain industry witnesses improvement or updates to different existing solutions, efficiency is key to new development. Modular blockchain networks such as <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a> or <a href="https://celestia.org/">Celestia</a> ensure that a network remains enormously scalable without tampering with security and decentralization. <br></p><p>Monolithic chains like Ethereum and Solana are already drifting to a modular design since blockchain developers now see the need for a seamless and cost-effective transaction arrangement. <br></p><p>However, in the recent past, we’ve witnessed the Ethereum ecosystem moving towards modular architecture with the development of Layer-2 and rollups. This could be considered an indicator of Ethereum being in a transition that marks the resolution of the blockchain scalability trilemma at a great scale, a first-ever and by all means a significant industry milestone.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p><p></p>
