  Brave's vertical tabs feature is now available for Windows, macOS, and Linux users to experience a new way to manage open tabs.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Brave’s vertical tabs feature is now available for users to experience a new way to manage open tabs. With today’s 1.52 desktop release, the vertical tabs setting is available to Brave users on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>

 How do vertical tabs work? 
<p>Enabling the vertical tabs setting relocates your open tabs from the top of your browser window (i.e. above the address bar) to the left side of the window, where they’ll appear stacked vertically rather than horizontally. To do so, right-click an existing horizontal tab and select “use vertical tabs” from the menu.</p>
<p>With open tabs arranged vertically, you’ll be able to scroll through them as needed. To open a new tab, simply click the button to create a new tab at the bottom of the vertical tabs sidebar.</p>
<p>There are additional settings you can adjust to further customize your vertical tabs experience, which we’ll get to shortly.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 The advantages of vertical tabs 
<p>Vertical tabs help to eliminate overcrowding your browser window, and to increase your on-screen real estate.</p>

 Identify open tabs more easily 
<p>The more horizontal tabs you have open, the smaller and more squished they become—often to the point of not being able to read any text on the tab. Vertical tabs, however, provide much-needed breathing room, allowing for more information to be displayed at a glance, so you can find the tab you’re looking for faster.&nbsp;</p>

 Use on-screen space more efficiently 
<p>Computer screens are almost always wider than they are tall, meaning you have more screen real estate left-to-right than you do top-to-bottom. By relocating tabs from the top of your window to the side, you maximize your available on-screen space.</p>

 Early feedback shows users love vertical tabs 
<p>While you may experience a short adjustment period as you become accustomed to vertical tabs, most users love the experience and don’t plan on going back.</p>
<p>“This, along with tab groups, should help me better organize my almost 300 tabs (!). Before, I used an extension called “Tab Manager Plus for Chrome” along with separating the tabs in multiple windows to keep things just enough organized to be usable. (yes I’m lazy I know). I was considering switching browsers, but thankfully now I won’t have to do that.”&nbsp; - Brave’s vertical tabs user</p>

 Customize your vertical tabs experience 
<p>By default, enabling vertical tabs will relocate your open tabs to the left side of your browser window. (This keeps the right side of your browser open to access Brave’s Sidebar feature, which provides quick access to your bookmarks, reading list, Brave Wallet, Brave Talk, and more. To enable Brave’s Sidebar, click on <code>brave://settings/appearance</code> in the Brave browser and enable / disable the Sidebar.)</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>You can also click the vertical tabs button  to collapse the vertical tabs panel. This way, you can maximize on-screen space by only opening the tabs panel when you need to access a different tab.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 A new tab management experience with familiar functionality 
<p>Despite a few key organizational changes, vertical tabs work much like the horizontal tabs you’re used to.</p>
 
 Navigation and shortcut keys remain the same 
 Pinned tabs still function the same way, and are pinned at the top of the vertical tabs panel 
 Grouped tabs also still function the same way, letting you create, label, and color code groups. 
 


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Vertical tabs give you an all-new, highly efficient system of tab management, without breaking anything you’ve come to love about tab management in Brave. Ready to try out vertical tabs? Make sure you’re on our latest desktop release (v1.52) and visit <code>brave://settings/appearance</code> to get started.</p>

<p>Today, Brave is excited to announce the release of the <a>Brave Search API</a>, making the backbone of Brave Search available to companies and developers worldwide as they build the next generation of apps that require Web search capabilities.</p>
<p>As the only privacy-preserving and independent search index in the West, Brave Search brings much-needed competition to Google and Microsoft Bing. The Brave Search <a>API</a> allows anyone to integrate billions of private, ad-free results from the Web with a simple API call.</p>
<p>The Brave Search API delivers great quality at an affordable cost. Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models developers in particular should benefit from the Search API, which offers access to high-quality, Web-scale data, with exhaustive coverage of recent events. It also brings a novel data set versus competitors who might be falling back to the standard Google / Bing options.</p>
<p>With a free plan and <a>affordable paid plans</a> starting from $3 per 1000 queries, the Brave Search API gives independent search access to all. Those interested can get started at <a href="https://api.search.brave.com/register/">api.search.brave.com</a>.</p>

 Brave Search, the Brave browser, and innovation 
<p>Since its initial launch in June 2021, Brave Search has grown to over 8 billion annualized queries, making it the fastest growing search engine since Bing. As the only global, independent alternative to Google and Bing, Brave Search is striving to make Web search more private and transparent. It’s also constantly innovating, with novel features like <a>Goggles</a>, <a>Discussions</a>, and the <a>AI Summarizer</a>, giving users more relevant results.</p>
<p>Brave Search is the default search engine in the Brave browser, which has nearly 60 million users worldwide. The browser’s opt-in <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-">Web Discovery Project</a> adds millions of new webpages to the index every single day, and ensures the index is populated with real, useful data: no dead links, SEO spam, or other junk content. Together, this private browser / private search combo ensures a constant source of fresh data for the index, and for the Search API.</p>
<p><a>The Goggles feature</a> expands and customizes the ranking. Goggles allow any individual—or community of people—to alter the ranking of Brave Search by using a set of instructions (rules and filters). Anyone can create, apply, or extend a Goggle. Essentially Goggles act as a custom re-ranking on top of the Brave search index. This means that, instead of a single ranking, Brave Search can offer an almost limitless number of ranking options.</p>
<p>All Goggles will appear in the Brave Search API.</p>

 Pricing tiers, and getting started with the Brave Search API 
<p>Anyone can visit <a href="https://api.search.brave.com/register/">api.search.brave.com</a> and start testing in minutes. After creating an account, users can search the Web and get back every result the search engine has access to, in an easy, intuitive format. This includes Web results, enriched metadata, entity search, news, video results, and more.</p>
<p>All users can <a href="https://api.search.brave.com/register/">get started for free</a> for up to 1 query per second, and 2,000 queries per month. For users who need more, we offer a variety of paid plan options:</p>

 Brave’s ongoing mission to improve search 
<p>Brave is on a mission to build a user-first Web. That mission starts with the Brave browser and Brave Search.

<p>Ethereum's merge and transition to a proof-of-stake consensus implied switching from proof-of-work mining to transactions being validated by entities that have an economic stake in the network. Proof-of-stake distributed networks are subject to complex game theory models (e.g. slashing). Distributed validator technology (DVT) enables a more modular validator stack at every level: key pairs, hardware and entities. This reduces trust dependencies and increases security for validator entities.<br><br>We were joined by Collin Myers &amp; Oisín Kyne, founders of Obol Network, to discuss Ethereum's 2.0 PoS consensus, the current validator landscape and how distributed validator technology (DVT) allows for an increased security and overall smoother UX for validator entities.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Collin’s &amp; Oisín’s backgrounds  Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) explained  How DVT improves user experience for different staking models  Reducing validator costs and increasing fault tolerance through DVT  Obol middleware approach  Obol v.2  Interacting with other middleware from the Ethereum stack  Expanding DVT to other ecosystems  Future validator landscape  How post-Danksharding data availability will be handled by an Obol cluster  L2 Ethereum equivalence  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/StakeETH">Collin Myers on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/OisinKyne">Oisín Kyne on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/obolnetwork">Obol Network on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst.

<p>Dear Panther Community,<br></p><p>We are thrilled to announce that the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther DAO</a> has officially approved <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xcb272ecdb9e9f820772c193ebbd3bb05b8d80c11d00735925c8d5e38355ef9a5">PIP-14</a>. This proposal formalizes the project’s Governance Framework and introduces a DAO Council, marking a significant stride in the project's decentralization journey.<br></p><p>This landmark development follows extensive discussions on our <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">community forum</a> about the need for a decentralized, high-level decision-making process, and accountability for non-team members.<br></p> Significance<br> <p>The approval of PIP-14 puts us on the path to:<br></p>  The formation of a DAO Council, which will be entrusted with reviewing Panther Improvement Proposals (PIPs) from our Discourse forum. By verifying the alignment of proposals with Panther DAO’s mission, vision, and values, the Council will effectively weed out spam requests and proposals that are out of budget or misaligned with Panther's scope and <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/roadmap?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">roadmap</a>.<br>  Establishing a transparent Governance Framework, bringing implicit rules and guidelines into the light. These rules, which are now formalized, can be found in the following diagram:  All the above advancements will allow us to build a more robust and decentralized Panther Protocol. The Council<br> <p>The elected Council will consist of three respected community (non-team) members:<br></p>  Santiago Velez: Co-Founder &amp; Division Lead (R&amp;D) at <a href="https://blockdigitalcorp.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Block Digital Corporation</a>, VP of R&amp;D at Sindric Solutions, LLC.

Their tenure will be for 6 months, with the possibility of re-election.<br></p> Moving Forward<br> <p>The approval of PIP-14 marks an exciting chapter in Panther's roadmap. By installing a council to review PIPs and instating a transparent governance framework, we are becoming more open and democratic. Your trust and active participation have been instrumental in this success.<br></p><p>Let's continue to build and accelerate the development of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364/">private</a>, scalable blockchain infrastructure for <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/web3/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Web3</a> together.

 Digital Integrity — disrupting the personal data&nbsp;economy  Five years in, it is clear the GDPR is not&nbsp;enough <p>By Alexis Roussel, co-author of <a href="https://www.slatkine.com/fr/editions-slatkine/74977-book-07211052-9782832110522.html">Our precious digital integrity</a> (Slatkine)</p><p>There is nothing natural, nor inevitable about the fact that our personal data is traded in open markets. And yet this has become the norm of the digital economy for billions of people’s data. This needs to&nbsp;change.</p><p>Today is the five-year anniversary of the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> and while the regulatory framework managed to put the question of digital privacy on the global agenda, it has been <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/5-years-gdpr-national-authorities-let-down-european-legislator">a disappointment</a> when it comes to enforcement. Furthermore, the GDPR does nothing to challenge the fact that people have been subjected to information about them being produced and traded on open&nbsp;markets.</p><p>This week, we are at the <a href="https://www.cpdpconferences.org/">Computers, Privacy and Data Protection Conference (CPDP)</a> in Brussels. In addition to <a href="https://twitter.com/jayapapaya/status/1661313286120390656">opening the conference</a> with a discussion on the privacy implications of the cashless society, we conducted a workshop introducing the “Right to Digital Integrity”. This is currently being incorporated into the constitutions of several cantons in Switzerland. We were joined by Alexander Barclay, Delegate for digital policy of the State of Geneva, and Lusine Vardanyan, researcher at the Palacký University Olomouc, author of the paper <a href="https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/bjes-2022-0008">Digital Integrity: A Foundation for Digital Rights and the New Manifestation of Human&nbsp;Dignity</a>.</p>Left to right: Alexander Barclay, Delegate for State of Geneva, Lusine Vardanyan of Palacký University Olomouc, Alexis Roussel, COO of Nym and Harry Halpin, CEO of&nbsp;Nym<p>The digital society has been in the making for half a century. From the beginning, developers and lawyers have pointed out the likely abuses of global information systems, all built without taking the rights of people into account. Sure enough, in recent times, an entire system and economy has emerged around the commodification and exploitation of personal data — namely surveillance capitalism as revealed by Edward Snowden and analysed by Shoshana&nbsp;Zuboff.</p><p>The societal response has been data protection laws, culminating with the adoption of the GDPR in Europe. It is now the most aggressive regulation vis-à-vis the private companies that participate in this surveillance economy. But the GDPR largely spares nation states themselves in its material scope and is really just a tool for market regulation, merely seeking to mitigate some of its negative effects. It does not manage to protect fundamental rights or challenge the underlying principles of the surveillance economy.</p><p>The foundation of the GDPR lies in the protection of privacy, a fundamental right that existed already long before the Internet appeared. But this is a limited approach that is not able to respond to the societal threats of the surveillance economy. Nor is it able to deal with the historical impact that our digital tools have on individuals and the organizations of our societies.</p><p>In the face of what can be described as a failed approach to data protection, there is now a call for a more fundamental digital right. The principle of informational self-determination is emerging in European case law and judges are seeking to extend protection beyond violations of privacy. However, they are trapped by the hierarchy of norms: the right to data protection as per Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union only offers a partial and limited form of protection. This article reaffirms the right to data protection, enshrines the importance of consent when processing data, but once again does not call into question the underlying model of a surveillance economy.</p> The Right to Digital Integrity <p>In 2018, the francophone data protection authorities, led by <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/home">Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL)</a>, declared that “personal data is constituent elements of the human person, who therefore has inalienable rights over them”. This statement is a frontal rebuttal to the notion of “personal data is a commodity”. Personal data is reframed as a constitutive element of a person, in the same way as their physical body. The proposal is a fundamental shift in understanding of data and yet this reframing largely goes unnoticed, with the CNIL itself not yet drawing the full conclusions of its proposal. If our data is indeed a constituent element of the human person, it is deserving of the same integrity and security protections as our bodies. And just like organ trade is highly illegal, personal data should not be traded in the open&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Since 2010, I have been exploring the extension of the concept of integrity of the person to their digital existence within political think-tanks in Switzerland working on digital rights issues. Grégoire Barbey and I co-authored a book “Our precious digital integrity” on the notion of a ‘right to digital integrity’. In this book, we explored how the emergence of such a right can lead to the emergence of a digital economy that is very different from the one we know. In fact, if implemented, it would necessarily lead to a revised security policy, protecting the integrity of the human being also in their digital&nbsp;sphere.</p><p>Shortly after we published our book, a symposium was organized by the Faculty of Law of the University of Neuchâtel discussing the ‘right to digital integrity’. The Valais Constituent Assembly, in charge of drafting the new Constitution of the Canton of Valais in Switzerland, then decided to integrate the ‘right to digital integrity’ in their draft. The vote is expected to take place next year in&nbsp;2024.</p> From “data protection” to the “digital&nbsp;life” <p>The primary contribution of the ‘right to digital integrity’ is that it takes a more comprehensive approach to what life in the digital age entails. What is at stake is not simply data protection, but the fact that much of humanity lives digital lives deserving of protection to safeguard their autonomy. This autonomy entails that their integrity is not violated.</p><p>The adoption of the ‘right to digital integrity’ in the constitutions of Swiss cantons is in full swing, and is already transforming the approach to data protection. For example, the Valais Constituent Assembly has moved away from the classic approach to data protection, which seeks to avoid the “abusive processing” of data, by proposing a prohibition of “data processing without consent” as a general rule. In contrast to the GDPR, this means the burden of proof is shifted from those who are the subject of the processing to those who carry out the processing. In the same draft, the ‘right to digital integrity’ is granted, including through the “ability to interact freely through digital technologies”. A right to open and non-discriminatory access to the Internet is recognized, as is the right to communicate with the authorities, without being required to exclusively use a specific technology.</p><p>In Geneva, a similar proposal is up for vote on the 18th of June 2023, a constitutional law submitted to the Geneva Grand Council. It proposes the introduction of a new article in the Constitution recognizing the ‘right to digital integrity’ with the following wording: “Digital integrity includes, in particular, the right to be protected against the abusive processing of data related to one’s digital life, the right to security in digital space, the right to an offline life as well as the right to be forgotten.” This is the first time the concept of “digital life” appears in a Constitution.</p><p>Furthermore, articulating a ‘right to security in the digital space’ allows for a profound paradigm shift in the security approach: the digital world can no longer be seen by the security authorities merely as a tool that can be compromised for some security scare. Instead, they have to actively contribute to securing the underlying infrastructures for digital life in order to allow citizens to lead their digital lives with serenity.</p><p>Following the trend of Valais and Geneva, the cantons of Jura, Neuchâtel and Vaud have also started debates on the ‘right to digital integrity’. And now, even the federal parliament.</p><p>Neuchâtel is the home of Nym, and here the ‘right to digital integrity’ is being advanced even further to include the ‘right to not to be monitored, analyzed and measured’. This recognises that the right to digital integrity in fact implies the right to remain anonymous, full stop. This is a radical step forward towards guaranteeing the autonomy and dignity of people in the digital&nbsp;age.</p> What next? <p>Our democracies are trapped in a paradox: our governments have rolled out privacy laws and mass-surveillance laws at the same time. But these two are fundamentally incompatible. The focus on privacy alone does not resolve this paradox. Instead, privacy, the right to anonymity and digital integrity needs to be incorporated into the fabric of our&nbsp;society.</p><p>At Nym, we work on building privacy into the core of our digital infrastructures. On a transparent network like the Internet, in order to establish a truly private conversation, this communication must be unobservable. This is what the Nym mixnet achieves.</p><p>Similarly, in a transparent society like the one we all live in, the legal system also has to provide a protective shroud for anonymity for people, to safeguard our digital integrity.</p> Join Nym community <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym"> Discord</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/digital-integrity-disrupting-the-personal-data-economy-509642bc756b">Digital Integrity — disrupting the personal data economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The current cloud and server architectures are vulnerable to hacking because of their centralised IT infrastructure. For applications that require a high level of data integrity, such as those that handle financial or privacy-sensitive data, exploring blockchain technology in a clean slate scenario can be highly interesting. </p>



<p>By leveraging a blockchain database, you can create a custom solution that meets your specific needs without having to conform to the limitations of pre-existing systems. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the database’s functionality and security.</p>



<p>In this article, we will address the much-debated topic of the difference between blockchain and a traditional database. So, without further ado, let us get to the point…</p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 Traditional database only stores the current state information 



 Blockchain stores a history of all transactions in the cryptographic signed database 



 On a blockchain, you can replay all transactions to reach the state information 



 Blockchain database provides a complete audit trail of all information flow 



 Blockchain databases offer an extra layer of security by creating an unalterable and tamper-resistant data record 



 On a blockchain, the historical record can be available and can be checked and verified by anyone with access to the blockchain database, in multiple locations 
 







 The fundamental difference 



<p>Blockchain databases differ from traditional databases in that they comprise a sequence of transactions that are securely anchored and immutable. In contrast, traditional databases are a collection of state information that can be mutated and lose logging history over time or in the case of a hack.</p>



<p>Blockchain databases store every transaction that has ever taken place. Consequently, creating a complete sequence of events that forms an unalterable record. So, in order to find the person’s state information, you can replay the whole chain of transactions.</p>



<p>To replay all transaction from the entire blockchain can be extensive and time-consuming. If you want to read a database state and don’t want to replay the complete history, you can also store it in a database next to the blockchain, or use a block explorer application. And then, it becomes a whole architecture that is highly secure, has high performance, and can not be changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For quick recovery after an incident, block producers can take snapshots of the blockchain at regular intervals, decreasing replay time.</p>



 Significant improvements in security 



<p>Blockchain transactions are completely encrypted and usually decentralised on multiple servers. Because of this, you have highly available architecture with multiple operators across the globe to check and verify transactions. This makes the whole architecture cyber secure.</p>



<p>Imagine having 21 validators plus 5 standby who operate the blockchain. In a hypothetical scenario where one validator gets hacked and the hacker tries to change the information on the blockchain, the hacker would not succeed. This is because the other 20 validators have the original sequence of all transactions. Any new information added to the database needs to be approved by the majority of validators before being added on-chain.</p>



 Ideal use cases 



<p>In the current market landscape, blockchain databases offer a more tailored solution for addressing custom in-house applications. As an example, if you are an IT manager for a municipality, and you want to create a database specifically for administration purposes, building it on top of a <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain/">blockchain (like Europechain) </a>is an option. This wouldn’t be feasible with an off-the-shelf application that is already built on an existing data architecture.</p>



<p>A blockchain database can be an ideal solution in situations where data security, transparency, and immutability are crucial. Among these industries are finance, healthcare, supply chain, and real estate, all of which require secure and reliable tracking of transactions.</p>

<p>Today, in order to better serve the Zcash mission, we are announcing a restructuring of ECC, including layoffs of valued team members. Going forward, ECC will focus our time and expertise on specific parts of the Zcash mission, and help transition other parts to other organizations in the Zcash community.</p>



<p>We at ECC have been trying to do too much with too few resources, especially in the last year and a half as the bear market began to impact our finances. It has become clear this was limiting our ability to execute on the things we’re best at.</p>



<p>Zcash has grown and changed, and today there are many organizations outside of ECC who are also committed to the Zcash mission, many of them funded by the Zcash Dev Fund, including the Zcash Community Grants committee, Zingo Labs, Nighthawk Apps, the Zcash Foundation, Zcash Media, the Zcash Global Ambassadors program, and many other individuals and organizations. There are also the promised contributions to Zcash by QEdit and Shielded Labs and by the Filecoin and Anoma projects. We are grateful to these people for their contributions to the Zcash movement, and by committing ECC to doing fewer things and doing them well, we hope to further empower them, making Zcash as a broad movement even more resilient and sustainable.</p>



<p>Restructuring ECC was a challenging decision. It required that we lay off 13 employees — about half of our team. Many of the people we let go today were instrumental in bringing to market groundbreaking technologies and ideas that no other team in the world has been able to deliver. We are sad to part ways with them and will always be grateful for the opportunity we had to work with these incredible individuals.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks, ECC will release a revised roadmap centered on empowering ZEC holders and giving them a voice. This includes:</p>



 
 Creating an excellent user experience for proof-of-stake ZEC 



 A wallet, built by and for Zcashers, that is easy to use and accessible for anyone 



 A mobile-wallet SDK that is useful to other Zcash builders 



 US-based policy work to ensure ZEC, self-custody, and staking remain viable in the USA 
 



<p>We will help transition ownership to the broader community of some functions ECC has undertaken in the past.</p>



 
 Support for zcashd outside of ECC’s Roadmap 



 Protocol review for Zcash core protocols outside of ECC’s roadmap 



 Alliances and exchange support 



 Global regulatory relations 



 Management of digital properties, including z.cash and the Zcash-specific social accounts 



 Product marketing 



 Zcash related PR and media engagement 
 



<p>Importantly, our immediate-term work on solving third-party wallet performance issues is still our highest priority at the moment, and we are committed to releasing zcashd 5.6.0, an updated lightwalletd, and new mobile SDKs for iOS and Android soon.</p>



<p>As with any transition, this restructuring of team and priorities will take some time to fully settle, and there are some other projects and initiatives that are nearing completion — such as the relaunch of z.cash and a proposal to foster community ownership of this and other Zcash digital properties — that we’ll be delivering to the community in the near term. We’re still engaging on important initiatives such as the Filecoin Foundation grants and other activities that will benefit the Zcash user.</p>



<p>This is hard. I asked all of the ECC team to join me in my work to serve human freedom. It became our collective mission, and something we’ve all fought for day-in and day-out. While we won’t all be able to continue on this particular path together, I am confident that in the scope of history, each one of us will look back proudly on what we did together for human freedom. I am grateful for all the team members to whom we said goodbye as employees today, and for the ones that will continue at ECC. We remain fully committed to our mission and believe ECC is now in a much stronger position to serve the Zcash mission, both today and into the future. </p>



<p>I’ll be joining an ECC-hosted Twitter Spaces on Friday, May 26th, to answer questions from the community. Please keep an eye on <a href="https://twitter.com/ElectricCoinCo">@electriccoinco</a> for details.</p>

    <p>Bringing decentralized oracle capabilities to the fast growing EON ecosystem and supporting a wide range of use cases&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are excited to announce a strategic partnership with <a href="http://bandprotocol.com">Band Protocol</a>, a cross-chain data oracle platform, to provide real-time price feeds and reliable data for <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a>, our EVM-compatible smart contracting platform. The partnership will bring decentralized oracle services to the growing EON ecosystem, supporting a wide range of use cases, including DeFi, gaming and NFTs.</p>
<p>Horizen’s EON is a fully EVM-compatible smart contracting platform and the first of many smart contract sidechains on the Horizen ecosystem. Band Protocol’s flagship oracle solution enables Horizen EON to gain access to real-time price feeds for tokens across different chains, providing a safe and reliable source of information for EON as it builds out its DeFi, gaming and NFT ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By aggregating and connecting real-world data and APIs to smart contracts, Band Protocol allows smart contract applications to be built on EON without relying on the single point of failure of a centralized oracle. This integration allows developers to enhance and extend their smart contract capabilities on EON.</p>

<p>This is the 26th post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave browsers. This post describes work done by Sr. Software Engineer Mark Pilgrim, with critical help from Cryptography Researcher Sofia Celi and Sr. Research and Privacy Engineer Shivan Sahib. This post was written by Peter Snyder.</p>



    


    


<p>Starting in version 1.53, Brave will begin rolling out a new feature called “Request Off the Record (OTR).” This feature aims to help people who need to hide their browsing behavior from others who have access to their computer or phone. For example, a person who is the victim of intimate partner violence who needs to find support services without their partner knowing, or someone needing to find personal healthcare without others in their home finding out.</p>
<p>Request OTR allows websites to optionally describe their own content as “sensitive.” The browser can then ask if the user would like to visit the site in OTR mode, where the site is visited in a clean, temporary storage area. Sites visited in OTR mode are not saved to your browsing history, and any cookies, permissions, or other site data do not persist to disk. Meanwhile, other sites visited are stored and treated as normal, obscuring to anyone who may access the device later that any “unusual” behavior happened.</p>
<p>Request OTR is another in Brave’s suite of features that support the privacy needs of individual users, protecting far beyond the “standard” threats browsers typically watch out for. Brave intends to work with other browser vendors to standardize OTR, so that at-risk browser users can be private and safe, across the Web, regardless of which browser they’re using.</p>
<p>This feature has been designed with the input of, and in collaboration with, several civil society and victim advocacy groups. We agree with Mallory Knodel, the CTO at the Center for Democracy and Technology, in the following:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Brave Browser's attention to detail with OTR Mode—users can more easily choose which websites are recorded in their browsing history—is an important privacy innovation that can protect users in "attacker you know" situations or anyone who wants more control over what their browser remembers and what it doesn't. This feature empowers people who browse the web—all of us—and gives us more agency over content consumption.</p>
    <p>— Mallory Knodel, CTO at the Center for Democracy and Technology</p>
</blockquote>

 Some users need to hide their browsing from people who have access to their device 
<p>Most often, when people talk about Web privacy they’re talking about protecting personal data from websites (e.g. blocking Google from recording the sites you visit).</p>
<p>However, Web users have other privacy needs too, needs that are currently poorly served by most browsers. Consider “Sarah,” a hypothetical Web user who lives with “Stan,” a physically abusive partner. Sarah needs to use the Web to learn about legal, medical, and other support services in her area, so she can safely exit her relationship. Stan, though, suspects Sarah may be planning to leave, and begins monitoring Sarah’s phone, computer, and other devices to see if she’s contacting support services.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not only do browsers fail to protect users like Sarah, they actually make it easier for abusers like Stan to digitally surveil others. Browsers record a wealth of information about our browsing behavior and interests, both explicitly (e.g. browsing history, DOM storage, and cookies) and implicitly (e.g. cache state, saved credentials, URL autocomplete). Worse still, the tools browsers do include to protect people like Sarah are incomplete and / or difficult to use correctly.</p>

 Current browsers tools are insufficient for protecting against known abusers 
<p>Browsers currently provide some tools to help users hide their activity on sensitive sites. However, these tools are insufficient to protect people whose safety depends on hiding visits to specific sites from people who have access to their device. Existing tools either hide too much (thus inviting suspicion from abusers), too little (thus allowing abusers to recover browsing history), or are otherwise difficult to use successfully.</p>
<p>Private (also known as Incognito) windows allow users to browse the Web without their browsing activity being permanently recorded. Unfortunately, private windows do a poor job protecting users from on-device surveillance. It’s easy to forget to open a private window before visiting a site, especially under stress, thus causing the site visit to be permanently recorded. And it’s equally as easy to forget to close the private window, and thus continue browsing in the private window beyond just the target sensitive site. This can reveal to the abuser that private browsing modes have been used, which on its own may elicit suspicion or put the victim at further risk.</p>
<p>Similarly, some browsers include advanced browser controls that can be used to delete browser storage for specific sites. This approach has the drawback of needing to be performed after the site was visited, instead of protecting the user during the visit, which may put the user at risk if the browser needs to be closed quickly. Additionally, these controls are often difficult to find, and more difficult still to use correctly for non-technical users. And finally, these browser controls typically only allow the user to delete stored values for the site (e.g. cookies or permissions), but do not allow the user to delete other traces of the site (e.g. browsing history or caches).</p>
<p>Finally, some sensitive sites include quick-exit buttons in the site themselves, which allow a visitor to quickly navigate away from the site in a way that may be semi-difficult for an abuser to detect. While useful, this approach is also incomplete. Quick-exit buttons cannot delete many types of site data (e.g. permissions or caches), and are constrained in their ability to modify browsing history. Further, they depend completely on the correct implementation by the site; the browser is unable to protect the user.</p>

 Brave’s Request OTR provides a novel, powerful protection 
<p>Brave’s Request OTR approach provides a comprehensive way for sensitive sites to request to be omitted from a user’s browsing history and local storage. Any site can request to go OTR, and the user is prompted to see if the user would like to do so. If so, the Brave browser creates a temporary storage area for the site, and does not record the site visit in the user’s browsing history. The OTR session is tied to the site, and any other sites the user visits in the same tab (along with any sites visited in any other tabs) are recorded in browsing history as normal.</p>
<p>More specifically, Brave’s implementation of Request OTR protects the user in the following ways:</p>
 
 The user is protected the entire time they’re visiting a sensitive site; they don’t need to try and scrub their browsing history later. 
 Other, non-sensitive sites are recorded as normal, which prevents big gaps in browsing history that might look suspicious to an abuser. 
 All target site behaviors are prevented from persisting to disk, including cookies, caches, browsing history, permissions, etc. 
 OTR prevents sites from abusing the feature; a site cannot go off-the-record unless a user explicitly gives the site permission to do so. 
 

 How can sites request to be off the record 
<p>Brave has developed Request OTR specifically to help people suffering from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_partner_violence">intimate partner violence</a>, or people otherwise needing to hide visits to sensitive sites from their browsing history. However, OTR is intentionally a general browser feature, and is intended to be usable by any site on the Web.&nbsp;</p>

 Request-OTR header 
<p>Currently, there are two ways for a site to request to go off the record in Brave. The primary, intended way is for the site to include the header <code>Request-OTR: 1</code> in the response to the initial navigation request for a site. If the browser sees this header, the browser will halt the navigation and ask the user if they would like to visit the site off the record.</p>
<p>If the user says yes, then the browser does two things:</p>
 
 It does not record the site visit in the browser history 
 It creates a temporary storage area for caches, cookies, permissions, etc. 
 
<p>The browser continues using this temporary storage area for all subsequent pages visited within the same tab, within the same site. When the user closes the tab, or navigates away from the site, the temporary storage area is discarded, and browsing behaviors return to being recorded as normal.</p>

 Request-OTR preload list 
<p>The second way for a site to request to go off the record is to be included in Brave’s preloaded <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/blob/master/brave-lists/request-otr.json">list of “request off the record” partner sites</a>. These are sites that serve victims of intimate partner violence, and have told Brave they’re interested in being considered a sensitive site by the browser. This list is intended as a bridge measure, until all sites can implement the previously mentioned header approach.</p>

 Limitations of Brave’s Request-OTR implementation&nbsp; 
<p>Brave’s Request OTR feature prevents visits to sensitive sites from being recorded in a user’s browser history, both overtly (browser history, cookies) and incidentally (caches, permissions, etc). Brave’s Request OTR feature is covered by <a href="https://hackerone.com/brave?view_policy=true">Brave’s security bug bounty program</a>, and we welcome any reports of data from an “off the record” session being incorrectly or incompletely cleared.</p>
<p>However, users should be aware that Brave’s Request OTR feature does not protect users from other software on their computer that might record information about what sites they visit. Examples of software the Brave browser cannot hide browsing history from include:</p>
 
 Browser extensions 
 Network spying 
 Malware or spyware installed on the device 
 Information saved by sites before or after you visit the “off the record” (such as if you have “Google Web History” enabled on Google Search or Gmail) 
 Operating-system level logging 
 Crash logs 
 
<p>Brave is exploring what additional protections can be provided against such threats, but users should be aware that (as with systems like private browsing mode) Brave’s Request OTR mode only prevents recording of core browsing behaviors and data.</p>

 Next steps in Request-OTR 



    


    


<p>We’re excited to release Request Off the Record in upcoming version 1.53 of our desktop browser, with an Android version coming in the 1.54 release. We’ll be rolling it out to users shortly, though people interested in testing the feature now can enable it by visiting <code>brave://flags</code> and enabling <code>#brave-request-otr-tab</code>. Please note that this should only be done if you understand the risks of testing experimental browser features. We welcome all feedback on the feature.</p>
<p>We’re also excited about the next steps we’re taking to further improve the Request OTR feature. First, we’re working with experts and researchers at <a href="https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu/">George Washington University</a> and <a href="https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/en/">Paderborn University</a> to evaluate how Request-OTR is understood by users, and how we can further convey to users exactly what protections the feature does (and does not) provide. We will both share the research that results from this collaboration on this blog, and incorporate it into future versions of Request-OTR in Brave.</p>
<p>Second, we’re interested in working with other browsers, organizations, and Web companies to potentially standardize Request-OTR, so that users of other websites and browsers can benefit from the protection. Our current implementation is the result of working with a wide range of abuse advocates, technologists, browser specialists, and NGOs, and we’re eager to continue working with similar organizations to best support Web users.</p>

Get started with Polygon ID Zero-Knowledge Credentials User Guide: Get started with Polygon ID Zero-Knowledge Credentials <p>Last week, Verida launched a new integration for the Verida Wallet, the <a href="https://news.verida.io/polygon-id-and-verida-make-zero-knowledge-credentials-accessible-to-all-fc0ac17538c9">first mobile crypto wallet supporting zero-knowledge proofs</a> generated from verifiable credentials issued through Polygon&nbsp;ID.</p><p>With zero-knowledge proofs, you can demonstrate your age, citizenship, finances and more while preserving privacy. These proofs are cryptographically verifiable, ensuring trust and security.</p><p>For example, using a trusted credential with your birthdate, a zero-knowledge proof can be created to verify you’re over 21 years old without disclosing your actual birthdate.</p><p>This user guide will walk you through this example of using Polygon ID in the <a href="http://verida.io">Verida&nbsp;Wallet</a>.</p><p>With the Polygon ID demo, you will explore the many features of the Verida Wallet, including:</p>  Decentralized identity: Create a decentralized identifier (DID) on the Verida&nbsp;Network.  Single sign-on: Sign into the Polygon ID demo application with a QR&nbsp;code.  Credentials: Receive and manage your Polygon ID verifiable credential.  Decentralized data storage: Store your Polygon ID credential in your Verida&nbsp;Wallet.  Secure data inbox: Use your encrypted data inbox to receive a Polygon ID credential.  Decentralized messaging: Send your zero-knowledge proof to a third party verifier.  Verida Wallet&nbsp;features<p>Download the <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a> on iOS or Android to get started with this&nbsp;demo.</p> 1. Connect to the Polygon ID Issuer Demo&nbsp;App   Visit <a href="https://issuer-demo.polygonid.me/">The Polygon Issue Demo webpage</a> and press Sign&nbsp;Up.    You will be redirected to a page which will generate your unique authentication QR&nbsp;code.  <p>Scan the QR code with your <a href="http://verida.io">Verida&nbsp;Wallet</a>.</p>  On the Connection Request screen, click on “Connect”  <p>Note: The Polygon ID “engine” takes a few seconds to initialize when starting the mobile Wallet app. If you scan a QR code directly after starting the app and get an error, wait a few moments and try again. The Verida engineering team is working on optimizing this&nbsp;UX.</p>  You’re signed&nbsp;in!   2. Generate a zero-knowledge KYC age credential   Click on “Create Claims” and choose Schema: KYC Age Credential.    Submit and Scan QR code via your Verida Wallet to receive the created credential.    Accept the incoming data in your Verida&nbsp;Wallet.    After accepting, your KYC Age credential will be stored in Data → Credentials.   3.

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce a new Web3 feature for Brave Talk, our privacy-preserving video calling product: token-gating. Web3 Brave Talk calls allow hosts to use <a>NFTs</a> and POAPs <a>1</a> to token-gate access, configure avatars, assign moderator permissions, and more. Web3 calling also expands utility for Brave’s browser-native Brave Wallet: Together, they create the first-ever fully integrated Web3 live event platform, combining browser, wallet, and video.</p>
<p>Whereas with other video calling solutions (like Zoom or Google Meet) the host can only control access to a call using a password, Brave’s new Web3 calls enable new functionality regarding user authentication and authorization. Since NFTs can be sold and traded, using NFTs as the gating system creates a video calling system that mimics real life events: You can enter if you have a ticket.</p>
<p>Token-gating is a key development in Brave Talk, allowing hosts to use NFTs and POAPs as access passes to live events. For example, communities can hold members-only calls for token holders. Creators can reward select fans who hold their tokens with exclusive access to them. Businesses can use the open NFT marketplaces to sell and resell tickets to events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web3 calls are available to all Brave Talk users on any browser with any Web3 wallet. Hosts can start a Web3 call with a Premium Talk subscription.</p>

 How to get started with Web3 calling 
<p>To get started with Web3 Brave Talk calls, follow these steps:</p>
 
 Open the Brave browser, and visit <a href="https://talk.brave.com/">talk.brave.com</a>. 
 Click Host a Web3 Call (you’ll need a Premium Talk subscription to see this option). 
 When you create (or join) a Web3 room, your wallet will ask to authenticate, and allow access to one of your accounts. 
 Choose an NFT as an avatar. 
 Specify whether participants have to own an NFT or be a member of a POAP group to enter. 
 Share the link to the call with those you’d like to attend. 
 
<p>Note: You don’t have to use <a>Brave Wallet</a> to start or join a Web3 Talk call. Any browser-based or hardware wallet will work.</p>

 What is token-gating? 
<p>Token-gating is one of the main ways you can control access in Web3, and it generally has two parts: authentication and authorization.</p>
<p>Authentication</p>
<p>Web3 authentication starts with a blockchain wallet address that you own. Ownership is verified using the unique signature of your wallet, which only the holder of the wallet can generate:&nbsp;</p>
 
 A service sends a message to you. 
 You sign the message using your crypto address. 
 You send the message back to the server. 
 The service verifies the signature, and then knows you “own” that address. <a>2</a> 
 
<p>Brave Talk uses the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361">SIWE</a> (Sign-In with Ethereum) protocol for Web3 authentication.</p>
<p>Authorization</p>
<p>For token-gating, authorization consists of specifying a token that an address must have to be authorized.</p>
 
 NFT ownership: You select one or more NFT collections, and if someone wants to join the Web3 room, their authenticated address must have an NFT from at least one of these collections. 
 POAP membership: You select one or more POAP events, and if someone wants to join the Web3 room, their authenticated address must be a member of one of those groups. 
 
<p>There are of course other authorization options, and we may expand to include these options in the future. For now, we’ve selected the two most common methods of NFTs and POAPs.</p>

 What’s next for Web3 Brave Talk? 
<p>While we’re excited to bring Web3 Talk calls to all Brave users, we’re already investigating several enhancements. These include:</p>
 
 Support for non-Ethereum NFTs: At present, only Ethereum NFTs (ERC-721) are supported. We hope to extend token-gating to NFTs on other platforms soon. 
 Token-gating for owners of a particular token: In this case, a participant has to have a specific balance of a particular token to gain entry. 
 Token-gating based on past ownership: this is a variation of the first two possibilities, but instead of looking at the current state of the blockchain, past activity is considered (e.g. if the user address ever owned an NFT from a particular collection). 
 Sending crypto to a participant: Since each participant has authenticated themselves, a “Send crypto” menu option could open a wallet widget with the recipient address already filled-in (with the user then having to enter an amount and approve the transaction). 
 
<p>These are just possibilities. We’d love your feedback and thoughts on other useful Web3 features you’d like to see come to Brave Talk. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/brave">tweet at us</a> or <a href="https://github.com/brave">submit an issue on Github</a> to share your ideas.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>A POAP—which stands for Proof of Attendance Protocol—is a type of NFT that signifies real-life attendance or participation in an event like a concert or conference. <a href="https://poap.xyz/about-the-protocol">Learn more at poap.xyz</a>.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Ownership is defined as the wallet has access to the private key that generated the address.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This release includes new key features and introduces a hard fork</p>
 
 A hard fork to support V2 sidechains (See V2 Sidechain New Features) will activate at&nbsp; block #1363115, which will occur on June 7th, 2023 at approximately 13:00 UTC. 
 ZEN 4.0.0 sets the upcoming deprecation date to block #1422426, which will occur on September 19th, 2023 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC. 
 
<p>Note: Zend 4.0.0 is the last version of Zend supporting Ubuntu Bionic. Future releases of Zend will only support Ubuntu Focal or newer, as Ubuntu Bionic is End of Life starting May 31, 2023.</p>     
 

 
         
     Main V2 Sidechain New Features: 
 
 Non-ceasable Sidechains: The Horizen mainchain verifies each sidechain and ensures its integrity. Unlike traditional sidechains that have a limited time to produce a valid proof to keep exchanging information with the Horizen mainchain, sidechains declared as V2 and non-ceasable don’t share this constraint. The certificate can arrive at any time. Non-ceasing sidechains makes the verification process more flexible and frictionless without compromising the security of the system. 
 Key Rotation: A security enhancement that gives the ability to sign transactions and certificates using keys that are not stored locally, that are instead in a separate trusted execution environment 
 One Version: Starting from this version, Bitcore versions of Zen binaries will no longer be released. There will be only one version, which includes the AddressIndexing features (previously included in bitcore version). 
 
<p>Meanwhile, the EON sidechain <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-is-now-live-on-gobi-testnet-with-bug-bounties/">is already live on testnet</a> check it out! We take this opportunity to also thank everyone for the continued support.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions or you need further support. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Of the current members, Cody Burns’ term expires at the end of June, and Wobbzz has announced that they are resigning their seat and will stand for re-election, in order to facilitate a move to staggered elections (i.e. where two committee members are elected in June, and three in December). </p>



<p>Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in June.</p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">governance zcg-elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining their priorities and vision for Zcash. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly as replies to their respective posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Monday 12th June 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>During the week commencing 12th June, the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select two candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st July 2023.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The two candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 30th June 2024. </p>



<p>Prospective candidates should familiarize themselves with the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;Hudson Jameson stepped down from the committee in <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/hudson-jameson-leaving-zcg/41941">June 2022</a>, triggering the election of Cody Burns, whose term expires at the end of June 2023. Wobbzz has <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/wobbzz-for-zcg-june-2023/44665">announced</a> that they are resigning their seat, effective June 30th, and will stand for re-election, thus facilitating a move to a staggered election cycle, where two seats are up for election in June, and three in December. </p>



<p>Committee members currently receive a stipend of $1,650 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC) from the Zcash Foundation (ZF).&nbsp;However, given the budgetary constraints that ZF currently faces, this stipend  may be subject to review over the coming year. </p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Zcash Foundation is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement. </p>



<p>To avoid conflicts of interest, the following policy applies to the ZCG Committee:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p></p>



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcg-committee-election-june-2023/44668">this topic on the Zcash Community Forums</a>.</p>

 🛠️ Deep dive: On new sources of competitive advantage &amp; moats in web3  <p>Scott Duke Kominers et al</p><p>A deep dive and tour through key business concepts from theory to practice, the latest episode of our podcast ‘web3 with a16z’ covers the tricky nuances of business strategy in a new world of open source. The discussion — which features a16z crypto research partner and Harvard Business School professor Scott Kominers in conversation with editor in chief Sonal Chokshi — covers foundational business frameworks yet also what changes in web3, as well as guidance for builders. </p><p>For decades, Michael Porter’s Five Forces model on the competitive forces that shape strategy helped companies understand the structure of their industry to “stake out a position that is more profitable and less vulnerable to attack” — but how do those assumptions change in web3? Where do so-called vampire attacks come in? And what even IS competition in web3, where so much is publicly available on blockchains?</p><p>The question throughout is basically how to compete when you're building in public… So we also go into the new moats of “community cohesion” and software “embeddedness” — and how network effects really work, beyond common misconceptions. Finally: since web3 changes the game altogether, what’s ahead for the evolution of business strategy overall?</p><p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/network-effects-moats-competitive-advantage-business-strategy-web3">listen to the discussion</a><br><a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1658516258579685376?s=46&amp;t=m_MyW3EHf_hr6YPWeAdbGA">share on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x050fe5">share on Farcaster</a></p><p>related:</p>  <p>Vampire attacks: A theory (and thread) on 'blood sucking' platform competition by John William Hatfield and Scott Duke Kominers (2023) — on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/vampire-attacks-competition/">a16zcrypto.com</a></p>  <p>Can web3 bring back competition to digital platforms? by Christian Catalini and Scott Duke Kominers (2022) — in <a href="https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/can-web3-bring-back-competition-to-digital-platforms/">Competition Policy International</a></p>  <p>Why build in web3 by Jad Esber and Scott Duke Kominers (2022) — in <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/why-build-in-web3">Harvard Business Review</a></p><p></p>   ▶️ Builder resources: On protocol to product, design, security, &amp; decision making  <p>Taking an idea, and turning it into a real product for people to use, is nothing short of alchemy. So it’s not easy… but several expert speakers at this year’s Crypto Startup School (our accelerator that connects builders with the resources, expertise, and networks they need) distilled their hard-earned experience, and journey through the idea maze, into guidance and frameworks for founders. </p><p>We shared the first batch of talks in our last <a href="https://a16zcrypto.substack.com/p/how-to-build-and-scale-in-web3">edition</a> (be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@a16zcrypto">subscribe to our channel</a> for the next releases), but subsequent batches cover the themes of “from whitepaper to reality”; product and design; leading and decision-making — as well as infrastructure, smart contracts, and security.

While the intention is to reduce any negative impact from cryptocurrency mining on local electricity prices and global pollution, it is far from obvious — from an economics perspective — that the other goals will follow.

<p>Public transaction history in blockchains represents one of their key features which, alongside immutability, aim to provide an alternative to CeFi. However, this transparency comes at a price: privacy. As a result, different solutions have been proposed, that preserve privacy while maintaining all the other benefits of blockchain technology, but there currently isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to this problem. For example, zero knowledge proofs convey the validity of a transaction batch without sharing any other details, but the underlying arithmetic circuits are both complex as well as computational intensive. Umbra proposes a system that relies completely on elliptic curve cryptography, employing multiple private-public key pairs to achieve stealth payments.</p><p>We were joined by Ben DiFrancesco, founder &amp; CEO of ScopeLift, to talk about Umbra's privacy preserving stealth token transfer system and if the need for privacy on blockchains outweighs any implicit UX frictions.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Ben’s background  Umbra's mission  How Umbra works  Non-interactive key distribution  Potential solutions (&amp; trade-offs) for Umbra's computational intensity  Generating private-public key pairs by the Umbra smart contract  User experience (UX) for senders and receivers  Fee structure for deterring griefing attacks  How Umbra works for ERC20 tokens &amp; NFTs  Privacy preserving withdrawals from stealth addresses  Privacy vs. UX friction  Smart wallets &amp; account abstraction  Prioritising privacy  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/BenDiFrancesco">Ben DiFrancesco on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/UmbraCash">Umbra on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ScopeLift">ScopeLift on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst.

 How to privacy enhance your apps and wallets — using NymConnect  Enjoy strong privacy protections via the Nym&nbsp;mixnet <p><a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a> is a one-button end user application that connects wallets and messaging apps to the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>NymConnect privacy-enhances your apps and wallets by protecting not just the content, but also your IP address and your communications patterns. This means nobody can trace who you are communicating with or de-anonymize you!</p><p>This blogpost will take you through the simple steps of how to use NymConnect and to secure the privacy of your applications.</p><p>NOTE: NymConnect is in Beta, and is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity (yet). NymConnect is the first step towards a general purpose Nym&nbsp;VPN.</p><p>Read on or&nbsp;watch:</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>When you connect a wallet or app to <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a> it will wrap your communications in several layers of encryption and send it through a gateway and the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>The <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/">mixnet</a> mixes your traffic with cover traffic and adds micro delays. This makes it impossible for an observer to trace and analyze your communications and it protects your IP&nbsp;address.</p><p>Communication patterns reveal more than people are aware of: your relationships, transaction histories, trading and spending habits, even psychological state of mind and your home address can be tracked&nbsp;down!</p><p>The Nym mixnet — and NymConnect — ensures that when you communicate online, you are speaking to and transacting with the person you intend to. And not some random stranger listening in!</p> Connect me&nbsp;up! <p>Right now, you can use NymConnect on your desktop computer for privacy-enhancing <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> messaging apps as well as <a href="https://electrum.org/#home">Electrum</a>, <a href="https://blockstream.com/green/">Blockstream Green</a> and <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> wallets via <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>. Here is how you do&nbsp;it:</p> Step 1: Download NymConnect <p>First thing is to download the application from the Nym website. NOTE NymConnect is in Beta mode and is only usable on a&nbsp;desktop!</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">Download now</a></p> Step 2: Turn on NymConnect <p>Open the application and click the big button to turn on the app. You will now see something called Socks5 address number and a port number. You will need these&nbsp;shortly…</p> Step 3: Configure your app/&nbsp;wallet   Open the app or wallet you want to privacy-enhance (lets use Telegram as an example&nbsp;here).  <p>2. Go to preferences or settings&gt; Advanced&gt; Connection type</p><p>3. Change your connection type to&nbsp;Socks5</p><p>4. Copy paste the Socks5 address number and your port number from NymConnect to your application</p> Step 3: You are connected! <p>Your app should now be connected to the Nym mixnet and privacy enhanced!</p><p>NOTE: your 3rd party app (Telegram, etc) will continue running through a socks5 proxy unless you deselect that option. So if NymConnect is not running your app traffic will not be coming through… so make sure to start up NymConnect again next time you open your computer!</p> Step 4: Aftercare… <p>The Nym mixnet is a decentralised network of independent operators.

(In technical terms a gateway or mix node might go offline). In that case, NymConnect will notify you stating that “your gateway is having issues”. You can then manually switch gateways.</p><p>Here is how you change gateways…</p>  If NymConnect is on, make sure to click the big button to turn it off&nbsp;first  Go to NymConnect and click on the top left&nbsp;burger  Go to “settings”&gt; “select your gateway” and switch it to manual. And click on “Network Explorer.” This will open a browser window with the explorer.  <p>4. Click on gateways and copy the Identity Key of one of the&nbsp;gateways</p><p>6. Paste the Identity Key of your chosen gateway in NymConnect.

 Sweating the details— part&nbsp;2 <p>At <a href="http://privy.io/">Privy</a>, we build simple tools to help you onboard and engage your users in web3. In this series, we break down some of the work it takes to create simple experiences with state of the art tooling in web3. <a href="https://blog.privy.io/sweating-the-details-6250f167638c">See part&nbsp;1</a>.</p><p>Multiplayer journeys make web3 products unique. By leveraging assets that can be used across apps and ecosystems, web3 powers novel experiences that can build on one another, where anyone can openly contribute to a protocol or support its assets, thereby adding to the ecosystem’s value.</p><p>The launch of our <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3-for-users-not-experts-52c692c25bb1">embedded wallets</a> raises some key questions for developers about interoperability:</p>  Can I ensure that my users have access to their assets across apps, even as they use embedded&nbsp;wallets?  If a user creates a wallet in my app, can they use this wallet, or its assets in another app like&nbsp;OpenSea?  <p>These questions apply to all wallets, but are particularly important for embedded wallets. Embedded wallets shift us from a wallet-centric mindset (where the user takes their assets with them using third-party software) to an app-centric mindset (where asset ownership is deeply integrated into the app experience).</p> Why interopability matters <p>Interoperability is the ability for data or assets to be freely moved from one system to another. It is essential to building rich experiences in web3 and helps unlock novel use cases beyond what any single company could&nbsp;build.</p><p>Practically speaking it boils down to two pragmatic concerns:</p>  Assets out — Will assets generated in your app have value elsewhere? Can your user take them to trade/spend/use?  Assets in — Can your app benefit from the assets your user has accumulated elsewhere? Do they need to buy crypto again (for gas, eg) if they have done it&nbsp;before?  <p>Historically, interoperability in web3 has been made possible by consumer crypto wallets. Users bring their own key management software (the wallet) to every app. The wallet acts as a bridge across apps and ecosystems, enabling the user to carry their assets with them, unlocking new value for the ecosystem.</p><p>However, <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3s-coming-of-age-c588af57c94d">wallets can cause quite a bit of friction for newcomers</a> who are not used to the self-custodial UX in&nbsp;web3.</p> Enter embedded&nbsp;wallets <p>Embedded wallets are tightly integrated into a given product — no third party extension or app download required. They give a user all of the benefits of a self-custodial system without requiring them to BYOW (bring your own wallet — download an extension, secure a 12-word mnemonic, etc).</p><p>But how does interoperability figure into this? Wallets must remain usable across apps. If I generate a wallet as part of my journey in app A, I must be able to take my assets to app B and&nbsp;beyond.</p> Embedded wallet interoperability, a story in three&nbsp;parts <p>Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of a user. Alice is new to crypto and may not even know the product she is using runs on decentralized rails. She signs up for MadRealities using her phone number (and gets a Privy embedded wallet), <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mad-realities-genesis-membership-pass">earning a rose</a> (NFT) in the process. Months later, Bob (her crypto-curious friend) tells her this rose is valuable and she should trade it on OpenSea. How can her embedded wallet enable this&nbsp;easily?</p><p>Option 1: Native wallet support across&nbsp;apps.</p><p>In this option, our embedded wallet system is supported across both apps, the asset originator and destination. That is both MadRealities and OpenSea integrate Privy natively so Alice can bring her wallet across both&nbsp;sites.</p><p>In this scenario, we must account for certain considerations:</p>  UX — embedded wallets can reduce user friction by integrating deeply into an app flow, and giving users an option to pre-approve certain transactions, for example. However, massive UX upside here carries real risk of a potential rogue app tricking a user into taking unwanted&nbsp;action.  Privacy — Automatically connecting a wallet across apps when a user logs in reveals a lot of information about the user. The wallet may be tied to sensitive on-chain information, and users must stay in control of whether they link accounts across apps like&nbsp;this.  <p>The prospects of embedded wallet integrations bringing self-custodial asset control across apps is exciting. But obviously it’s unrealistic to expect all apps to support the same wallet infrastructure in the near-term. This cannot be the end of the story. What if the app your user is going to (OpenSea in this instance) doesn’t support your user’s embedded&nbsp;wallet?</p><p>You really have two practical options:</p>  A WalletConnect integration  Provisioning a consumer wallet to go alongside the embedded&nbsp;wallet  <p>Option 2: the WalletConnect integration</p><p>WalletConnect was created in 2018 to make it easier for developers to integrate the long tail of wallets, and ensure users can connect to their app with any wallet. In fact, WalletConnect is an invaluable part of the <a href="https://www.privy.io/features/connectors">connector infrastructure Privy has built</a> for native users. While WalletConnect is fantastic for web3 users, it’s UX is very native to consumer self-custodial wallets and accordingly, some of its flows confuse web3 newcomers.</p><p>Back to Alice…<br>Using WalletConnect, Privy would appear as one of the available wallets in the WalletConnect interface and Alice could simply use this to connect her embedded wallet to any site that supports WalletConnect. But we must keep in mind where Alice is coming from as part of her&nbsp;journey.</p><p>The Newcomer Experience — New to web3, Alice thinks in terms of apps, not wallets. She is thinking about her assets (her MadRealities rose) not in terms of software (what wallet is securing these assets). This implicit change of frame is hard to pull&nbsp;off.</p>  Alice expects to log into OpenSea with her MadRealities account. Instead she sees WalletConnect, but may not know what that&nbsp;is.    From there Alice, if she knows to click it, she will be shown a list of available wallets in the market (or worse: a QR code). This is very intimidating for a newcomer. Now, she must pick Privy, which she may not know about. Expecting to access her MadRealities rose from OpenSea, Alice gets a crash course in the wallet&nbsp;market.  <p>Accordingly, our view of the landscape today is this: rather than let the user learn about wallets on their own, let’s proactively onboard them to a consumer wallet once they are ready.As your user is ready to leave their first app experience and head into the wider world of digital ownership, we want to give them the right tool for the&nbsp;journey.</p> The right tool at the right&nbsp;time <p>By the time Alice is ready to leave MadRealities for OpenSea to sell her NFT, she has a real incentive to deal with the friction of getting a&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Out of the box, <a href="https://docs.privy.io/guide/frontend/embedded/export">Privy supports simple key export</a> so you can easily prompt your user to copy their keys to an external wallet at the appropriate time. From there, they can use their embedded wallet in other apps, as well as continue to use it in your&nbsp;app.</p> The way&nbsp;ahead <p>Our work does not stop here. We are working with a number of wallet providers to develop one-click wallet migrations, enabling users to export their embedded wallet into an external wallet with a single click. Interoperability is a core part of the web3 user experience and we’re excited to see many builders in the space pushing to make assets usable across apps for all&nbsp;users.</p><p>We’re excited to share more on this front&nbsp;soon!</p> Some Lessons   Remember who your user is and how they got to your app. Knowing what they know and what they expect is powerful information. Make use of it to pick the best flows at a given&nbsp;moment.  Size the carrot and the stick. Through their journey through your app, consider your users’ incentives and motivations. By the time a user has a material reason to take assets from your ecosystem elsewhere, they are much more engaged than when they first came into your&nbsp;app.  <p>By supporting both external wallets and internal wallets, Privy is designed for all of your users, newcomers and experts alike, as they evolve through their web3 journey.

  Exploring Autonomous Agents: A Semi-Technical Dive  <p>Agents are all the rage, but their planning capabilities currently outpace their ability to act reliably. How do we make them truly autonomous?</p>   
	By Dan Chen	 



Published May 11, 2023
  







 
<p>Over the past several weeks, autonomous AI agents have taken the world by storm. AutoGPT is one of the fastest growing Github repos in history, rocketing past PyTorch, every major Python web framework, and Python itself (sorry Guido) in number of stars. It’s led to some pretty sweet—albeit cherry-picked— demos and has captured the imagination of Twitter thought leaders and AI doomers alike. In a weird twist of fate, the popularity of agents has probably accelerated AI doomerism more than it has accelerated progress towards the superintelligence doomers fear.</p>



<p>An agent’s primary distinction from LLMs is that they run in a self-directed loop, largely augmented by a lightweight prompting layer and some kind of persistence or memory. The architecture varies from agent to agent, with some focused on task prioritization and others taking a more conversational roleplaying approach. The use cases are far reaching, from personal assistants to automated GTM teams. If you’re looking for an excellent primer and thesis on agents, look no further than my colleague Lauren Reeder’s <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-agents-perspective/">post</a>. And if you’re looking for the cutting edge for this family of agents, there’s LangChain’s recent <a href="https://blog.langchain.dev/plan-and-execute-agents/">post</a> on Plan-and-Execute Agents.</p>



<p>Pretty exciting, but how far are we from this reality? In order to truly understand, I am a strong believer in getting to the nuts and bolts. This means getting your hands dirty with the code. So I sat down for an afternoon and took a quick look at the codebases for some popular agents. Here are some observations.</p>



 Implementation 



<p>The core autonomous agent loops are pretty straightforward. For instance, for AutoGPT, each agent has access to an initial prompt, a set of actions to execute, a history of messages, and a workspace where it can write executable code and files on the fly. An initial prompt might be something like “plan my daughter’s birthday—she really likes unicorns.” The agent then runs on a modified <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf">ReAct</a> loop and is able to critique its own action through a second chat completion call with a <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/1d26f6b69720a561237f4d94d08bd9fae232aebb/autogpt/agent/agent.py#L292">special prompt</a> that roughly boils down to: “review the proposed action and tell me whether it’s good or bad and why.” The agent calls the OpenAI chat completion endpoint with the following context: the original directive describing the goal of the agent (“plan a sweet unicorn-themed party”), some commands that represent procedural code the agent can run, as well as some short-term memory (the historical context of the agent’s prior reasoning and actions, up to the token limit). The text completion is formatted to a <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/ecf2ba12db11ff19bce359b842f810f0e2d09d6a/autogpt/json_utils/llm_response_format_1.json">JSON dict</a> of “thoughts” reasoning through the next action to take as well as the next selected action—potentially through another chat completion call. The agent pauses after each loop and waits for user input, which will be included in future context. The context and history can be persisted in storage: Pinecone, Redis, or more recently, Milvus or Weaviate—but honestly a JSON dump works just fine.</p>



<p>Some immediate observations: Although the demos can be astounding, agent implementations are pretty straightforward under the hood. AutoGPT is in essence a light prompting layer running on a recursive loop with persistent memory and which can write executable code on the fly. LangChain has a partial <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/experimental/autonomous_agents/autogpt">implementation</a> of AutoGPT where they augmented their base agent with the optional human feedback component. It’s important to note: LangChain is a framework that allows for the implementation of various agents, including not just AutoGPT, but also BabyAGI and direct translations of existing research (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf">ReAct</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00445.pdf">MRKL</a> – <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/agents">here</a>). AutoGPT is an agent implementation that has made specific decisions on overall architecture and prompting strategy.</p>



 <code>    def generate_prompt_string(self) -&gt; str:
        """Generate a prompt string.
        Returns:
            str: The generated prompt string.
        """
        formatted_response_format = json.dumps(self.response_format, indent=4)
        prompt_string = (
            f"Constraints:\n{self._generate_numbered_list(self.constraints)}\n\n"
            f"Commands:\n"
            f"{self._generate_numbered_list(self.commands, item_type='command')}\n\n"
            f"Resources:\n{self._generate_numbered_list(self.resources)}\n\n"
            f"Performance Evaluation:\n"
            f"{self._generate_numbered_list(self.performance_evaluation)}\n\n"
            f"You should only respond in JSON format as described below "
            f"\nResponse Format: \n{formatted_response_format} "
            f"\nEnsure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads"
        )

        return prompt_string

// Prompting strategy in the LangChain AutoGPT <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/423f497168e3a8982a4cdc4155b15fbfaa089b38/langchain/experimental/autonomous_agents/autogpt/prompt_generator.py">implementation</a></code> 



<p>An immediately achievable next step to making these agents useful in practice is expanding their action space: <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/tools">LangChain tools</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins">AutoGPT plugins</a>. These modules define the extended set of commands that an agent can perform. Examples include searching Google or writing some code on the fly. The open source community might expand this finite set of actions with, for instance, Twitter integrations to let the agent read and post tweets, or payments integrations to navigate checkout flows. This is where LangChain and AutoGPT excel: due to recent attention, developers flock to these projects to build plugins. It’s a really interesting moat where, similar to proof-of-work consensus in blockchains, developers are incentivized to build on the most complete plugin ecosystem—the longest chain, so to speak. The hard part is that the set of actions a user can take on the internet is near infinite. To get agents that can do everything humans can do online the long term solution is to have agents reliably write their own procedural code to gracefully handle novel cases, but we need a step function improvement in models before this future is within reach.</p>



LangChain <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/423f497168e3a8982a4cdc4155b15fbfaa089b38/langchain/tools">tools</a>



<p>Currently, agents run like your run-of-the-mill MBA graduate or entry level consultant: they are very good at describing plausible solutions but very poor at executing on them. Put another way, the Act component of ReAct performs poorly in unconstrained environments (ReAct is constrained to a predefined action space), and it is clear that the agent isn’t able to reason at a deeper level about novel situations or problem solve on the fly. A concrete example of this is that agents often hit a wall when the output of an action isn’t what they expect: they try to pull up a tweet, hit a 403: Unauthorized error, and are not quite sure what to do next as they have no notion that calling Twitter might give a different response if the user is not logged in. Practically speaking, the current generation of agents still need quite a bit of human intervention and direction to be effective.</p>



 So what’s next? 



<p>Building a working autonomous agent in an unconstrained environment is an open research problem. We are still far from this reality. That said, models are improving at an accelerating clip. AutoGPT-like agents represent an interesting practical experiment on agents in an unconstrained environment. Through experimentation and iteration on architecture and prompting strategy and enough open source contributions in the action space (plugins), this approach could plausibly start to bridge the gap between AI doomer fantasy and reality. Here is my agent wishlist to try to get us there:<br></p>



 
 A better headless browser. The kinds of agent directives that work best are the ones that involve researching things on the internet. This works well when the agent starts with a <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/1d26f6b69720a561237f4d94d08bd9fae232aebb/autogpt/commands/google_search.py">Google search</a>. It works less well when the agent then visits an arbitrary web page. Not only do agents need to understand and gracefully handle various HTTP errors, but also parse an arbitrarily large webpage and potentially execute Javascript to fully mimic a human user experience. Then, the agent would have to map the perceived UX to a limited context window. This is a very hard problem, but if you have a potential solution, <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/1d26f6b69720a561237f4d94d08bd9fae232aebb/autogpt/commands/web_selenium.py">here</a> <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/423f497168e3a8982a4cdc4155b15fbfaa089b38/langchain/tools/requests">are</a> some places to start. 
 



 
 Better command selection. Currently, chat completion is responsible for command selection (“<a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/3b74d2150e26ec9387e40cf65a75d8a995d8c9f3/autogpt/prompts/prompt.py#L13">determine which command to use…</a>”). This leads to some pretty crazy hallucinations: for instance, the birthday planning agent shown below tries to reference as an argument a file that doesn’t actually exist. There is probably some clever combination of prompting and procedural code that can minimize hallucinations and help guide the agent in the right direction. For instance, you could try cosine similarity between the embedding vectors across more descriptive versions of current commands and the chat completion response. Or you could try to craft the prompt in a way to minimize edge cases or restrict the creativity of completion outputs. It’s unclear what the right solution is, but there is a lot of room for improvement here. As an aside, this a great opportunity to explore <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04761.pdf">toolformers</a> at the model level. 
 



 <code>    {
      ...
      "speak": "Let's start by analyzing any previous conversations or notes we have about the daughter's interests and preferences for her birthday party. This will help us come up with creative and unique ideas for themes, decorations, activities, and entertainment that align with her incentives and preferences. Then we can move on to managing the logistics of the party, including venue selection, guest list management, catering, and budgeting. Finally, we should anticipate and address potential issues or challenges that may arise during the planning and execution of the party to minimize stress and maximize satisfaction."
    },
    "command": {
      "name": "read_file",
      "args": { "filename": "daughter_preferences.txt" }
    }

// Example hallucination (no such file exists!)
</code> 



 
 Optimizations around the action space. While the LangChain agent is parameterized by default (you decide which tools to pass on instantiation), AutoGPT defaults to a set of out of the box <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/tree/master/autogpt/commands">actions</a>. Some of these actions give agents a ton of functionality: they can read, write and execute arbitrary code and files. In the best case, this will make agents truly autonomous and self-improving. However, agents are not yet able to generate code and files in productive ways more reliably than they are to fail or hallucinate in doing so. This leads agents to get stuck more often than it leads to novel and working outcomes. The suggestion here is threefold: 1) do a bit of “hyperparameter optimization” around which subset of actions lead to the best agents—and for LangChain, include this as the default set of tools; 2) allow agents to change the action set on the fly, either automatically once they have hit an edge case and run into a loop (should be easy to detect) or manually on user input; 3) build out guardrails, input validation, and better failure mode handling for existing actions (similar to the suggestion for a better headless browser). Also, for AutoGPT, potentially remove some of the more powerful “out there” commands until the models get better. 
 



 
 A discriminator to rank actions. The recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf">Generative Agents</a> paper described a strategy that ranked observations in memory by some linear combination of “recency,” “importance,” and “relevance.” We could try implementing something like this for both memory context and task selection/action prioritization. The devil is in the details. For instance, the paper suggested a separate prompt to rank importance (“on a scale of 1 to 10…”); however, depending on the use case, “importance” could be better estimated by a numerical model (e.g. likelihood estimator) depending on the objective. There is likely no one size fits all solution, and the best approach is likely to start with a simple prompt and go from there. 
 



<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf">Ranking actions</a> from the Generative Agents paper



 
 More tools and plugins. Over the past two weeks, the number of approved plugins on AutoGPT has ballooned from 2 to almost 20—from Telegram to Wikipedia to crypto. LangChain <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/423f497168e3a8982a4cdc4155b15fbfaa089b38/langchain/tools">tools</a> are just as comprehensive. Each additional working plugin expands an agent’s action space and gets it that much closer to mimicking a human on the internet. 



 Agent-to-agent messaging. As agents are deployed in the wild, they can start communicating with each other in novel ways. These ideas are explored in multi-agent simulation environments, but AutoGPT and other unconstrained agents currently operate in single player mode. Messaging could introduce the possibility of more complex relationships between agents with different directives, such as student-coach or competitive peer-peer. This would require a persistence layer for agents, the ability for agents to query all other agents, and a messaging layer, potentially with a discriminator to rank messages by importance that are received between each iteration of the agent (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/nicktindle">@nicktindle</a> for this observation). 



 Better models. This is a must-have for the frequent gaps in logic the agent exhibits. We don’t quite get there with GPT-4—maybe the next generation of models? In addition, current autonomous agents are slow and expensive. Perhaps it is worth exploring fine-tuning on agent trajectories to make them faster, cheaper and effective for a subset of tasks. Toolformers remain underexplored but promising. 
 



<p>If there is one takeaway from all of this, agents’ reasoning ability is pretty good but their action-taking aspect is still pretty rudimentary. In research, agents largely run in constrained environments with limited abilities to act, like toddlers playing with toy cars in a sandbox. With autonomous commercial agents, we are seeing the first experimental attempts to have agents run in the wild unconstrained. We are giving these toddlers actual cars, so to speak. This is exciting and unprecedented, and would represent a zero-to-one improvement in agents once they work reliably. However, these toddlers don’t know how to drive and are currently crashing into most obstacles that come their way. Do we replace the cars with Tonkas or do we hope that the toddlers grow up? I have made some suggestions on the toy car side in the hopes of making some surprisingly competent toddlers, but if we want truly working autonomous agents, we also need to wait for better models.</p>

 Why wallets need a&nbsp;mixnet <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/new-mixnet-integration-nym-for-monero-f0a3068e803f">Monero</a> just integrated Nym and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/configuring-nymconnect-with-electrum-wallet-3dd6e429cc8e">Electrum</a> and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/how-mixnets-led-to-bitcoin-blockstream-green-supported-by-nym-connect-85d2ee325012">Blockstream Green</a> wallets were integrated already a while ago. What is all that about and why do digital wallets need a&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p>Wallets are one of the core elements of the decentralised web. Not only do they store your tokens, wallets also act as portals! They are access points into different chains and services. In this sense, the tokens being stored in wallets are less a currency as we know it and more like credentials — the means by which users can access, benefit from and participate in different online&nbsp;worlds.</p><p>The shift from cash to digital tokens has opened up many new use-cases, but it has also brought new problems. Whenever something “goes digital” this means it is translated into bits of information. And these bits are ripe for the picking: data and metadata that can be vacuumed from the tubes of the internet, for profiling, targeting and exploitation.</p><p>As more of the services we use and rely on move to tokenised systems (including, in many countries, increasingly large swathes of the public sector), it is vital that we build digital wallet technologies that are private by&nbsp;default.</p> Crypto is secure….isn’t it? <p>Many users of crypto wallets assume that their activities are private. After all, wasn’t the point of Web3 to do things differently from Web 2.0 and make sure people instead of big tech would be in control of online information? There are several key reasons why this is not the case. We’ll look at some of them&nbsp;here…</p><p>Wallet design. Digital wallets are not designed from a privacy-first standpoint. They are designed to fulfil a business case, and by extension to generate revenue. Privacy is a secondary concern, and indeed may be actively detrimental to the business interests of the infrastructure provider.</p><p>There are plenty of examples — in 2022, the <a href="https://decrypt.co/111451/bankrupt-crypto-lender-celsius-reveals-thousands-of-users-transaction-histories-in-court-filing/">Celcius bankruptcy resulted in the publication of the transaction history of half a million of the platform’s users</a>, along with all the information required to de-anonymise them. The publication was demanded by the judge overseeing the Chapter 11 process — a clear demonstration that the only way to collect data safely is to simply not collect it at&nbsp;all.</p><p>The good news is there are several privacy-first wallet solutions. These all come from the open source community. <a href="https://electrum.org/#home">Electrum</a> is the most popular wallet for the privacy-minded, and for good reason — it is beyond the control of any single party, and is not hostage to corporate fortune. And <a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/">Wasabi Wallet</a> runs on the Tor network by default, offering ways to further improve security. But even privacy wallets like Wasabi that use Tor and coin mixers <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/de-mixing-wasabi-coinjoin-transactions-a-deep-dive-into-chainalysis-deanonymizing-claims/">face problems</a> by virtue of public ledgers. Journalist Laura Shin and blockchain surveillance company Chainalysis apparently<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2022/02/22/exclusive-austrian-programmer-and-ex-crypto-ceo-likely-stole-11-billion-of-ether/?sh=7b7d8e367f58"> managed to ‘de-mix’ a Wasabi transaction</a>. Also Electrum cannot guarantee privacy on its own due to a fundamental flaw in the design of the internet: network traffic and its metadata is&nbsp;exposed.</p> It’s the metadata… <p>Even wallets with strong privacy protections are vulnerable at the network layer, the layer where communications traffic criss-crosses the world. This traffic, even when encrypted, leaks metadata and reveals your IP address. Metadata is the information about a message rather than the content: the size of the message, timing, device it was sent from and so on. This metadata reveals patterns that — especially now with AI powered surveillance — reveal in detail what is going on. And this includes all crypto transactions!</p><p>The peer-to-peer transaction broadcasts of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more broadly are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/why-mixnets-are-needed-to-make-bitcoin-private">entirely exposed</a>. And this allows an observer to link for example your Bitcoin public key to your IP address and can even give an approximate location of where you&nbsp;live…</p><p>In order to solve this, the Nym mixnet protects your metadata and IP address. It does this by obfuscating traffic patterns. Packets are encrypted so they look the same and are routed across a large network through three layers of mix nodes, each mixing the packets with others so that they are entirely untraceable.</p><blockquote><a href="https://electrum.org/#home">Electrum</a> and recently the <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/">Monero</a> are already integrated with Nym! They can be used via <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Watch <a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject/status/1656318199699324931">how</a>…</blockquote><p>Nym provides the infrastructural privacy foundations on which wallets, DApps and other tools can be built. The mixnet and its benefits are platform-agnostic, and can be used with any existing or new blockchain.</p><p>How does Nym compare to Tor? <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/vpns-tor-i2p-how-does-nym-compare-8576824617b8">Read&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>If you are a wallet developer and want to integrate with Nym — <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/">start&nbsp;here</a>!</p> Wallets beyond&nbsp;Web3 <p>Wallets will shortly be the cornerstone of many people’s financial lives. Cash is being thwarted, trust in financial institutions is ebbing away, and in many so-called “developing” countries people have jumped straight from physical money to some form of digital token, bypassing the wildly inefficient structures erected by Western financial institutions. Payment rails, clearing houses, and the wastage associated with them already look antiquated.</p><p>But beneath this supposed surface story of legacy finance fading away, big finance is joining forces with big tech pushing out digital payment systems via cards and smart-phones. This is much bigger than Web3 and this shift from cash comes with major consequences.</p><p>First of all, the shift to digital payment systems means we are headed towards a veritable explosion of sensitive economic data and metadata traversing networks. Don’t underestimate just how much your purchasing habits can reveal about your life, relationships and state of&nbsp;mind!</p><p>Secondly, the shift from cash to digital payments means a shift in power towards this new coalition between big tech and big finance. The invention of Bitcoin nearly fifteen years ago was exactly in anticipation of the surge in financial surveillance that was to come. And the movement for privacy preserving e-cash is still&nbsp;alive!</p><p>Nym will be opening this year’s <a href="https://www.cpdpconferences.org/">Computers, Privacy and Data Protection Conference</a> in Brussels, to make sure the issue of digital payments and privacy remains on the&nbsp;agenda!</p>  Cloud Money, Data Privacy and Sovereignty — What Is At Stake And What Can Be&nbsp;Done?

<p>Tokenisation and real estate are a match made in heaven. Thus, it is important to understand what goes into tokenising real estate before embarking on your tokenisation journey. In this article, we will discuss how to tokenise real estate, in addition to all the things you need to consider when tokenising real estate, as well as the possible challenges that are out there when it comes to tokenising real estate! Let’s first start with a brief introduction to the process of tokenisation.</p>



 Key takeaways  



 
 Tokenising real estate consists of 3 main steps, namely the pre-tokenisation, tokenisation, and post-tokenisation step. 



 The pre-tokenisation step consists of formalising the value of the asset, verifying ownership, establishing property management and maintenance processes, establishing various legal requirements, and researching regulatory requirements. 



 The tokenisation step consists of selecting the right blockchain, determining the token standard, determining the token structure, setting up the legal framework, selecting the right platform for tokenisation, minting the tokens, and integrating off-chain data. 



 The post-tokenisation step consists of selling the tokens, managing the property, monitoring the regulatory environment, and providing investor updates. 



 The tokenisation of real estate comes with many legal and regulatory considerations and technical challenges. 



 The tokenisation of real estate opens up many new opportunities such as new ways of funding, fractional ownership, unlocking liquidity, new investment avenues, and more. 
 



 Brief intro to the tokenisation process 



<p>Tokenisation is the process of creating a (blockchain-enabled) digital twin of a real world asset. This process has gained significant attention in recent times, as it allows for the fractional ownership and trading of assets that were previously illiquid, such as real estate, art, or even intellectual property. As explained more in-depth in our “<a href="https://zaisan.io/tokenisation-real-world-assets-explained/">tokenisation of real world assets explained</a>” article, the process of tokenisation can be broken down into three main steps: pre-tokenisation, tokenisation, and post-tokenisation.</p>



<p>The pre-tokenisation step involves formalising the value of the asset, verifying ownership, and ensuring the proper processes are in place for maintenance, management, and legal compliance. The tokenisation step involves creating a digital representation of the asset in the form of tokens and ensuring that all relevant information about the asset is accurately represented on the blockchain. Oracles are a common solution to enable the connection between traditional databases and the blockchain. Finally, the post-tokenisation step involves the perpetual management of both the physical asset and the tokens. This includes their distribution and sale through specialised marketplaces or offerings.</p>



<p>Tokenisation has numerous benefits for the real estate industry. Firstly, it allows for fractional ownership, which enables investors to purchase and trade smaller portions of a property. This creates opportunities for smaller investors to enter the market and diversify their portfolios with real estate assets. Tokenisation also provides liquidity to real estate assets, allowing investors to buy and sell their tokens on secondary markets. This means that investors can realise their returns without waiting for the property to be sold. Finally, tokenisation can provide increased transparency and traceability of ownership. Tracking each token on the blockchain reduces the potential for fraud and disputes.</p>



<p>However, it also comes with its own set of challenges, including regulatory compliance, data privacy, and the potential for fraudulent activities. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the risks and benefits associated with tokenising a particular asset before embarking on the process. We will discuss the potential challenges more in-depth later in this article. Let’s first take a more in-depth look at what you need to consider when tokenising real estate.</p>



Watch it<a href="https://zaisan.webinargeek.com/tokenising-rwa-on-demand"> here</a> 



 What to consider when tokenising real estate  



<p>Tokenising real estate is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various aspects. So before delving into the actual tokenisation process, let’s take a look at the following essential aspects to consider when tokenising real estate:</p>



 
 Regulatory compliance  



 Legal structure  



 Fractionalisation  



 Alternative financing options  



 Liquidity &amp; trading  
 



 Regulatory compliance  



<p>Let’s start with regulatory compliance. One of the key regulatory requirements to consider when tokenising real estate is compliance with securities laws. Most jurisdictions consider the tokenisation of real estate as a security offering and subject it to the same regulatory requirements as traditional securities offerings. This also includes complying with securities laws related to registration, disclosure, and anti-fraud measures.</p>



<p>Additionally, anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations must be carefully considered and complied with when tokenising real estate. This is particularly important when dealing with cross-border transactions, as different countries have different AML regulations and requirements. Ensuring a clear definition of the ownership of the real estate is crucial.  Also, there should be proper legal agreements in place to govern the rights and obligations of all parties involved.</p>



<p>Moreover, it is important to note that the regulatory framework for tokenisation of real estate is still developing. The legal requirements can vary widely depending on the country or region in question. Therefore, one should seek legal advice and guidance to ensure that they meet all legal and regulatory requirements. Additionally, as the regulatory framework develops it is important to monitor any changes to prevent non-compliance with new regulations.</p>



<p>Lastly, while it is a key aspect to consider when tokenising real estate, regulatory complexity can be reduced by offering the tokenised real estate in smaller and more specific regions, as well as by tokenising real estate in jurisdictions which have more clear regulations surrounding tokenising real estate.</p>



 Legal structure  



<p>Another important aspect to consider when tokenising real estate is the legal structure. While the legal structure for tokenising retail and residential buildings is relatively similar, it is necessary to take into account the ownership structure and protection of underlying assets. This entails selecting the appropriate legal entity for holding the real estate. Namely, a limited liability company (LLC) or a real estate investment trust (REIT), defining ownership rights and obligations, as well as setting up appropriate governance structures and auditing measures.</p>



<p>In addition to selecting the right legal entity for holding the real estate, it is also crucial to establish ownership agreements that clearly define the rights and obligations of all parties involved in the tokenisation process. This includes establishing clear rules for how the real estate will be managed, maintained, and potentially sold in the future. It is important to consult with legal and financial experts to ensure that the ownership agreements are comprehensive and cover all necessary aspects of the tokenisation process.</p>



 Fractionalisation 



<p>As mentioned in our previous article about tokenising real world assets, fractionalisation of real estate through tokenisation allows for more flexible ownership structures. This makes it more appealing to a wider range of investors. It also enables investors to purchase smaller portions of an asset, making real estate investments accessible to those who may not have the capital to purchase an entire property.</p>



<p>However, it is important to also consider the potential downside of fractionalisation, as it can lead to the fragmentation of ownership. As more investors become involved in the ownership of the asset, it becomes increasingly difficult to reach consensus on decisions related to the asset. This can result in conflicts between token holders, which can ultimately impact the value of the asset. Therefore, it is crucial to have a clear governance structure in place to manage decision-making and conflict resolution among token holders.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is essential to ensure that the real estate asset being tokenised is properly evaluated and accurately reflected in the tokenised value. This includes conducting a thorough assessment of the property’s physical condition, location, and market value. Accurately evaluating the property can help prevent overvaluation or undervaluation of the asset. Consequently,  which can have negative implications for both the issuer and investors.</p>



 Alternative financing options  



<p>As more investors are able to invest in real estate projects through tokenisation, it can provide alternative financing options for projects that may not have been possible before. Tokenisation can open up access to a broader range of investors. Including those who may not have been able to invest in traditional real estate investments. This can provide more flexibility for project financing. Furthermore, it may lead to increased competition for funding, potentially lowering the cost of capital for real estate projects.</p>



<p>However, it is important to carefully consider the potential impact on the financial structure of the real estate asset. Tokenisation can lead to changes in ownership rights, cash flow distribution, and financing arrangements. It is important to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of tokenisation to ensure that it aligns with the project’s financing goals and objectives. Additionally, it is also important to ensure that token holders have a clear understanding of the financial structure of the asset. This includes any potential risks, limitations, and liabilities associated with token ownership. Proper due diligence and risk assessment should be conducted to ensure that the tokenisation of real estate projects is done in a responsible and effective manner.</p>



 Liquidity &amp; trading  



<p>The final aspect to consider is the liquidity and trading aspect of tokenising real estate. As also discussed in some of the other aspects of tokenising real estate, tokenisation has the potential to increase the liquidity of real estate assets. It allows for the creation of digital assets that can be traded quickly and efficiently. This can be beneficial for investors who are looking for an easy way to exit their investments. However, it is important to consider the potential impact on the trading of the real estate asset. For instance, tokenisation can result in changes to the underlying value of the asset, market demand, and price volatility.</p>



<p>One of the advantages of tokenisation is that it allows for the creation of smoother secondary markets, which can increase liquidity and trading volume. This can also benefit investors who are looking to sell their tokens and exit their investments quickly. However, it is important to ensure that there is adequate market demand for the tokenised asset. The market cannot be too illiquid. Investors should also consider the potential risks associated with market volatility. The value of the tokenised asset can fluctuate rapidly in response to changes in market conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to have a well-defined exit strategy in place that takes into account these potential risks and benefits of tokenisation.</p>







<p>All in all, tokenising real estate requires careful consideration of various aspects such as regulatory compliance, the legal structure, fractionalisation, alternative financing options, and liquidity and trading. By addressing these key considerations, tokenisation can offer significant benefits for both investors and issuers. However, before embarking on a tokenisation project it is crucial to do a thorough assessment of the potential risks and benefits involved.</p>



 How to tokenise real estate 



<p>Now you are aware of the things you need to consider when tokenising real estate. Let’s take a deeper look at the exact steps involved in every stage of tokenising real estate.</p>



 Pre-tokenisation steps for real estate  



 
 Formalising the value of the real estate asset 



 Verifying ownership of the real estate asset 



 Ensuring the right processes are in place for maintenance and management of the property 



 Establishing legal requirements for liquidations, dispute resolutions, and enforcement 



 Review of the regulatory requirements 
 



<p>During the pre-tokenisation step there are various things to do in the real, non-digital, world before the asset can get tokenised. One of these steps is formalising the value of the real estate. This involves assessing the value of the property based on various factors such as location, size, condition, and potential for income or appreciation. Valuation is typically done by a licensed appraiser who provides an appraisal report that outlines the value of the property. Determining the value of the tokens that will be created and sold on the blockchain is crucial at this step.</p>



<p>The verification of ownership is also critical in the pre-tokenisation process for real estate assets. This involves conducting title searches, surveys, and reviewing legal documentation to ensure that the person or entity claiming ownership of the property has a legitimate claim to it. This step helps to avoid disputes over ownership of the asset in the future.</p>



<p>In addition to verifying ownership, it is important to have processes in place for the maintenance and management of the physical property. This includes tasks such as property management, repairs, and maintenance of the property. Establishing a maintenance plan and budget is crucial to ensuring that the physical asset remains in good condition and retains its value over time. Furthermore, in this stage, it is also important to establish how the property can be used.</p>



<p>Another part of this step is establishing the legal requirements for liquidations, dispute resolutions, and rule enforcement. Establishing these is a prerequisite for tokenisation to occur. This includes creating contracts, deeds, and insurance policies that cover the ownership and use of the property. Having these legal requirements in place helps to mitigate risk and provides a framework for addressing any disputes or issues that may arise during or after the tokenisation process.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is important to do a careful analysis of the regulatory requirements before you start the tokenisation process. This analysis should look at the regulatory requirements for tokenising real estate, as well as the regulatory requirements for offering tokenised assets in the specific jurisdiction(s) in which you plan on tokenising the property as well as the specific jurisdiction(s) in which you plan on distributing the tokenised asset.</p>



 Tokenisation steps for real estate  



 
 Selecting the right blockchain for the tokenisation 



 Identify the type of token standard that will be used 



 Determine the token structure 



 Prepare the legal framework for the issuance of the tokens 



 Choose a platform to use for the tokenisation 



 Minting the tokens 



 Ensure all relevant information about the asset is represented on-chain 
 



<p>After all pre-tokenisation steps are completed you can move on to the actual tokenisation. The tokenisation process for real estate starts with selecting a blockchain on which you will tokenise your asset. This part is critical, as it determines the type of token standards, marketplaces, and technical abilities at your disposal. It is important to research these areas and make an informed decision about the blockchain you plan to use for the tokenisation process.</p>



<p>Once you have found a blockchain that matches your needs, you can select the specific token standard that you will use for your token. The token standard determines whether a token is fungible or non-fungible.  Also, what kind of other properties it has, or can have. Generally speaking, a common token standard such as the commonly used ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum can be used for this. But with various purpose-built real estate token standards on the rise on various protocols, it’s worth keeping an eye out for more specific token standards that better suit the needs of tokenised real estate.</p>



<p>Determining the token structure follows the selection of the token standard. This refers to the number of tokens to be issued and their value. This is based on the value of the underlying real estate asset. Then, the legal framework for the issuance of the tokens is prepared, including documentation of ownership and the legal rights associated with the tokens.</p>



<p>The next crucial decision is to choose a suitable platform for the tokenisation process. In order to ensure that the chosen platform aligns with the requirements of the real estate asset being tokenised, one must carefully consider factors such as scalability, security, and cost. And while offering the tokens on a marketplace is typically part of the post-tokenisation process, it is worth noting that certain marketplaces offer an integrated tokenisation solution. These platforms provide the ability to carry out the tokenisation process and mint the tokens directly on their marketplace. This is a more streamlined approach that can make everything more efficient by eliminating the need for separate token minting procedures.</p>



<p>However, if the chosen marketplace or platform does not have built-in token minting capabilities, alternative options are available. In this case, you can either mint the tokens independently or collaborate with a technology partner. Regardless of the decisions in this part of the tokenisation step, it is important to ensure your tokens are ready for sale and/or distribution before the post-tokenisation step.</p>



<p>Lastly, in order to ensure that all relevant information about the asset is accurately represented on the blockchain, including the property’s location, size, ownership, and legal rights associated with the tokens, it is essential to utilise oracles to integrate relevant off-chain data with the blockchain. These oracles collect data from traditional databases and broadcast it to the blockchain. Information that would have to get updated regularly would be any information regarding expenses and (rental) income, maintenance and repairs, etc. Another option for managing this information would be pointing to a regular database from the blockchain. Although, generally speaking, the use of oracles to put this off-chain information on-chain is preferred. It is more transparent and prevents the loss of data in case anything happens with the regular database.</p>



 Post-tokenisation steps for real estate  



 
 Distribute/sell the tokenised assets through specialised marketplaces or offerings 



 Perpetual management of the property and the tokens based on the rules previously set 



 Continuous monitoring of the regulatory environment 



 Providing ongoing investor updates 
 



<p>Once someone creates tokenised real estate assets, the next step is to distribute or sell them through specialised marketplaces or offerings. These marketplaces typically enable buyers to access assets either directly from the seller or through a secondary market. Additionally, these marketplaces can provide investors with an opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate assets, which can be particularly attractive for those who do not have the financial resources to purchase an entire property, or want easier access to foreign real estate.</p>



<p>Once the tokenised real estate asset has been sold/distributed (or is being sold/distributed), the perpetual management of both the physical asset and the tokens is key. This includes managing things such as repairs, insurance, leasing, etc. of the physical property, as well as the ongoing management of information about the token on-chain. The perpetual management of the physical asset may involve hiring a property manager to handle day-to-day operations such as maintenance and leasing. Meanwhile, the management of the tokens may require the ongoing monitoring of the blockchain platform used for the tokenisation to ensure that the tokens continue to function properly and that all relevant information is accurately represented.</p>



<p>In this part of the tokenisation process it is also important to continuously monitor the regulatory environment to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes in laws and regulations could impact the ability to distribute or sell the tokenised assets, as well as the ongoing management of the asset.</p>



<p>Finally, providing ongoing investor updates is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and trust. This could include regular financial reporting, updates on property management activities, and other relevant information. Communication with investors can also help to build relationships and foster a sense of community among token holders.</p>







 The challenges of tokenising real estate  



<p>While there are clear benefits to tokenising real estate, there is also a multitude of challenges that need to be considered in order to prevent issues down the line. These challenges can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Legal complexity  



 Technical challenges  



 Adoption and education  
 



 Legal complexity  



<p>The legal complexity of tokenising real estate is one of the biggest challenges in this field. There are many legal and regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome before a property can be tokenised. In particular, the ownership and transfer of real estate is subject to a variety of laws and regulations that can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Creating a standardised tokenisation process that can be applied globally can be difficult due to this.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the legal framework for tokenisation is still in its infancy. This means that there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the legality of the process in many countries. This can create significant barriers to adoption. Investors and issuers alike may be hesitant to get involved with a technology that is not yet fully understood from a legal perspective.</p>



<p>Another legal challenge associated with tokenising real estate is the issue of cross-border transactions. Securities laws and regulations differ significantly across different jurisdictions, which can create difficulties when selling security tokens across borders. In particular, issuers and investors may need to comply with complex rules around cross-border offerings and sales, which can be a significant barrier to entry for smaller investors.</p>



<p>Additionally, different countries may have different rules around the transfer of real estate, which can further complicate the legal picture. As a result, it is important to carefully consider which jurisdictions to target when offering tokenised real estate.</p>



 Technical challenges  



<p>Tokenising real estate also brings technical challenges. It requires a secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure capable of handling large transactions of high value assets. The blockchain platform must ensure that the tokens can be easily traded, while also providing transparency and security for investors. While most modern blockchains are perfectly capable of these tasks, it is also important that the marketplaces on top of these blockchains have the required capabilities, such as the ability to oversee the perpetual management of the physical property and the tokens, managing the distribution of profits, the opportunity to resolve disputes, and more. While more and more marketplaces and platforms with these capabilities are being developed, it is important to tackle this challenge by monitoring what is out there and bringing technically proficient members or partners on board to assist you with the process in the meantime.</p>



<p>Another technical challenge is the integration of off-chain information with the blockchain. As discussed earlier, tokenising real estate requires the sharing of various off-chain information, including property valuations, surveys, and legal documentation. Either through oracles or other mechanisms, the information must be accurately represented on the blockchain. Ensuring the accuracy of this information is critical to the functioning of the tokens and the transparency of the investment. Moreover, the integration of off-chain information with the blockchain raises additional technical challenges, such as data privacy and security, which also vary per jurisdiction.</p>



 Adoption and education challenges  



<p>Another challenge of tokenising real estate is the need for education and adoption. Tokenisation is a relatively new concept with many investors being unfamiliar with the benefits and risks associated with this type of investment. In this stage, education is crucial to ensure that investors understand the technology, the risks and opportunities involved, as well as the legal and regulatory framework. Moreover, real estate professionals, such as property managers and developers, will also need to be educated about tokenisation and how it can benefit their businesses.</p>



<p>Adoption of tokenisation may also face difficulties due to the conservative nature of the real estate industry. Real estate has traditionally been a relatively stable and conservative investment. Many investors and professionals may be hesitant to adopt new technologies or investment structures. Convincing these individuals and professionals of the benefits of tokenisation, as well as assisting them with actually tokenising their real estate, will require significant effort and time.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, tokenising real estate opens up many new opportunities such as new ways of funding, fractional ownership, unlocking liquidity, new investment avenues, and more. However, it is crucial to carefully consider the complex legal landscape and to address the various considerations in order to ensure a successful tokenisation process.</p>



<p>Working with a <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/tokenisation/">knowledgeable tokenisation partner</a> can prove invaluable in navigating these challenges, providing expert guidance on both the technical and legal aspects of the tokenisation process. All in all, tokenising real estate can be a complex, yet very rewarding process if done correctly.</p>

<p>This is the 25th post in an <a>ongoing, series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave browsers. This post describes work done by Staff Engineer Aleksey Khoroshilov and was written by VP of Privacy Engineering Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>Most Web browsers are finally getting serious about limiting third-party tracking on the Web and—while no browser is as aggressive as Brave—third-party trackers are taking notice of the trend. In response, third-parties are increasingly relying on first-party storage to continue tracking users. Forgetful Browsing is the first in a series of upcoming tools Brave has planned to continue protecting Brave users and address first-party reidentification.</p>
<p>Starting with desktop version 1.53, and Android version 1.54 <a>1</a>, Brave browsers will include a new feature called “Forgetful Browsing,” which allows users to always clear cookies and other storage when the site is closed. Forgetful Browsing can help you:</p>
 
 Be automatically logged out of a site when it’s closed 
 Avoid being rate limited by a site (e.g., “you have X remaining articles to view”) 
 Generally prevent sites from reidentifying you across visits 
 
<p>Forgetful Browsing is similar to, but more powerful and protective than, popular browsing extensions and private browsing modes. It’s another example of Brave offering the most powerful privacy features of any popular browser.</p>

 The Web has the wrong defaults for privacy 
<p>Many privacy problems on the Web have a common root cause: by default, browsers let sites reidentify users indefinitely, but users only benefit from reidentification on a fraction of sites they visit.</p>
<p>In some cases, it’s very useful for a site to remember you (e.g. so you don’t have to log back into your email every day, or so you can easily use a social media account). But such sites are the exception, not the rule. Most often, you won’t benefit from being remembered by every news site you read an article on, or every shopping site you briefly browsed, or every image hosting site that showed you a cute cat picture.</p>
<p>In this way, all Web browsers get the defaults backwards: they assume you want to be identifiable by every site you visit. And this causes both annoyance (e.g. rate limiting or paywalls) and privacy harm (e.g. being profiled by untrustworthy sites). This problem is called “unwanted first-party reidentification.”</p>
<p>The Forgetful Browsing feature—the next step in Brave’s ongoing project to improve how browsers manage first-party storage—addresses the reidentification problem head-on.</p>

 Browsers lack good protections against unwanted first-party reidentification 
<p>Browsers are getting better at protecting users against third-party tracking, but generally do a poor job of protecting against unwanted first-party identification. Brave already provides <a href="https://privacytests.org/">best-in-class protections against third-party tracking</a>; Forgetful Browsing is one of several upcoming features in Brave that will provide similarly robust protections against first-party tracking.</p>
<p>Browsers provide some tools to help users prevent unwanted first-party reidentification, but these tools are clumsy, inconvenient, and scoped either too broadly or too narrowly, all of which invite unwanted–and irreversible–reidentification.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario: Khen has two email accounts, <code>dolphinfan4ever@example.com</code> and <code>serious.guy@example.com</code>, both of which Khen accesses through his Web browser. Khen doesn’t want the email provider to know both accounts are owned by the same person. Unfortunately, Web browsers make this kind of privacy very difficult.</p>
<p>This is because of how browsers manage first-party storage. Browsers prevent sites from reading another site’s cookies (e.g. yahoo.com can’t read your login cookies for outlook.com), but browsers generally don’t restrict how the same site can read cookies across visits (if you visited chicagotribune.com yesterday, the site can re-read the same cookies next time you visit). Even when you tell a site to log you out, it can’t easily clear some kinds of first-party storage <a>2</a>. This gives even well meaning sites the ability to reidentify users across visits. Worse, browsers provide few protections against sites that intentionally aim to re-identify you across logins (as in Khen’s situation in the previous paragraph).</p>
<p>Browsers provide some tools you can use to be certain there are no identifying values persisting across site visits. Unfortunately, these tools are difficult to use and/or require user perfection; in many cases a single error can allow a tracker to permanently, irreversibly link to different accounts together.</p>
 
 
<p>Private browsing modes: Allow users to visit a site with a clean storage area, but require perfection to prevent unwanted first-party reidentification. If Khen (from the previous example) forgets to use a private window just once, and mistakenly logs into his second email account in a normal window, the email provider will be able to link the two email accounts, indefinitely and irreversibly.</p>
 
 
<p>Browser extensions: Can clear first-party storage whenever a user closes a site, but extensions are limited in their ability to clear cached values, or values in nested documents.</p>
 
 
<p>Clear all storage: Most browsers contain a feature like this, which clears first-party storage for all sites when closing the browser. However, this feature is, for most users, very inconvenient, since it will log a user out of all their sites, even those the user trusts and wants to stay authenticated with. The feature also does not provide much help for people who tend to leave their browser open for long periods of time. This feature is a sledgehammer when what’s needed is a scalpel.</p>
 
 
<p>Advanced site controls: Some browsers include this feature, which advanced users can use to manually clear, or otherwise micro-manage first-party storage for sites. These features are useful, but can be (depending on the browser) difficult to discover, need perfect use to prevent identification, or otherwise can be unsuitable for non-advanced users.</p>
 
 

 Forgetful Browsing prevents unwanted first-party reidentification 
<p>Forgetful Browsing, by contrast, allows Brave users to easily prevent unwanted first-party reidentification, in a way that’s convenient and does not require constant vigilance to get right. Using <a>Brave Shields</a>, users can indicate that they want to be forgotten when a site is closed. When this option is set, Brave will clear first-party storage for the site a few seconds after there are no more open tabs for the site. Forgetful Browsing clears both explicitly stored values (e.g. cookies, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">indexedDB</a>) and indirectly stored values (e.g. HTTP cache or DNS cache).</p>
<p>Users can enable Forgetful Browsing in one of two ways.</p>

 Set Forgetful Browsing for a single site 
<p>Users can indicate that a specific site should be forgotten when it’s closed. To do so:</p>
 
 Navigate to the site. 
 Click the shields icon in the URL bar. 
 Click Advanced controls. 
 Click Forget me when I close this site. 
 



    


    



 Set Forgetful Browsing as a global default 
<p>Users can also make Forgetful Browsing the default setting for all sites. To do so:</p>
 
 Visit <code>brave://settings/shields</code> from the Brave browser. 
 Click Forget me when I close a site. 
 



    


    


<p>Note that users can set this as the global default, and then use the steps outlined above (in the “Set Forgetful Browsing for a single site” section of this post) to create exceptions (i.e. to indicate that particular sites should not be forgotten). This allows you to configure Brave to clear storage everytime a site is closed except for your email site, a social media site you log into often, etc.</p>

 Forgetful Browsing applies to entire sites, not domains 
<p>Forgetful Browsing differs from other settings in Brave Shields in its scope. Most settings in Brave Shields are set per domain; Forgetful Browsing, meanwhile, is set per site. For example, you can configure first.site.example to use aggressive fingerprinting protections and second.site.example to use standard fingerprinting protections, but all subdomains on site.example will share the same Forgetful Browsing setting. This is necessary to align the Forgetful Browsing setting with how Brave (and most other browsers) enforce storage boundaries.</p>

 More coming to prevent unwanted first-party reidentification 
<p>Forgetful Browsing is one of several existing ways Brave protects against unwanted first-party reidentification on the Web. Brave’s <a>Unlinkable Bouncing</a> feature automatically clears first-party storage whenever the browser is bounced through known tracking domains. And Brave’s <a>CNAME uncloaking</a> feature allows Brave to block trackers even when they try to look like first-party resources. Brave also limits the lifetime of cookies set in JavaScript to seven days to prevent some forms of first-party tracking.</p>
<p>Forgetful Browsing is the first of several upcoming features related to further managing and improving privacy around first-party storage on the Web. Together, these features will address a range of ways first-party storage can be abused to harm users. We look forward to sharing more about these features in the coming weeks and months.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Brave will incrementally enable Forgetful Browsing for users during the 1.53 and 1.54 release processes. Users who want to test the feature now can visit <code>brave://flags</code> and manually enable the “Enable First Party Storage Cleanup support” flag. Note that Forgetful Browsing is still experimental, and should only be enabled by users who understand the risks of enabling such features.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>HTTP cached values, storage for embedded third-party iframes (in browsers other than Brave), etc.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

PEPE briefly boasted a billion-dollar capitalization after being listed on Binance.

As top-signals go, that was one for the books, with PEPE tumbling 51% from its all-time high after listing on the world’s largest crypto exchange.

Despite its recent losses, PEPE still enjoys a larger market cap than DeFi bluechips like Synthetix, Curve, and Rocket Pool. Traders also exchanged nearly $700M worth of PEPE over just the past 24 hours.

 🛠️ Builder resources: *New* talks from our 2023 Crypto Startup School, now available! <p>The next generation of startups isn’t just advancing web3; it’s laying the groundwork for a more open, decentralized internet. But the industry know-how, shifting trends, and emerging tools in the space can be difficult for builders to navigate — whether they’re new to crypto, coming from other domains, or are more seasoned founders. That’s why we started Crypto Startup School in 2020, and recently relaunched it with a new cohort: to connect builders with the resources, expertise, and networks they need. </p><p>Over the past ten weeks (and counting), we’ve covered topics like go-to-market, community, product-market fit, technical &amp; research deep dives, policy, and much more. And now, we’re publicly sharing the curriculum with everyone, starting with 5 videos on: strategies for pricing; the basics of cryptography for blockchains; protocol design; the big picture; and lessons learned in strategy, growth, &amp; operations in the business of open source (with Uniswap Labs). We’ll continue to share 25+ more talks through near-weekly “drops”, so be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@a16zcrypto">subscribe to our channel</a> for updates. <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQ9HCQMu_8ywq3VUso7i_-TOx6RKXQeQ">watch the first batch of talks here</a><br>share: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1654512284335734784">on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7060282013236277251/">on LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x2d7531">on Farcaster</a> </p> 🔗🧩 Deep dive: On data availability sampling  <p>Data availability sampling — which is applicable to advances in computing, networking generally, and especially blockchains — helps ensure that all necessary blockchain data has been made available to nodes without straining the network. It is therefore important for scaling blockchains.</p><p>Data availability sampling also features heavily in “danksharding”, a series of planned upgrades to Ethereum; and also paves the way for more advanced blockchain networks and user applications (including future stateless clients). The next danksharding milestone is EIP-4844, the Ethereum upgrade known as “protodanksharding”, which is planned for later this year. [Both “danksharding” and “protodanksharding” were named to reference Ethereum Foundation researchers, Dankrad Feist and protolambda (now at OP Labs).]</p><p>a16z crypto researcher &amp; cryptographer Valeria Nikolaenko, with Stanford cryptography professor and a16z crypto research advisor Dan Boneh, survey how data availability in danksharding works. They also propose modifications to the underlying technique that may improve data recovery (e.g., requiring not 75% but 25% of shares to recover a block). Finally, both of them explain the concepts (and some of the math) involved in our latest podcast episode, hosted by a16z crypto’s Robert Hackett. </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/an-overview-of-danksharding-and-a-proposal-for-improvement-of-das/">read their piece</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/lera_banda/status/1651665339363520513">share</a><br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/podcast/data-availability-danksharding-web3-with-a16z-podcast/">listen to the discussion</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1654618547321208832">share</a></p><p>related readings:</p>  <p><a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/proto_danksharding_faq">FAQs on danksharding &amp; protodanksharding</a> - Vitalik Buterin</p>  <p><a href="https://grizzly-answer-991.notion.site/Proto-Danksharding-0b148da2c6a54ca5838716b481a5ead3">a technical analysis of protodanksharding</a> - Michael/ grizzly-answer-991<br></p>  <p>see/ hear also:</p>  <p>📖 read about why the major Ethereum upgrade <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/what-the-merge-means/">The Merge</a> (2022) mattered - by Ali Yahya</p>  <p>🎧 listen to “<a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/ethereum-the-merge-pos-security-decentralization-process-community-people">Ethereum, the Merge and beyond</a>” - with Tim Beiko, Tim Roughgarden, Ali Yahya, and Sonal Chokshi</p><p></p>  <p><a href="https://api.a16zcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/a16z-crypto_HMT-crypto-consultation-response-April-2023-.pdf">👑🔓🌐</a></p><p>--Sonal Chokshi, Stephanie Zinn, Tim Sullivan, Robert Hackett / a16z crypto  <br></p><p>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

<p>New Nym mixnet integration launched for Monero desktop to secure the right to financial privacy and censorship-resistance</p><p>Nym team are in Mexico City today for <a href="https://monerotopia.com/">Monerotopia 2023</a> to announce that the Nym mixnet has been integrated with the Monero&nbsp;network!</p><p>Financial privacy is an important component of digital currencies and the use of Nym will provide users with the highest level of privacy at the infrastructure level. All users of digital currencies should be afforded equal rights to protection from financial surveillance.</p><p>A team made up of Monero community members have successfully set up a service provider to use Monero (using the Monero desktop wallet) over the Nym mixnet. This allows Monero users to easily use <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/nym-connect/">NymConnect</a> to run Monero over the mixnet, thereby enhancing the privacy of Monero transactions.</p> How can I use Monero over the Nym&nbsp;mixnet? <p>The mainnet service provider to Monero over the Nym mixnet is now ready for use via <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>.</p>  Download and open the latest version of <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>  Click on the top left options and go to&nbsp;Settings  Go to “Select service provider” and turn it&nbsp;on  For Mainnet, insert this service provider:  <blockquote>i1TiuoNp4jp9weffCW7tPnkb4hRTPydRjX8iXFVaYDG.88Z1hruuvbzWpdCE2xYnTbPNrr49j4s7mmUQC5wvRRLZ@3EPuxwGn2WP2HdxybzoDa5QsohYSP76aQQRUJuPMvk23</blockquote>  Go to the main NymConnect interface and connect to the&nbsp;mixnet  <p>Then go to your Monero wallet (gui or otherwise) and change the settings to run over socks5&nbsp;proxy:</p>  Monero desktop: Settings -&gt; Interface -&gt; Socks5&nbsp;proxy  Monerod: add ` — proxy 127.0.0.1:1080 — bootstrap-daemon-proxy 127.0.0.1:1080` to&nbsp;args  Monero-wallet-{rpc, cli}: add ` — proxy 127.0.0.1:1080 — daemon-ssl-allow-any-cert` to&nbsp;args  <p>Follow the instructions and the Monero mainnet will be connected through to the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>For those who want to try it out in testnet, a stagenet service provider is also available: <a href="https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/connect/service-providers.json">https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/connect/service-providers.json</a></p>Nym Community Manager Gustavo and Nym COO Alexis in Mexico City, Monerotopia 2023 About Nym <p>Nym is an open-source, incentivised, and decentralised platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance. For more information: <a href="https://nymtech.net/">https://nymtech.net/</a>.</p> About Monero <p>Monero was launched in April 2014. It was a fair, pre-announced launch of the <a href="https://static.monerooutreach.org/doc/monero-outreach/cryptonote_whitepaper.pdf">CryptoNote</a> reference code. There was no pre-mine or “insta”-mine, and no portion of the block reward goes to development. See the original Bitcointalk thread&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563821.0">here</a>.</p><p>Monero has made several large improvements since launch. Nearly all improvements have provided advances to security or privacy, or they have facilitated use. Monero continues to develop with goals of privacy and security first, ease of use and efficiency second.

A <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts">collection of smart contracts</a>, deployed on Polygon, that decentralize the critical components of identity, discoverability and network infrastructure for the Verida&nbsp;network.  An incredibly powerful <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet">client SDK library for developers</a> that enables web, mobile and server applications to leverage identities and self-sovereign storage on the Verida&nbsp;network.

A <a href="https://news.verida.io/announcing-the-verida-credentials-incubator-the-inspiring-first-projects-coming-to-market-9ad8f1856e6b">credentials incubator program</a>, launched almost twelve months ago, and now helping multiple projects bring their credentials ecosystems to&nbsp;market.  <p>We are now preparing for our mainnet, so it’s time to reward our community members for helping put the Verida testnet through its&nbsp;paces.</p> Bringing the Verida testnet to&nbsp;you <p>The incentivized testnet will rollout over several phases, each with their own campaigns. Our first phase will be focusing on end users, allowing them to install the <a href="http://www.verida.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet&amp;utm_content=install">Verida Wallet</a> and progress through different campaigns designed to battle test the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>In future phases, the team will work closely with storage node operators and application developers to further decentralize the <a href="https://www.verida.network/">Verida network</a> and build a world leading onboarding experience for web3 builders.</p> Why participate in the Verida incentivized testnet? <p>Verida’s mainnet launch is slated for mid 2023. In the leadup, the team plans to accelerate growth to onboard users, application developers and node providers onto the network. Early participants who contribute to the incentivized testnet will be rewarded with Verida’s native protocol token, VDA — redeemable for mainnet tokens upon&nbsp;launch.</p><p>More than 60% of the Verida token supply is dedicated to rewarding ecosystem participants for supporting the network rollout. A portion of this token supply will be set aside for the incentivized testnet.</p> What can you&nbsp;do? <p>As a user during the incentivized testnet, you can explore the many features of the Verida network and applications. You will create decentralized identities, reclaim your personal data stored in centralized platforms and unlock early access to new applications. You will download the <a href="https://www.verida.io/">Verida Wallet</a> and experiment with the decentralized social platform, <a href="https://www.verida.one/">Verida&nbsp;One.</a></p><p>We will provide more details over the coming weeks as each campaign is announced.</p> What is the VDA&nbsp;token? <p>The native token of the Verida network (VDA) creates a data economy enabling secure interactions between accounts to facilitate secure data storage, trusted sharing, fast querying and secure messaging.</p><p>The Verida network is a self-sovereign “user-pays” model, whereby users pay for their own storage needs. In this way, “access to user data” is not the product, rather the product is the “security and protection” of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Storage node operators must stake VDA tokens in order for their nodes to be discoverable on the network and be available for selection by end&nbsp;users.</p><p>The Verida token plays an important role in bootstrapping the network by incentivizing and rewarding users for connecting their identities and data, while rewarding storage node operators for providing storage infrastructure to end&nbsp;users.</p>The Verida Data&nbsp;Economy<p>VDA has a fixed total supply of 1 billion tokens. Creating a native token allows for the design of economic incentives in the Verida network that provides control over the setting of monetary policy and equitable rewards for all network participants.</p> How can you participate? <p>Every individual has personal data to reclaim. Verida’s infrastructure will impact millions of lives. For this reason, we should all have a say. The incentivized testnet is open to everyone and all, interested in privacy-focused data management on&nbsp;web3.</p><p>More information will be posted on our blog in the following weeks as the Verida team prepares to launch the first user campaign. <a href="http://www.verida.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet&amp;utm_content=subscribe">Subscribe to receive updates</a> and <a href="http://discord.verida.io">join our self-sovereign community</a> today.</p><p>This is an opportunity to contribute to a solution expected to change the nature of data on the internet.

Centre stage fireside chat between Chelsea Manning (Nym) and Leo Swartz (Fortune) — WebSummit Rio&nbsp;2023<p>Nym was at <a href="https://rio.websummit.com/">WebSummit in Rio</a> this week, one of the world’s largest technology conferences. The team joined other innovators, thought leaders and entrepreneurs from across the world with the aim to ensure privacy remains at the centre of internet industry debates, and to support the rapidly growing Latin American Nym community!</p><p>Nym joined forces with <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a> to ensure privacy was the headline of WebSummit with centre stage appearances by Chelsea Manning and shortly after by the President of Signal messaging app, Meredith Whittacker. The two voices ensured that the AI hype was grounded in the realities of data markets and centralised power, emphasising the need for privacy technologies to ensure our future freedoms!</p> Key highlights from this&nbsp;week   Nym Security Chelsea Manning opened the centre stage in a fireside chat with Forbes crypto reporter Leo Swartz and featured as the main conference highlight of the&nbsp;day.  The Nym Masterclass on Privacy in the Age of AI had a guest appearance by President of Signal foundation, Meredith Whittaker, and was packed way over capacity.  The Nym partnership with Swissnex was strengthened boost growth in Latin America, hosting presentations by Nym COO Alexis Roussel, CSO Jaya Klara Brekke and Head of Growth Daniel&nbsp;Vazquez.  Nym team met with the Rio Secretary for Science and Innovation to propose a Rio privacy crypto-carnival (and she liked it! So stay tuned for a party invitation…)  The Nym community of Rio linked up with the z-cash community to boost privacy interest and ecosystem growth in the&nbsp;region.   Brazil takes on the tech&nbsp;industry <p>Just before WebSummit opened, Brazil shut down Telegram for a few days. The Brazilian Congress is going through an intense debate about a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-lawmakers-vote-controversial-bill-clean-up-social-media-2023-05-02/">new online bill </a>to push for stronger content moderation by technology platforms, after far right groups attacked government buildings and schools earlier in the&nbsp;year.</p> Privacy is the solution, not the&nbsp;problem <p>The new bill and how to address manipulation, radicalisation and violence, without resorting to censorship was a major topic of discussion at the Summit. But there is an approach to these problems that so far has been overlooked: strong privacy protections. Securing strong privacy of communications would protect people from being profiled and targeted with radicalising content streams and misinformation!</p><p>Nym discussed the problem of disinformation with the Secretary of Science and Innovation of Rio de Janeiro, Tatiana Roque, who is also an expert on the topic. In her view, trusted social relationships provide the societal immune system to solve misinformation and disinformation. And she agreed that enabling people to securely communicate with one another without spying and interference is the foundation for building trust in&nbsp;society.</p> Fireside Chat with Chelsea Manning, Nym and Leo Schwartz, Fortune <p>Tuesday 2nd of May, 10.30 am centre stage — <a href="https://wsr23-video-ed.s3.amazonaws.com/ST1_1_3_58c28215-cd70-49ea-83cc-3133d64198a7_000008_002255.mp4?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAISIRK44NQMJLRRAA&amp;Signature=YX5VFos72tslSrWQ3iqWd5ks26Y%3D&amp;Expires=1688225188">watch&nbsp;here</a></p><p>How could strong data privacy lead to better AI? Could encryption democratise governance and access to AI? How can cryptography counter deep-fakes and contribute to a better and more secure online experience? Chelsea Manning spoke on MainStage with journalist Leo Schwartz, reporter at Fortune covering the global impact of crypto, regulation, cyber crime, and all things blockchain.</p> Nym Masterclass: Privacy in the age of&nbsp;AI <p>Tuesday 2nd of May, 1pm Main Conference, Masterclass 3</p><p>Unfortunately WebSummit does not record masterclasses, but a longer summary is&nbsp;coming!</p>Chelsea Manning, Jaya Klara Brekke, Meredith Whittaker, Alexis Roussel and Vincent Neumann at the Nym Masterclass on Privacy in the age of AI — WebSummit Rio&nbsp;2023<p>A major highlight of the whole summit was the Nym masterclass on Privacy and AI. The Nym team Jaya Klara Brekke, Alexis Roussel and Chelsea Manning, was joined by President of Signal Foundation, Meredith Whittaker and Vincent Neumann, Program Manager, Innovation &amp; Startups Swissnex (in order of appearance). We had a queue down two floors and the room filled up over capacity!</p><p>AI has been built after over a decade of mass surveillance. In the words of Meredith: it is a “surveillance derivative”. The recent boom is the result of large technology platforms holding near monopoly access to people’s content and behavioural data. But privacy preserving technologies are going through their own revolution. End-to-end encryption is becoming standard and we now have functioning mixnets and advanced cryptographic techniques including homomorphic encryption.</p><p>The key question is whether these technologies can ensure that people and society can have a say over the future development and uses of AI. Privacy preserving technologies afterall place the power to decide over data (when it is created and who can use it) back into the hands of&nbsp;people.</p><p>Jaya introduced the session, providing the current context of AI hype, privacy tech and the risks of “privacy washing” that will likely come this next&nbsp;year.</p><p>Alexis gave an overview of the Nym mixnet, and how metadata can be protected to secure against AI-powered surveillance.</p><p>Chelsea emphasised that regulation is not going to be enough, what is needed is a technological intervention to block data markets and shift the direction of AI development.</p><p>Meredith gave the historical overview of how data-markets and centralised big tech power emerged to monopolise the control over AI, reproducing racist categorisations in society. Important research and publications that were mentioned included the<a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/2023-landscape"> AI Now report</a> by Amba Kak and Dr Sarah Myers West,<a href="https://abebabirhane.com/"> work</a> by Abeba Birhane and<a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/louise-amoore/"> work</a> by Prof Louise&nbsp;Amoore.</p><p>Vincent Neuman of Swissnex rounded off the masterclass highlighting the importance of Latin America as a counterpoint to the surveillance-driven technology industries of the US and China, describing the work and programs of Swissnex in supporting start ups in the&nbsp;region.</p> Press conference with Alexis Roussel and Chelsea&nbsp;Manning <p>The Nym WebSummit press conference on building privacy by design — watch&nbsp;<a href="https://wsr23-video-ed.s3.amazonaws.com/ST2_1_3_PRIORITY_8545eeea-bb6f-421b-8f1f-5fccedf36dff_000000_001447.mp4.mp4?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAISIRK44NQMJLRRAA&amp;Signature=nJSvlCaoipVADTnefaUSIF6xXag%3D&amp;Expires=1688245445">here</a>.</p>Chelsea Manning (Nym) and Alexis Roussel (Nym) press conference — WebSummit Rio&nbsp;2023 The Nym team on the ground in&nbsp;Rio  Nym Latin&nbsp;America   Daniel Vazquez (Head of growth in Latin&nbsp;America)  Joao Phelip (Nym community manager, Portuguese)  With expert assistance on the booth from Paula and&nbsp;Bruno!

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>Just like every month, it’s time for a monthly update. As we start May at full speed, let's take a moment to recap April’s developments!</p> Tech updates  v0.5 updates PIP-13 succeeded!<p>Earlier this month, a series of updates and upgrades for v0.5 was presented by the Panther community. This elaborate proposal aimed to introduce updates to v0.5 needed for v1’s development and launch a new Advanced Staking round.</p><p>Formalizing this proposal, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0825de3b9289d3e04e8f9f3607d1145923f482104fecabc9d02634b3f7d6f521">PIP-13</a> succeeded with an overwhelming majority vote on our Snapshot page. Among other things, this meant that the community decided on:</p>  Prolonging the "Advanced Staking" program, conserving the original staking APR, until Aug 22, 2023  Implementing UI upgrades, effectively elevating v0.5 to Panther Protocol’s v0.5.3.  <p>After the vote, the proposal was successfully executed. With all contracts deployed by Panther community members, this is officially our third decentralized deployment to date!</p> v1 updates  Testing for v1 <p>We keep working on Panther's v1 mechanism to issue rewards, with complex mathematical models running to test this. Work on rewards and fees is now unblocked due to advancements in Shielded Pools' development and the deployment of v0.5.3, a significant step forward.</p><p>General product testing for v1 is also progressing according to plan. This month witnessed the internal release of the first prototype for the full product. Exciting times are near as we polish and prepare to develop it towards Testnet!</p>Get ready for v1! Diving into zSwap and DeFi Adaptors Panther will enable private DEX swaps with zSwap.<p>We also just published an article featuring an <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zswap-and-defi-adaptors-unlocking-private-defi-usage/">in-depth look at zSwap &amp; DeFi Adaptors</a>.</p><p>Discover how this concept will link Panther with leading DeFi dApps like <a href="https://twitter.com/Uniswap?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/QuickswapDEX?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">QuickswapDEX</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve Finance</a>, enabling seamless &amp; private swaps on DEXs. The article also explains how having DeFi Adaptors makes Panther’s privacy stronger.</p> Relayer integration <p>For v1, we are also progressing in the integration of relayers, an essential component of Panther’s privacy.</p><p>Relayers are responsible for forwarding transactions to the blockchain, thus acting as intermediaries between Panther’s privacy layer and the decentralized network. They can do so, for example, by paying for gas in users’ name. By integrating relayers, we aim to significantly increase privacy by obfuscating the origin of transactions, making it more difficult for third parties to trace and link them to specific users.</p><p>Another crucial aspect of our ongoing work is the exploration of gasless transactions. Gas fees are a well-known pain point for users in the blockchain ecosystem, often causing frustration due to their volatility and unpredictability. By evaluating gasless transactions, we hope to provide users with a more convenient and cost-effective way to interact with the Panther Protocol network.</p><p>Lastly, we are in the process of exploring Account Abstraction Paymaster logic. Account abstraction is a cutting-edge technique that aims to simplify the user experience by allowing smart contracts to pay gas fees on behalf of users. The Paymaster logic plays a crucial role in this process, as it is responsible for determining which transactions should be paid for and ensuring the appropriate gas fees are covered.</p> Panther’s PMONK zero-knowledge scheme makes its debut Last weekend, at the ETH Privacy event in Istanbul, Turkey, CTO and Chief Scientist Anish Mohammed presented a paper for PMONK, Panther’s original zk-SNARK scheme.<p>This presentation, which will be soon published on Youtube, represents a significant milestone in the history of our project. There is still quite some way to go before we can tell you more about PMONK’s applications, but right now seemed like a good time to share the excitement!</p> Documentation review, compliance work, and website continue to progress <p>Last but not least, our technical contributors are fact-checking and screening our improved documentation for it to go live.</p><p>Expect the site’s launch soon, as well as a first release of documentation followed by an ongoing process of updates and upgrades.</p><p>Finally, we continue engaging with industry leaders in the Web3 compliance realm to determine the best approach for Panther's solution. Stay tuned!</p> Ecosystem  Community-driven exchange listings Another mission successfully completed by the Panther DAO!<p>This month, our decentralized community reached a notable milestone as $ZKP was listed on <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1643557579900035072?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">MEXC Global</a> in a community-driven operation, enhancing our token’s accessibility in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Following this, Hotbit.io also took the initiative to list $ZKP, so we had two centralized exchange listings this month.</p> ZKPanthers NFT giveaway Cool cats.<p>Another notable event this was the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZKPanthers?src=hashtag_click&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">#ZKPanthers</a> NFT giveaway organized by community merch providers <a href="https://twitter.com/SubvertedN?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Subverted Norms</a>!</p><p>Subverted Norms designed the beautiful artwork, minting only 25 tokens, giving away 15 of them, and listing the rest for sale at OpenSea. They also created some cool products based on this NFTs, which you can see <a href="https://panthermerch.shop/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">on their merch shop</a>!</p><p>Congratulations to all the winners!</p> Media and articles <p>Co-Founder Oliver Gale's latest piece on the potential of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and their use cases for businesses is now live on Forbes. The article discusses the importance of ZKPs in finance, as they enable secure and private transactions while meeting regulatory requirements. The article also highlights how businesses can benefit from ZKPs in terms of enhanced privacy, improved security, regulatory compliance, and greater efficiency.</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/04/19/zero-knowledge-proofs-use-cases-for-businesses/?sh=38db059558b8&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Read it here.</a></p>A read you can’t miss straight from our CEO.<p>Oliver also published two more articles on our blog:</p>  The first one breaks down the potential role of on-chain dark pools as key to attracting traditional institutions and enterprises to DeFi. He explains how these pools can allow for secure, private, and regulatory-compliant transactions that leverage the best side of decentralized finance.<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/on-chain-dark-pools-the-missing-piece-to-bridge-enterprise-capital-to-defi/"> Read it here.</a>  The second one was written in anticipation of Consensus 2023, the largest gathering of crypto, blockchain, and Web3 communities. In it, Oliver highlights the critical industry concerns and insights on integrating traditional finance and DeFi, addressing regulatory compliance, exploring compliant-friendly data protection solutions like Zero-Knowledge technology, and fostering collaboration for a unified financial ecosystem. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/insiders-guide-to-consensus-2023-defi-capital-markets-collision/">Read it here.</a>   Ama with Hotbit <p>Oliver also took part in an AMA hosted by Hotbit to introduce Panther to a broader audience and answer questions about his latest article mentioned above.

  New Fellowship: How Sequoia is Supporting Open Source  <p>FastAPI creator Sebastián Ramírez is the first recipient of the Sequoia Open Source Fellowship.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky and Lauren Reeder	 



Published May 4, 2023
  



 
<p>Open source is the lifeblood of software. Downloads of the most popular open source packages&nbsp;are measured in the trillions and <a href="https://www.sonatype.com/state-of-the-software-supply-chain/open-source-supply-demand-security?utm_campaign=pr&amp;utm_source=pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=organic">growing fast</a>, and most commercial software today features libraries and programs made better and more reliable by open source contributors around the world. At Sequoia, we have a long history of partnering with companies that pioneered the commercialization of open source software, such as MongoDB and Confluent, and the pace of our partnerships with open source companies&nbsp; is also on the rise, including Chainguard, Deno, dbt labs, Infracost and Temporal Technologies in recent years. But we also recognize that open source projects that don’t become businesses are still critical tools for our portfolio companies and the broader community.</p>



<p>Last year, we were fortunate enough to meet Sebastián Ramírez, creator of the wildly popular open source Python framework <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, which is used everywhere from Fortune Global 500 corporations such as BMW, American Express and Roche, to academia, to nonprofits such as NASA and the Red Cross. Sebastián was overflowing with ideas to improve on what he’d built—but because even the most beloved open source projects rarely pay the bills, he was forced to split his time between FastAPI and part-time work.</p>



<p>His situation inspired us to think about how we might support his work and that of other open source creators who give so much to the broader tech ecosystem. Today, we are thrilled to share that Sebastián is the first Sequoia Open Source Fellow.</p>



<p>Each year, we’ll invite a small number of leading open source contributors to this new fellowship program and will provide a stipend to cover their living expenses for 6 to 12 months, so they can dedicate themselves to their open source work full-time. They’ll also become members of the Sequoia community, connecting with and mentoring founders. (Sebastián recently helped us host the closing event for our seed-stage catalyst, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>.) In short, we will support each other. We believe Sequoia can benefit greatly from fellows’ expertise to help us better understand the open source ecosystem, but there are no other strings attached. Our goal is to give Sebastián and builders like him the time and space to innovate, whatever that means for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We recently sat down with Sebastián to talk about FastAPI, his fellowship experience so far, and what’s next.</p>



 



<p>For those who aren’t familiar, what is FastAPI and why did you build it?</p>



<p>Sebastián: FastAPI makes life easier for developers working in applications in the cloud using Python, which is one of the most popular programming languages—it’s often used for machine learning, data science and AI. You can use FastAPI to take advantage of all the features of code editors, like auto completion and inline errors, while getting application best practices by default with simple code, all in one place, so you can be super efficient and still get the best possible quality and performance.</p>



<p>I was working on teams building data and machine learning products, and we kept seeing the same problems and mistakes. I tried every tool I could find, but nothing ticked all the boxes—so eventually, I decided to try to put all the things I liked about other frameworks into one project. I didn’t expect it to work, but it did! I released the first public version of FastAPI on December 24, 2018, two years after the version of Python that enabled FastAPI, and it’s been downloaded more than 800,000 times since. It was even used to <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamin_falk/status/1546947039363305472">share data</a> captured by the James Webb Space Telescope—that was a highlight.</p>



Data captured by the James Webb telescope was shared via FastAPI.



<p>Why did you decide this fellowship was right for you?</p>



<p>Sebastián: Ever since I started FastAPI, I’d been trying to optimize to work more on it and my other open source projects, like Typer and SQLModel. But because they were growing so quickly, it took a lot of time just to maintain them, and even more to improve them. I quit my job and worked part-time, but it still wasn’t enough. So doing open source exclusively was super appealing—not just the hours, but the continuity of those hours. I knew being able to focus deeply would drive a lot more progress.</p>



<p>I was also interested in learning about how businesses are built, because I think for FastAPI, a self-sustaining model will probably make sense at some point. It can help a lot of people and organizations be more efficient, and there’s value in that. But I wanted to focus first on just making it the best tool possible.</p>



<p>What has the experience been like so far?</p>



<p>Amazing. Honestly, I didn’t expect it to be this nice. We had calls before we started, and those were good. It was good on paper. But it’s been just as it was on those calls. We talk about companies and projects, but otherwise, I get to just work like crazy.</p>



<p>One thing that’s really valuable but less obvious is that I can focus on what I know will have the biggest impact, even if it’s invisible to most users—like the underlying building blocks of FastAPI, or even other open source projects it uses. I’ve even been working on improving the way internal code (reference) APIs are documented in Python itself recently, which is the kind of thing it’s usually very difficult to allocate time and resources for. But it will be super valuable, for FastAPI users and everyone else.</p>



<p>What are you most looking forward to—during the rest of your fellowship and beyond?</p>



<p>A bunch of things! The most obvious one is integration for the new version of <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a>, which is <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-pydantic-no-more-steel-seats-for-developers/">now</a> part of the Sequoia community, too. It’s going to mean a big boost in performance for FastAPI and the other tools, plus better support for edge cases. I’m also working on more documentation of FastAPI’s internal code—I have lots of tutorials, but there isn’t a dictionary-like code API reference, which is one of the things people request the most. And I’m making improvements to FastAPI itself, and to Typer, SQLModel, Asyncer, and others, which will simplify building the whole stack in FastAPI applications.</p>



<p>I’m also looking forward to continuing all the relationships I’ve built, including with you two! I was always scared of VCs. The idea of raising capital and building a company wasn’t super intuitive to me. But this has been a mindset shift—seeing that it can actually be good. We’re friends! It feels like, “Okay, this really can work.”</p>



 



<p>Consideration for the Sequoia Open Source Fellowship is by invitation only; we aim to support established creators and enable them to chart the paths of their projects as they continue to grow.

<p>Ethereum-style smart contracts meet encrypted execution in a single zkRollup.</p><p>At Aztec Labs, our mission has been driving toward an encrypted zkRollup supporting generalized private&nbsp;compute.</p><p>Today we’re excited to announce the end-game — an entirely new zkRollup with the samename that started it all:&nbsp;Aztec.</p><blockquote>Aztec is our vision for a trustless, scalable, and decentralized Layer 2 zkRollup enabling private smart contract execution.</blockquote><p>Imagine all the things you love about Ethereum smart contracts, plus the ability to protect your data with programmable anonymity, data privacy, and confidential contracts.</p><p>That’s it. That’s the&nbsp;pitch.</p><p>Ethereum, encrypted.</p><p>Aztec explodes the design space of what you can do on blockchains by allowing public-private composability, and today, we’re proud to announce the roadmap for delivering Aztec to&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>We are well on our way to completing basic contract deployment (Milestone 1.0), with significant progress across all components needed for a local developer environment.</p><p>Developers can expect a local testnet by the third quarter of 2023, and users and network stakeholders can expect to access a full-fledged public testnet by early&nbsp;2024.</p> Aztec: it’s not a&nbsp;zkEVM <p>Ethereum is, at its heart, a state machine. It takes a starting state, ingests transactions (sequenced into blocks), and transitions state deterministically.</p><p>Aztec takes the original promise of a global state machine and extends it to private&nbsp;state.</p><p>This hybrid public-private state machine processes both public and private execution of smart contract logic. Simultaneously, it no longer executes transactions like a conventional blockchain, instead proving the correctness of transactions that have already been computed.</p><p>In other words, Aztec is a zero-knowledge execution environment, but it’s not a&nbsp;zkEVM.</p><p>Why? Isn’t zkEVM the end-game?</p><p>In Aztec Labs’ search for private smart contract capability, we came to an early conclusion: privacy isn’t EVM compatible.</p><p>The beauty of rollups goes beyond mimicking Ethereum but extending its utility. Aztec is an opportunity to enshrine privacy at the base layer with the benefit of Ethereum’s security guarantees.</p><p>At the time of its invention, Ethereum traded privacy for public consensus. Trustless, private execution enabled by advanced zero knowledge cryptography had yet to be invented. After all, it wasn’t until 2018 that Zac Williamson and Ariel Gabizon published Plonk, the first zkSNARK that was practical for widespread use in blockchain applications.</p><p>But while public account-based blockchain models like Ethereum can’t support native privacy, UTXO-based privacy solutions can’t support the robust ecosystem of applications and tools that have been created for public smart contract platforms.</p><blockquote>That’s why Aztec is&nbsp;both.</blockquote><p>Aztec combines public and private execution into a single zkRollup, providing seamless composability across encrypted and unencrypted transactions. If Ethereum’s innovation was allowing read and write to public state, Aztec’s is the ability to read and write to both public and private&nbsp;state.</p><p>The combination of public and private into a single hybrid roll-up enables confidentiality and auditability:</p>  Private voting for public&nbsp;DAOs  Private sessions of public&nbsp;games  Private trades on public&nbsp;AMM’s  <p>Aztec goes beyond unauditable private transactions, enabling smart contracts that allow for flexible compliance and view permissions.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>Aztec takes the prior work achieved with our Connect architecture and massively extends its scope and functionality.</p><p>Connect leveraged an encrypted UTXO architecture in which value notes represented money.</p><p>In Aztec, we’ve carried on with the same design with one key difference: UTXOs can represent not only “the value of a token”, but any data you&nbsp;like.</p><p>UTXO’s now store entire smart contracts.</p><p>Connect supported just 3 custom-built circuits. Aztec can support arbitrary smart contract logic over both public and private state. That means developers can access the full set of Ethereum use-cases, plus entirely new encryption-enabled applications.</p><p>Where Connect was designed for and limited to DeFi, Aztec is limited only by your imagination.</p> Public-private composability <p>Aztec’s public and private state environments are fully composable–meaning any function can call any other function.</p><p>This leads to completely new blockchain paradigms like private-to-private function calls: smart contracts whose logic is invisible to blockchain observers can call other contracts with invisible logic.</p><p>Aztec is building a true privacy ecosystem–a network of smart contracts that can draw from and write to whichever ledger is most convenient:</p>  a visible, public one to support primitives requiring transparency like AMMs and lending protocols  an invisible private one enabling the creation of private decentralized governance, finance, identity, and&nbsp;gaming.   View permissions and compliance <p>Aztec maintains the same segregation between viewing and spending keys as Connect, while extending viewing key permissions to each contract for fine-grained control on data&nbsp;access.</p><p>Because Aztec allows for permissioning on a contract-by-contract basis, compliance can be implemented flexibly with new blockchain primitives: decentralized identity, third-party verification, and view key&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>Applications no longer have to think about all-or-nothing approaches: Aztec supports the full spectrum of programmably private permissions.</p> Noir: Write Code, not&nbsp;Circuits <p>In order to enable private smart contract computation, Aztec Labs is contributing to core development of Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge.</p><p>Noir is an open-source, generalized zero knowledge circuit writing language compatible with any proving back-end and verifiable on any blockchain with customizable smart contract verifiers.</p><p>Where lower-level zk programming languages like Circom require knowledge of cryptographic concepts, Noir lets you write code, not circuits.</p><p>Zero-knowledge programs can have familiar syntax and abstracted cryptographic safety. An open-source library of crypto primitives means you can rely on a cache of audited crypto code and a community of cryptographers and open-source contributors.</p><p>Noir’s vision is to be the LLVM for zkSNARKs. Just as programming languages compile to an intermediate representation rather than machine language, Noir compiles to an abstract circuit intermediate representation (ACIR), which can then compile to any cryptographic backend.</p><p>Proofs can then be verified on any chain with a Solidity verifier.</p><blockquote>That means devs from Solana to Cosmos can integrate ZK proofs with&nbsp;Noir.</blockquote><p>In addition to its use as a generalizable zk programming language, Noir also serves as the smart contract language for Aztec: it retains traditional smart contract semantics, replete with state variables, functions, and cross-contract composability (even across the public-private barrier!).</p> Scalability <p>Our belief has always been that the largest barrier to blockchain adoption isn’t blockspace–it’s utility. Thankfully, zkSNARKs unlock both flexible encryption and scalability for&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>The recursion enabled by Aztec’s kernel circuits is so powerful that we have achieved a massive scalability improvement over Connect. Aztec will target 100+ TPS and single-digit cent transactions by mainnet launch, approximately 5x more throughput than Ethereum and 50-100x more than&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>We expect Aztec’s primary cost input–posting call data to Layer 1–to drop significantly via the use of blob transactions facilitated by EIP-4844.</p><p>Our long-term roadmap includes custom data availability, state sharding, FHE-enabled state syncing, hardware acceleration, and parallelized execution — all of which will allow us to access another order of magnitude of&nbsp;scale.</p> Next-level Privacy&nbsp;UX <p>Outside of core infrastructure, privacy UX has been a major bottleneck to the adoption of blockchain encryption tools.</p><p>We see the problem as&nbsp;3-fold:</p>  It’s hard to reason about&nbsp;privacy  Inflexible view permissions make compliance difficult or impossible  The wallet experience is confusing and non-standard  <p>Aztec tackles all three issues&nbsp;head-on.</p> Privacy guarantees <p>Our goal with Aztec was to have significantly stronger privacy guarantees than Connect, while making them easier to reason about. Simultaneously, Aztec improves generalizability and reduces cost–meaning better privacy comes with no trade-offs.</p><p>The simple&nbsp;tl;dr?</p><p>Private transactions are private. Full&nbsp;stop.</p><p>With previous-generation privacy solutions, users were concerned with privacy sets. In Aztec, private transaction execution is fully private–not only is the transaction private but the contract being executed is also private. That means private token transfers, private loans, private order book exchanges, and private game state are all totally inscrutable to blockchain observers.</p><p>There is simply no way to leak information other than the raw number of private state updates triggered, nor is it possible to interrogate the origin or nature of those state updates. The only way an observer gains information about the nature of the transaction is if there is a call to a public function.</p><p>Public execution is default anonymous–observers can’t tell who invoked the transaction but can see the results of the transaction publicly.</p><p>While public transactions are still reliant on privacy sets for their guarantees, the composability of Noir contracts means privacy sets are shared across the entire&nbsp;network.</p><p>A stablecoin like Dai will have a privacy set encompassing payments, DeFi, and usage as an in-game currency.</p> Wallet Experience and Account Abstraction <p>To make Aztec accounts as compatible as possible with existing wallets, user spending keys will utilize the same spending keys as Ethereum&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>In addition, native account abstraction will allow users to deploy custom Noir contracts to their account addresses instead of utilizing existing ECDSA signature flows. Aztec account abstraction facilitated by Noir circuits will&nbsp;support:</p>  Smart contract&nbsp;wallets  M of N multisigs  Schnorr Signatures  ECDSA over the 25519 curve (the same signature scheme as Apple’s&nbsp;TouchID)  Social recovery  <p>The future of blockchains is in programmable wallets, not manually signing transactions and granting permissions. Smart contract wallets will be a core feature of Aztec’s architecture, enabling future-proof blockchain UX.</p> Build <p>Are you an independent or protocol dev wondering whether Aztec is right for&nbsp;you?</p><p>Aztec is purely additive to Ethereum. Because it supports both public and private smart contracts, anything that can be built on Ethereum can be built on&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>And while Aztec’s public transactions look broadly similar to Ethereum (since they’re both public state machines), developers will be granted new opportunities unlocked by private&nbsp;compute:</p>  Hiding confidential information  Anonymity  Hiding the terms and conditions of confidential contracts  Hiding which contract has even been&nbsp;executed  Programming in zero-knowledge  <p>Because Aztec’s core execution engine verifies rather than executes compute, private transactions can have arbitrary runtime. Unlike Ethereum, which has a block resource limit of 30 million gas, there is no hard limit to the compute intensity for an Aztec&nbsp;block.</p><p>After all, users run programs and generate proofs on their own devices. That means programs can have arbitrary runtime and still be proved&nbsp;locally.</p><p>Aztec therefore allows for the concept of private micro-rollups: programs that are executed and proven locally and sent onward for verification.</p><blockquote>Entire rollup instances and applications can be run like Layer 3’s on&nbsp;Aztec.</blockquote><p>We’re excited for the new paradigms that are possible when users are empowered to run and prove programs on their own&nbsp;devices.</p> Open Vision, Open&nbsp;Source <p>Aztec’s vision is wildly ambitious. As a result, we are opening Aztec’s codebase, protocol design, and documentation to the broader zk and blockchain communities to&nbsp;discuss.</p><p>We are starting by building in the open at discourse.aztec.network–our new home for protocol-level discussion and debate, and the future home of Aztec’s decentralized governance.</p><blockquote>Join the conversation about Aztec’s specification and roadmap at <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network">discourse.aztec.network</a></blockquote><p>In the spirit of radical openness, Aztec is being built under the open-source and permissive Apache 2.0 License, and Aztec’s repos are updated on a regular basis.

Sequencers then send blocks to a federated network of&nbsp;provers.</p><p>Provers then break up the 16,348 individual transactions that comprise an Aztec block into trees of proofs 14 deep. They then “split up” the work of proving individual transactions, working together to construct the full Merkle tree that makes up a finalized Aztec&nbsp;block.</p><p>Finally, Aztec nodes provide chain data, syncing chain state, answering RPC requests, and propagating transactions.</p><p>Aztec is designed with decentralization and the sustainability of all stakeholders in mind–not just users and applications, but node providers, sequencers, and provers. All components of the stack will use commodity hardware with requirements as low or lower than their Ethereum equivalents.

<p>Aztec’s response to HMT’s consultation for cryptoasset regulation</p> Answering HM Treasury’s Call <p>In February of this year, His Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) published a consultation and call for evidence titled “future financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets”.</p><p>The consultation follows an April 2022 call for a new unified regulatory framework for cryptoassets in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>The primary view expressed by the UK government is that “cryptoassets and the activities underpinning their use should follow the standards expected of other similar financial services activities.”</p> DeFi ≠&nbsp;CeFi <p>We support the need for clear, affirmative, and proportionate regulation as a step toward jurisdictional clarity, and believe the UK’s stance that the prime objective should be on growth and innovation is the correct&nbsp;one.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are two nuanced distinctions within crypto that must be&nbsp;drawn:</p>  Firstly, between centralized or intermediated financial entities and peer-to-peer decentralized financial protocols;  And secondly, between credibly neutral protocols and consumer-facing applications  <p>The government’s core design principle equating “same risk, same outcome” threatens to throw centralized financial entities (CeFi), decentralized financial protocols (DeFi), and decentralized applications (dApps) into the same regulatory bucket.</p> Our Response <p>It’s our belief that the unique non-intermediated nature of DeFi is not only consumer protective but non-analogous to existing forms of financial services. Therefore, applying regulation derived from that applying to traditional financial services may both harm consumers and hinder industry innovation.</p><p>Consumers may be at risk of being misled into believing CeFi custodians are trustless, when in fact some of the biggest failures in the entire crypto-asset industry were in fact due to malfeasance on the part of CeFi entities and custodians.</p><p>In reality, there are vast differences in custody, trust, and permissioning between centralized financial services (CeFi) and decentralized protocols (DeFi), and as a result we recommend that HMT create a bespoke and progressive regulatory regime that is suited to DeFi’s unique benefit to the consumer.</p><p>We seek to clarify some of these nuances in our response to HMT’s consultation, with a specific focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), while underscoring the need for encryption to protect user privacy and security.</p><p>Read our full response&nbsp;here:</p><p>And read HMT’s full consultation here:</p> Join the Conversation <p>Aztec is building at the cutting edge of blockchain privacy and encryption.

<p>AI is exploding into every facet of the internet.

One example of this is AutoGPT, which uses AI to generate code for on-chain smart contracts.</p> <p>How do we balance caution and optimism?

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today, we’re announcing new features to support the development, adoption, and use of the decentralized Web (dWeb) through Brave, the privacy-first browser used by over 57 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>Brave and Protocol Labs first began collaborating in January 2021, when <a>Brave introduced support for IPFS</a> on desktop versions of the browser, unlocking unique new ways to experience the Web for everyday users. Later that same year, <a>Brave Wallet integrated the Filecoin network</a>, which aims to facilitate how people store, access, and distribute data on the dWeb. Now, we’re unveiling new ways to participate and contribute to the growing dWeb movement with Brave.</p>

 Back up NFTs automatically with IPFS in Brave Wallet 
<p>Brave desktop v1.51 introduces automatic NFT pinning, which backs up the metadata of supported NFTs to the <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)</a>. “Pinning” means to tell IPFS to indefinitely store a file in a specific location so that it’s always available for retrieval. By pinning a file to multiple locations, you effectively spread the risk of data loss over multiple different points, thus improving its long term resiliency.</p>
<p>While many people believe that NFT metadata (such as images and descriptions) is stored entirely on blockchains, that’s generally not true. Instead, most collections store their metadata on IPFS or other decentralized storage solutions. Some even host NFT metadata on Web 2.0 servers, which carry risks of data loss and censorship.</p>
<p>“Brave now enables you to pin NFTs to your local IPFS node in just a few clicks, ensuring their continuous availability within the IPFS network,” said Brian Bondy, co-founder and CTO at Brave.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Even with no knowledge of IPFS, Brave Wallet users can avoid the permanent loss of NFT metadata and gain peace of mind by pinning their NFTs locally in the browser. This ensures users have a copy of the assets and metadata for their NFTs, and can make them available to the broader network. Enabling IPFS in Brave is simple and can be done in a matter of minutes. Once set up, eligible NFTs will automatically be pinned. It’s important to note that this doesn’t mean pinned NFTs gain additional protection from hacking or theft, but rather that the data associated with them is kept online through multiple distributed copies.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Pinning will first be available for Ethereum-based ERC-721 tokens, with plans to expand to more chains and tokenization standards in the future. You can even pin NFTs owned by other wallet addresses, including NFTs you own on a hardware wallet that isn’t connected to Brave Wallet. To do so, simply input the token details manually and Brave Wallet will both display and back up the NFT. This means you can support the health and safety of NFT collections you enjoy, even if you don’t own them.&nbsp;</p>

 Build on Filecoin EVM with Brave Wallet 
<p>Brave has also simplified access to the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) with the addition of Filecoin EVM (FEVM) in Brave Wallet. As a refresher:</p>
 
 
<p>FVM is a runtime that brings smart contracts to Filecoin.</p>
 
 
<p>FEVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) runtime that allows Ethereum and Solidity developers to run their contracts on the FVM with little to no modifications.</p>
 
 
<p>FEVM is making it easier than ever to experience Filecoin’s potential, supercharged by existing (and familiar) Ethereum tooling and infrastructure. Protocol Labs, the team behind Filecoin, expects to see major development in cross-chain contract calls to execute storage processes from other blockchains. They also expect exciting experimentation at the intersections of decentralized finance, social, gaming, and more.</p>
<p>“Putting the compute layer for the largest open storage network in history directly in the browser with Brave wallet unlocks a whole new class of applications on the web which put control directly in end-users hands” said Dietrich Ayala, Browsers &amp; Platforms Lead at Protocol Labs.</p>

      Agents on the Brain         
	By Lauren Reeder, Cornelius Menke, and Stephanie Zhan	 



Published May 1, 2023
        Autonomous agents’ traction is undeniable. On the other hand, it’s unclear how useful these AI applications are today for real tasks. We unpack their potential, and help separate the hype from reality.      



 
<p>The last nine months produced a few discrete waves of AI innovation, each of which expanded our notions of the possible. Last summer came Stable Diffusion and the image generation moment. Then in November, ChatGPT turned our collective attention to LLMs, which has only grown with the launch of GPT-4 and many others. LangChain popularized agents and now we’re seeing the next step on that journey emerge with autonomous agents. AutoGPT surpassed 100k Github stars (more than Go, Kubernetes or Node.js) on April 21, less than a month after launch. BabyAGI has 12k stars and has inspired a <a href="https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi/blob/main/docs/inspired-projects.md">long list of projects</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Autonomous agents can be thought of as language model-powered bots that can break down complex problems and iteratively solve them, taking action on users’ behalf. We can use a simple example to illustrate what is possible with just an LLM, an agent, and with autonomous agents. With just an LLM, we can look up the best restaurants in a given city. With an agent, we can tell it to look up the highest rated restaurant with a table available and book the table for two. With an autonomous agent, we can ask it to find the best restaurant that fits into my schedule and my preferences then book it for me and my best friend. Autonomous agents can do this by breaking down a task into subtasks and using memory between each step to guide the agent’s actions.</p>



<p>Depending on whom you ask, autonomous agents will either prove to be a lasting paradigm shift—with a glimmer of what might be ahead with AGI—or they may just be another moment among many iterative approaches.</p>



<p>It’s easy to see why autonomous agents have captured our collective imaginations. They make it easy to dream of what is possible with small, lightweight apps on top of LLMs. We’ve experimented with spinning up agents ourselves—exploring everything from email digests (that go from scraping Google trends to synthesis and summary) to complex travel itinerary planning and more.</p>



<p>As compelling as these examples may be, autonomous agents leave a lot to be desired in their current state. There is significant room to improve performance, user control and output quality. It is still early days and agents will have to overcome at least three significant hurdles to achieve large scale adoption:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Logical reasoning != good execution: In principle GPT-4 is capable of chain-of-thought reasoning and decomposing tasks into multi-step processes. But in practice, the agent often struggles with executing on their own sub-tasks. They struggle to know when to “take a step back,” leading to getting stuck doing the same task in a loop, or may hallucinate a step and get stuck because there is little external feedback. 



 Compute costs: The architecture of these applications rely on recursive loops, which can lead to many repetitive calls of your LLM. The cost is relatively low per call today with tools like OpenAI’s APIs (but may run into API limits!), but with in-house models, the cost equation may be quite different.&nbsp; 



 Learning: Because the autonomous agents are spun up and not subsequently reused, they do not learn from the prompts or from prior attempts, and don’t learn much from their mistakes. Services that help agents persist are on the horizon, though, which should make managing them easier. 
 



<p>If we can solve some of these challenges, we can imagine a future of “agent to agent” interactions. Specialized agents could be created for common tasks. Instead of spinning up a new agent for every task, you might “outsource” some of the steps and rely on pre-trained agents to fulfill tasks that you pay for per output, and incorporate those outputs as input into your next steps. In other words, your AI could hire or outsource to another AI. “Core” tasks could be covered by different agents, and a new layer of tooling could emerge as the “glue” stitching the entire process together.</p>



<p>What would it take to get there? Current implementations rely on GPT-4 APIs utilized by short-lived agents with limited context windows. To reach their full potential, the next generation will need to be:</p>



 
 Compute aware: minimizing resource usage as an objective function 



 Data aware: finding and connecting to the right model or data source for the task 



 Agent aware: finding, reusing and communicating with ecosystems of agents 



 Safety aware: checking outputs and sandboxing code is the first step, plus more serious controls will be needed to prevent abuse 



 User aware: learning from user behavior and preferences to optimize performance 
 



<p>We think autonomous agents could become an interesting part of the AI application landscape, and the technology is just starting to get good. What will the evolution of agents look like? <a href="mailto:reeder@sequoiacap.com">Tell us</a> what you’re building!</p>

<p>The end of 2022 and beginning of 2023 were marked by centralised institutions failing: from CEXes to CeFi itself, contagion spread quickly in over-leveraged and opaque entities. Amidst this chaos, (crypto)people turned their hopes, once again, to DeFi. However, in lack of traditional enforcing mechanisms, not even battle-tested decentralised lending protocols could find a solution to provide under-collateralised loans, aka credit. Mars Protocol, with its unique hub &amp; outposts architecture, aims to answer this need in the Cosmos ecosystem, by deploying on Osmosis and tapping into its deep liquidity. From manual leverage to credit and yield farming, Mars will feature a wide suite of DeFi products.</p><p>We were joined by Jose Macedo, founder of Delphi Labs, to discuss the history of Delphi Digital, their learnings from incubating projects and the vision behind Mars’ ‘Red Bank’ DeFi products.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jose’s background  Delphi Digital’s history  Incubating projects on Solana and Terra  Learning from Terra  The vision behind Mars Protocol  Mars’ DeFi suite  Different risk parameters and collaterals  Mars’ module architecture (outposts) in the Cosmos ecosystem  How Mars Protocol differs from Osmosis  Mars Protocol roadmap &amp; Mars v.2  Ecosystem accelerator  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ZeMariaMacedo">Jose Macedo on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/delphi_labs">Delphi Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital">Delphi Digital on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/mars_protocol">Mars Protocol on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/astroport_fi">Astroport on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/osmosiszone">Osmosis on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Brian Fabian Crain &amp; Felix Lutsch.

 Levelling up Nym mix nodes across the&nbsp;world <p>Counting 500+ community-operated mix nodes, the Nym mixnet is the largest decentralized mixnet in the world today. The network is maturing: from Nodes.Guru to No Trust Verify, Hermes Stakepool and many others, we are seeing professional mix node operators providing outstanding quality of service. An emerging, broad and active community of stakers pledge their trust in these nodes by delegating NYM tokens to them, making them more likely to mix traffic. This ensures privacy, security, honest behaviour and high quality of service across the entire&nbsp;network.</p><blockquote>See the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym mixnet&nbsp;explorer</a></blockquote><p>It sounds simple: if you want to contribute to the Nym privacy infrastructure and earn mix mining rewards for your efforts, just run a good mix node, get recognized by the community and attract delegations. But what makes a good mix node? And how can one gain recognition in the Nym community and earn the trust of delegators?</p> Welcome to the Nym Delegations Program! <p>The primary motivation for the delegations program is to encourage further decentralisation of the Nym mixnet in terms&nbsp;of</p>  geographical locations  VPS providers  and number of operators.  <p>It is also worth noting that mix node operators in low-income countries often have a proportionally higher cost of setting up infrastructure. This can make running a node prohibitively expensive, especially in the early stages before they get to sufficient stake to start being part of the active set and earning rewards. The Nym Delegations Program aims to bridge this&nbsp;gap.</p><p>If you operate a mix node in an underrepresented part of the world, you can apply for temporary delegations from the Nym treasury to ensure your node gets into the active set more often so you begin earning rewards for providing privacy. Importantly, via mentorship from Nym community OGs, the program also aims to support dedicated node operators like you with best practices and know-how to run outstanding mix nodes and attract community delegations.</p> Key info   How much: 200K NYM tokens for 25 eligible mix&nbsp;nodes  Until when: Delegations apply until node reaches 70% saturation  Deadline to apply: Monday 8th of May&nbsp;2023  <p>**EDIT: due to popular demand, the deadline for submissions is extended by a week to Monday, the 15th of&nbsp;May.**</p> Can I&nbsp;apply? <p>There are five criteria you node has to meet to be eligible for delegations:</p>  You are running a reliable mix node with good quality of&nbsp;service  Your node has below 20% saturation  You do not have other highly saturated mix&nbsp;nodes  Your node is in an underrepresented part of the&nbsp;world  Your node is not running at a major VPS provider such as Hetzner, Google Cloud, Azure, or AWS, or an unreliable one such as&nbsp;Contabo.  <p>Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that becoming a successful mix node operator is an involved process, far beyond just setting up and operating a node. When it comes to the Nym mixnet, community and trust is the name of the game — if you are looking to set-and-forget, this program is not for&nbsp;you.</p><p>On the other hand, if you are eager to contribute to the most robust privacy infrastructure the world has ever seen and to the community operating and securing it, you will enjoy mentorship in doing so from top Nym contributors as part of the delegations program!</p> What do I&nbsp;get?   If selected, the Nym treasury will delegate 200K NYM tokens to your mix node. This will ensure your node gets to mix traffic fairly often, earning you mix mining rewards in the process. The treasury delegation will remain on your node until it reaches 70% saturation organically, through community delegations.  You will receive a special role on the Nym Discord server. You will also get access to a private channel on Element, where you can hang out and work with other delegations program participants, and receive ongoing support and mentorship from distinguished Nym community OGs and node operators.  You will learn the ins and outs of operating a Nym mix node to the highest standards: hardware requirements, monitoring, maintenance, and&nbsp;more.  You will learn about the Nym network, community and ecosystem and how you can establish yourself as a trusted, serious player via contributions.  If you decide to build something or contribute in some way, you can come on the Nym community call as a guest to introduce yourself and your project (this will be decided on an individual basis).   How do I&nbsp;apply? <p>If your node meets the criteria above, simply fill in <a href="https://nymtech.typeform.com/delegations">this</a> application form before Monday, the 8th of&nbsp;May.</p><p>**EDIT: due to popular demand, the deadline for submissions is extended by a week to Monday, the 15th of&nbsp;May.**</p><p>You will need to&nbsp;include:</p>  Mix node&nbsp;ID  Explorer link to your&nbsp;node  Location  Your VPS/server set&nbsp;up  Email/telegram  <p>Note: if selected, you will then be invited to a video interview to meet the team and verify the details of your operations.</p> What happens after the&nbsp;program? <p>This is just the beginning for the Nym Delegations Program. If successful, in future iterations, the scope and scale of the program will be extended. When you no longer need treasury delegations, the community will be counting on you and your new-found knowledge and skills to reach and empower even more people around the world, and to decentralise the Nym mixnet&nbsp;further!</p> Resources   <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/">Download Nym wallet</a> (to bond and delegate to&nbsp;nodes)  <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Browse mixnet explorer</a> (to browse existing mixnodes)  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">Learn about mix&nbsp;mining</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-economics-quarterly-parameter-update-e85b6c929b37">Nym token economics</a>  <p>All program participants must complete KYC; void where prohibited including USA — more information <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/community-resources/rewards-faq.html">here</a>.</p> Languages   <a href="https://medium.com/@nymportugues/apresentando-o-programa-de-delega%C3%A7%C3%B5es-de-nym-b4bcfe9da2a2">Portuguese</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/programa-de-delegaciones-de-nym-fortaleciendo-los-mixnodes-en-todo-el-mundo-bf60a9edded8">Spanish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nym-delegasyon-program%C4%B1-duyurusu-668ec8ef2ae0">Turkish</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%B5%D0%BC-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D1%83-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F-nym-7946c689bb13">Russian</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-delegations-program-c5ecf320ed12">Introducing the Nym Delegations Program</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Release <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.5.0">5.5.0</a> introduces a number of bug fixes and changes to the underlying libraries that support Zcash. Much of this work lays the foundation for the fund availability features coming with the next release. Those features will provide the ability to spend funds before a wallet is fully synchronized. In addition, this release introduces a proportional fee mechanism that may help address future periods of high transaction load on the blockchain. Mobile wallet users sending regular single-recipient transactions will not be affected by this change.</p>



<p>The Zcash protocol continues to be our primary focus at ECC, as we work to exit “Emergency Mode” and deliver a solid and reliable user experience.<br></p>



<p>Summary of Changes</p>



 
 Proportional fee mechanism for the <code>zcashd</code> bundled wallet and mining partners; 



 Foundation work for fund availability/fast balance readiness; 



 Refactor of common code shared in <code>zcashd</code> wallet for <code>z_sendmany</code>, <code>z_shieldcoinbase</code> and <code>z_mergetoaddress</code>; 



 A bugfix enables Orchard transactions to be created and verified on 32-bit platforms. 
 



<p>All node operators, which includes our mining and other ecosystem partners, should upgrade to this latest version as soon as practical.</p>



<p>Additional RPC changes and feature deprecations have been included in this release. For technical details on these changes, including potential impacts of the proportional fee mechanism for node operators, please read the full release notes available at <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/tree/v5.5.0/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.5.0.md">https://github.com/zcash/zcash/tree/v5.5.0/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.5.0.md</a>.</p>

   An analysis of VC funding and trends for 2022 and the first part of 2023. While there is considerable restraint in today’s funding ecosystem, lower financing figures don't translate to lower activity. Seed deals are up, and advancements in AI, vertical specialization, and security are all fueling the formation, growth, and partnerships between companies.

							<p></p>
<p>Recently, we added terminal-based progress bars to Zebra. These experimental progress bars show Zebra’s status, including peers, blocks, and transactions.</p>
<p>To display these progress bars, Zebra uses <a href="https://github.com/kdr-aus/how-u-doin#how-u-doin">how-u-doin</a>, a recently published Rust crate for progress bar coordination. how-u-doin uses the <a href="https://docs.rs/indicatif/latest/indicatif/">indicatif</a> terminal display library to actually create the progress bars. We also started tracking some new metrics in Zebra, like the last chain fork height.</p>

			 Fully Synced View 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>When Zebra has synced to the tip, the progress bars show:</p>
 
 how many peers Zebra is connected to 
 how far its has synced the chain 
 the recent chain forks it is tracking 
 how many transactions are in the mempool 
 						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
																														 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>This is an alternative to Zebra’s logs, which show the chain sync progress every minute and log mempool transactions as they arrive.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Initial Sync View 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>When Zebra is doing its initial sync, it shows the number of queued and verified checkpoint blocks. It doesn’t show the mempool because it doesn’t activate until it reaches the chain tip.</p>

<p>Future growth and wider adoption of blockchain technology largely hinge on fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. More specifically, the success of web3 depends on these factors. While the development and implementation of sidechains are still relatively new, the technology offers promising results.</p>



<p>Sidechains can become effective ‘testing grounds’ for new applications, as it were. If a dApp or smart contract is found to cause damage for example, the harm is contained to the sidechain, as the main chain remains secure, preventing even greater damage.</p>



<p>But perhaps the biggest positive of sidechains is the sheer opportunity to diversify, create, and provide specific solutions to specific use cases. This alone incentivises the investment of time and resources into exploring this exciting possibility.</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/blockchain-consultancy/">Zaisan</a> can become your guide to explore sidechains and any other aspect of blockchain technology.</p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 Sidechains enable the movement of tokens or other digital assets between the main chain and the sidechain through 2-way peg mechanisms called bridges 



 A sidechain can have its own consensus protocol, token, and security, independent of those same features on the main chain 



 Sidechains can run dApps and take some of the computational workloads off the main (‘parent’) chain 



 Sidechains offer the benefits of scalability, interoperability, and versatility 
 



 The evolution of blockchain protocols 



<p>Blockchain technology was little known outside academic circles before 2008. Scott Stornetta and Stuart Haber first proposed the theory behind what we know today as a decentralised ledger – a blockchain – in the early 1990s. They are credited with inventing a network to store timestamped, unalterable digital records.</p>



<p>Stornetta and Haber were aware that altering digital documents without anyone realising the changes was all too easy. This meant that the integrity and trustworthiness of the data were questionable. To address this problem, they came up with a hashing function used to register the documents, group them into blocks, and link them digitally using the hash values. For all intents and purposes, a blockchain.</p>



<p>But this was back in 1991, a full 17 years before the very word, blockchain, gained notoriety outside niche circles following the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has evolved at pace since. Several consensus protocols have emerged. The Bitcoin network used Proof of Work (PoW). Ethereum, Cardano, and others use the Proof-of-Stake model. Other chains use Delegated Proof of Stake. There are other, less-known protocols. Thus, the point is that blockchain, or decentralised ledger, has evolved and diversified ever since that seminal moment in 2008.</p>



 Challenges 



<p>Decentralised ledgers, while versatile, do face some challenges, often referred to as the blockchain trilemma, a term coined by Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin. The trilemma states that three pillars support a perfect blockchain: security, decentralisation, and scalability. Therefore, successful implementation is only possible for two out of these three elements. Adding a third would always be detrimental to the other two in one way or another.</p>



<p>Discussing the trilemma is beyond the scope of this piece, but awareness of it is important as background information, and to understand why sidechains are a key component in solving it.</p>



 Defining layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain 



<p>In the context of blockchain architecture, people often mention the terms ‘layer 1’ and ‘layer 2’. These essential concepts serve a dual purpose: they explain how a blockchain network is constructed and provide a simple representation of what a blockchain network entails. Let’s explore these concepts a bit deeper. </p>



 Layer 1 



<p>The best way to represent layer 1 is by imagining a multiple-tiered wedding cake, at the bottom of which is a stand. This stand is the layer that supports the rest of the cake. In other words, layer 1 acts as the stand for the cake, providing support for the infrastructure built on top of it.</p>



<p>But there is a problem. The stand is only of a certain size, and cannot be made any bigger. It can only hold a certain amount of cake slices. How to solve this problem?</p>



 Layer 2 



<p>How about adding a second layer (layer 2) on top of the base layer? With a second layer, we have more cake, without having to make the base (layer 1) any bigger. We have scaled the cake, haven’t we? And that second layer is completely independent of the base. It can have a different frosting, different flavour, different decoration, etc.</p>



<p>If we extend this analogy, we can draw a comparison to how a blockchain is organised. The underlying blockchain (the main chain) is layer 1, and the sidechain is layer 2, built on top of the first layer. And this second layer can have its own protocol, consensus mechanism, token, etc., just like the second layer of the cake can be decorated in a completely different fashion from the base.</p>



 Sidechains: a solution to the scalability trilemma 



<p>Remember the <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/assets/images/scalability-trilemma-b28096dc15beb24ad77e960c376bef96.jpg">trilemma</a> we mentioned earlier, and how blockchain scalability is one of its vertices? Sidechains are layer 2 solutions (ie, solutions built on top of layer 1) that address this challenge by enabling the main chain to offload some of its computational capacity. By doing this, the main chain achieves higher throughput.</p>



<p>Sidechains are designed for the specific purpose of scaling the layer 1 chain without compromising its security or stability. By connecting to the main chain through two-way pegs, also known as bridges, assets can be securely transferred back and forth.</p>



Source: <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/assets/images/scalability-trilemma-b28096dc15beb24ad77e960c376bef96.jpg">horizon.io</a>



 Asset transfer mechanism 



<p>While the two-way pegs (think of these as traffic tunnels with one lane going each way) enable the transfer of assets between the main chain and the sidechain, the assets aren’t actually transferred. Instead, the requested assets become ‘locked’ on the sender chain, and a smart contract executes to realise the transaction, assuming that all conditions are met. When the transaction is validated, the assets are unlocked and released on the other end and the smart contract informs the main chain about this event. Bridges, depending on their design and functionality, might also enable swapping one token type for another. For example, it may enable swapping one token type for another.</p>



 Benefits of a sidechain 



<p>The use of sidechains in a blockchain system confers three key advantages: scalability, interoperability, and versatility.</p>



 Scalability 



<p>The addition of sidechains enables faster and cheaper transactions on the main chain.</p>



 Interoperability 



<p>Sidechains allow different blockchains to communicate, interact, and exchange data with each other via smart contracts. Besides, developers can use sidechains to quickly deploy dApps on different blockchains, to test out which one works best. This is usually referred to as cross-chain interoperability.</p>



 Versatility 



<p>Sidechains greatly diversify and augment the main chain’s use cases. Furthermore, developers can implement sidechains to meet the specific needs of industries, purposes, or projects, for example.</p>

<p>Brave Search also announces it will launch its own search API to power other search applications in the near future</p>

 Summary 
<p>Every Web search result seen in Brave Search is now served by our own index. We’ve removed all search API calls to Bing, which previously represented about 7% of query results.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>Since its launch, privacy-preserving Brave Search has been the only global, independent alternative to serve results almost exclusively from its own index. That meant far less reliance on the existing Big Tech options (Bing and Google) than the supposed alternatives—like DuckDuckGo—that are actually powered by these Big Tech APIs.</p>
<p>When Brave Search launched in June 2021, about 13% of the queries required the help of third parties to achieve the desired level of quality across various types of queries. Total independence, however, was a primary goal of Brave, and in less than a year <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/independence">the Brave Search global independence score</a> rose from 87% to 93%.</p>
<p>We were able to achieve these improvements in a few ways:</p>
 
 
<p>The rapid adoption of Brave Search (it’s now averaging about 22 million queries per day) made it the fastest growing search engine since Bing.</p>
 
 
<p>Broad adoption of the Web Discovery Project (which allows users to anonymously contribute browsing data to grow the Brave Search index) meant results had the nuance and completeness needed to compete on both privacy and quality.</p>
 
 
<p>Together, these achievements allowed us to accelerate this milestone of 100% independence.</p>
<p>But there was also another consideration: uncertainty over the future of the Bing API, which grew after the Microsoft and OpenAI partnership. We feared for the continuity of the Bing service, which turned out to be a prescient concern, as Microsoft recently announced an unprecedented increase in its API pricing. This created undue pressure for search engines that rely partly or fully on the Bing Search API. The consequences of their reliance on Bing will play out in the following months when their long term contracts expire.</p>
<p>Thankfully (and unlike other search alternatives), Brave had both an independent index, and a built-in delivery mechanism (the Brave browser) to continue improving the Brave Search index.</p>

 What this means for Brave Search and users 
<p>By default, Brave Search users will now receive 100% of results from the Brave Index, giving users fully independent results. As always, our results will preserve user privacy. And this independence does not come at the expense of quality: Over the past several months, the Search team has drastically improved Brave Search’s ability to answer nuanced, long-tail queries.</p>
<p>For the time being, Brave Search won’t serve image or video results from its own index, as we work to improve quality. We now include an option to redirect image and video searches to Bing or Google, rather than relying on a 3rd-party API. Rest assured that the Search team is working on improving image and video search capabilities. If you are conducting these searches within the Brave browser, the browser’s built-in tracking protection applies, even if you’re viewing results on Bing or Google.</p>
<p>For users who want it, <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/google-fallback">Google Fallback mixing</a> will continue to be an option. Users can continue to support the growth of the index and results quality by opting into the <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-">Web Discovery Project</a>, and <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/feedback">submitting feedback</a> in cases where we should improve. And users can use <a href="https://search.brave.com/goggles/discover">Goggles</a> to re-rank and filter results from the Brave Search index.</p>
<p>This removal of all Bing API calls may have an effect for certain queries, or for some regional or language-specific results, so we encourage users to submit feedback as often as possible. The more people who use Brave Search, the better it becomes, and the more we can advance our vision of a user-first Web.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>How to submit feedback on the search results page.</p>

 Announcing the Brave Search API 
<p>In continuing our mission to offer alternatives to Big Tech, Brave is planning to release the Brave Search API. Through it, developers and companies will be able to build search experiences that compete on quality with Big Tech. Those interested should stay tuned for more details, or contact us at <a href="mailto:bizdev@brave.com">bizdev@brave.com</a>.</p>

 Summary: how can you support Brave Search 
 
 
<p>Tell everyone you know about Brave and Brave Search. The more people use Brave, the better the search index becomes, and the more we can drive privacy and security across the Web.</p>
 
 
<p>If you use the Brave browser, opt in to the <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-">Web Discovery Project</a> to help grow the Brave Search index.

 Nym is at Consensus this&nbsp;week <p>One of the world’s primary crypto conferences, <a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/">Consensus by Coindesk</a> is about to kick off in Austin, Texas. And in the midst of major regulatory crackdowns, the overarching theme this year is a return to first principles of Web3 and delivering real value to people. This has become a bit of a trend, with every bear market repeating a similar message: now is the time to remember why we are doing this in the first place and BUIDL. But the first principles of web3 are about more than idealism and ethics. They are pragmatic principles, arrived at after years of tireless work and experiences developing the earlier iterations of the internet.</p><p>Several founders of Nym found themselves in the Web3 movement after having worked on two generations of decentralised networks: Harry Halpin through his work with W3C and <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-computer-scientist-who-boosts-privacy-with-entropy-20221018/">with inventor of the world wide web, Tim Berners Lee</a>; Claudia Diaz through her work at <a href="https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~cdiaz/">KU Leuven</a> on the core privacy problems of the internet with world renowned cryptologist <a href="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/bart-preneel/">Bart Preneel</a>; Alexis Roussel through the Pirate Party; Dave Hrycyszyn and others in the core team via the under-documented history of federated activist media networks in the late 1990s and 2000s. These decentralised activist networks invented micro blogging, tweeting and self-publishing, which was then picked up by and centralised into the familiar corporate form of today: the social media of Web 2.0 platforms who monetized through surveillance.</p><p>What are the lessons learned from these experiences? Firstly, if you don’t solve the business model, you will end up back with centralised control and value extraction. Secondly, without a sustainable remuneration model, open source software will simply provide free R&amp;D to the big technology corporations. And third, that the <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html">cypherpunks</a> were right: the internet has become a world wide vehicle for mass surveillance and what is needed is strong encryption and mixnets to solve&nbsp;it.</p><p>With the advent of Bitcoin, the pieces were finally coming together to solve a fundamental problem of the internet: that the network traffic is entirely exposed. This is because the internet as we know it today was conceived and built in a trusted academic environment. It is notoriously hard to get high-quality, general purpose privacy infrastructure funded and to ensure that this funding doesn’t tempt a company to spy on its users. What had been missing was the final pieces to ensure sustainable, permissionless, decentralised privacy systems: tokenisation to incentivise contributions, reputation and ensure fair remuneration.</p><p>It is now time to deliver the privacy layer for the open internet to ensure basic freedoms in a trustless environment. The Nym mixnet is therefore from its very inception built, necessarily and pragmatically, on the first principles of Web3, with the primary mission of enabling digital privacy for all humanity.</p><p>The Nym mixnet delivers some of the worlds <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/vpns-tor-i2p-how-does-nym-compare-8576824617b8">strongest network layer privacy</a>, shielding IP addresses and traffic patterns for any blockchain, dApp, wallet or application. The mixnet&nbsp;is:</p>  DECENTRALISED — To enable privacy for everyone.The Nym mixnet is operated by a decentralised community of node operators and stakers. Nym is run by a growing ecosystem of users, developers and researcher partners aligned with the mission to make sure Nym software is running, remains usable and solves real problems.  PERMISSIONLESS — To ensure the availability of privacy. You do not need anyone’s permission to run Nym software. Anyone can make use of the libraries or spin up a Nym node and contribute to providing privacy by running the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.  TRUSTLESS — To ensure privacy by default. The Nym mixnet is trustless, meaning that no parts of the system nor its operators have access to information that might compromise the privacy of users. Nym software enacts a strict principle of data minimisation and has no back&nbsp;doors.  TOKENISED — To prevent operators from selling the customer. Where relevant, Nym software incorporates a token to ensure the economic sustainability of operators so that there is no incentive to ‘sell the customer.  OPEN SOURCE — To validate the quality and security of the software. All Nym software is open source so that it can be audited by anyone. This is essential for enabling open code contribution and peer-validation, ensuring that it is secure and of the highest&nbsp;quality.

<p>New Blog Post written by&nbsp;Shorn.</p> Why PIVX’s Optional Private Transactions are a Game-Changer in Cryptocurrency  Introduction to PIVX and its Optional Private Transactions <p>PIVX, or Private Instant Verified Transaction, is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was launched in 2016. PIVX is built on the Bitcoin codebase and uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. One of the key features that sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies are its optional private transactions, which allow users to choose whether to make their transactions public or&nbsp;private.</p><p>The PIVX team believes that privacy is a fundamental human right, and that privacy is essential for the long-term success of cryptocurrency. In a world where digital privacy is becoming increasingly important, PIVX provides a unique solution that allows users to control their own&nbsp;privacy.</p> The Importance of Privacy in Cryptocurrency <p>Privacy is one of the key characteristics of cryptocurrency that sets it apart from traditional financial systems. Cryptocurrency transactions are pseudonymous, which means that they are not tied to a real-world identity. This provides users with a degree of privacy that is not available in traditional financial systems.</p><p>However, not all cryptocurrencies provide the same level of privacy. Some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are more transparent than others. While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, they are still recorded on a public ledger, which means that anyone can view the transaction history of a particular address.</p><p>This lack of privacy can be problematic for users who want to keep their financial transactions private. For example, someone who wants to make a large purchase without revealing their identity might be hesitant to use a cryptocurrency that does not provide strong privacy features.</p> How SHIELD, PIVX’s zk-SNARKs Technology, Enables Private Transactions <p>PIVX’s Optional Private Transactions are enabled by a technology called SHIELD, which is based on zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge). zk-SNARKs is a privacy-enhancing technology that allows users to prove that they have knowledge of something without revealing what that knowledge is.</p><p>In the case of PIVX, SHIELD allows users to make private transactions by proving that they have the funds to make the transaction without revealing their transaction history or the amount of the transaction. This means that PIVX users can make transactions without revealing their real-world identities, making it much more difficult for anyone to track their financial activity.</p> The Benefits of Using SHIELD for Your Transactions <p>There are several benefits to using SHIELD for your transactions. First and foremost, SHIELD provides users with a high degree of privacy. This means that transactions cannot be traced back to a particular user, which provides a level of financial privacy that is not possible with most cryptocurrencies.</p><p>In addition to privacy, PIVX also provides users with almost instant transactions. This makes PIVX an attractive option for users who want to make fast, low-cost transactions, without sacrificing privacy.</p> Other Cutting-Edge Technologies Used by&nbsp;PIVX <p>In addition to SHIELD, PIVX uses several other cutting-edge technologies to provide users with a secure and private cryptocurrency experience. For example, PIVX uses masternodes to provide additional network security and governance. Masternodes are nodes that provide additional services to the network, such as instant transactions and voting rights in the PIVX ecosystem.</p><p>PIVX also uses a decentralised governance system called the PIVX DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation). The PIVX DAO allows users to propose and vote on changes to the PIVX ecosystem, which helps ensure that the community has a say in the future direction of the&nbsp;project.</p> Comparison of PIVX with Other Privacy-Focused Cryptocurrencies <p>There are several other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies on the market, such as Monero and Zcash. While these cryptocurrencies provide strong privacy features, they do not offer the same level of flexibility as PIVX’s optional private transactions.</p><p>With Monero and Zcash, all transactions are private by default. While this provides a high degree of privacy, it also means that users cannot choose to make their transactions public if they need to. This can be problematic for users who need to prove that they made a particular transaction, such as for tax purposes.</p><p>PIVX’s optional private transactions provide users with the best of both worlds. Users can choose to make their transactions private when they need to, but they can also choose to make their transactions public if they need to prove that they made a particular transaction.</p> How PIVX is Contributing to the Evolution of Cryptocurrency <p>PIVX is one of the leading privacy-focused cryptocurrencies on the market, and its innovative use of SHIELD technology has helped set it apart from other projects. By providing users with a flexible and private cryptocurrency experience, PIVX is contributing to the evolution of cryptocurrency as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>PIVX’s focus on privacy is also helping to raise awareness of the importance of privacy in digital transactions. As more people become aware of the risks associated with digital privacy, they are likely to seek out privacy-focused solutions like&nbsp;PIVX.</p> Future Implications of PIVX’s Optional Private Transactions <p>PIVX’s Optional Private Transactions have the potential to revolutionise the way that we think about privacy in cryptocurrency. As more people become aware of the benefits of PIVX’s privacy features, it is likely that other projects will begin to adopt similar technologies.</p><p>In the future, we may see a shift towards more privacy-focused cryptocurrencies that provide users with greater control over their financial privacy. This could have implications for the broader financial system as well, as privacy becomes an increasingly important consideration for consumers.</p> Conclusion <p>PIVX’s optional private transactions are a game-changer in the world of cryptocurrency. By providing users with a flexible and private cryptocurrency experience, PIVX is helping to raise awareness of the importance of privacy in digital transactions.</p><p>With cutting-edge technologies like SHIELD and a decentralised governance system, PIVX is leading the way in the evolution of cryptocurrency. As more people become aware of the benefits of PIVX’s privacy features, it is likely that we will see a shift towards more privacy-focused cryptocurrencies in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>If you value your digital privacy and want to take control of your financial transactions, PIVX is definitely worth considering.</p><p>Visit <a href="http://Pivx.org/privacy-protocol">Pivx.org/privacy-protocol</a> to learn more about SHIELD, and how to keep your cryptocurrency transactions private.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx-coin/optional-privacy-881bf1bc6112">Optional Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx-coin">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Partnering with Harvey: Putting LLMs to Work  <p>Gabe, Winston and their team are using generative AI to give knowledge workers superpowers. </p>   
	By Pat Grady and Charlie Curnin	 



Published April 26, 2023
  



 
<p>More than a hundred million people have now had The GPT Moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the moment you realize the earth is moving beneath your feet. The tectonic plates of technology are shifting, and your world is changing in a fundamental way. You begin to dream. You imagine the impact this will have on your life. You begin to play. You start small, but quickly you’re pushing the limits of the machine, feeding it more and more context for increasingly sophisticated queries. You begin to work. With superhuman recall and reasoning at your fingertips, you’re more productive than you’ve ever been. You don’t know how you lived without this. Your heart is filled with joy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is when the second moment strikes. The Uh-Oh Moment. This is the moment you get an email from Compliance. Compliance would like to provide you with a copy of the new AI Usage Policy. It turns out you are a repeat offender. You instinctively move to ask ChatGPT if this policy is retroactive, but quickly realize that this may be yet another violation. Your heart rate increases. You are now sweating. How are you going to get your job done without GPT models? How is your company going to compete? Fear and panic overwhelm you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Relax. Gabe and Winston have your back. Long before you had your GPT Moment, they had theirs. And they’ve been thinking about how to help you ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gabe Pereyra and Winston Weinberg are the founders of <a href="https://www.harvey.ai/">Harvey</a>. Harvey unlocks the power of LLMs at work.</p>



<p>Last year, Harvey became the first company built on top of GPT-4, and ever since then they’ve been making it work for work. Need a custom model? They’re on it. Data segregation? They’re on it. Enterprise security and compliance? They’re on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gabe comes from the bleeding edge of AI research. Winston comes from blue-chip securities and antitrust litigation. Together, they understand both the problem (rote cognitive labor) and the solution (large language models). And experience aside, they are forces of nature—not to mention a true delight to work with.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harvey is starting with the legal market, which is <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/global-legal-services-market">$300Bn+</a> in the U.S. alone. Legal work is the ultimate text-in, text-out business—a bull’s-eye for language models—and Harvey has already begun to make an impact. Harvey helps legal teams find leverage in time-consuming tasks like legal research, due diligence and more, allowing them to focus on client relationships and strategic work that truly moves the needle. In February, <a href="https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/news-and-insights/news/ao-announces-exclusive-launch-partnership-with-harvey">Allen &amp; Overy</a> became the first announced enterprise customer. In March, <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-announces-strategic-alliance-with-harvey-positioning-pwcs-legal-business-solutions-at-the-forefront-of-legal-generative-ai.html">PwC</a> announced it was coming on board. More than 15,000 law firms are on the waiting list today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gabe, Winston and their team are running hard to make these early believers successful, and they now have the full force of Sequoia behind them. Today we are thrilled to share that we’ve led Harvey’s Series A.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harvey is the first and best instantiation of a new breed of company: the AI super app. Harvey is in the business of giving people superpowers. First, lawyers. Next, professional services. Eventually, all of knowledge work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at Sequoia are delighted to be in business with Gabe, Winston and the entire team at Harvey. We look forward to helping them unlock the power of LLMs at work and, in doing so, usher in a new era of superhuman productivity.</p>

  Consensus 2023’s main theme will be the convergence of traditional finance and DeFi. CEO Oliver Gale shares his guide to the event.

<p>The imminent convergence of traditional finance and DeFi has created a need to build the foundations to support a shared ecosystem. As the incumbents start to adapt, new technology promises to disrupt the standard models. As the architects of a new financial ecosystem, our responsibility is to build the technical, regulatory, and legal frameworks that support growth and innovation, while safeguarding the true interests of users. This is why, during <a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Consensus 2023,</a> I’m looking forward to participating in the multiple conversations that will arise around this.</p><p>‌‌Here are the main topics that have captured my interest.</p> Setting the Stage for Consensus 2023 <p>Consensus is the world's largest, longest-running and most influential gathering that brings together all sides of crypto, blockchain and Web3 communities. It is often regarded as a prominent event for heavyweight players in the blockchain and crypto industry. If you know where to look, the event agenda itself will reveal critical industry concerns, along with where you might find the most valuable insights.</p><p>‌‌Upon reviewing this year’s, several recurring themes stand out: First and foremost, regulatory compliance is a top concern for everyone. Second, this is predominantly due to an urgency from both the DeFi and TradFi sides to create a clear path for institutions to participate in DeFi.</p><p>‌‌The aftermath of this tumultuous year in crypto will determine who is fully established and prepared to integrate with the blockchain industry. As an example, the panel, "<a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-crypto-is-still-inevitable-65?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Crypto is (Still) Inevitable</a>," by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanselkis?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ryan Selkis</a>, CEO of <a href="https://messari.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Messari</a> –a leading DeFi data analytics firm– will delve into the arguments for and against crypto’s proposed solutions. Messari's research reports and data have provided strong guidance for builders, investors, and stakeholders within Web3, and Selkis' talk will likely offer a data-driven analysis of the evolution of DeFi.</p><p>‌‌Another topic of conversation that will doubtlessly be present everywhere is characterized as “government overreach." The topic is gaining traction as the discontent from the sector against the regulatory angles pursued by governments grows. On that note, former U.S. CFTC Chairman <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/About/Commissioners/JChristopherGiancarlo/index.htm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">J. Christopher Giancarlo</a> (who advocated for a "do no harm" approach to crypto regulation) is set to provide a starting point to discuss the future of money and the value of sovereign and non-sovereign digital currencies.</p> Innovating Compliance and Regulations <p>‌‌One topic I’m particularly interested in Consensus 2023, is the role of compliant-friendly data protection solutions.</p><p>‌‌<a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Consumers still require privacy in their transactions</a>, and privacy is a major trust driver in technology. As privacy-unfriendly CBDC solutions loom in the horizon and the global macroeconomic landscape shifts, Zero-Knowledge technology is naturally emerging as a way to preserve user privacy while retaining compliance, allowing parties to prove the authenticity of information without revealing the information itself.</p><p>‌‌<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/04/19/zero-knowledge-proofs-use-cases-for-businesses/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ZK technology</a> can be leveraged for many other use cases, such as blockchain scalability and (as stated) privacy, but I suspect the most interesting conversations will revolve around its use for compliance. The US and other jurisdictions have already taken note of this potential use case, and the ball is now on the DeFi industry’s court to propose and educate regulators on solutions to adopt it.</p> Consensus 2023 And Institutional Capital <p>As institutions find their way into DeFi, some conversations also will naturally begin to shift towards the approach they should follow once in.</p><p>‌‌The Consensus 2023 panel "<a href="https://consensus.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-where-does-tradfi-go-from-herea-recalibrating-the-risks-and-opportunities-34?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Where Does TradFi Go From Here? Recalibrating the Risks and Opportunities</a>" will aim to provide insights that can guide institutional investors on how they can ensure their investments in cryptocurrencies align with their risk appetite and investment objectives. Dawn Harflinger, Matt Halstead, and Dan Tapiero will spearhead this talk, alongside moderator Joe Marenda, Global Head of Digital Assets Investing at Cambridge Associates. As experienced investors who have effectively managed and allocated billions of dollars in capital, I'm interested in hearing the perspectives they've gained through navigating the present investment landscape.</p> Collaborating for a Unified Future <p>‌‌As the industry continues to evolve, early adopters who establish strong networks and relationships will find themselves at the forefront of shaping the future of finance. The successful integration of traditional finance and DeFi requires not only a technically secure infrastructure and self-governing identity solutions but also direct engagement and collaboration among all stakeholders and participants.</p><p>‌‌As we navigate through a tumultuous year and the end of a seemingly long crypto winter, we stand at a crossroads. The decisions we make now will pave the way for a much-needed wave of adoption. It is often said that bear markets are the breeding ground for builders, and witnessing the evolution of conferences like Consensus from their early days only reinforces this notion.</p><p>‌‌By fostering open dialogue, embracing innovation, and working together, we can create a unified ecosystem that is both accessible and secure. I look forward to coming together, sharing ideas, and forge the connections necessary to drive the industry forward, ultimately shaping the future of finance for the better.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a chain-agnostic privacy layer that allows users to access DeFi privately and compliantly. Its users can execute transactions and deploy assets across DeFi. Panther’s <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/cryptographic-primitives">zero-knowledge primitives</a> are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p>Users access Panther’s privacy by depositing assets from different chains into <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/multi-asset-shielded-pools">Multi-Assed Shielded Pools</a> (MASPs or simply <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools">Shielded Pools</a>). Shielded Pools exist in different chains, interconnected by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/zbridges">zBridges</a>. Using <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors">DeFi Adaptors</a>, users can also deploy their assets into DeFi dApps/Protocols, or they can transact with and swap them privately within MASPs.Since Panther’s privacy is enabled by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/cryptographic-primitives">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, users can disclose any part or the whole of their transaction history to anyone at will. They can also choose to withdraw their assets from MASPs into stealth addresses.

 Part 1: Intentional product design around multi-wallet user experiences <p>At <a href="http://privy.io">Privy</a>, we build simple tools to help you onboard and engage your users in web3. In this series, we break down some of the work it takes to create simple experiences with state of the art tooling in&nbsp;web3.</p><p>We spend a lot of time thinking about the user experience surrounding user activation, and in particular connecting wallets to&nbsp;apps.</p><blockquote>Wallets enable true self-custody, but often at the cost of confusing UX.</blockquote><p>To that end, Privy strives to make wallet flows more intuitive for end users, and easier to manage for developers.</p><p>In this post, we’ll see that there is a lot of state complexity in this domain: users can enter the connection flow from many different states, and the wallet can be disconnected or switched from outside of the app&nbsp;context!</p><p>Let’s dive into a concrete example and see how Privy solves for it carefully. At a high-level, our heuristics are:</p>  Wallets integrations should work, independently of what state the user comes in&nbsp;with.  Wallets integrations should account for state changes within the wallet&nbsp;client.  Wallet integrations should provide UIs to help the user understand what to do to get to a desired state, when necessary.  <p>Today we’re going to zoom into a particularly subtle issue around MetaMask connections in a multi-wallet world, that behaves differently based on the user having zero, one or more accounts connected in MetaMask, and also which is the primary selected&nbsp;one.</p>The privy SDK allows multiple wallets to be linked to one&nbsp;user Down the rabbithole <p>First, let’s define some terms and some context. The Privy Auth SDK allows users to link multiple wallets to their user account. This is a very useful feature that customers love, but it comes with a slew of subtle edge cases we need to handle carefully.</p><p>Why is it so subtle? Like a lot of hard programming problems, it’s due to non-trivial state. Wallets can&nbsp;be:</p>  Connected. The official documentation defines it (<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193">EIP-1193</a>) as follows: “The Provider is said to be “connected” when it can service RPC requests to at least one&nbsp;chain.”  Linked. This means authenticated in the privy SDK. With wallets, it means the user has actually signed a message (using <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361">EIP-4361</a>: SIWE).  Active. This is a concept of the Privy SDK. This is the wallet which the developer wants to use to take an on-chain action (like signing, sending ETH, or performing a transaction).  <p>Likewise, we should distinguish between</p>  Wallet addresses. The actual public address for an account on-chain. For instance 0x1dA4FDf7029bDf8ff11f28141a659f6563940642 or pushix.eth.  Wallet clients. The software provider helping users manage their keys, typically what people mean by “wallet”, for instance MetaMask, Phantom or Coinbase&nbsp;wallet.  <p>In addition to the above SDK state (connected-linked-active), wallet clients can have their own wallet state. Most of them, like shown in MetaMask in the below image, have a “primary” selected wallet at any given&nbsp;time.</p>MetaMask’s “selected” wallet<p>A given wallet address (e.g. pushix.eth) can be provided by different wallet clients — by importing the seed phrase — for example by both MetaMask or Coinbase wallet, each of which has subtle differences! The relationship between clients and addresses is therefore many-to-many. If this is still confusing, go check out <a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@nichochar/blockchain-accounts">this short explanation</a> on wallets and external accounts.</p><p>We can start to see the state complexity appear! Wallets can be linked but not connected, connected but not linked, both, active or not, across different clients,&nbsp;etc…</p> Sweating the&nbsp;details <p>Authentication in a multi-modal world (email, phone, wallets) can be tricky business, but is the only way to build rich and engaging experiences, so it’s worth the pain. Let’s shed some light on this by taking an example user story: let’s imagine we’re building an NFT marketplace app which allows users to link wallets together to display the user’s aggregate NFT gallery, but also allows users to mint or purchase NFTs to one of their connected wallets.</p><p>Session 1</p>  User signs up with address1 with the wallet client&nbsp;MetaMask  User links a phone, to take advantage of Privy’s mobile SMS login flows and log in on their phone later (where they do not have MetaMask installed)  The app encourages the user to link more wallets, for a richer gallery profile -&gt; user links address2 with&nbsp;MetaMask   Session 2   User is on mobile, uses their phone number to login, shows off their gallery to a friend on the go. This experience doesn’t involve their&nbsp;wallet.   Session 3   User is on Desktop again, has used SMS to login again, and wants to perform an on-chain action (purchase a sweet new NFT). This requires a wallet to be not only linked to their account (which is already the case), but also connected to the current&nbsp;app.  The developer was intentional here, and wants to connect a specific wallet: address1, not any wallet (maybe because of some on-chain properties of that wallet: it is on a whitelist which allows it to perform a gated transaction).  They call Privy’s setActiveWallet(address1) function, which ensures that the user will connect that specific address and return an ethers or web3 provider to handle the transaction logic.  <p>OK, now that we have this story in place, let’s look at some nuanced state combinations which can happen, and how Privy handles them with&nbsp;care.</p> Case 1: Target address is connected to the site and selected in the wallet&nbsp;client. <p>The happy path! The user’s metamask is already connected to the site, and is also the selected wallet in metamask, this means that eth_requestAccounts returns this address, and sending transactions through window.ethereum will forward to that&nbsp;one.</p><p>This is the easy case! And this is what happens in a non-multi-wallet world most of the time. This just works, so we’ll keep looking at harder&nbsp;ones.</p> Case 2: Target address is connected to the site, but not selected in the wallet&nbsp;client. <p>The user’s metamask is connected to the site, but with the wrong address. So the developer is calling setActive(address1) but the user has address2 as the “selected” wallet in metamask. In this case, Privy’s SDK will nudge the user to switch the wallet in MetaMask, and MetaMask’s UI is quite helpful and intuitive.</p>MetaMask makes it easy to connect another address if at least one is already connected<p>In this case, since MetaMask’s UI is acceptable, so Privy simply gives the user a helpful hint and they can do the switch on their own. This is surprisingly manageable for people that have multiple MetaMask addresses, probably because they are in the habit of switching them like this&nbsp;already.</p> Case 3: Target address is not connected to the&nbsp;site. <p>The user’s metamask has no addresses connected to the current site. This could happen for a multitude of reasons, first of which is that users can choose to disconnect sites independently, at any time, from MetaMask directly (we love user control, this is a good&nbsp;thing!).</p><p>Unlike in case 2, MetaMask does not do a good job of connecting an address to the site from the extension, if no address is connected. The user has to know about an obscure flow, shown&nbsp;below:</p>This mysterious flow to connect from the MetaMask client directly when no wallet is connected is&nbsp;*hard*<p>In practice, little to no one knows about this flow, meaning users are unable to connect to the&nbsp;site.</p><p>Privy adds a <a href="https://littlebigdetails.com/">little big detail</a> for this case, and only this one, which gives the user the option to open the account picker and select the intended address1 and connect it. See&nbsp;below:</p>This will only show up in this specific&nbsp;case<p>Privy goes further to make sure that the user indeed connects address1 and not another one, and gives the user feedback to help them through if they didn’t. This is to compensate for the lack of more powerful APIs in MetaMask: they don’t give the option to connect address1 directly, but only open the account picker, so the user can choose which account to connect. Sometimes, it is great to give the user the choice, but other times — like in the example above where we seek to specifically connect address because of its on-chain properties — developers want more control. See the flow&nbsp;below</p>What if the user gets it wrong and selects another wallet than the intended one from the developer?Privy to the&nbsp;rescue!<p>This example shows but one, small and rare edge case, that a good connector (like Privy) can optimize and make more usable. There are many more such examples of sweating the details in Privy. Privy’s mission is to make onboarding to web3 easier for all users, meeting them where they are in their web3&nbsp;journey.</p><p>As we saw in this post, there is a lot more nuanced complexity that needs to be handled than meets the eye when it comes to web3 connection &amp; authentication flows.</p><p>To be clear, wallets are a core piece of infrastructure and as such, should be treated with care and built around standards (and great work is being done here by the likes of CASA, Spruce and others). Nonetheless, our users’ lives should be simple, regardless of how they connect to the applications we&nbsp;build.</p><blockquote>It’s easy to only think about the happy path and ignore rarer ones that degrade user experience.</blockquote><p>Privy spends a great deal of time optimizing for these and making them as usable as possible for end users, no matter where they are in their web3 journey. Progressive onboarding means meeting users where they are, and often that means smoothing out the UX of these edge case&nbsp;flows.</p><p>You can play around with this yourself at <a href="https://demo.privy.io">https://demo.privy.io</a></p><p>If you are building an awesome web3 product and want to focus on your business domain, not the long and complex tail of web3 Auth edge cases like this one, Privy is here to help!

<p><a href="https://rkyv.org">Rkyv</a> is a data format and (de)serialization framework for Rust that “implements total zero-copy deserialization, which guarantees that no data is copied during deserialization and no work is done to deserialize data. It achieves this by structuring its encoded representation so that it is the same as the in-memory representation of the source type.” (Source: <a href="https://rkyv.org/zero-copy-deserialization.html#total-zero-copy">rkyv.org</a>)</p>
<p>Zebra and zcashd currently provide JSON-RPC methods that accept/return<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON"> JSON</a>-encoded Zcash consensus-serialized data for historical and compatibility reasons. Where there isn’t a Zcash consensus serialization, RPCs serialize data in internal zcashd formats before it is JSON-encoded. JSON is widely-supported, flexible, and human-readable, but lacks type-checking and is relatively slow to encode/decode.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/6313">PR #6313</a>, a “rkyv-serialization” feature was added to Zebra with a new “rkyv_listen_addr” config field for starting a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/datacake-rpc">datacake</a> RPC server that accepts/returns data in the rkyv format.</p>
<p>The datacake RPC methods route to the same RpcImpl and GetBlockTemplateRpcImpl methods provided by Zebra’s JSON-RPC server, except they use the rkyv data format for quicker transformations to and from Zebra’s internal in-memory representation of the source type. Clients calling RPC methods from a Rust environment can import the request/response types paired with message handlers from zebra-rpc and let the Rust compiler check correct usage.</p>
<p>Rkyv <a href="https://github.com/djkoloski/rust_serialization_benchmark">performs very well in benchmarks</a>, (de)serializing over 100x faster than serde_json, and appears to be the most usable, versatile crate for zero-copy deserialization. Validating data with bytecheck can make a big difference, this could be optional if Zebra supports rkyv in the future.</p>
<p>Clients calling RPC methods from a Rust environment can reap the performance benefits from a data format that matches Zebra’s internal in-memory representation of source types. Clients in other languages can also use Zebra’s Rust libraries to deserialize rkyv RPCs.</p>
<p>There are also other excellent frameworks for serializing data (e.g. protobufs, flatbuffers) with better support for other programming languages. Ideally Zebra could expose its RPC methods via multiple encodings and protocols in the future by decoding/encoding request data according to ‘Content-Type’/‘Accept’ headers so clients can call methods from whatever environment they’re already using or which best meet their needs. A GraphQL server that exchanges JSON data may also be nice for making it easier to get started developing with Zebra.</p>
<p>Let us know what data formats and/or protocols you would like to see supported in Zebra on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/809218587167293450/809251029673312267">Discord</a>&nbsp;or on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zebra-rpcs-with-rkyz-data-format/44471">Zcash Community Forum</a>!</p>

<p>San Francisco, California, USA – <a href="http://www.xrsi.org">XR Safety Initiative(XRSI)</a>, a global leader in privacy, safety, and security in immersive and emerging technologies, today announces its strong support for the Kids PRIVACY Act, recently reintroduced by the U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor (FL14). The legislation aims to update the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and implement more robust protections to keep children and teenagers safe online while holding Big Tech companies accountable for their surveillance and targeting of young users.</p>



<p>“Children are spending more time online than ever before, and it’s time that Congress address the evolving online landscape, especially the tracking and data gathering that has vastly outpaced online privacy protections for kids,” said Rep. Castor. “I’m proud to reintroduce my Kids PRIVACY Act, endorsed by parents, safety advocates and pediatricians to update COPPA, protect children online, and hold Big Tech accountable. Parents and families deserve a 21st century privacy law that can contend with a 21st century internet. Companies continue to knowingly target kids, and it is past time they are penalized for violating privacy protections. Let’s come to the table, Democrats and Republicans, to strengthen protections for our youngest neighbors and bring these safeguards into modern day.”</p>



<p>Kavya Pearlman, Founder and CEO of XR Safety Initiative, stated, “In this age of rapid technological advancement, it is crucial to ensure the privacy and safety of our children and teenagers. We commend Rep. Castor for her unwavering commitment to protecting young people in the digital world. The Kids PRIVACY Act is a vital step toward ensuring that the best interests of children and teenagers are at the forefront of service design and that their privacy rights are respected.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The Kids PRIVACY Act expands privacy protections for children and teenagers by:</p>



 
 Banning Companies from Providing Targeted Advertisements to Children and Teenagers: Prohibits companies from targeting children and teenagers based on their personal information and behavior. 



 Best Interests of Children and Teenagers: Requires an operator to make the best interests of children and teenagers a primary design consideration when designing its service. 



 Requiring Opt-In Consent for all Individuals Under 18: Companies must obtain specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent before collecting, retaining, selling, sharing, or using a young consumer or child’s personal information. 



 Creating a Right to Access, Correct, and Delete Personal Information: Companies must provide individuals the opportunity to access, correct, or delete their personal information at any time. 



 Protecting Additional Types of Information: Expands the type of information explicitly covered to include physical characteristics, biometric information, health information, education information, contents of messages and calls, browsing and search history, geolocation information, and latent audio or visual recordings. 



 Requiring User-Friendly Privacy Policies: Companies must make publicly available privacy policies that are clear, easily understood, and written in plain and concise language. 



 Creating a Protected Class of “Teenagers” Ages 13-17: For the first time in statute, the bill provides protection for teenagers 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it. 



 Expands Coverage of Companies: Applies to all sites likely to be accessed by children and teens, not just child-directed services. 



 Limiting Disclosure to Third Parties: The bill prohibits companies from sharing personal information without consent. Furthermore, it creates additional duties companies must comply with before disclosing any personal information with third parties. 



 Requiring Reasonable Data Security Policies, Practices, and Procedures: Requires companies to have a written security policy, point of contact for information security management and processes to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities. 



 Prohibiting Industry Self-Regulation: Repeals dangerous safe harbor provisions that allow for lax enforcement and rubber stamping of potentially unlawful practices. 



 Strengthening FTC Enforcement: Raises the maximum allowable civil penalty per violation by 50 percent and allows the FTC to pursue punitive damages. Also establishes a Youth Privacy and Marketing Division at the FTC. 



 Providing for Parental Enforcement: Parents will be able to bring civil actions to help enforce the bill and any resulting regulations. 



 Banning Forced Arbitration: In a much-needed reversal of current law, companies will no longer be able force their consumers to waive their right to sue.

The Public Blockchains as a Service release marks a major milestone for Verus and the entire cryptocurrency industry.  ⏱️ PBaaS activation: block height 2,549,420 (Tuesday 23 May&nbsp;2023) <p>Upgrade to this release or a later version v1.0.0-x, before MAY 23, 2023 to stay reliably connected to mainnet. <a href="http://www.verus.io/wallet">Download here</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>Testnet release will allow you to connect to the new testnet, which we see as a core development platform and staging area for the Verus PBaaS network and have no plans to reset in any foreseeable future.</p><p>Read the release notes on GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v1.0.5">CLI</a> 🔗 and <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.5">GUI</a>&nbsp;🔗</p> Turning the Crypto Industry on its&nbsp;Head <p>The wide cryptocurrency industry will see how much better Verus PBaaS is as a solution for true decentralization in cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, on-chain P2P exchange, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, scale, or just about any of the challenges people have on crypto platforms today. In fact, as we prepare for activation of this protocol that enables so many new use cases for crypto, not to mention easy onboarding when entrepreneurs discover how to really leverage VerusIDs, PBaaS is so far beyond what people are experiencing on any crypto platform today that it has been easy to dismiss our community as describing the impossible.</p><p>Once PBaaS is live on mainnet and people can actually use all of this themselves, along with every project, chain and currency on the PBaaS network and EVERY ERC20 or ERC721 on Ethereum or even bridged to Ethereum, the truth of Verus will be self-evident, and those who build on Verus will more easily build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs that do not need business deals, permission, or any centralized infrastructure to connect services and users, enabling everyone to communicate in provable, private, or public ways that always include bidirectional, secure commerce of all&nbsp;kinds.</p> Core Capabilities <p>The core capabilities of this release include (lots to learn to understand it all, but here’s a partial&nbsp;list):</p> Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP) — Layer 0 Multichain and Inter-chain Protocol <p>To our knowledge, the VIP protocol is the only fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology available on any network that is based on cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. From what we’ve been able to learn about LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, Thorchain or others, VIP is different from (though closest in some ways to LayerZero), superior to, and more decentralized than all other cross-chain protocols we have seen. We can of course get into any level of discussion on the topic, but expect more descriptions and educational material to follow, now that the protocol was originally conceived of 5 years ago, and has been developed and tested/hardened for&nbsp;years.</p> VerusID Content Multimaps — Unlimited Provable Data for Every&nbsp;VerusID <p>Of course this upgrade retains all of the groundbreaking capabilities already available with VerusID, including multisig options, separate revocation and recovery authorities for maximum security to prevent theft of identity or funds, and the ability to timelock your ID, enabling you to even thwart attempts to access your funds after someone compromised your secret&nbsp;keys.</p><p>With the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs also gain a powerful new capability that amounts to an unlimited, rent-free indexed database for every VerusID on every blockchain of the PBaaS network. This data can be encrypted or published in the clear and used for any purpose or application, whether social networking, voting, oracles, publishing any information, various forms of provable attestations, ratings, and much, much more. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. We don’t believe anything else even comes close, and with the recent rise of AI, it feels great to have this come together as a core original goal at a very appropriate and important time in&nbsp;history.</p> Permissionless Chain, Token, and Liquidity Basket Currency&nbsp;Launches <p>Whether you are looking to crowdfund an effort in a manner much like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, sell identities to which you expect to add value or that are sub-IDs of a very cool root ID, or launch an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with all of the Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1, Verus is probably the best platform for you. In fact, as we were planning for the next testnet and wanted to have our own version of DAI to use in the bridge, since we want only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge, we used a command to launch a token on the old testnet, exported it and all its supply to Ethereum’s Goerli on the existing bridge, and that will be the DAI proxy/simulant that we will use on the new testnet. It saved us all some time, proving that Verus PBaaS will also be the easiest, most efficient way to launch even an Ethereum ERC20, whether that ERC20 represents a token, DeFi basket, or even another PBaaS blockchain</p><p>Verus enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched&nbsp;it.</p><p>All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus&nbsp;network.</p><p>Verus also enables any ID owner to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners, stakers, and liquidity providers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.</p> Decentralized Ethereum&nbsp;Bridge <p>Shortly after PBaaS activates on mainnet, the Ethereum bridge will launch as a decentralized gateway and 1:1 provably mapped currency called “vETH” on the Verus network, also available to all PBaaS chains. The Ethereum bridge will also include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will have the following functions:</p>  Auto conversion of fees from Verus &lt;-&gt; Ethereum when sending cross chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket  Permissionless ability to register *.vETH IDs, which in addition to the normal sub-ID capability of creating a single token that has control over the ID and can be exported to Ethereum as an automatic ERC721 NFT, can alternately be used to create a “mapped currency”, which can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting it to the vETH bridge. Only Verus root IDs, and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a&nbsp;gateway.  Decentralized, fair bridge launch. The vETH bridge will launch as other currencies, chains, and gateways can launch, including the bridge converter. When the bridge launches, the contracts will have a surplus of Verus that comes from the fees paid to launch the gateway. In the protocol, that surplus is first used to solve the chicken and egg problem of none of one currency on the other chain. The contracts will cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches, the liquidity basket becomes active, and the bridge recognizes that launch. Once that happens, the remainder of ½ the fees (5000 VRSC) that are left over from the launch and did not go to miners and stakers or pay Verus fees for people sending from Ethereum.   The Verus Fee Pool and&nbsp;Rewards <p>Another technology and solution unique to Verus, the Verus Fee Pool technology goes live with PBaaS. What this means is that as people use the cross-chain, DeFi, or purchase/register IDs on the network, the miner or staker will put all fees into the on-chain “fee pool”, and then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This gives everyone incentive to still prioritize transactions based on fees, while preventing validators from gaming the fee system by washing fees-in vs. fees-out or working to reorg/rewind to capture a particularly juicy block reward. Instead, this technology aligns all validator incentives with the health/proper operation of the network and creates a circular on-chain economy that can last well beyond block&nbsp;rewards.</p> To know more about Verus PBaaS capabilities <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-announces-new-multicurrency-multichain-defi-protocols-and-immediate-public-availability-of-f1868f259ce5">read this article</a>&nbsp;🔗  A Historic Move&nbsp;Forward <p>For those who actually understand the challenges actual users have in crypto today, this release represents a historic move forward in public cryptographic networks and credibly and actually neutral infrastructure for society-wide human and AI collaboration and learning. As a community, this version really does realize the vision laid out in the original <a href="https://verus.io/papers/VerusVision.pdf">Verus Vision Paper</a>, and at the same time provides much more than was described there. We are a community of individuals, and it is only because that is what we are that we have all arrived here together. The rest of the world is stuck on their Munchausen’s protocols, trying to figure out how to share the front-running and back-running spoils taken from users, but Verus activation gives them a better path&nbsp;forward.</p><p>As a community, we do not promise, we describe a shared vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases described in the first vision paper together, it is time for each of us to also consider what we might personally want to build or be part of building over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Read the release notes on GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v1.0.5">CLI</a> 🔗 and <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.5">GUI</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>Thanks to the incredible combined efforts of so many people in the community ranging from development, companies and projects joining and their open contributions (<a href="https://www.valu.earth">Valu/Arkeytyp</a>, <a href="https://chips.cash">CHIPS</a>, vDEX, <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert</a>, <a href="https://cragslist.hopto.org">cragslist</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joefromthehills/status/1635769270708649988?s=20">Electricty Supply Board of Ireland</a> and more) to community members supporting users to helping educate others who can contribute as well, we have run these protocols now for years as we’ve improved them, and all of these capabilities will go live on the Verus mainnet May 21, 2023, with the activation expected targeting block 2,546,600.</p> Join the community.

 👉 Trend + tips: Token design, beyond tokenomics <p>Guy Wuollet et al</p><p>“Tokens” are a hot-button topic, capturing mindshare not just for those in crypto but for anyone interested in art, design, economics, gaming, math, psychology, and more. And while tokens have been described as everything from a “<a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef">breakthrough in open network design</a>” to a “<a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619?lang=en">new digital primitive (analogous to the website</a>)”, we can generally define tokens as: an internet-native unit of value.&nbsp;Importantly, tokens represent not just monetary value — but also social, reputational, and many other forms of value. </p><p>Tokens can be used to coordinate and organize people beyond a purely economic context. That’s why the term “tokenomics” — token + economics — for describing the study and design of tokens is too limited. We need another term to designate “the study of “ tokens (“tokenology” perhaps?) for how to coordinate people, organizations, and/or computation towards a common goal through the use of cryptography and mechanism design.<br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/beyond-tokenomics-tokenology/">read more</a></p><p>Okay; so if tokens are a powerful new primitive that can be defined in many ways — allowing for a very rich design space — it would be great to have <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_roughgarden/status/1522995114062360576?lang=en">the modern equivalent</a> of (what computer scientists refer to as) “the Dragon Book”! The Dragon Book helped turn the impossibly messy, big computer science problem of the 1950s — that is, of compiler design — into a more well-solved problem that could be tackled in stages, by applying rigorous principles at each stage.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s too early to produce such a definitive text on tokens, but some of early token design principles are already becoming clear. And while effective token models will have design elements unique to their specific objectives, most flawed token designs do share a number of common pitfalls. So here’s a list of instructive tips our team has observed, to help builders avoid the most common failure modes:<br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/designing-tokens-sanity-checks-principles-guidance/">read more</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/guywuolletjr/status/1649546737726398465?s=46&amp;t=m_MyW3EHf_hr6YPWeAdbGA">share on Twitter</a> / <a href="https://warpcast.com/guy/0x71889ahttps://warpcast.com/guy/0x71889a">share on Farcaster</a></p><p>related:</p>  <p>▶️ watch: “<a href="https://youtu.be/GOkxDvq_8zQ">Token Design: Mental models, capabilities, and emerging design spaces</a>” (2022) by Eddy Lazzarin</p>  <p>📖 read: “<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/the-web3-playbook-using-token-incentives-to-bootstrap-new-networks/">The web3 Playbook: Using token incentives to bootstrap new networks</a>” (2021) by Chris Dixon&nbsp;</p>  <p>see also: 📖 “<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/reputation-based-systems/">A novel framework for reputation-based tokens</a>” (2021) by Jad Esber and Scott Kominers, on how reputation systems present an opportunity for platforms to recognize (and thus incentivize) participants’ meaningful contributions, including content creation, moderation, community building, and gameplay. </p> 📐Code + theme: More client diversity through open source <p>Noah Citron et al</p><p>A recurring theme in our (and more importantly, the broader crypto community’s) open source efforts is making sure networks have no single point of failure. This helps makes decentralized networks more robust, more secure, and far more resilient than their centralized counterparts. But in practice, we often see potentially vulnerable points of centralization — whether due to specific aspects (like <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-helios-ethereum-light-client/">centralized remote procedure calls</a>), or a lack of independently developed clients.&nbsp;</p><p>Client diversity, in particular, is critical for <a href="https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1553323168521228289">rollups</a>; client diversity is needed on both the execution and consensus sides, but most of the development so far has been focused on execution clients. That’s why we *just released* <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-magi-a-new-rollup-client-for-optimism/">Magi</a> — a fast OP Stack rollup client written in Rust — which acts as the consensus in the traditional execution/ consensus split of Ethereum by feeding new blocks to the execution client, in order to advance the chain. Magi aims to be an independently developed, drop-in replacement for op-node, adding to the rollup’s client diversity; and encouraging greater safety and liveliness throughout the OP Stack via Rust. </p><p>But it also helps bring more contributors into the ecosystem, simply by broadening the developer base with clients in other languages...&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-magi-a-new-rollup-client-for-optimism/">read more</a><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/building-magi-a-new-rollup-client-for-optimism/"><br></a><a href="https://github.com/a16z/magi">see code base</a><a href="https://github.com/a16z/magi"><br></a><a href="https://twitter.com/eddylazzarin/status/1648703454813241350?s=20">share on Twitter</a> / <a href="https://warpcast.com/ncitron/0x865a57">share on Farcaster</a></p><p>see also: 🎧 “<a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/programming-languages-smart-contract-programming-evolutions">Programming languages &amp; crypto</a>”, with Sam Blackshear, Noah Citron, Eddy Lazzarin, and Sonal Chokshi (2023).

<p>We often take data storage for granted, but the rise of centralised storing facilities (i.e. AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) hangs over like Damocles’ sword. When it comes to blockchains, full nodes store that network’s complete data history. Even if storage costs are set to decrease as technology evolves, so do blockchains accumulate more data over time. An interesting solution would be to create a decentralised backup for blockchain data and Arweave is a prime candidate for it. There is but a missing link represented by uploading and validating different blockchains’ data. This is where KYVE steps in, offering a decentralised validating solution to verify uploaded blockchain data and even retrieve it from Arweave, on demand. This also extends to off-chain data, opening new possibilities for data availability and scalability.</p><p>We were joined by John Letey, founder and CTO of KYVE Network, to discuss the challenges and use cases of decentralised data storage and how blockchain interoperability could benefit from it.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  John’s background  Why KYVE migrated to a Cosmos app-chain  High-level explanation of KYVE  KYVE’s data pools and data streams  How KYVE connects to Arweave  Validating uploaded blockchain data  How Arweave works  KYVE v.2  How slashing is handled  KYVE use cases  Future roadmap  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/johnletey">John Letey on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/KYVENetwork">KYVE Network on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://www.kyve.network/">KYVE Network</a>  <a href="https://arweave.org/">Arweave</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p></p> Horizen EON brings EVM compatibility to the Horizen ecosystem and offers more opportunities for developers and web3 end users.&nbsp; 



 



 TL;DR 



 
 We are thrilled to announce today the launch of <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> (Ethereum Open Network), our first public proof-of-stake and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible smart contracting sidechain, on permanent public testnet <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/status/gobi">Gobi</a>.&nbsp; 
 Horizen partners with Immunefi to launch Gobi Bug Bounty Program to offer up to $75,000 in bounties 
 Gobi Testnet is supported by a network of products, integrations and tools that ensures the rich capability and user-friendliness for EON developers and end users, starting on day one.  
 Gobi Testnet has many improvements and new features since the previous testnets, it is the final beta stage before the EON mainnet activation later this year. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About Horizen EON and What Makes it Different? 
<p>While Ethereum has been driving broad adoption of DeFi ecosystems and smart contracts, Horizen has been developing its cross-chain protocol and horizontal scaling solution, <a href="https://horizen.io/zendoo">Zendoo</a>, that will allow a wider adoption of blockchain technology with full customization at the protocol level. </p>
<p>With the addition of EON, the first of many smart contracting sidechains on Horizen, Horizen is opening up its ecosystem to more opportunities for efficient development and usage of a wide range of dApps and services than ever before. Solidity developers will be able to deploy custom logic to the blockchain to enable continuous innovation without changing the protocol. </p>
<p>Coupling smart contracts with the custom blockchain nature of Zendoo and an intra-ecosystem secure bridging protocol, Horizen now offers a market-leading solution to drive the industry forward – a permissionless, interoperable, customizable sidechain network.</p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Horizen_EON_how-it-works.jpg"></a> 


 



 
  
  



 
<blockquote>
<p>“The launch of EON opens our doors to the Ethereum developer community and invites them to explore the vast possibilities that Horizen offers. </p>



<p>As we enter the final testnet phase, we’re eager to harness not just the existing Ethereum DeFi infrastructure but also connect it with the dynamic and interconnected Horizen ecosystem. This presents a unique opportunity to receive valuable feedback from both our longstanding users and new members, which will enable us to refine our offerings and create an even more seamless and user-friendly experience for all.”</p>
Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs</blockquote>
 
 



 Horizen Partners with Immunefi to Launch Gobi Bug Bounty Program to Offer Up To $75,000 in Bounties 



<p>Aiming to strengthen the security of the EON platform, accompanied with the Gobi testnet launch of EON, Horizen also partners with Immunefi to launch a bug bounty program of up to $75,000 in bounties for reporting vulnerabilities.</p>



 
  
  



 
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m proud of our team’s hard work building out the tech behind our public EVM. Our focus is on optimizing the advantages of smart contracts within the Horizen ecosystem by providing a smooth development process and user experience through a suite of tools and a range of integrations on EON. </p>



<p>In addition to our team’s efforts, we rely on the wider community to ensure the security of our platform. Therefore, we invite developers to participate in our Gobi bug bounty program to help us improve EON’s security.”</p>
Zain Cheng, CTO of Horizen Labs</blockquote>
 
 



 
  
  



 
<blockquote>
<p>“Immunefi is excited to collaborate with Horizen in launching their bug bounty program. This partnership showcases our shared commitment to security and excellence, empowering us to build a robust and trusted blockchain ecosystem together.” </p>
Mitchell Amador, CEO of Immunefi</blockquote>

 Early Participants and Integrators Jumpstart the EON Ecosystem 



<p>Gobi Testnet is supported by a network of products, integrations and tools that ensures the rich capability and user-friendliness for EON developers and end users, starting on day one. </p>


 
 


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These integrations include popular developer tools such as <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/docs/tutorials/thirdweb">Thirdweb</a>, Remix, Truffle and Hardhat; the most popular web3 wallet, MetaMask; fully-featured open-source block explorer, <a href="https://gobi-explorer.horizen.io">Blockscout</a>; cross-chain bridge protocol, <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1636022497744392192">Multichain</a>;&nbsp; cross-chain data oracle platform, <a href="https://www.bandprotocol.com/">Band Protocol</a>; blockchain data API, <a href="https://covalenthq.com">Covalent</a>; and more! Horizen community developers have also been building on EON since the previous testnet stages. EON is expected to welcome a wealth of developer tools, dapps and services in the coming months!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join the first wave of builders and integrators to build on Gobi to give your development a jumpstart for EON mainnet! You can find guides on <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/docs/">EON documentation</a>. Join the #eon developer community on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord</a> for support and discussion with other developers.</p>
<p>Important information for Gobi testers: Smart contracts previously deployed on Dune Testnet and/or Yuma Testnet have to be redeployed on Gobi.&nbsp;</p>

 About Gobi Testnet 


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ZBF_Gobi-eon-roadmap.jpg"></a> 


<p>Prior to the launch of Gobi testnet, EON has been run on the invite-only testnet Dune and temporary public testnet Yuma. </p>
<p>Gobi Testnet is a permanent public testing environment for EON, with many improvements and new features added, it is the final beta stage before the EON mainnet activation later this year.&nbsp;</p>


 
 


 
 Non-ceasing sidechains 
 
<p>The Horizen mainchain verifies each sidechain and ensures its integrity.&nbsp; Non-ceasing sidechains makes the verification process more flexible and frictionless without compromising the security of the system.</p>
 
 Key rotation circuit 
 
<p>A SNARK-based security enhancement that gives a higher level of security and will allow for increased decentralization over time.</p>
 
 Secure key management 
 
<p>A security enhancement that gives the ability to sign transactions and certificates using keys that are not stored locally, that are instead in a separate trusted execution environment&nbsp;</p>
 
 Local EON client for building dapps&nbsp; 
 
<p>This can improve the dapp development process by allowing developers to test and iterate dapps more quickly locally before deploying on chain. Instructions is available on <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/docs/develop_and_deploy_smart_contracts/local_build_and_deploy">EON documentation</a></p>
 
 Websocket support 
 
<p>An alternative way of getting data, more suitable for dapps running a local client. Websocket creates a channel between server and client, and is ideal to receive notifications or new blocks as they arrive.</p>
 
 On-demand autoscaling RPC nodes 
 
<p>For improved scalability and user experience. Autoscaling allows the network to automatically increase the nodes as demand increases.</p>

<p>The Nym Rust SDK is now available, meaning devs can more easily integrate with the mixnet! The Nym mixnet puts the most advanced network privacy protections in the hands of developers to extend to their&nbsp;users.</p><p>When you integrate with the mixnet, you are offering your users protection for their IP addresses, as well as ensuring their network traffic is shielded from AI-driven metadata surveillance and large scale traffic analysis. In short, integrate with the mixnet to ensure your apps have default network level privacy, as it should&nbsp;be!</p><p>This is a pre-release, meaning it is not available on crates.io quite yet, but you can still import it from GitHub, so <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/sdk/rust.html">try it&nbsp;out</a>!</p> What is an SDK useful&nbsp;for? <p>The Nym SDKs make it far easier for developers to integrate mixnet functionality into applications by being able to import Nym clients as dependencies, just like any other dependency or a crypto library. What this means in practice is that clients can connect to and communicate with the mixnet as part of the app process, instead of having to run as a separate process alongside it. This makes for both far smoother development and user experiences.</p><p>What does this mean for people wanting to integrate with Nym? It means it’s now easier to integrate Nym mixnet functionality into your development environment. You will be able to build or integrate your web apps (with the already released Typescript SDK) and now also Rust applications. You no longer need to run a client as a separate process on your machine. And the SDKs provide far more intuitive interfaces with which to interact with the mixnet, meaning you can focus on the logic of your own app instead of constructing messages to send through the&nbsp;mixnet.</p> Which SDKs are available for&nbsp;Nym? <p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk/v/1.1.4">TypeScript SDK</a> is available and was announced in a previous <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-sdk-powerful-privacy-served-directly-to-your-browser-15c0919bdfbf">blog post</a>. This SDK allows users to import the Nym Webassembly client into browser-based application frontends, and has been updated and now has an example with parcel as a&nbsp;bundler.</p>  Coming soon: for NodeJS environment so you can use it in server environments as well as persistent identities / key&nbsp;storage.  <p>The <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/sdk/rust.html">Rust SDK</a> (pre-release) allows developers to embed either a Websocket or Socks5 client into applications to communicate with the mixnet. You can find examples&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/sdk/rust.html">here</a>.</p>  Coming soon: Nym Rust SDK tutorial!   Future SDK&nbsp;updates <p>Right now both SDKs allow devs to interact with the mixnet: send and receive messages, and create clients (the Rust SDK allows for persistent client identities / keypairs, the TS SDK will in a subsequent release). But there are many other features that will be supported once these are rolled out across the mixnet! Including the ability to create and use zk-nyms and sign and broadcast Nyx blockchain transactions and&nbsp;queries.</p><blockquote>Bring the power of a global mixnet to your app, dapp or&nbsp;wallet!</blockquote> What apps are already integrated with the Nym&nbsp;mixnet?   <a href="https://github.com/notrustverify/nostr-nym">Nostr over Nym</a> by <a href="https://pnproxy.org/">Pineapple Proxy</a>  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/tree/b13a58f439cab0e87062f0567896d8665d9c12a0/yarn-project/nym-gateway">Aztec connect</a> by&nbsp;<a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec</a>  <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/rust-libp2p-nym">Libp2p over Nym</a> — by <a href="https://chainsafe.io/">Chainsafe</a>  <a href="https://github.com/EdenBlockVC/spook">Ethereum RPC</a> by <a href="https://www.edenblock.com/">EdenBlock</a>  <a href="https://github.com/noot/nym-ethtx">Ethereum broadcaster</a> by&nbsp;noot  <a href="https://github.com/notrustverify/pastenym">Pastenym</a> by No Trust Verify (<a href="https://pastenym.ch/#/">try&nbsp;it</a>!)

<p>In our latest <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-monthly-update-january-2023/">monthly update</a>, we shared the user interface for zSwap, the very first use case for Panther’s DeFi Adaptors… and one of the most important features of Panther’s v1.<br></p><p>zSwap allows users to execute swaps on most liquid DEXs with a high degree of privacy. As such, it is the first piece of Panther’s plan to enable private access to DeFi from multiple fronts.<br></p><p>Let’s take a look at how it all works.<br></p> But first, what are DeFi Adaptors?<br> <p>One key component that will help realize Panther’s vision of private DeFi access is to develop plugins that are specific to existing protocols and connect them to Panther Pools (Panther’s private Multi-Asset Shielded Pools). This overall solution is referred to as DeFi Adaptors.<br></p><p>Each plugin enables zAssets (assets shielded in a Panther Pool) to interact with DeFi protocols by passing relevant values and function types, resulting in a seamless transaction flow while maximizing the benefits of both protocols for the user. Thanks to this system, users gain access to Panther’s zero-knowledge privacy without having to let go of the underlying security of the blockchain networks Panther is deployed on.<br></p><p>Panther’s catalog of DeFi Adaptors will be ever-expanding to interact with a broad range of DeFi dApps and protocols, starting with some of the ecosystem’s most popular applications –DEXs, NFT marketplaces, and lending/borrowing protocols. Each of these different interaction types will have a dedicated Adaptor and, as you will see below, the DeFi Adaptor dedicated to swapping assets through DEXs is called zSwap.</p>Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pools connect to DeFi dApps through custom plugins. The overall solution is what we refer to as “DeFi Adaptors.”<p>Since Panther’s vision is to give users the ability to access DeFi with full privacy, Adaptors play a key role in enabling them to break the on-chain link between their assets and their DeFi activity. Like Panther Pools, DeFi Adaptors will be debuted in Polygon at the release of Panther’s v1. If you want to learn more about zAssets and Panther Pools, please see this article.<br><br></p> How zSwap enables private swaps on popular DEXs <br> zSwap’s user interface.‌ ‌<p>The first use case for DeFi Adaptors, zSwap, is designed to facilitate swap transaction flow towards some of the most widely used protocols in the Polygon DeFi ecosystem –<a href="https://quickswap.exchange/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Quickswap</a>, <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap v3</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve</a>. This functionality is found within the “Swap” tab in Panther’s decentralized application (dApp).<br></p><p>zSwap features a user interface similar to those of the DEXs mentioned above for a familiar user experience. It also allows users to dictate the token IDs for the assets they want to sell/buy from a list of accepted assets (see below), enabling them to choose the specific swap pair they wish to trade. Users can also input the amount of the sell token they wish to trade, and the zSwap function will query an exchange rate based on these inputs and provide users with up-to-date values. This ensures that users can make informed decisions about their trades and optimize their transactions for the best possible outcome.<br></p><p>zSwap’s goal is to cater to a wide range of user types, including retail users, institutions, and market makers. At v1, zSwap will support the interaction with three different platforms, with the ability to highlight the best platform or “route” for users to conduct their swaps, allowing them to swap tokens at the most favorable rates and incur smaller fees.<br></p> Economic optimization of swapping opportunities<br> <p>zSwap uses advanced algorithms to identify the optimal routing path for the trade execution while allowing the user to choose other sub-optimal options if that is their preference. It provides an optimized user experience by automatically defaulting to the platform with the least price impact based on the trade variables that the user is wishing to execute. <br></p><p>Additionally, zSwap displays a calculation of the difference between the best available opportunity and the rest of them in terms of the price impact of each DEX (e.g. a trade could feature a 2% impact in Curve as opposed to a 0.3% on in Uniswap). In the future, zSwap might be expanded to support more DEX integrations to allow further diversity of asset flow and access to deeper liquidity.</p>zSwap screen, featuring the routing functionalities. How zSwap enables user privacy in DeFi <p>The ability for users to swap assets privately serves a double purpose: <br></p>  Allowing users to trade between all whitelisted assets available using the platforms above.  Contributing to the privacy that Pools provide to users holding assets within them. In other words, no one can link assets within the pool to specific users since they have the ability to swap assets and trade with one another within it, even if deposits/withdraws to the Pool itself are viewable by observers.<br><br>  Comparing Panther’s privacy to a typical transparent L1 blockchain when swapping assets.<p>The Panther DAO can propose assets for whitelisting at any time since whitelisting an asset requires a manual configuration. For the protocol’s first release, Panther will roll with the following assets:<br><br>Stablecoins:<br></p>  USDC  USDT  DAI  <p>Other tokens:</p>  wETH  wBTC  MATIC  CRV  LINK  <p>These tokens represent the largest DEX flow on Polygon and, as such, can aid Panther’s goal of bootstrapping its privacy through user activity. Further integrations can then be leveraged as activations on their own and help the protocol’s organic growth by engaging the communities associated with them.</p> User path<br> <p>The following scenario may help you understand how zSwap works in a practical setting.<br></p>  Alice wants to swap her ETH for USDC. As a privacy-conscious user, she already holds her ETH as zETH within Panther Protocol (ETH deposited into a Panther Pool, helping others in the process by increasing the Pool’s size and its mixture of assets). This grants her access to the privacy-preserving functionalities of zSwap. Alice then proceeds to the Swap page on the Panther dApp’s interface.  Alice navigates to the left side of the UI and chooses the selling token and an amount based on her historical deposits (for example, zETH). She then chooses the receivable token (for example, zUSDC.  zSwap automatically calculates the exchange rate between the sellable and receivable asset (e.g. 1750 zUSDC per 1 zETH) according to real-time market data from DEXs.  zSwap will automatically display the best swapping route identified, as well as the details of the swap. Alice can choose to expand the list of DEX routing options to compare the costs of using a different DEX and select it if she decides to do so.  After Alice finds a preferred option among all the DEX options available, she executes the transaction by pressing the Swap button.  Once her transaction successfully goes through, the newly deposited asset (in our example, USDC) is delivered to Alice as a zUSDC. Alice also gets rewarded for conducting a transaction on zSwap through Privacy Reward Points (PRPs), which reward users for increasing the anonymity rate of the Panther ecosystem. Should there be an issue that causes the transaction to fail at any step of the way, Alice’s asset balance would remain unchanged.   About Panther <p>Panther is a chain-agnostic privacy layer that allows users to access DeFi privately and compliantly, maintaining control of their transactional and historical data. Its users can execute transactions and deploy assets across DeFi. Panther’s <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/cryptographic-primitives">zero-knowledge primitives</a> are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p>Users access Panther’s privacy by depositing assets from different chains into <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/multi-asset-shielded-pools">Multi-Assed Shielded Pools</a> (MASPs or simply <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools">Shielded Pools</a>). Shielded Pools exist in different chains, interconnected by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/zbridges">zBridges</a>. Using <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors">DeFi Adaptors</a>, users can also deploy their assets into DeFi dApps/Protocols, or they can transact with and swap them privately within MASPs.Since Panther’s privacy is enabled by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/cryptographic-primitives">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, users can disclose any part or the whole of their transaction history to anyone at will. They can also choose to withdraw their assets from MASPs into stealth addresses. Panther also features <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/product-and-technological-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals">ZK- and non-ZK Reveals</a>.</p>

<p>We’re back with all new editions of this newsletter, beginning with our just-released 2023 <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/series/state-of-crypto/">State of Crypto</a>. </p> 1. Data &amp; pulse checks: On the State of Crypto 2023&nbsp; <p>Daren Matsuoka, Eddy Lazzarin, Robert Hackett and Stephanie Zinn</p><p>It’s easy for a casual observer to overlook rapid progress in the crypto industry, especially given the noise of media headlines and fleeting price movements. But our State of Crypto report 2023 tracks the data, indicators, and signals that matter — revealing a steady cycle of development, product launches, and ongoing innovation. And this year, we also introduced the State of Crypto Index, a tool to track the health of the crypto industry from a technological, rather than financial, perspective. </p><p>The index represents the weighted average monthly growth of 14 industry metrics — also displaying, in a single chart, the rate of “innovation” and “adoption” of web3 — that offers a more nuanced measure for the state of crypto.&nbsp; The tool is also interactive, so anyone can tweak the parameters to form their own data views.</p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/state-of-crypto-report-2023/">see this post for 7 takeaways &amp; 55+ slides</a><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/stateofcrypto/">&nbsp;</a></p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/stateofcrypto/">explore the interactive index &amp; indicators</a></p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/QYgslufMJ4s">watch this video for a slide walk-through &amp; live discussion</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/state-of-crypto-trends-data-index-2023">listen to this new episode</a></p>  <p>…share on <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1645778427402928129">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7051548230962073600/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x5b3f2f">Farcaster</a>.</p> 2. Latest trends: applying zero knowledge to machine learning; minting NFTs in ‘waves’ to better build community <p>Elena Burger; Scott Duke Kominers and 1337 Skulls Sers</p><p>In past editions, we’ve shared a lot about <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/zero-knowledge-canon/">zero knowledge</a>, foundational technologies that hold the keys to blockchain scalability, represent the future of privacy-preserving applications, and more. But zero-knowledge proofs can also be useful in providing checks-and-balances on machine learning models and AI. Recently, there have been notable efforts in putting larger and more complex models on-chain — leveraging the ability of zero-knowledge proofs to succinctly represent and verify programs. <br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/checks-and-balances-machine-learning-and-zero-knowledge-proofs/">read more<br></a><a href="https://twitter.com/VirtualElena/status/1643648433100836864">share</a></p><p>In an NFT project, the mint largely determines who the community is and how they (and the broader market) view the project going forward. Since brands and projects need a secure mechanism that draws participation from the people they initially want, we review a new minting strategy called a “wave mint”, in which members of different NFT communities are invited to mint in a series of waves gradually expanding outwards. The wave mint design leverages people’s on-chain data and reputation to select for holders who are well matched to a project’s culture and goals; drives attention and energy to the project; and avoids common problems with “free” mints, like <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/nft-sales-market-clearing-gas-wars-auction-mechanism-design-for-builders/">gas wars</a> and bots.<br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/a-new-nft-launch-strategy-the-wave-mint/">learn more</a>&nbsp; <br><a href="https://twitter.com/skominers/status/1644044669142069253">share</a>&nbsp;</p> 3.

<p>Another major milestone in the Ethereum ecosystem was achieved yesterday with the Shanghai upgrade, or <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/03/08/goerli-shapella-announcement">Shapella</a>. This upgrade allows validators to withdraw ETH that have been staked (and the rewards earned from staking) from as far back as December 2020 — over $26 billion worth of ETH is potentially becoming&nbsp;liquid.</p><p>Now, the ideal outcome of such an event would be that some of this liquidity would go towards boosting decentralisation by encouraging more people to operate and stake on validators in underrepresented areas. At present, the vast majority of validators are run on AWS and in <a href="https://ethernodes.org/countries">US and&nbsp;Europe</a>.</p><p>Decentralisation is one of the core principles of Web3 and for good reasons: it can ensure censorship resistance and reliability of service globally. But decentralisation is not feasible unless we realise another core principle in Web3, namely privacy. Decentralised infrastructures require a high intensity of coordination between actors. If this takes place in open networks or through trusted third parties, this exposes the infrastructure — and importantly, those who run it — to a range of&nbsp;attacks.</p> Why Ethereum isn’t privacy-preserving <p>The Ethereum ecosystem achieved a monumental transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus algorithms last year. But with the move to POS, new privacy issues became evident and the very core of the blockchain, covered in an earlier <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/congratulations-on-the-merge-now-to-cure-the-hangover-with-a-strong-dose-of-privacy-c4b0c8eb46ea">blogpost</a>.</p><p>In summary, with the move to POS, validators need to coordinate on who creates the next block in the blockchain, which means more traffic between validators. This traffic can be analysed, compromising validator privacy opening the infrastructure up to attacks, from MEV Bots and DDoS attacks to targeted censorship. At this year’s ETHDenver, <a href="https://medium.com/nymtech/ethereum-was-never-designed-with-privacy-in-mind-d45039e5c692">privacy-focused discussions were at the forefront and on the main stage</a>, which signifies that the community strongly recognises the importance of privacy in the ecosystem.</p><p>In February 2023, <a href="https://decrypt.co/119370/ethereum-validators-hit-500000-ahead-scheduled-shanghai-upgrade">Ethereum hit the milestone of 500K validators</a>. This means that the consequences of the lack of validator privacy is only growing. In addition, <a href="https://metamask.io/news/latest/meta-mask-introduces-liquid-staking-in-dapp-for-an-easy-and-convenient-way-to-stake-eth/">Metamask recently launched a new staking functionality</a>, allowing users to stake their ETH using liquid staking protocols. If this leads to more people staking as well as more people running validators, it will exacerbate the privacy issues. And staking and operating from home for instance, could even entail people leaking their home IP addresses. Essentially, this is the same as someone finding out where you live, uncovering your salary slip, and then attaching it to your front door for all to&nbsp;see.</p> Deep privacy integrations for networked public&nbsp;goods <p>The good news is that as an industry we are making huge progress both when it comes to decentralisation and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The industry relies on a set of core public good technologies, and <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> is one of them. The Libp2p module has been nothing less than groundbreaking for decentralised networking. Developed by <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol labs</a>, it is a modular peer-to-peer networking framework that can run on across different network protocols. And this p2p networking framework is used in major blockchain ecosystems from IPFS, to Ethereum and Polkadot.</p><p>This is a huge win for decentralisation, but what about privacy? Libp2p is encrypted which is great, however, the patterns of communication running through the network remain exposed. And this can be almost more revealing than the content itself. This is where a mixnet such as the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym mixnet</a> comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>Nym <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-and-chainsafe-bring-enhanced-privacy-to-over-half-a-million-ethereum-validators-9792cbdedebd">recently partnered</a> with leading blockchain R&amp;D firm <a href="https://chainsafe.io/">Chainsafe</a> to build a <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/rust-libp2p-nym">Nym Libp2p module</a> for the Rust implementation of Libp2p. Clients and networking libraries such as Lighthouse (maintained by Chainsafe) can privacy-enhance traffic by sending it through the mixnet, shielding information that could doxx them from prying machine learning scraping. Solving the privacy problem at the core of major Web3 public goods can have a major impact across several ecosystems and more specifically, resolve the privacy issues for Ethereum validators, preventing the leaking of their IP addresses and metadata.</p><p>All new Ethereum validators should include this Nym integration module as part of their standard “starter&nbsp;pack”!</p> Privacy is your&nbsp;right <p>Everyone has their own reasons for wanting privacy. At the very least, leaking your home address on a blockchain is scary! And allowing people to see your personal ETH balance is unnecessary and making yourself vulnerable to attacks is dangerous.</p><p>A fully decentralised network needs network layer privacy for it to provide the benefits that are envisioned as part of the core principles of Web3. The industry is making progress when it comes to decentralisation and privacy, it is now time to put it into&nbsp;action.</p><p>Links</p>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/">Download Nym&nbsp;wallet</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/nodes/setup-guides.html">Run a mix&nbsp;node</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">Nym staking</a>  <p>Resources</p>  <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Mixnet explorer</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/">Nym docs</a>  <p>Languages</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@M.Quin/nym-libp2p-ethereumun-gizlilik-krizi-kamu-mallar%C4%B1yla-nas%C4%B1l-%C3%A7%C3%B6z%C3%BCl%C3%BCr-6bb2c777a8a2">Turkish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/nym-libp2p-comment-r%C3%A9soudre-la-crise-de-confidentialit%C3%A9-dethereum-avec-des-biens-publics-869f999804be">French</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/nym-libp2p-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%83-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-ethereum-%D1%81-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%89%D1%8C%D1%8E-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85-%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B3-5d939a0fb218">Russian</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-libp2p-how-to-solve-the-ethereum-privacy-crisis-with-public-goods-e2a4972bdf1c">Nym + Libp2p: how to solve the Ethereum privacy crisis with public goods</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have taken the world by storm in recent years. They have already shown to be usable for way more than their initial use cases in art. As a brand, you might be wondering if you should get in on the action and start using NFTs to represent and promote your products or services. Let’s take a look at why your brand should leverage NFTs and how various industries are already leveraging NFTs.</p>



 Why Your Brand Should Leverage NFTs 



<p>From shaking up the art world to tokenising real estate to improving customer loyalty programs. NFTs are widely usable, but most use cases rely on the general benefits of using NFTs. Here are a few reasons why your brand should leverage NFTs:</p>



 
 NFTs provide ownership and authenticity 



 NFTs can drive engagement and loyalty 



 NFTs can increase brand visibility and reach 



 NFTs can generate new revenue streams 
 



 Providing ownership and authenticity 



<p>One of the biggest benefits of NFTs is that they provide a unique, verifiable way for consumers to own and collect digital items. With an NFT, you can prove ownership and authenticity of a digital asset. Regardless of whether it is a piece of art, a virtual collectible, or even a digital product or service. This can be especially appealing to collectors and fans who value the exclusivity and rarity of certain items.</p>



<p>And with recent advances in technology, the thin line between the digital and physical world is also getting increasingly thinner. With <a href="https://beincrypto.com/top-luxury-fashion-brands-double-down-nfts-despite-2022-crypto-fallout/">luxury brands already using NFTs to combat counterfeit products and create digital </a>twins of physical products and liquor producers using <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2022/12/01/nfts-debut-with-interactive-gin-whiskey-and-fine-wine-projects-revolutionizing-the-spirits-industry/?sh=31c7553f7160">NFTs to guarantee the provenance of their products.</a></p>



 Driving engagement and loyalty 



<p>By using NFTs, you can create a sense of exclusivity and community among your most devoted fans and customers. For example, you could offer limited edition NFTs that are only available to a select group of loyal customers or fans. This can help drive engagement and loyalty. People will feel more invested in your brand if they have a unique and exclusive item that represents it.</p>



 Increasing brand visibility and reach 



<p>Using NFTs can also be a great way to increase the visibility and reach of your brand. By creating and promoting NFTs that are related to your products or services, you can tap into the growing community of NFT collectors and enthusiasts and expose your brand to a new audience.</p>



 Generating new revenue streams 



<p>NFTs can also be a useful way to generate new revenue streams for your brand. By selling NFTs related to your products or services, you can create a new avenue for revenue. This can be especially appealing in the digital world, where traditional ownership models can be more challenging.</p>



 The Risks and Pitfalls of Using NFTs 



<p>While everything seems to be in favour of the usage of NFTs, as with everything, there are also some risks and pitfalls that should be considered when using NFTs. The two foremost risks and pitfalls of using NFTs are fraudulent NFTs and the high volatility of NFT values.</p>



 Fraudulent NFTs 



<p>One risk of using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is the potential for fraud or misrepresentation. Since NFTs are often used to represent unique or rare items, it is possible for unscrupulous individuals to create fake or altered NFTs and sell them as genuine. This can result in significant financial losses for buyers who believe they are purchasing a valuable or authentic item.</p>



 High volatility of NFT values 



<p>Another potential pitfall of using NFTs is the volatility of their value. The value of NFTs can fluctuate significantly over time.  The indicated can depend on a variety of factors. Such include market demand, the perceived value of the underlying item, and the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. This means that the value of an NFT may increase or decrease significantly in a short period of time, leading to potential financial losses for holders.</p>



<p>Depending on how your brand uses NFTs, these risks/pitfalls do not have to be significant, though. A platform on which your NFTs could be bought/sold/attained could automatically filter out fake NFTs already, for example. Or if the value of your NFTs is tied to a certain physical asset or service, the value of the corresponding NFT tends to be less volatile. Nevertheless, it is good to be mindful of these risks and pitfalls.</p>



 NFTs in the ‘Real World’ 



<p>Before concluding the article, let’s take a look at some examples of how NFTs are being used in various industries. Examples are the hospitality industry, gaming industry, and politics!</p>



 NFTs in the hospitality industry 



<p>A loyalty program uses NFTs as a way to reward and engage customers. For example, a business could create an NFT that represents a certain level of loyalty, and offer it to customers who reach that level. Customers could then redeem the NFT for rewards, such as discounts, exclusive products, or early access to events. NFTs can also be used as a way to create a sense of community or exclusivity among customers, as they may be able to purchase and trade NFTs with each other.</p>







<p>Customers can also use NFTs as a way to offer unique experiences or rewards. For example, a hotel chain could create an NFT that represents an exclusive VIP package, which includes perks such as private check-in, room upgrades, and access to a special lounge. Customers could purchase the NFT and redeem it for the VIP package during their stay. NFTs could also be used to represent unique experiences. Namely, a private dinner with the chef or a guided tour of the city, which could be bought and sold by travellers. In this way, NFTs can provide a way for hotels and other hospitality businesses to offer highly coveted, one-of-a-kind experiences to customers.</p>



<p>For more information about NFTs in the hospitality industry read our article <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-hotels-customer-loyalty/">here!</a></p>



 NFTs for gaming 



<p>NFTs might be used in a variety of ways within the gaming industry. They can be used to represent in-game items or currency, such as weapons or armour, which can be bought and sold within a game. NFTs are brought into play to grant access to exclusive content, such as special levels or events. Additionally, game developers can use NFTs to create a sense of scarcity around certain in-game items, making them more valuable and sought-after by players.</p>



<p>Additionally, the creation of metaverses could prove to be another new realm of gaming. NFTs can really thrive by providing an easy way to own and trade items/property within the metaverse.</p>



 NFTs for politics 



<p>In the political realm, NFTs can be put to use as a tool for fundraising or campaigning. For example, a political candidate could create an NFT that represents a specific policy stance or campaign promise, and sell it to supporters as a way to fund their campaign. NFTs could also be used to represent digital collectibles related to political events or figures. These could be bought and sold by collectors. Additionally, NFTs could be used as a way to engage supporters and create a sense of community, as supporters could trade and collect NFTs related to the campaign or candidate. More information can be found <a href="https://zaisan.io/nfts-politics/">here.</a></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, NFTs can be a powerful tool for brands looking to increase ownership, authenticity, engagement, reach, and revenue in the digital world. If you’re considering using NFTs as part of your marketing strategy, it’s worth exploring the possibilities and seeing how they might fit into your overall branding and business goals.</p>

<p>San Francisco (USA), April 11th, 2023 – <a href="http://www.xrsi.org">XR Safety Initiative(XRSI)</a>, a 501(c)(3) global non-profit <a href="https://www.standardsportal.org/usa_en/sdo/xrsi.aspx">Standards Developing Organization (SDO)</a> promoting privacy, safety, security, and ethics in immersive and emerging technologies, is pleased to provide an update on its ongoing partnership with The Metaverse Standards Forum. Since joining as a Principal Member last year, XRSI has been working diligently to support the development of interoperability standards while providing privacy, safety, security, and ethics oversight for an open Metaverse.</p>



<p>XRSI’s founder and CEO, Kavya Pearlman, serves as the co-chair for the Forum’s Privacy, Cybersecurity &amp; Identity Exploratory Group, bringing her subject matter expertise and representing XRSI alongside Dr Louis Rosenberg, Chief Scientist at Responsible Metaverse Alliance and XRSI Global Technology Adviser. Their leadership in the group reinforces the need for strong privacy and security measures in the rapidly evolving Metaverse landscape.</p>



<p><a href="https://metaverse-standards.org/">The Metaverse Standards Forum</a>, hosted by the Khronos Group, brings together leading standards organizations and companies for industry-wide cooperation on identifying interoperability standards essential to building the open metaverse. Principal Members include Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Adobe, Google, Unity, HTC, and the World Web Consortium.</p>



<p>The Forum focuses on pragmatic, action-based projects such as implementation prototyping, hackathons, plugfests, and open-source tooling to accelerate the testing and adoption of standards, while also developing consistent terminology and deployment guidelines. This approach enables the Forum to coordinate requirements and resources to foster the creation and evolution of standards within standards organizations working in relevant domains.</p>



<p>Neil Trevett, President of the Khronos Group and chair of Metaverse Standards Forum, expressed his enthusiasm for XRSI’s involvement, stating, “We are truly excited to have Kavya Pearlman and XRSI join and co-chair the Privacy, Cybersecurity &amp; Identity Exploratory Group. Their expertise and commitment to privacy and security will be invaluable in shaping the future of the Metaverse. It’s an honor to work alongside such dedicated and knowledgeable professionals who are passionate about creating a safe and inclusive digital environment for everyone.“</p>



<p>Ensuring safety, privacy, and trust is vital for the successful digital transformation journey of governments, organizations, and individuals alike. In line with its mission, XRSI has recently published a standard definition of the Metaverse to provide a comprehensive understanding and foster collaborative efforts. According to XRSI, the Metaverse is “a network of interconnected virtual worlds with the following key characteristics: Presence, Persistence, Immersion, and Interoperability.” The full definition can be found here: <a href="https://xrsi.org/definition/the-metaverse">https://xrsi.org/definition/the-metaverse</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>XRSI calls on all key stakeholders, including privacy professionals, cybersecurity experts, security organizations, policymakers, technologists, and researchers, to join the Forum and the Privacy, Cybersecurity &amp; Identity (PCI) group to contribute to the development of robust standards for the Metaverse. Open standards enable consistency across multiple Metaverse implementations, and XRSI will contribute its knowledge to the overall Metaverse standards being worked on by The Metaverse Standards Forum and its members.</p>



<p>Let’s join forces to shape the next iteration of the internet. The future of the Metaverse needs every stakeholder to play their part, ensuring a safe, secure, and inclusive digital environment for all. By collaborating and sharing our collective expertise, we can pave the way for a Metaverse that not only revolutionizes the way we interact and connect but also upholds the highest standards of privacy, security, and ethics. Together, we can build a Metaverse that respects user rights, fosters innovation, and creates opportunities for everyone, regardless of their background or location. Join XRSI, the Metaverse Standards Forum, and other forward-thinking organizations in this mission to make the Metaverse a better, safer, and more inclusive space for generations to come.</p>
