<p>It is <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">that time again folks</a>! The mixnet token economic parameters are being updated to take into account the recent&nbsp;vest.</p><p>The vest means there are now more NYM tokens in circulation, thereby increasing the total available staking supply. This requires a new target staking supply and, of particular interest to stakers and mix node operators, this means the stake saturation point increases to 929k&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Here is a quick overview:</p> New parameters   Circulating supply: 394 million&nbsp;NYM  Locked token that can be staked: 52 million&nbsp;NYM  Max staking supply: 446 million&nbsp;NYM  Target staking supply: 223&nbsp;million  Mix node stake saturation point: 929k&nbsp;NYM  <p>For those wondering what lies behind these numbers and why the parameters change, here is a little&nbsp;recap…</p> Why do Nym token economic parameters change? <p>With every new vest, a tranche of tokens are released and become part of the circulating supply. This means the tokens that are available to be staked on mix nodes increase, changing the token economic parameters.</p><p>With the latest vest, the total circulating supply has increased to 394million and the locked tokens that are available to be staked are 52million. This gives a total of 446million that in theory could be&nbsp;staked.</p><p>Taking into account current levels of staking, we set the target to 50% of the available staking supply of 446 million NYM, leading to a current target staking supply of 223million. The target staking supply determines the mix node stake saturation point.</p><p>Mix nodes have a stake saturation point, which is the amount of stake that maximises the node’s rewards. This parameter is found by dividing the target staking supply by the number of rewarded nodes per epoch (currently 240&nbsp;nodes).</p><p>With these new parameters, the APY of well-performing nodes with high levels of staking is slightly above&nbsp;20%.</p><p>The next update to this parameter will take place in June after the next quarterly vest.</p><p>Join the Nym community of stakers and mix node operators</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> // <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //&nbsp;<a href="http://@nymproject">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-economics-quarterly-parameter-update-e85b6c929b37">Nym token economics: quarterly parameter update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, data storage is a crucial component for all applications, regardless of their scope or complexity. While traditional Web2 offers a wealth of storage options tailored to various use cases, such as SQL, NoSQL, Filestorage, S3, and FTP, the transition to Web3 demands a similar expansion of storage infrastructure to accommodate its unique requirements.</p><p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> has emerged as the de-facto standard for storing data in Web3, with its decentralized file storage protocol being ideal for images, videos, and static content. However, IPFS was never designed to handle personal data, and thus, a more suitable solution is necessary.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/data-storage">Verida DbStore</a>, the first “self-sovereign” database infrastructure for Web3, which promises to revolutionize how data is managed by offering users guaranteed ownership, the speed and performance of traditional databases, and the ability to permanently delete their data. As a new decentralized infrastructure and architecture, Verida DbStore is specifically designed for rapid access to highly changing, structured personal data with encryption as a fundamental aspect of the protocol.</p><p>Let’s delve into the intricacies of IPFS and Verida DbStore, comparing their architecture, security, performance, storage types, and suitability for handling personally identifiable information (PII).</p>At a glance: IPFS vs Verida&nbsp;DbStore Architecture <p>IPFS consists of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of block storage nodes, where each node is responsible for data identified by its unique hash. Users can retrieve data from any node, which collaborates with other nodes to locate and return the requested information.</p>IPFS consists of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of block storage&nbsp;nodes<p>On the other hand, Verida is a P2P network of database storage nodes, each responsible for a user-specific queryable database. Data on the network is identified by the owner and database name. To retrieve data, users look up the database storage nodes associated with a user and request the data from one or more nodes. Data is replicated across multiple nodes based on geographical and user preferences.</p>With Verida, a user can use their private key to sign, encrypt and access their&nbsp;data Type of&nbsp;storage <p>IPFS stores unstructured blobs of data such as images, videos or&nbsp;PDFs.</p><p>Verida stores structured data in a document database that can be queried, indexed and replicated.</p> Security <p>IPFS lacks native authentication or encryption, making all stored data publicly accessible without permissions or security restrictions, akin to a globally distributed hard drive with universal read&nbsp;access.</p><p>In contrast, Verida incorporates end-to-end encryption as a fundamental aspect of its protocol. All data requires authorization for access and a decryption key, ensuring security on par with traditional database infrastructure. Verida also offers flexible permission configuration for each user database, allowing control over read, write, update, and delete permissions.</p> Performance <p>IPFS, inspired by torrenting technology, uses distributed hash tables to find content across nodes. While this allows for fast read responses when data is cached locally, it leads to significant latency in discovering new data, resulting in unpredictable and slow response times. This latency issue makes IPFS unsuitable for dynamically changing data without additional protocols.</p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ipfs-measurements/">Real world data from Cloudflare showing an average response time of 44.4 seconds for newly created content on&nbsp;IPFS.</a><p>In contrast, Verida is designed for sub-second reads and writes. Although there’s some initial overhead in discovering a user’s database, once connected, data transfer occurs via a P2P socket connection. This makes Verida ideal for applications requiring “web2-like” performance, where interactions are primarily “app-to-user” or “user-to-user.”</p> Suitable for&nbsp;PII <p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes sensitive data like health records, names, addresses, and financial records that are legally protected in most countries. Regulations dictate the storage, transfer, and user rights concerning PII.</p><p>IPFS, a globally decentralized network, is unsuitable for storing PII because it offers no control over data storage or replication, nor guarantees data deletion, which is necessary for compliance with the “right to be forgotten” in many jurisdictions.</p><p>Verida DbStore, also a globally decentralized network, allows users to control where their data is stored. By default, the <a href="https://www.verida.io/">Verida Wallet </a>selects <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/infrastructure/storage-node">storage nodes</a> in the user’s country or region, ensuring regulatory compliance. Users can change these nodes or host their own for greater self-sovereignty. They can also delete their data from storage nodes, delete their identity and data entirely, and exercise their “right to be forgotten.” Verida combines the advantages of decentralization with regulatory compliance.</p>The <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk">Verida Client SDK</a> is designed to empower user’s to control where their data is&nbsp;stored. IPFS as a base&nbsp;layer <p>Numerous projects are developing decentralized database infrastructure for Web3 using IPFS, including Textile, Ceramic, and Web5. At first glance, this approach may appear logical, as IPFS serves as the filesystem for Web3 and could potentially be transformed into a queryable database. However, this strategy proves to be impractical.</p><p>This approach is similar to constructing a permissioned, encrypted MySQL on a public S3 bucket. This would be slow and vulnerable to security threats, making it an undesirable option. While some projects incorporate an encryption layer over IPFS, the eventual breaking of current encryption would leave the data exposed, as it is both public and permanently accessible. In contrast, Verida safeguards encrypted data through authentication and authorization layers, adhering to industry best practices for protecting sensitive information.</p><p>To address these issues, some projects introduce additional server-side infrastructure on top of IPFS, forming new “storage networks.” However, if extra infrastructure is necessary, it would be more efficient to build on a foundation designed as a database from the outset, rather than relying on an ill-suited base technology like&nbsp;IPFS.</p><p>It is essential to note that IPFS is suitable for various use cases, such as storing immutable public records, NFT images or videos, or whitepaper PDFs. However, it is not an ideal choice for personal data storage, which necessitates a more fitting alternative.</p> Verida’s approach <p>At Verida, we’ve adopted a groundbreaking approach by creating nodes that are not based on IPFS, but rather on well-established database technology that supports authorization, permissions, and decentralized identity standards. This innovative strategy combines the best of both worlds: the reliability of battle-tested, industry-leading database technology and seamless integration with emerging decentralized identity standards through our provided <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk">SDKs</a> and server components.</p><p>In a world where users can own their personal data, it’s critical to provide a mechanism to share encrypted data with third parties. The Verida protocol leverages encrypted data replication which is facilitated by peer-to-peer database synchronization at the protocol&nbsp;level.</p><p>This standards based architecture allows for the addition of various storage engines, making Verida DbStore the first of many decentralized storage solutions expected to emerge over the next decade.

<p></p><p>Communities play an important role in any blockchain and crypto projects. Community members became project ambassadors and were the first to spread the word about these new revolutionary technologies. In this article, see how Horizen leverages its community thanks to its ambassador program.</p>



 Blockchain and crypto projects rely on their communities.&nbsp; 



<p>It is due to the precursory character of these technologies. They are too avant-garde for the mainstream media and too complicated for the general public. It took communities to be able to take an interest in emerging projects and to promote them more widely.</p>



<p>Take bitcoin, for example. One of its strengths is drawn from its original community, the cypherpunks. These are the best cryptographers in the world who helped the bitcoin technology emerge and have given it credit, as well as shedding light on revolutionary technology.</p>



 What is a (crypto) community? 



<p>Suppose we have a look at the definition of community. In that case, we find:</p>



 
 a unified body of individuals: such as the people with common interests living in a particular area 



 &nbsp;a group of people with a common characteristic or interest living together within a larger society 



 a body of persons of common and especially professional interests scattered through a larger society 
 



<p>(source: <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community</a>)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto communities were born with people with shared crypto and freedom interests, living on the internet. They are linked by a shared policy (e.g., decentralization, banking freedom, currency sovereignty) but are still part of a larger society. Everybody can join the ownership by owning cryptos! And that’s the beautiful thing about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we know that the emergence of crypto and blockchain technologies is due to their communities, how do we use this strength by being a blockchain project?</p>



<p>The answer is with Horizen and its Zenvangelists!</p>



 The Horizen Ambassador Program 



<p>The Zenvangelists are active members form the Horizen community who are dedicated to contributing to and growing with Horizen. </p>



<p>&nbsp;Zenvangelists are web3 believers from all walks of life who are passionate about Horizen. Anybody can become a Zenvangelist, as long as they are:</p>



 
 A part of the Horizen community. 



 Interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general 



 Always willing to help other members of the community 



 Eager to contribute to the growth of the Horizen community  



 Want to be committed to continuous learning and education 



 Be a self-starter (autonomous, self-taught, in short: passionate) 
 



<p>How do we empower our Zenvangelists?</p>



 
 We are always available for guidance and support 
 



 
 We hold monthly meetings where they can discuss community matters and share ideas with the Horizen team and leadership 



 Zenvangelists have exclusive early access to new Horizen product and service releases before the public 



 We help Zenvangelists grow their personal network and reach, improve their skill sets, and provide event opportunities to represent Horizen.   



 We reward Zenvangelists for their effort in many ways, including swagkit, ZEN rewards, free event participations etc. 
 



 Some are Legends! 



<p>They are OGs, community, and project backbones or have joined us recently but have shown exceptional activity: let me introduce you to the Legend Zenvangelists.</p>

				<a>
															Why Horizen?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;In short, I chose Horizen because of its strong community, its innovative vision, and its potential to make a real difference in the world.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;Mainly because of the privacy focus, constant development, and great potential. The innovating sidechains were giving new tools to developers, with $ZEN powering the future of DeFi, Play2Earn games, DApps, Web3, and NFT projects</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;What first garnered my interest in crypto, as many like to joke about being “in it for the tech” was truly my growing interest in GPU mining. I’d tried to mine Ethereum at the time and had been failing with graphics drivers and related issues, so I found that ZEC was comparably profitable at the time and was easy to set up and get going.</p>
<p>When I found that Horizen would have the same algorithm and supply of coins, I saw opportunity at being an early supporter. The passion of the team at an early stage and to this day has always been something that stands out to me.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;Horizen looked like a big project and has since grown even bigger. There are 3 companies, a doxxed team, a news website, a blog, the academy, an open GitHub, the Horizen Early Adopter’s Program, and the HDE (Horizen Developer Environment). There are tools for the community: Discord, Twitter accounts, and Telegram channels … It even has a meme coin^^</p>
<p>There was a lot of work to build the Zendoo protocol, and since it was released, a new era has started, with Tokenmint and EON. I hope many sidechains will be added to the ecosystem in the coming months/years.</p>
<p>Paragism:&nbsp;The strong ethos of privacy attracted me initially. I also found Horizen very dedicated to bringing new innovations with its research-driven culture and strives to push technological boundaries. This blockchain project keeps delivering back-to-back developments with continuous R&amp;D regarding various vital parameters to achieve high scalability and extendibility.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;The project has a clear vision, excellent leadership, a capable team, unique technology, and major industry partners. Horizen ticks all the boxes, and with Horizen EON launching, we will soon see Horizen carve out its market fit.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;At the end of 2017, while preparing for my own business, I wanted to learn more about the blockchain area. At that time, I found the ZenCash homepage and sent a direct email to send a proposal saying that I would like to work while learning.</p>
<p>We also asked for consent by presenting an article on zencash’s forum, which is now unused.</p>
<p>At the same time, I conducted various communication, such as sharing many conversations and Korean market research.</p>
<p>Based on that, I joined the current Horizen, and I strongly agree with the direction we are heading now, the role as a platform, and the cultivation of an ecosystem that focuses on practically necessary privacy such as Data-Privacy.</p>
<p>I first announced the launch of Horizen Korea at ZenCon0, and since then I have made preliminary contact with many partners for Horizen Korea in Korea.</p>
<p>Now that we are almost ready to announce the business outline and official launch, we will soon be able to meet Horizen Korea, which is taking on various challenges as much as the Korean community members expect of Horizen.</p>
<p>Guan:&nbsp;Because the project has a sustainable funding model and cool graphic designs. Horizen is an inclusive ecosystem where everyone is rewarded for their contributions.</p>

															For how long have you been in the Horizen community? Share your journey in crypto communities?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;I’ve been actively involved in the crypto ecosystem since 2019, and I’ve been passionate about the potential of blockchain technology to transform the way we live and work. Since then, I’ve been exploring different projects and communities in the space, and I was excited to join the Horizen team in late 2021.</p>
<p>As someone who has always been interested in the intersection of technology and finance, I was drawn to Horizen’s vision of a decentralized, privacy-focused ecosystem that empowers individuals to control their assets and data. I’ve been impressed by the team’s commitment to innovation and dedication to building a community-driven platform that can make a difference in people’s lives.</p>
<p>As a tracker of daily task submissions, I’ve had the opportunity to engage with Horizen users daily and see firsthand their enthusiasm and passion for the project. I’m honored to be part of such a vibrant and dynamic community, and I’m excited to see what the future holds for Horizen and the wider crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;I joined the Zenvangelists in May 2021. I was expanding my reach into the Cryptoverse and was happy I could join the community. I was enhancing my blockchain knowledge, and Horizen was one of the chains that impressed me.</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;I’ve been involved with Horizen since early 2017 very near the launch of the project when I first heard about it being supported on the first ever exchange for Horizen, Bittrex, which happened to be the first alt-coin exchange I had used in my crypto journey.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;I don’t remember when I first heard about Bitcoin, but at the time, I thought it was cooler to search for Alien life running SETI or help research with Folding@home than to mine cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>I saw all this crash in 2018 and thought the ecosystem had turned to silly speculation.</p>
<p>But, after a while, during the bear market, I started looking into the ecosystem again and saw great people building interesting projects. I bought some cryptos and read a lot of whitepapers.</p>
<p>I started a website. The first tutorials I wrote were about Bitgreen and Zelcash (now Flux) configuration.</p>
<p>In 2020, I started looking into masternodes and Horizen was one of my first ones. A Secure Node was cheap, and the APY was very good before the halving.</p>
<p>I started to dig deeper into Horizen with the public release of Zendoo on the testnet, tested it on a VPS, completed some HDE tasks, and therefore wrote some articles.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;Horizen was one of the first coins I bought when I started my crypto journey in 2017. I wasn’t active in the community then, but I used to lurk on Telegram. I was always impressed by how accessible the team was, and Rob was always in the chat, answering questions and engaging with the community.&nbsp; His passion was infectious. During the 2018/19 bear market, I became more involved in the community. I tried to help where I could, such as live streaming the weekly team meetings, amplifying Horizen news through HorizenClips, and doing some end-of-year and zendoo launch community Livestream events.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;I learned about Bitcoin from the end of 2015 and started mining with my computer at home. I didn’t get as much volume as the current Bitcoin whales, but I started to pay more attention to the technology called blockchain rather than profit.</p>
<p>Technically, it came out earlier, but the technology that was almost dead came back to the world through an example of Bitcoin, and since then, as new technologies such as Ethereum’s smart contracts have been introduced, the blockchain industry has begun to draw attention.</p>
<p>These days, diversity that can be utilized within the blockchain industry, such as NFT, is possible, but in the past, there were many people who took a business approach with a conceptual nature as a simple payment method. In it, I was obsessed with the thought of whether it would be right for someone to look into my wallet address, even though it is a wallet address made up of addresses that are very long and difficult for people to memorize.</p>
<p>From this point of view, even in terms of a simple payment method, we can see the importance of privacy.</p>

															Do you have something to say to those who want to join the Zenvangelist program or any crypto community?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor:&nbsp;For those interested in joining the Zenvangelist program or any other crypto community, I would say: go for it! Being part of a community is a great way to learn, grow, and contribute to a larger cause. It’s an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals, share your knowledge and experience, and make a difference.</p>
<p>My advice would be to start by getting involved in the community in whatever way feels most comfortable to you. This could mean joining a Discord group, participating in social media discussions, attending meetups or events, or contributing to open-source projects. Whatever you choose, be sure to stay engaged, be respectful, and be open-minded. Everyone in the community is there to learn and grow; working together can achieve great things.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t be afraid to take on leadership roles and responsibilities within the community. Whether becoming a Zenvangelist, organizing an event, or contributing to a project, stepping up and taking action is the best way to make a real impact and show dedication to the cause. So, if you’re passionate about crypto and blockchain, I encourage you to get involved and join a community today.</p>
<p>PVM:&nbsp;The Zenvangelist Program, like the majority of crypto communities, empowers the users. You bring your skills, work with others, and learn. Being part of a strong, vibrant, and fun community will bring more knowledge than many courses.</p>
<p>DeFi:&nbsp;For any community members whether new or old my greatest advice to give would be to never underestimate the impact you may have on the communities and projects you are involved in, and in many cases opportunities will arise and those passionate community members certainly stand out of the crowd (and if not make sure you let yourself be heard in a constructive manner) a little effort goes a long way when we all work together to build something greater than one team or project can build alone.</p>
<p>Paragism:&nbsp;Horizen community is rich in resources. It will enable you to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual growth of the ecosystem. The sense of togetherness is profound and enjoyable here.</p>
<p>Xavier:&nbsp;Joining a crypto community is still the best way to learn about the ecosystem and a project.</p>
<p>The more you speak with people, meet others, and share what you know, the more your knowledge and comprehension grow. That’s a win-win. You become better and help others understand our ecosystem.</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp;I say jump in! The Zenvangelist program is great because you can tailor it to suit your own unique talents! It is also a great way for you to get to know the team and community better, and it can help open lots of doors if you are pursuing a career in crypto.</p>
<p>Jonghun:&nbsp;Sure! In the Korean community, there are many valuable members who play many roles. For example, AstarZen is directly producing PFP NFTs for node operators in our Korean community. Needless to say, Ken is also the spiritual pillar of our Korean community.</p>
<p>Guan:&nbsp;We are an honest and lovely community with many interesting and smart people! Come on and join us, You won’t regret it!</p>

															How does it feel to be named Legend Zenvangelist?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>Mahnoor: Being recognized as a Legend Zenvangelist within the Horizen community is amazing. Being acknowledged for my contributions and dedication is an honor.</p>
<p>I believe it helps promote the project, impart my wisdom and experience, and assist in adopting and engaging new users.</p>
<p>However, having the title of Legend Zenvangelist carries more obligations than just a title. It entails continuing to be involved and active in the community, sharing my knowledge and suggestions, and assisting in determining the project’s direction. It entails setting an example for others and motivating them to get involved and change the world.</p>
<p>Overall, being recognized as a Legend Zenvangelist is humbling, and it inspires me to keep putting in the effort and helping the Horizen community. I’m happy to be a part of this thriving ecosystem and eager to see what we can accomplish together.</p>
<p>PVM: I feel proud to be named a Legend Zenvangelist but still humble. It’s a title that makes me feel appreciated and the reason to keep working as hard as I did until now. Now I have to lead by example and maintain high standards</p>
<p>DeFi: It’s an honor to be recognized as Legend Zenvagelist, and my pleasure to see where the Horizen Ecosystem has come from, to where it is now, and being a part of where it is going. I truly believe the greater market is largely unaware of the constant building going on throughout the years and could be near the precipice of true recognition as a DeFi, Smart Contract platform – being secured by the largest node network and hybrid Proof of Work network structure under the hood.</p>
<p>Paragism: It is a matter of pride. Horizen community has empowered me to bring positive changes. I am grateful that my involvement and work have been recognised.</p>
<p>Xavier: That’s a funny bonus, but honestly, being called a legend wasn’t part of the plan when I joined the Zenvangeslists^^</p>
<p>Michael:&nbsp; I feel a little undeserving because I have been pretty quiet in the community lately as I have been busy launching a new business in Seoul. But Horizen is definitely my favourite project!</p>
<p>Jonghun: I am delighted to hear that I have been selected among the valued Zenvangelists for more diverse endeavors. I am happy that I will work harder in the future with Horizen Korea as my new starting point, but I accept it with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Guan: I feel so honored to be a Legend Zenvangelist, spreading Horizen is a significant thing in such a very early stage!&nbsp; I also meet a lot of super cool ZEN-frens from all over the world. It’s a fantastic journey in my life!</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Mahnoor, thank you so much for being here every day for the community. You were even here during your maternity leave to help the fellowship. Where do you find this constant energy to be present in the community?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I believe that the crypto and blockchain space has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about money, data, and identity, and I’m committed to doing my part to help bring about that change. Whether it’s through tracking daily task submissions, answering questions in Discord groups, or participating in social media discussions, I always try to be available and responsive to community members.</p>
<p>Of course, there are times when it can be challenging to balance community involvement with other responsibilities, such as family or work. But ultimately, I believe that being present for the community is an important part of my role, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute in any way I can.</p>
<p>Overall, my energy and enthusiasm for the Horizen community comes from my belief in its potential and my passion for the work that we’re doing. I’m honored to be a part of this dynamic and innovative ecosystem, and I look forward to continuing to contribute in any way I can.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: PVM, you are our event Zenvangelist and an excellent writer. So tell us, what is the best: hosting or participating in the party?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: Hosting parties and events is fun, and taking part is even better. My friends tell me to make “PVM Entertainment and Leisure” a real thing, as the events I create are always top of the crop!</p>
<p>This is what I love to do … to create events that suit every crypto user, from NFT lovers to Crypt edges. I constantly think about new party activities and themes and ways to reward the participants with memories and good vibes”</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: DeFi, you are the new Horizen community voice. You have great skills in hosting and green screen management. What came first, the desire to play with editing software or to talk about the Horizen project entertainingly?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: AI would say my desire in content, editing, and feeling though I have an above average understanding of many concepts that others may benefit from all to tie in together, but to answer which came first, it was the tinkering around while bringing some creativity to the mix – I’d been doing so since the Windows XP era on Windows Movie Maker… Although the quality and effort was poor at best, I always try to make incremental improvements over time (even if it means two steps forwards, one step back at times).</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Paragism, what is different in the Horizen community?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: The Horizen community gives a sense of belonging. All ideas are welcomed and we get to see plenty of expressions. The community members also get to learn new things and hone their skills.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Xavier, you are the always-willing-to-try-tech-things-guy among the Zenvangelists. You make great tutorials and create love, hug, and cakes in our tokenization platform and EVM. Where does this genuine willingness to share come from?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I love tech. I love to learn new technologies. I started coding at 7 and never stopped learning different flavors of basic (Turbo) pascal, c, c++, java, SQL, HTML, javascript, php, tcl, … and systems administration.</p>
<p>I’ve been sharing my knowledge since 98, I think. It was one of my end of studies projects to write a website generator in java (v1.0.2) and use it to generate a website. The website was called Alaide (that means“help needed” in French). It was a collection of tutorials about HTML 3.2, CGI programming, and java.</p>
<p>I then wrote articles for the French Linux magazine for several years, mainly about Linux development.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time browsing the apache forums and community websites like “léa Linux” or “le site du zéro.”</p>
<p>Nowadays, I work as a freelance sysadmin and developer and help my customers understand and face their tech problems. I’m still writing tutorials, helping people on Twitter and Discord, testing things, and helping people in their crypto journey.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Jonghun, you’re more than the Korean community backbone; you made it to the Horizen team! What made you stay at Horizen through the years?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: I have had various experiences within the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>I helped launch a global exchange in Korea and played the role of COO, and I am advising on various projects.</p>
<p>Unlike many projects, Horizen always develops by clarifying the vision set in the beginning, responding to the market, and knowing how to adapt.</p>
<p>From a currency with a simple privacy function, now as a platform, we are expanding the ecosystem for various projects. Of course, we are preparing to support the use of the Privacy function where it is actually needed, rather than abandoning it.</p>
<p>In the Korean community, not only me but Ken and so many people are moving together.</p>
<p>Maybe not just community members, but each of them speaks a lot about Horizen’s development direction in a really logical and passionate way.</p>
<p>There was also strong support from the community about removing the shield pool from the main chain this time. When voting on this, members of the Korean community debated day and night.</p>
<p>In addition to my vision for Horizen, Horizen, with such a passionate community, will keep everyone in the future.</p>					 
				
			 
	     
		     
			 
				<a>
															Q: Guan, You are an OG who did much for the Horizen community. What made you stay through the years?
				</a>
			 

			 

									 
						<p>A: The team always knows how to push things forward. the project’s core cross-chain protocol Zendoo solves scalability that can massively help many web2 businesses into web3.</p>

<p>Horizen inspired artwork from Zenvangelist <a href="https://twitter.com/S1DARTA0">Sidarta0</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>“I love the sleeping astronaut. A lot. But also <a href="https://sidarta.in/product/topsy-turvy-drawing/">Topsy Turvy</a>, one of the first artworks that got people from Horizen further interested in letting me have art on their products. I still have the original; it blows my mind that no one has ever bought it. I love the colors and the weird randomness. It was created in the flow. One of my favorites. Because I still remember the process. It was a fun piece to do. And also very hard to do again.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>Last but not least, special thanks to Psyrax, JC, our Legend Zenvangelist SupportMan, who is always available to assist the community with any node/mining-related questions. You’re the backbone of our Discord server, essential to the community. So, thank you!</p>

 Why release a transparency report? 



<p>Electric Coin Co. is committed to openness and transparency — as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital currency, and in support of our mission to empower people with economic freedom. This transparency report details company income, expenses, and use of funds during Q3 2022.</p>



<p>Key takeaways</p>



 
 Bootstrap received coins at a value below the ECC operating-expense level for Q3 2022. During this time, Bootstrap received coins at an average of $461,000 a month (at the Q3 average ZEC price, $60, for each of the three months’ distribution dates), and Bootstrap and ECC incurred average monthly expenses of approximately $766,000.&nbsp; 



 At the end of Q3 2022, Bootstrap and ECC collectively held approximately $3.0M in USD and approximately 116.9K ZEC.&nbsp; 



 As of March 16, 2023, the company held approximately $1.3M in USD and approximately 110K ZEC.&nbsp;

							<p>We could start this post by saying that our motivation to create a Zebra package for Arch Linux was that Arch enjoys the highest average rating of any Linux distribution on <a href="https://distrowatch.com/index.php?dataspan=score">DistroWatch</a>. However, the truth is that one of our engineers uses Arch (btw.), and he thought it would be handy to have Zebra packaged.</p><p>Packages in the official Arch repositories contain compiled binaries signed by their maintainers. The Arch developers maintain essential packages, and so-called trusted users maintain the rest. In addition to the official repositories, the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">Arch User Repository</a> (AUR) lets anyone from the Arch community share their own package. The difference is that AUR packages do not contain binaries but a script that pulls, builds, and installs the software for the user. Arch users are encouraged to inspect the script’s content before executing it.</p><p>Zebra is currently packaged in the AUR. The <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zebrad">package</a> prepares dependencies, pulls Zebra’s source code from GitHub, and builds and installs the same binary as the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/zfnd/zebra">Docker image</a>.</p><p>AUR users can vote for a package to increase its popularity, and trusted users can adopt popular packages and promote them to the official repositories. As the ArchWiki says, “a good number of new packages that enter the official repositories start in the AUR”. The original zcashd node already has an official package, and Zebra will hopefully follow. So if you are, by the way, using Arch, feel free to install the zebrad package and let us know how it went on our Discord, or on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/technology/zebra/46">Zcash Community Forums</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following is a correspondence from a teacher and father in the Czech Republic. I very much appreciated his observations, and he generously permitted me to share them with you all here in the hopes that it might help others.</p>
<p>March 23, 2023</p>
<p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>I have been following your research for a certain time now. I work as an elementary public school teacher, and there are some quite dramatic changes in the approach to students being implemented in our public school system. Nothing is official though. NGOs are starting to infiltrate the schools, such as the one I teach in. So far, this has taken the form of seminars for all teachers staff, where they stress student sovereignty, which is reasonable in essence. I have studied Montessori and Waldorf school methods and raise my own kids in such a way.</p>
<p>A method being pushed for about two years is called formative assessment. After taking the time to take a course on it and study it more thoroughly, I’ve found aspects of reductive scientific techno vision. Kids are given aims to fulfill along with some criteria they must meet at the end. When they finish working, they assess themselves according to the criteria and draw their conclusions about their own study. However, kids are unable to take their own studies into their own hands and be “responsible for it,” which is the underlying idea of formative assessment. It seems to me that it copies the fundamentals of machine learning, which they are trying to implement in our schools. I have tried it in many classes, and it is unrealistic, unnatural, time consuming, and unwanted by the kids.</p>
<p>Have you come across formative assessment in your country? Is it something they promote there also? Is this a method used to teach kids constantly sitting in front of panels and Ipads? I tried to find some studies supporting its success in teaching but found nothing. It is being promoted by the EU and our government all through our school system. As a teacher and a father I am concerned.</p>
<p>I also want to thank you for your research and the energy you are putting into informing people about these huge changes in our lives. Here, in my country, there is absolutely no information about the metaverse, blockchain, or AI whatsoever. Not even in blogs or social media.</p>
<p>I will be happy to hear from your opinion on this, should you find a minute. Keep up the good work!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greetings from the Czech Republic!</p>
<p>My reply:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Teacher Friend,</p>
<p>First, I think you are correct that it has everything to do with machine learning. The themes of “student-centered” education and “student voice and choice” have been central here for the past decade. While to the uninformed these ideas sound empowering, especially after so many years of drill and kill exercises for standardized testing that were intended to sap student and teacher creativity and curiosity. They know this. The program of “formative assessment” is in alignment with training a machine. It is goal oriented behavior. You can see numerous references to “formative assessment” in this <a href="https://www.oecd.org/czech/49479976.pdf">2012 OECD document for the Czech Republic</a> promoting competency based education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to better understand the evolution of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/?s=%22competency+based%22+">competency-based education</a> in the United States, here is a search of the term from my blog. I was introduced to these ideas by my friend Emily, a second grade teacher in Maine. She discontinued her blog a number of years ago, but some of the posts are available on the Wayback Machine – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214808/https://emilytalmage.com/2015/04/26/save-maine-schools/">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117100719/https://emilytalmage.com/2016/01/15/what-really-happened-in-alaska/">here</a>. We didn’t know anything about machine learning at the time, just the human capital finance part.</p>
<p>Competency Based Education, which is sometimes called Mastery or Proficiency-Based, is a set up for digital skills badges and “lifelong learning” on the blockchain ledger. Essentially, the “self-directed” model of education suits the need to treat humans as learning agents in complex simulations that will be used to forecast future global labor markets. It is important to understand that teachers are intended to be the vanguard in the adoption of these new technologies. Managing educators as “improve-able” digital human capital is also a planned global investment market. In the United States, they conditioned teachers first to accept behaviorist badges and digital micro-credentials as part of their “professional development,” so they would embrace the idea and promote the new paradigm to their students. I see that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq5BE-hoEKA">Erasmus</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/academy-for-sustainable-future-educators-edusta/">EduSTA</a> are <a href="https://projects.tuni.fi/edusta/">doing the same</a> in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>There is a reason Jeff Bezos, grandson of DARPA and Department of Energy big-wig <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35782841/lawrence-preston-gise-sr-death/">Lawrence Gise</a>, is investing in Montessori pre-k. I didn’t know about embodied AI and sensor networks when I wrote <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/09/15/montessori-inc-pre-k-predictive-profiling-for-power-and-profit/">this post</a>. Look up <a href="https://www.3blmedia.com/news/history-rsf-social-finance">RSF Social Finance</a>, the Rudolf Steiner Foundation, now based in Silicon Valley. It’s a social enterprise channeling considerable amounts of tech money. No surprise then that, at least in the US, Waldorf schools forced masking of children. We have to be mindful that even “alternative” types of learning styles like Montessori and Waldorf are being set up to <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-11-20-kid-tracking-sensors-may-not-be-the-wildest-thing-about-this-montessori-model">harvest data on children</a>. This will happen through artificial vision cameras, beacons, sensors, and wearable tech installed in learning environments. Such environments can be in non-traditional classrooms and even the outdoors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is most needed now is data to train artificial intelligence in social relations and human creativity and introspection. Formative assessments, when fed into a machine, allow the thinking process of the child to be made available for computation and analysis. This isn’t about one child or a classroom of children, but learning at scale – all of the children in the EU. It’s about the mental states of individuals and communities for the purposes of documentation and pattern recognition over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A challenging task is to embody artificial intelligence. When the AI comes into the material world it has to be able to navigate with a material “body” around complex obstacles and changing environments. Much of this research has been conducted as part of the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Embodied-AI-Robocup-Domestic-Robots.pdf">RoboCup</a> – robotic soccer team competitions. That project is being led by <a href="https://ai.sony/blog/blog-006/">Peter Stone</a> at UT Austin in Texas. Stone is also <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/">head of SONY AI North America</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this relates to choice and decision theory. Researchers use simulation modeling to train the AI before putting the technology into a robot. Within the digital simulation, the robots experience many failures moving through their test environment. Those failings affect their choices the next time around. Eventually, they “learn” to be more functional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it’s useful to see alternative “student directed” approaches to learning in this light. They will want children to be independent to the verge of social isolation to create the stress to force their decision making process – then log the self-reflection inquiry. This is “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2022.846693/full">goal oriented behavior</a>.” It is easier for the system to “learn” from disaggregated agents than a complex mass of humans collaborating, at least at this point. Some day, perhaps soon, the machines will be able to look at group dynamics with the same ease. It seems the Czech government has been very involved in the development of <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/customer-cases/czech-id">digital identity and e-government</a>. Social Finance has also been working with the European Social Catalyst Fund to <a href="https://socialfinance.org/insight/spotlight-social-finance-global-network/">investigate pay for success opportunities</a> in your country. Education and health are the two primary targets.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for reaching out. I hope you, and others, find this information helpful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Alison McDowell</p>

<p>Electric Coin Co. (ECC) has been working since June to resolve Zcash wallet performance issues that are affecting users of third-party apps Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable.* All three of these mobile wallets utilize the ECC SDK.</p>



<p>Our engineers have made progress, however, work remains —&nbsp;including further updates to zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet — to fully restore good user experience in the impacted apps.</p>



<p>Solving these issues is our No. 1 priority, even taking precedence over our long term roadmap. Internally, we are calling this “Emergency Mode.”&nbsp;</p>



 The syncing problem 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented some wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. (The current wallet sync process requires scanning the entire blockchain before funds are available to be spent.) If a wallet won’t sync, a user can’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>



 What we’ve done so far 



<p>Within weeks of identifying the problem, ECC released two updates to zcashd that resolved full node issues, and work was underway on the SDKs. In October, we released zcashd 5.3.0 to fix out-of-memory issues, but further public releases specifically relevant to these syncing issues were delayed, as ECC engineers were pulled off task to build zcashd 5.3.3 and 5.4.2 — critical updates that remediated vulnerabilities inherited from Bitcoin Core.</p>



<p>Here’s a summary of what we’ve done, so far, to address wallet performance issues:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Released zcashd 5.1.0 and 5.2.0 in July to address performance in full nodes 



 Released zcashd 5.3.0 to fix a number of intermittent out-of-memory issues 



 Completed most of the code updates and testing for zcashd 5.5.0, which implements fee changes. Note: users should have the ability to spend funds without a full wallet sync upon the release of zcashd 5.6.0. 



 Completed a portion of the back-end work required to support the next release of the iOS and Android SDKs, which will include the first phase of an improved sync capability. 
 



 Exiting Emergency Mode 



<p>Our top priority is ensuring users can access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, so we’re building updates that will allow users to receive and spend new incoming funds faster,** and we’re implementing features that provide visibility on syncing progress.</p>



<p>Only after these capabilities are delivered —&nbsp;and when we’re confident that wallets are not being impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior —&nbsp;will we consider exiting Emergency Mode and widening our focus to include other initiatives.</p>



<p>The table below represents an estimated release schedule to address the wallet syncing issues. Each release is slated for delivery within a half-month window to allow for dozens of inherent dependencies. Interim releases may occur based on specific requirements or dependencies throughout this process. Version numbers listed may also change based on emergency or other unplanned impacts.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that after these releases are made available, third-party developers may need a number of days or weeks to implement and test.</p>



DateReleaseDetailsFirst half of April 2023zcashd 5.5.0A transaction-fee structure change based on overall size (inputs/outputs) and frequency of transactions (ZIP-317) will make attempts to spam or flood the network with txs much more expensive and unlikely. Mobile wallet users sending regular single recipient transactions will not be affected by this change.<br><br>Fund availability improvement will provide the ability to spend funds before a wallet is fully synchronized.&nbsp;<br><br>While this release will have no immediate positive effect on the wallet user experience, this is a necessary step toward exiting emergency mode.Second half of April 2023lightwalletd 0.5Partners currently running lightwalletd servers will need to apply this update to allow the future SDK capabilities to properly function and deliver an improved user experience via the mobile wallets.<br><br>Supports future zcash 5.6.0 update.Second half of AprilECC prototype walletThis initial version of the app is being developed with a minimum feature set as a test platform to validate current Zcash functionality and serve as a prototype for future feature development.<br><br>Initial distribution will be limited with a broader product launch later in 2023.Second half of May 2023zcashd 5.6.0DAGSync capability, which will enable fast sync and scanning of the blockchain<br><br>Users will not see the changes to the UX until the SDK update 0.6 (outlined below) goes out.Second half of May 2023Mobile SDK updates 0.6 (iOS &amp; Android)This update will include support for third-party app access to fund availability and improved sync capabilities.<br><br>Once this update is live, it will be up to the individual wallet developers to integrate the new features into their application, which will enable users to access their funds without issues and improve the overall Zcash user experience. This will end the emergency mode.



<p></p>



 



 



<p>* Based on community feedback, Ywallet has been working well and appears to be unaffected by high transaction load on the network.</p>



<p>** The speed benchmark we’ve set for downgrading from emergency mode is that a typical Zcash user can receive and spend funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in one hour. This is not a perfect measurement (use cases can vary wildly), nor is it our end goal (we know a great user experience demands more), but we believe it’s important to set a reference goal for internal and community alignment. Future speed improvements will be planned once the critical issues are resolved.</p>

   Alfredo Garcia describes a new Zebra feature to store Zcash block data in an elasticsearch database, which allows us to use Kibana to explore and visualize the data.  
 The post Visualize Zcash Blockchain Data with Zebra + Elasticsearch + Kibana appeared first on Zcash Foundation.

							<p>The Zcash blockchain history is big and rich—any block explorer application can just call RPC methods from a zcashd node and present the data in the desired way. Data analysis is hard in this context, on the one hand, you can just do what a specific application will allow you to do, or on the other hand if you need different visualization you have to create your own app.</p><p>As an alternative, we can export and index all block (header and transaction) data fields into an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">elasticsearch</a> database and use <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana/">Kibana</a> as a front end to do some analysis.</p><p>The possibilities of data visualization are huge with Kibana and all we need to do to create them is to feed an elasticsearch database with valid JSON block data.</p><p>When the elasticsearch feature is enabled, each block is sent from Zebra into elasticsearch; this is in addition to saving the block in the internal rocksdb database. We can then guarantee Zebra’s correct ongoing functionality and storage in the desired external database at the cost of more hard drive storage and a longer synchronization time.</p><p>Once the data has been inserted into the database, the Kibana part is easy. It may be able to provide many answers to existential questions our community deserves to know, for example:</p>  How many Orchard transactions have we had since its introduction? (Adoption)  How many shielded coinbase transactions have we had since its introduction? (Adoption)  How many Sprout transactions did we have in the last X period? (Deprecation)  How many transactions per block have we had on average since the start of the blockchain? (Information)  Which hours of the day are more transactions executed? (User distribution)  What is the average size of a block or transaction? (Parameters)  What is the distribution between Orchard, Sapling, Sprout and transparent transactions? (Information)  And many, many others.  						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
																														 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							The Zebra elasticsearch feature has only been tested on Testnet so far. Here is a guide on how to set it up; it is pretty easy.

What I think is needed next:
 
 	 Deploy the Mainnet in the cloud 
 	 Setup Kibana for listening to an external IP address. Optionally attach a domain name to it. 
 	 Create and share Kibana usernames and passwords between people interested in creating visualizations 
 	 Create dashboards with Zcash data 
 	 Share links to visualization in forums, twitter, news, etc. (external users do not need Kibana access to see shared visualizations)

If you want to collaborate on any of these, please let us know by posting to the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/technology/zebra/46">Zcash Community Forum</a>!

<p>Scientific research &amp; publishing are gruelling tasks that extend outside the scope of science itself. Centralised publications abound in archaic practices that span from submitting a paper to getting it peer-reviewed and finally published, process which may take even up to years. In addition, research requires funding from very early stages of pursuing an idea, all the way to its finality (i.e. clinical trial or real-life applications). In TradSci (traditional science), funding is usually obtained once progress has already been achieved or when a startup has been formed.<br>DeSci (decentralised science) sets out to change this paradigm by funding early stage research via DAOs. When it comes to scientific publications, peer reviewing is also decentralised and incentivised, considerably speeding up the process. Moreover, contributions can be clearly retraced, avoiding false claims over IP, and the research itself becomes much more easily accessible and disseminated.</p><p>We were joined by Vincent Weisser &amp; Laurence Ion, stewards of Vita DAO, to discuss the advantages of DeSci in general, and the progress of longevity research in particular.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Vincent’s background and his interest in longevity  Laurence’s background and his interest in biotech  The purpose of DeSci  Which science branch is better suited for DeSci  How DeSci fixes contribution acknowledgement &amp; incentive misalignment  From research idea to startup via DeSci funding  $VITA token utility  Accelerating scientific publishing via DeSci  How IP is attributed in a DeSci setting  Project review and governance in Vita DAO  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentweisser">Vincent Weisser</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/longevion">Laurence Ion</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/vita_dao">Vita DAO</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/molecule_dao">Molecule DAO</a>  <a href="https://www.vitadao.com/projects">Vita DAO projects</a>  <a href="https://www.molecule.to/">Molecule</a>  <a href="https://www.bio.xyz/">Bio DAO launchpad</a>  <a href="https://www.longevityprize.com/">The Longevity Prize</a>  <a href="https://longevity.review/">The Longevity Decentralized Review</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst &amp; Meher Roy.

<p>This happened to me today (three-a-half-minute clip below):</p>
<p></p>
<p>So much for meaningful community participation and relationship building. This demonstrates that the P3 / NGO complex is a theater of busywork to misdirect well-meaning people as Web3 sensor networks and extended reality are installed around us. It’s happening right before our eyes, but we cannot see it for what it is. Even if we could, we’re far too distracted. We’re in a struggle for consciousness and agency, navigating a digital landscape whose treachery we cannot yet fully comprehend. Tell me, what does “community” mean if the majority opts to construct a world where turning children and the most vulnerable into securitized debt is normal? Where everything we love is quantified and rated in real time by emerging technologies? </p>
<p>The professionals fiddle as Rome burns. They, or at least the host, couldn’t handle a mother with a conscience.</p>
<p>This is the introduction of a webinar hosted by <a href="https://www.sp2.upenn.edu/person/nicholas-torres/">Nicholas Torres</a> of Social Innovations Journal based in the Philadelphia suburbs.</p>
<p></p>
<a href="https://archive.ph/yfSga"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://archive.ph/yfSga">https://archive.ph/yfSga</a>
<p>The webinar served as a launch event for <a href="https://socialinnovationsjournal.com/index.php/sij?mc_cid=546eb7ef1b&amp;mc_eid=c36bf829c8">a new volume of their journal</a> on place-based approaches to social innovation. A majority of the co-authors were affiliated with the Canadian anti-poverty think tank, the Tamarack Institute that operates out of the University of Waterloo. There were also several participants with ties to the Salt Lake City United Way, the lead organization for the first pre-k social impact bond as well as staff from StriveTogether, the US NGO using the collective impact framework to turn children into an asset class for global investors. </p>
<p>I mapped out the co-authors and commenters from the chat below.</p>

 Opening Remarks: 
<p>Sonja Miokovic: “So it all starts with this premise that we believe that communities drive transformational change, and this is something that Tamarack’s been doing for over twenty years now. When we were founded, we had two big goals. So, the first was to establish a learning center that would provide research and document real stories, best practices, and effective applications for community change. The second was to apply what we were learning in the field, in communities and learning to end poverty. So, these last two decades have shown us that community change really happens when individuals and networks come together with this intention to collectively tackle these problems and focus on impact. </p>
<p>So, I feel like the curation of this issue was a really great for us to zoom out and see how things are interconnected. This edition really focuses on our evolving understanding and our experience with social innovation, and it was a really unique opportunity for us to these examples of ingenuity across communities, across Canada but also the US and some other experience we have baked in here. So, the theme is really grounded in community innovation or place-based social innovation, and we believe this is an essential piece for tackling complex issues. Throughout our session today you’re going to hear the perspectives, we have eighteen contributing authors. So, that’s quite a lot, and it was really interesting to look at the overarching theme and see all the threads that are going through. I really invite the audience, I know it’s just gone live, but we’re going to hear from all the authors to hear their thinking, and how they’ve moved these themes forward. So, questions are always welcome.</p>
<p>*Remember that last part when we get to the end.</p>

 My comments posted to the chat: 
<p>Alison McDowell: “I’m curious how you imagine extended reality and emerging tech / sensor networks fitting into your social innovation program? I know that population level data analytics is an area of significant interest, especially in the impact finance space.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alison McDowell in response to a suggestion by one of the authors that universities play a lead role in social innovation: “At this point, though, I think we need to consider that many research universities function as R&amp;D extensions of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/10/09/has-the-chamber-of-commerce-hijacked-your-education-system-engineering-students-for-a-low-wage-gig-economy/">corporate</a> and <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2017/01/16/how-did-the-department-of-defense-end-up-in-my-childs-classroom/">military interests</a>.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell regarding government involvement in innovation: “How is <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-nations.html">Canada’s role as a leading digital nation</a> / e-government solutions participant being factored into how this program is being implemented?”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell: “It seems that the impacts of AI and disruption of traditional work options will create opportunities in human capital investment in re-skilling labor markets to build out extended reality. Do you see this as a public-private partnership opportunity? What is the government’s role in providing access to citizens as raw human capital via digital identity and labor engineering? What are the ethics of creating global investment markets in re-skilled labor? Is there a difference in <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/12/06/poverty-wont-be-solved-by-committee-education-for-liberation-less-data-more-freire/">using this approach with children</a> as opposed to with adults?</p>
<p>Andrea Nemtin: “Hi Alison, I think there are some very interesting conversations to be held around data and social innovation, who owns what information, and how do we use it for social benefit?”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell in response to above comment: “I would be interested in knowing who defines social benefit, and how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arfNOiXB8CU">“wellbeing” metrics</a> might be <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/07/14/wellness-metrics-teaching-machines-to-live-with-us-synthetic-pretenders-part-15d/">built into AI and sensor networks</a>. I imagine sometime in the near future government might be replaced by a “public goods” DAO (<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/02/07/gods-eye-view-part-2-intuition-governance-tokens-and-training-kids-to-bet-big/">futarchy</a>). Not sure if people would be onboard for that.”</p>
<p>Andrea Nemtin’s response to my comment that many universities are now functioning as extensions of the corporate and military sectors: “Yes, and how do we ensure how similar resources can be directed to our most pressing social challenges?”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply to Nemtin: “Well, if we’re using military technology to address challenges, I wonder how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx7Dt8hql5M">vulnerable populations</a> would feel about that, right?”</p>
<p>Andrea Nemtin’s reply: “Oh no, that isn’t what I meant – yes, that would be problematic.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply to above: “Most people have no idea that <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/09/27/ieee-blockchain-chair-urges-speedy-collaborative-open-metaverse-deployment-before-mass-dissent-erupts/">Niantic</a>, who pioneered augmented reality, got their seed funding from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hanke">In-Q-Tel</a>, the CIA’s venture capital arm. We’re not informed about the origins of these technologies.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell commenting on a reference to “field catalysts” and “systems level change:” “Do the concepts of <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YhH5y1I2L8lwEnLzs6jWNrH0u64_04PbksgIdcthPuo/edit?usp=sharing">systems theory</a> and emergence inform your process? Is <a href="https://integraleuropeanconference.com/integral-theory/">Integral Theory</a> a part of it?”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alison McDowell commenting on discussion of building capacity by linking community leaders (field catalysts) and adopting models of collective knowledge sharing: “How is data from these interactions gathered? <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/02/10/gods-eye-view-part-3-civic-tech-the-wisdom-of-crowds-and-off-shore-sandboxes/">Is machine learning involved</a>? If not now do you imagine it will be in the future?”</p>
<p>Sandra Lapointe: “Are universities community innovators?”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply: “Do you mean the role of universities in establishing the research frameworks that underpin social impact finance? My experience is that many academics are tasked with building the cost-offset equations that will drive global markets to develop human and natural capital interventions. They’re also innovating the technologies that will capture the impact data for the deals. The problems is that most grassroots activists have no idea these markets even exist.”</p>
<p>Sandra Lapointe’s reply: “There are researchers conducting research on social financing, but I don’t have the impression that this is the bulk of the work. Social innovation happens when we create new ways of doing and thinking and build the capacity to reflect on social change at a very fundamental level. That includes research on all aspects of what we are discussing today, and especially things like inclusive innovation and sustainability.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply: “I suggest looking into <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/10/heckman-and-pritzker-pitch-apps-as-poverty-solutions-yielding-a-13-return-on-investment/">James Heckman’s equation</a> that will underpin global markets in children’s futures via securitization of pre-k debt. It involves putting children on blockchain with digital ID and using surveillance play tables (<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/21/childhood-captured-pay-for-success-and-surveillance-pre-k-play-tables/">Hatch Education We Play Smart</a>) to gather social-emotional audio and video data to score toddlers’ behaviors. This data will run global finance markets once all the children have a digital ID, and it can be brought to scale. See the <a href="https://readynation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/db_files/Kauffman-ReadyNation%20PKSE%20Report%2012041922.pdf">2012 ReadyNation / Kaufmann Foundation PKSE study</a>.”</p>
<p>This clip is of a conference hosted by Heckman at the University of Chicago on social-emotional learning. When a researcher says it’s been too difficult to get low-income parents to use the (surveillance) apps, Heckman jokingly replies they <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/30/incentivizing-pre-k-online-gaming-with-digital-sticker-books-and-pornography-for-the-adults-says-heckman-half-joking/">better incentives</a> – like online pornography for the adults. Really, he says this.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Alison McDowell continued: “The same thing is being done for natural capital via NFTs or other forms of tokenization. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPEGnJJ_4so">the Bank of International Settlement was presenting</a> on their <a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/green_finance/genesis_2.htm">Genesis Project</a> – green bonds with smart contracts for carbon offsets. All of this requires real time data collection. That impact data can then be repurposed via <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> and <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">Singularitynet.io</a> to train AI. &nbsp;We are building the Singularity with the impact data.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell in response to presentation on equity in climate space, including just transitions for indigenous groups in Canada: “I would be really interested in <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2020/02/17/statement-of-solidarity-in-support-of-wetsuweten-first-nation-all-the-darkness-shall-be-exposed-to-the-light/">indigenous perspectives</a> on the use of sensor networks and surveillance technologies like drone and satellite monitoring tied to smart impact bonds in carbon markets. This approach is being done in the name of climate justice, but in fact these data-gathering systems put vulnerable communities under increased digital surveillance.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell: “To what extent are indigenous worldviews shaping the collective impact space?”</p>
<p>Sandra Lapointe: “Participation of communities in the granting process is crucial. Academic granting councils are keen to support partnered research, but substantially more impact (and incentives to transform research practices) would come if community members were involved in the evaluation of partnered research grant applications.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply: “I’m curious if you all are looking at initiatives like <a href="https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-quadratic-funding-for-the-world">Gitcoin grants</a> that are feeding the grant making process into DLT (distributed ledger technologies). I see a big push for broad participation, but the Quadratic Funding model still involves deep reserves of matching funds that are often from tech interests who will benefit from the digitization of philanthropy. In that case it looks like philanthropy, but really, it’s catalytic capital, patient capital awaiting the scaling of extended reality.”</p>

<p>Alison McDowell commenting on presentation about the importance of “social capital:” “Do you all think most people are aware of the massive changes that are underway with disruption of labor markets, the impact of public surveillance tech, globotics, quantum computing. I love the idea of community voice, but the reality of it is the ability to shape the future is currently in the hands of the people at the top who hold considerable wealth and power. It’s hard to come up with good solutions if people don’t even understand the landscape that they’re operating in.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jaime Stief: “This resonates with me a lot Alison. I’ve been watching how the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in the US has influenced federal financial priorities there, and I wonder whether something similar could ever happen in the Canadian landscape?”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s reply: “The BIS (Bank of International Settlement) over the past two days was all about programmable money and cross-border payments. They are restructuring banking – the central bankers don’t want the commercial banks to go away, though. Look up digital nations – plans for tokenization go beyond financial assets the next plan is to “tokenize” democracy and frame it as “radical participation. Money and votes must be understood as signals to train machine learning in social interactions. This is at the core of complexity theory and emergence. Look up Teilhard de Chardin and the Omega Point. Also, Oliver Reiser’s 1946 book “World Sensorium.” This has been in the works for quite some time.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell continued: “For example Sanctuary.ai based in the Vancouver area – look up globotics, Globalization 4.0 discussed by economist Richard Baldwin. They are creating a future of work where people compete for global gig jobs to put their minds in a tele-operated robot. These are major changes. We can’t come to consensus if <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/12/11/email-to-yu-yuan-president-of-ieee-standards-association-sent-december-8-2022/">people don’t understand what is planned.</a> No one is being honest about this planned future.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sandra Lapointe: “Agreed! As Andrea mentioned, the role of government, and specifically municipal government in supporting and engaging in the social innovation ecosystem. As Bill is mentioning this requires governments to change and rethink partnerships.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell’s response: “Is it the role of government to <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/05/16/speaking-out-against-pay-for-success-predatory-public-private-partnerships-and-dr-hites-ties-to-ridge-lane-lp/">create the policy and technological infrastructure required to turn citizens and/or natural resources into investment opportunities for private capital</a>? Will people and nature as assets be available to ALL global investors. How does that work once debt is securitized and attached to high-frequency trading portfolios? Could we unknowingly be setting up toddlers to have their futures shorted? Are poor people and damaged environments (tokenized) the next “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/01/26/will-see-a-pre-k-tarp-toxic-assets-relief-program-in-20-years/">Big Short</a>?” Not only pre-k finance, but also securitization of income sharing agreements on blockchain (<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2021/03/03/thingification-ii-talking-with-tom-cowan-about-the-game/">Edly</a>) and Social Finance’s <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/01/23/fin-tech-digital-identity-and-e-government-in-brazil/">Career Impact Bonds</a>.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell: “Yesterday, the BIS floated the idea of technology companies joining commercial banks in the lending space.”</p>
<p>Liz Weaver: “I’m excited to be talking about collaborative governance. I do think it is, almost like what we heard today, it’s a circle.”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell comment in response: “Circle – cybernetic feedback loops – Macy Conferences – now we have the tech, including token engineering, for granular social programming.”</p>

 Testimony Against Turning Children Into Investment Assets: 
<p>Alison McDowell: “So, I’m a mother and an independent researcher in this field. I’m a conscience for what is happening. I got into this when they closed a bunch of schools in my city. We’re a city with significant poverty, with significant environmental racism, with significant harm being experienced in many areas, and the solutions that are being proposed are about data. They have to be about data at scale. So, that becomes inherently dehumanized.</p>
<p>What I have found researching the education spaces is that the money ALWAYS went back to hedge funds. Not just venture capital, but specifically to hedge funds. Then what I realized is that these equations in human capital finance, and also natural capital, are being used to turn human relationships of the most disenfranchised people who don’t have the capacity to write all the papers that you’ve been writing – to create the equations, <a href="https://wymancenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Belfield-et-al-2015.pdf">Clive Belfield’s social-emotional learning</a>, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/10/heckman-and-pritzker-pitch-apps-as-poverty-solutions-yielding-a-13-return-on-investment/">the Jim Heckman equation</a> that’s going to be used to scale pre-k finance. These equations will put children around the world on blockchain, put returning citizens from prison on blockchain, push people in addiction onto blockchain…at scale with digital identity all the data will be collected through sensor networks. There’s a paper – ReadyNation and the Kaufmann Foundation from 2012 saying specifically that pre-k debt will be turned into global asset-backed securities and traded on global markets.</p>
<p>They were setting up ten years ago children, children to be traded as global debt products. There are these technologies like the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/21/childhood-captured-pay-for-success-and-surveillance-pre-k-play-tables/">Hatch Education surveillance play tables</a> (we play smart) that are being used, because as Jim Heckman says they cannot actually change IQ. It’s not useful to the market, but they can change character. They can change character through digital media. These are all facts. They are very well documented.</p>
<p>You’ve presented all of this lovely information about community innovation, but what about the mother who runs, a Black woman businessperson who’s running a pre-k out of her house, doesn’t know this. So, there will be academics and community organizers who will come in and spin these great tales, but they won’t say, you know what? We’re training your child so that they can agree to put their mind in a robot developed at Sanctuary.ai in Vancouver, for the world of Quantum AI – D-Wave – in Burnaby. They’re not telling you that, and that’s why…Ronald Cohen’s film “I<a href="https://theinvisibleheart.ca/take-action/">nvisible Heart</a>” screened all over Canada to set you guys up for this.</p>
<p>Now I don’t know if you know it, and you think it’s ok to securitize children? This is the new slavery, and you’re doing it in the name of social justice and saving the world. I don’t know if you don’t know what you’re doing. Do you not know what you’re doing? Did no one give you the papers that said the plan is to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/edly-income-share-student-loans">securitize income sharing agreements</a>, and then feed the AI all the impact data? This collective impact data that you’re all collecting. Maybe you don’t know that you’re collecting it yet, but soon the sensor networks will be everywhere. This (waving at the laptop camera), this is all collecting the data. And they’re going to get social data, because the thing the AI most wants now is how to be human. It wants to know the system, how we interact with each other…how we’re creative…”</p>
<p>Sonja Miokovic: “Alison…”</p>
<p>Alison McDowell: “Yes, I mean I’m just…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE HOST HAS REMOVED YOU FROM THE MEETING</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe Nicholas Torres of Social Innovation Journal was the host. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An hour-long screen recording, which lasted until I was removed from the webinar, can be watched here. Sorry, you can hear the keystrokes as I type into the chat. Af far as I know the event wasn’t livestreamed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>PS: I spent the morning contacting as many people as possible from the webinar. I got some bounce-backs, but I suspect many of my emails landed in the right inbox. I’m grateful for Cliff’s guidance in these matters. He’s taught me that we get back the kind of energy we put in. Let us all try and exercise compassion, because some day it will be us who needs gentle redirection. Below is the email I sent out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear (personalized name),</p>
<p>I didn’t have the opportunity to conclude my remarks yesterday, so I wanted to reach out and share a post from my blog that includes my comments from the chat and links related to the issues I raised.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/03/24/mother-of-conscience-gets-bumped-by-social-innovators-for-explaining-how-children-will-be-securitized-on-blockchain/">https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/03/24/mother-of-conscience-gets-bumped-by-social-innovators-for-explaining-how-children-will-be-securitized-on-blockchain/</a></p>
<p>I believe if we understood the role that social innovation is meant to play in tokenizing natural life on earth – yes, including children – to create profit for powerful investors and to generate the data required to advance the Singularity, we would not want to be a part of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trent.st/">Trent McConaghy</a> of<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/"> Ocean Protocol</a>, a key player in the impact data / AI tokenization space, is Canadian now based in Berlin. There are numerous initiatives involved in planned systems of tokenized economics, e-government, and social physics that operate out of the University of Waterloo, just a few minutes walk from where the Tamarack Institute is based.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “place-based” strategies people are being tasked with facilitating are about gamification, complexity, and emergence in a world of ubiquitous computing – de Chardin’s Omega Point. The goal is to mine our social relations in “smart” IoT environments to train machine systems – to “humanize” them. If you appreciate a good rabbit hole, check out this relationship<a href="https://embed.kumu.io/7e4ca13d5586842710868082b4eaa6fa#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1XY2tvTTRjYw%3D%3D"> map</a> I made.</p>
<p>I encourage you to step back from the part of the elephant you’ve been focused on and consider that there may be a lot more going on in the background than you know. We live our lives generally only aware of the slivers of reality we’re offered, until something happens that leads us towards uncharted waters. For me that was 2013 when Boston Consulting Group<a href="https://archive.ph/LBXKp"> closed</a> 23 public schools in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintaining siloed information is a useful tactic for those who seek to hide treachery in plain view. Curiosity is the antidote. I know that the human heart and soul are far more powerful than any emerging technology. That is why we must say no to a future of<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/05/28/soulbound-tokens-trust-networks-and-californias-big-test/"> Soulbound Tokens</a>. I trust you will make good choices going forward. Inform yourself. You cannot un-know what I shared yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never underestimate informed mothers with a conscience. : )</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Alison</p>
<p>PS: If you have questions about my work, which centers on Web3, speculative finance, cybernetics, and legacies of domination, feel free to reach out. We don’t know what we don’t know. Maybe you have some pieces of the puzzle, too!</p>

 zk-nyms are here — a major milestone towards a market-ready mixnet <p>We recently <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-unveils-zero-knowledge-anonymous-credentials-zk-nyms-at-sxsw-6d56bd31802a">announced zk-nyms</a> to the world. zk-nyms are a cryptographic system that allows people to pay and use for services without leaking unnecessary personal information. This is an important milestone for the Nym mixnet and the following VPN example illustrates perfectly why…</p><p>VPNs are one of the more known and used privacy tools around, and if you are using one, you will probably be using a credit card to pay for it. That means the VPN provider has your card details, name and address. Furthermore, VPNs act as a trusted proxy, so even if they shield your IP and browsing history, they themselves know all the websites you are accessing!</p><p>To put it bluntly, your VPN provider now has your identity and full browsing history. And to make matters worse, some “free” VPNs even embed third-party trackers to gather your data and sell it on others (<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/vpns-tor-i2p-how-does-nym-compare-8576824617b8">read&nbsp;more</a>).</p><p>So let’s get into what zk-nyms can do to solve&nbsp;this!</p> Introducing zk-nyms <p>The very first use-case of zk-nyms is now out in the world: bandwidth credentials for the mixnet! By using zk-nyms, people can prove they have the right to use the mixnet for privacy, without revealing their wallet address, payment amount, balance or any other information.</p><p>We don’t want your payment details, your name, transaction number or any other information about you. All we need to know is whether you (or the app you are running) have the right credentials to use the mixnet. In fact, that should be the norm for any digital service that you&nbsp;use!</p><p>We have just launched a sandbox where people can test spending bandwidth credentials with a gateway (<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/bandwidth-credentials.html">using CLI</a>). We invite devs and gateway operators to come and <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/bandwidth-credentials.html">try it&nbsp;out</a>!</p> Pay, but not with your&nbsp;privacy! <p>The Nym mixnet protects you online — not just the IP address and content, but even the metadata and patterns of communication. The mixnet is decentralised and trustless, meaning there is no part of the infrastructure that holds any data about you or your traffic. And that has to be the case for payments&nbsp;too.</p><p>The mixnet is currently free of charge, but there will eventually be a small fee to ensure <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-token-d55ffd3d397a?source=collection_archive---------0-----------------------">operators are compensated fairly</a>. Today’s digital services are incentivised towards surveillance. From Facebook and social media more generally to free email and VPN services, they provide a service at a low cost to attract users and then make up the rest by selling people’s&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Nym mixnet includes token economics to ensure that the infrastructure operators are incentivised to provide privacy, not surveillance. And now with zk-nyms, we are one step closer to a paid mixnet service that is fully secure and does not leak any additional information.</p> What next for&nbsp;zk-nyms? <p>Bandwidth credentials is just the first practical use-case for what we see as blazing a new innovation pathway for our online lives. In the physical world, most of us are not under constant observation. Most of us are not subject to continuous micro analysis by unknown organisations, determining who you are, where you belong and what you are likely to do next. In the physical world, you get to choose what you share about yourself, when and with whom. Unfortunately that is not currently the case&nbsp;online.</p><p>zk-nyms intends to make this possible in the digital world too. You will be able to selectively reveal your information to build trusted and secure relationships without leaking unnecessary personal information to third parties. Specific use-cases include privacy preserving KYC, private payments, access control, age verification as well as a generic privacy preserving single-sign on!</p><p>You are not a number in a database. Your identity should not be imposed by companies and agencies using a tightening net of proliferating profiling algorithms. Digital systems should primarily serve people, not the other way around and the ability to selectively determine what you reveal and to&nbsp;who.</p> Features of&nbsp;zk-nyms <p>You may be seeing the words ‘zero knowledge’ and ‘private credentials’ bouncing around a lot these days and be wondering: what makes zk-nyms different from other credentials and zk-magic? The main advantage of zk-nyms is that we are decentralised, and have threshold-issuance, meaning that we avoid a centralised point of trust to issue us the credentials! To wrap up here is a quick overview of the features of&nbsp;zk-nyms…</p> Cryptographic <p>As the name hints at, zk-nyms make use of several cryptographic primitives, including zero-knowledge proofs, blind signatures and commitment schemes, and are an extension of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07344">Coconut credential scheme</a>. Zero knowledge has become quite the hype lately, so there are plenty of guides out there for those who want to deep-dive, but suffice to say that this bit of cryptographic magic allows people to cryptographically prove something without having to reveal the evidence. (A more in depth post comparing zk-nyms with zk-snarks, starks and other zero knowledge hype, coming&nbsp;soon!)</p> Decentralised <p>A unique feature of zk-nym is that it is decentralised. This means that there is no single authority that holds your credentials. Instead they are issued by a decentralised validator set. For some of you readers, this might raise alarm bells regarding potentially malicious validators, but we have good news for&nbsp;you…</p> Threshold issuance <p>…because zk-nym makes use of threshold issuance, meaning validators only hold a share of the key that signs the credential! Having a threshold issuance has a similar byzantine-fault tolerance as other validator bases schemes, i.e., we not only distribute trust but also avoid crush of the system in case some validators go offline or are malicious.</p> Unlinkable <p>Unlinkability means that the issuance of your credential and your subsequent showing of it is unlikable. This means that even if validators collude with the service to which you show your credential, they cannot learn any additional information. Furthermore, a property of blind issuance means that even if all the validators colluded, they would not be able to piece together the private attribute of your credential.</p> Selective disclosure <p>The power is now firmly back in your hands to selectively disclose information about yourself as and when you need&nbsp;to.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@M.Quin/zk-nyms-burada-piyasaya-haz%C4%B1r-bir-mixnet-yolunda-%C3%B6nemli-bir-kilometre-ta%C5%9F%C4%B1-2b6388695653">Turkish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/zk-nyms-ya-est%C3%A1-aqu%C3%AD-un-hito-importante-hacia-una-mixnet-preparada-para-el-mercado-fd182329addf">Spanish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymportugues/zk-nyms-est%C3%A3o-aqui-um-marco-importante-em-dire%C3%A7%C3%A3o-a-uma-rede-de-mixagem-pronta-para-o-mercado-33297c488080">Portuguse</a></p> Learn more <p>Try: zk-nyms for <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/bandwidth-credentials.html">bandwidth credentials CLI&nbsp;sandbox</a></p><p>Blogpost: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/vpns-tor-i2p-how-does-nym-compare-8576824617b8">VPNs, Tor, I2P — how does Nym&nbsp;compare?</a></p><p>Paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07344.pdf">Coconut credentials scheme</a></p><p>Paper: <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/011">Security Analysis of&nbsp;Coconut</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">zk-nyms are here — a major milestone towards a market-ready mixnet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      Partnering with Hex: Data Collaboration Made Easy        Barry, Caitlin, Glen and their team are building a collaborative workspace for the modern data stack—where delivering insights is seamless.   <p>By Matt Miller and Michelle Bailhe Fradin</p><p>Published March 23, 2023</p>      



 
<p>Data is the competitive advantage of the 21st century. Without access to the right information, businesses are unable to make the quick decisions they need to survive—and any dream of AI is off the table. The good news is that the wave of the cloud has brought with it a whole set of new companies and technologies to collect and break down more information than we ever could have imagined, including cloud data warehouses, real-time data and integration, efficient data loading, transactional cloud databases, transformation and metrics. These products and others like them are giving us better information than ever before and the companies behind them have created more than $100B of market cap in the process.</p>



<p>The irony, though, is that atop this modern data stack, teams are still forced to use kludgy, decades-old analytics tools to actually make all of that data useful and deliver insights to users. But these are the types of opportunities we love at Sequoia: when a shift in the competitive landscape creates a clear opening for an enduring company to emerge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we are thrilled to embrace just such an opportunity and announce our partnership with <a href="https://hex.tech/">Hex</a>. We believe the platform that co-founders Barry McCardel, Caitlin Colgrove and Glen Takahashi and their team are creating has the potential to transform how businesses work together—in modern languages, with modern infrastructure. Hex starts its journey with data scientists, offering them the best way to collaborate on notebooks and work together to deliver insights. It ends with an analytics platform that empowers both business users and data analysts to quickly find the answers they need to do their jobs.</p>



<p>We learned about Hex through our partnerships with Snowflake and dbt, where customers were raving about their experiences with the product. People tell us they love the collaborative experience it offers and the ease it gives them in accessing the information they need. For some customers, Hex is already being used not only by data scientists, but the whole company.</p>



<p>When we first met Barry, Caitlin and Glen, they weren’t raising money. We are thankful to them for nonetheless being patient with our interest—and for seeing value in the opportunity to partner with us. We are excited to put Team Sequoia behind Hex, and we look forward to seeing them accomplish their dream of making data an easy and collaborative experience for everyone. By doing so, they will rightfully claim their spot as the crown jewel atop the modern data stack that is changing our world.</p>

      Developer Tools 2.0         <p>By Charlie Curnin, Josephine Chen and Stephanie Zhan</p><p>Published March 22, 2023</p>        Generative AI stands to change how work happens in one industry after another. But software engineering’s transformation isn’t done yet.        



 
<p>Copilot has caught lightning in a bottle. GitHub’s AI-powered companion for developers, suggesting the code you might want to write next, is a hit in more ways than one. It’s beloved by engineers, attracting more than <a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/">a million</a> within about a year and delivering a substantial boost in productivity. (Even if you’re a <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1608895189078380544">top engineer</a>, it might write half your code or more.) It also stands to become a commercial blockbuster. Charging $10-19 per seat per month, Copilot could grow to generate $1 billion or more in annual revenue among GitHub’s <a href="https://github.blog/2023-01-25-100-million-developers-and-counting/">100 million users</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Copilot’s success has set off a gold rush. Founders have raced to bring the power of large language models to all kinds of other industries, building tools to help professionals write, code, design and create media. There’s “Copilot for lawyers,” “Copilot for doctors” and “Copilot for designers,” and many more “Copilot for X”’s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are all exciting directions. We think <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">generative AI</a> stands to transform <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyatweetybird/status/1628446962742874112">one industry after another</a>, making all kinds of professionals <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-for-work-perspective/">more effective at work</a> and delighting waves of consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there’s a lot more to do for developers. Copilot, which leverages OpenAI’s model Codex, may be just the opening salvo in AI’s transformation of how software engineers work. Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">predicted</a> in 2017 that neural networks would create a new generation of software, “Software 2.0,” and we may see the same reinvention of the tooling that helps people make software—a “Developer Tools 2.0.”</p>



<p>There are many opportunities here. Some founders are iterating on the in-editor, get-help-while-you’re-coding experience Copilot popularized, trying different interaction patterns or different models. Think of Replit’s <a href="https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter">Ghostwriter</a>, Soucegraph’s <a href="https://twitter.com/sourcegraph/status/1618719148087070721">Cody</a>, <a href="https://www.tabnine.com/">TabNine</a> and others.</p>



<p>Many other opportunities lie further afield. You might target work engineers do beyond writing code, like debugging and documentation—or other work engineering orgs do, like incident response. You might think of value props other than “write code faster,” like “write code that’s more performant or more secure.” You might throw out the plugin form factor and rebuild an entire application. You might focus on personas other than the software engineer, like the data scientist who needs a boost writing in notebooks (see: <a href="https://hex.tech/magic/">Hex</a>), or the data analyst toiling away writing SQL queries. There’s a wide waterfront of opportunities to explore and many places to hook into developers’ workflows.&nbsp;</p>
 



<p></p>







 
<p>Building legendary companies to enable this won’t be easy. Copilot faces <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446821/microsoft-openai-github-copilot-class-action-lawsuit-ai-copyright-violation-training-data">legal scrutiny</a> over concerns related to <a href="https://githubcopilotlitigation.com/pdf/06823/1-0-github_complaint.pdf">software piracy</a>. Microsoft, the incumbent with control over both GitHub and VS Code, enjoys significant distribution advantages. Many founders have started building with LLMs, making many opportunities competitive. GitHub itself just announced plans to offer broader AI functionality through a brand-new version of Copilot, powered by GPT-4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in our view, there’s a massive opportunity for AI to transform software engineering, and it’s a matter of who, not if. We think important ingredients in who prevails will be focusing on developer experience, providing net-new capabilities, and making strategic choices around how to land and expand in developers’ workflows. Success here can mean rewriting how engineering happens—and having a chance at building a generational company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today we’re happy to announce a new partnership with Transak, whose developer integration toolkit will enable the purchase of crypto assets directly within Brave Wallet. Transak offers Brave Wallet users access to over 50 new tokens across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum—giving self-custodial wallet users more options to buy and deposit their preferred tokens.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to be integrating Transak to Brave Wallet to give our users more choice in what crypto they buy and how they choose to buy it,” said Brian Bondy, co-founder and CTO at Brave.</p>
<p>“Brave browser has always been on the forefront of supporting Web3 and is enabling so many users to securely interact with the ecosystem. Therefore, we are very proud to be supporting Brave Wallet in its mission to onboard more and more users to Web3. Our integration will enable these users to easily buy crypto via their locally supported payment methods and deposit directly to their Brave Wallet,” said Sami Start, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Transak.</p>
<p>In addition to Visa and Mastercard, Transak offers a wide variety of payment methods—Apple Pay, Google Pay, UPI, Mobi Kwik, AstroPay, and Maya—which greatly expands coverage to more customers around the world. For a full list of payment options by region, see <a href="https://transak.notion.site/On-Ramp-Payment-Methods-Fees-Other-Details-b0761634feed4b338a69f4f186d906a5">Transak’s documentation</a>, and for a guide on how to buy crypto with Brave Wallet, check out Brave’s <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/10800687258637-How-do-I-buy-crypto-with-Brave-Wallet-">support center.</a></p>

 Using Transak to buy crypto in Brave Wallet 


    
    

    


    


    
    

 
 Open the Brave browser, and then open Brave Wallet.
 
 You can either visit brave://wallet, click the wallet icon in the address bar, or select Wallet from the browser options menu. 
 
 
 Select “Buy” in the wallet panel or wallet page. 
 Select a network in the “All Networks” dropdown menu, and then search your desired token. 
 Pick Transak from the list of available on-ramp partners. 
 Follow the steps to complete the purchase with Transak. 
 
<p>Brave Wallet enables Brave users to store, manage, grow, and swap their crypto portfolio across multiple blockchains from a single wallet. Unlike most crypto wallets, Brave Wallet is browser-native, meaning it doesn’t require any additional downloads or extensions, helping reduce security risks and reliance on extra CPU and memory. Users can transact with thousands of crypto assets with superior safety and performance, as well as connect with other wallets and Web3 DApps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>March 19, 2023</p>
<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>I would like to share with you my notes from a book that I am reading about the thought of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.</p>
<p>As you know, Teilhard is part of the Catholic story as is the author of this book, Wolfgang Smith. But Smith is also a product of the same academic and corporate structures that you have painstakingly traced in your mapping of the development of the ideas that are now shaping our world in ever more terrifying ways. He graduated from Cornell at eighteen with majors in physics, mathematics and philosophy and took an M.S. from Purdue. He then spent 3 years at Bell Aircraft Corporation as an aerodynamicist. He gained recognition for his pioneering papers on the effect of diffusion fields, providing a theoretical solution to the re-entry problem for space flight. He then got a Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia University and became a professional mathematician.</p>
<p>So, Smith straddles both science and faith. I guess that it was the ever more obvious attempts to morph science itself into a faith that made him embark upon a critique of scientism and upon attempts to revive metaphysics as an authentic theological discipline.</p>
<p>In this light, he has Teilhard firmly in his sights.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you have often pointed to the Jesuit’s work as a central element in the potential endpoint that is driving many of the current developments in society, I thought it might be useful to precis the central points of this work. In the first chapters, the author is establishing how Teilhard’s theories depend upon the destruction of the thought of his own Catholic and all other major religious traditions. He also calls into question the scientific basis for his theories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think his insights will deepen our understanding of Teilhard’s work and why it so influential and dangerous for the entire human race. I hope that it is not too dry!</p>
<p>The book is called <a href="https://angelicopress.org/theistic-evolution-smith">Theistic Evolution: The Teilhardian Heresy (</a>Angelico Press 2012).</p>
<p>Below, I provide a summary of the introduction and chapters one through three.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Smith locates Teilhard within the field of theistic evolution which argues that God creates through evolution that is driving us to a predestined endpoint. Teilhard devoted much of his work to promoting and describing this endpoint. His work combines science and theology.</p>
<p>The author provides a brief sketch of Darwin’s theory of evolution. He then highlights how subsequent discoveries, especially in biology, have cast increasing doubt on the theory.</p>
 
 Microevolution. Although yielding observable effects, has never been shown to effect the transformation of one species to another 
 Macroevolution. The famous gaps in the fossil records and all those missing links! 
 Irreducible complexity. The practical and mathematical improbability that a complex system could evolve by chance mutations and be selectively assumed into a genetic line. 
 
<p>He highlights how fanatical adherence to Darwin’s theories can only come from a need to contain all explanations for life in a materialist framework.</p>
<p>Teilhard’s “theistic evolution” has infected nearly all the Christian world. Even worse, it is being used to shore up a tottering “scientific” theory by filling in its gaps with divine intervention.</p>
<p>Modernism has demythologised biblical interpretation and stripped it of ontological meaning (ontological as relating to all questions of what it means to “be”). This means that we interpret Eden as belonging to the same material world as that which we now inhabit. However, it is really a transcendent realm from which humanity “fell”. This fall has come to be seen almost entirely in moralistic terms and not as a movement from one realm to another.</p>
<p>The point is that the Christian creation story and theistic evolution cannot both be true. If mankind originated (body and soul) in a transcendent realm outside of our world, then it did not originate in our known world many millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Smith argues that in Christianity man is at the absolute centre of creation and the created world is tied to our fate because we have a unique relationship to God. Teilhard wanted to reinvent Christianity and create a new religion. But this does not just concern remote Catholic theologians as (after some kind of mystical vision) he felt that he was the only person to have seen the truth. He then set out to engulf all of humanity in this vision.</p>
<p>His work has replaced the idea of following Christ with the intention to create Christ by way of evolution. Christ is no longer Alpha and Omega but only Omega. All that remains of spiritual life is communal action – the kind that promotes “socialization” (apparently one of Teilhard’s own terms). What counts is not the individual but the species.</p>
<p>He created many scientific-sounding fictions and has convinced many people of the truth of his vision. Smith aims to look at the “scientific evidence” for theistic evolution which has allowed his doctrine to “attain dominion” in the educated Christian world and beyond.</p>
<p>Finally, he offers this book as a kind of homeopathic remedy for the infection of theistic evolution. He will go on to cover such topics as the nature of time and eternity, the twofold distinction between spirit, mind and matter and the meaning of history in light of revelation. Of course, his is obviously a Christian perspective.</p>
<p>Chapter One – Evolution: A Closer Look</p>
<p>Whilst there is some evidence for microevolution this is not the case for macroevolution. Smith means the latter in this discussion. For instance, there is no evidence of a continuous evolutionary chain and there are many temporal gaps in the fossil record. Also, no evidence has been found for the intermediate creatures that had been proposed in order to complete that chain (such as Ernst Haekel’s protovertebrates). In addition, DNA shows that idea of the genealogical tree is mistaken as the biosphere does not show a sequential progression but rather is divided into well-defined and widely separated classes. This separation is clear and mathematically verifiable at the molecular level. There is no evidence that this was any different in the past.</p>
<p>Even more convincing is the complexity of living organisms even at their most basic level. Mathematical calculations based on the makeup of the simplest of life forms show the improbability of Darwin’s scenario. The author gives the example of flagellum.</p>
<p>Smith then puts Darwin’s increasingly shaky theory of evolution up against what he calls “authentic theology.”</p>
<p>St Augustine said “beyond a doubt the world was not made in time but with time.”&nbsp; Evolution takes place in time so this is not how God created. Scripture rules out the objection that the world might have been made with time but creatures in time.</p>
<p>“He that liveth in eternity created all things at once”. – Ecclesiasticus 18:1</p>
<p>This is known as the omnia simul doctrine.</p>
<p>“God creates the world and all things in the present now” explains Meister Eckhart.</p>
<p>This “now” coincides with eternity.</p>
<p>So Teilhard’s assertion that “God creates through evolution” is untenable metaphysically, or at least it should be for Christians!</p>
<p>God creates the creature before he creates time: being has precedence over time.</p>
<p>In fact, time derives from the creature. This seems strange to us. But the Church Fathers taught that created beings are birthed in time and then each manifest being has its own spatio-temporal locus. It fits into a “universal network of secondary causes” but its roots extend beyond the visible cosmos and into the timeless instant of the creative act.</p>
<p>This means that your being does not coincide with the visible “you”. Smith says that even the tiniest plant is “vaster than the entire cosmos in its visible form” because its roots extend into eternity.</p>
<p>This doctrine is difficult for us to understand – it is from God’s perspective.</p>
<p>Creation from the point of view of Anthropos (Adamic or primordial man) is contained in the hexaemeron or six days of creation. This is the first effects of the creative act as they are expressed within (and not without) the visible cosmos.</p>
<p>Smith argues that our world has effectively shrunk because we no longer understand the old teachings about the extra dimension where the primary act of creation takes place–that which is above. This is the invisible realm that is beyond the detection of science and has therefore been dismissed as fantasy. So, we have now become “denizens of the flatland”: the land that has lost its verticality. Consequently, we can now dismiss the ancient doctrines altogether (atheism) or reinterpret them to fit into the horizontal plane (heresy).</p>
<p>Thus, according to Smith, the Darwinist is seeking the origin of the species where it cannot be found as being preceded time. But the theistic evolutionist both commits this error and adds another. He locates these origins within time and then asserts that God creates through evolution. Omnia simul has disappeared and every supposed movement of evolution is attributed to God. We have been deracinated and cast onto the shifting sands of time. In short, we have been robbed of our essential being.</p>
<p>But there is a true evolution of creatures. A first birth takes place in the “above” and then a second as the creature moves “downwards” (as it were) into the visible cosmos. This is the manifestation or “unfolding” in space and time of a created being.</p>
<p>Evolution is central to the work of Teilhard as he says all other theories and systems must bow before it.&nbsp; However, he does not explain how this came to be established. In other words, he is claiming an evidential base for Darwin’s theory that does not exist.</p>
<p>Smith shows that Teilhard abandons the argument that Darwin’s theory can be proven by empirical evidence in favour of the argument that it can be established on a priori grounds – that is through the exercise of reason. No one has ever been able to observe a genuine action of evolution or transformation of species from one state to another. So, Teilhard enthrones evolution as the king of theories on the grounds that reason can see no other way that the development and transformation of species could occur.</p>
<p>Even though Teilhard, the Christian, has to include God in his theories, the operations of chance predominate in his work.&nbsp; Moreover, everything, even Christianity, must now be reinterpreted in the light of a universe fuelled by random chance. The biblical creation story and the whole idea of God has to be recast as He may only now create through the mechanism of evolution.</p>
<p>Smith concludes that Teilhard became fascinated by the theory of evolution because he wanted to be able to contain all explanations for the causality and transformation of life within the visible cosmos. He wanted to rule out “the intervention of an extra cosmic intelligence” and to see a self-sufficient nature “as a seamless garment of organic interrelationships in which every living form can be regarded as the resultant of preceding forms.” This is the biological counterpart of Newtonian physics applied to the biosphere.</p>
<p>Teilhard identifies that there must be a “physical agent” that connects and explains the transformative movements of nature. His dream seems to have been to define, name and presumably use this agent. It is the philosopher’s stone of the transformist’s cause. Smith points out that if they have not, after so much time, identified this agent of transformation and thus of evolution how can they say that evolution itself is established fact?</p>
<p>He concludes this chapter by wondering at the fanatical faith of the transformists in the self-sufficient “one organic physical interaction of living beings.” They seem to be obsessed by establishing evolution as a way of precluding the “intrusion” of an extra cosmic intelligence”. This is the great paradox. It seems that Teilhard’s express aim was to reintroduce the Christian God into the scientific world view. But Smith argues that the God of Teilhard is not the Christian God. He wishes to enthrone a new deity who is more suited to the needs of the evolving “ultra human”. This is a new religion and Teilhard is its self-appointed prophet.</p>
<p>Chapter Two – Forgotten Truths</p>
<p>For Teilhard “spirit” is an evolutionary process in consciousness and thought. It is the unconscious unfolding into the conscious and onto the self-consciousness unique to humanity and which includes our capacity for language.</p>
<p>“Once symbols have taken the place of things, one is able to manipulate these symbols, move them about at will; and by virtue of this inner freedom, one finds oneself, as it were, in a new space: the space of concepts, the inner world of thought.”</p>
<p>Spirit has become a “thing” that can be “observed” within ourselves and related to other things (such as the brain). It is “a variable connected to other variables.”</p>
<p>If this process of spiritualization is channelled through “socialisation,” it will lead, according to Teilhard, to hyperconsciousness. This is the collectivisation of thought of Teilhard’s super-organism in which each of our brains is but a neuron in the over brain.</p>
<p>Following Descartes, Teilhard reduces spirit to a “thinking entity”. This departs from the ancients who distinguished the thought processes of the mind from the intellect which was associated with the spirit.</p>
<p>Particularly after Descartes, the higher concept of “intellect” was subsumed into “mind” and forgotten. For Descartes, “mind” was a spiritual substance whose activity was thought. Teilhard goes beyond this and declares that mind/thought is spirit. This amounts to a radical transformation in our view of what it is to be human.</p>
<p>Traditionally, thought was seen as an activity arising from the interaction of spirit (or soul) and body – like a pianist (spirit) playing a piano (the body). For Teilhard there is only the piano (body). He insists that our dynamic humanity arises from one single phenomenon and not the interaction of two. Thus, for instance, personhood arises only from the neuronal activity of the brain. This is not universally accepted even by many neurologists.</p>
<p>Smith maintains that Teilhard has failed to grasp that spirit and matter are situated on different levels of reality – the two poles on a vertical axis that contain existence. he argues that Teilhard’s single cosmic substance does not exist.</p>
<p>Creation began with a duality – heaven and earth which can be understood in a number of different ways, but underlying them all are two elements—spirit and matter.</p>
<p>In the past, thinkers have tried to represent the invisible spiritual reality through metaphors and images, but eventually these attempts (such as Ptolemy’s cosmology) were ridiculed because they contained elements that could not be observed and hence were deemed to be untrue. These attempts to portray a dual reality have been obliterated from the modern mind.</p>
<p>This obliteration becomes especially problematic when we try to grasp the immaterial elements of our own inner worlds. It was widely understood that the spiritual (the heavenly) interpenetrated the human person. Spiritual and material elements worked together in order to produce the created world and the self-conscious “I” but each kept their separate identity. For Teilhard, however, there is only one indistinguishable substance.</p>
<p>In physics there is no empty space or a totally material particle. The cosmos is full of immaterial spiritual content that gives life and renders the universe comprehensible. So, as we comprehend the world we see it with a spiritual eye – it is this that makes us human.</p>
<p>For Teilhard, our world is not the lowest level in a hierarchical, metaphysical cosmology but is the whole cosmos that includes even God. Spirit and matter are two sides of the same coin –</p>
<p>&nbsp;“All that exists is matter becoming spirit”.</p>
<p>This is the core of Teilhard’s thought.</p>
<p>The “arrow of time” is propelling this substance “spirit-matter” on a one-way evolutionary journey.</p>
<p>The implications of Teilhard’s theories for Christian anthropology are immense. Traditionally man is seen as reflecting the duality of heaven and earth as he consists of body and soul. &nbsp;However, we depend on three elements for our existence. Soul (psyche) is not strictly speaking the spirit(pneuma) which exists in a level above our individual forms. It is the spiritual element from which our individual soul is derived – the soul of our soul. So, the individual soul occupies an intermediary position between the spiritual realm from which we derive life and the material body. In this way we are technically made up of body and soul but linked through the soul to a higher reality. The psychic knowledge of the soul is not self-contained. It derives its “knowing” from a higher spiritual plane. The intellect is thus ultimately spiritual.</p>
<p>But Teilhard does not distinguish between spirit and psyche. In fact, He replaces both these “old” concepts with another evolutionary process – that of psychogenesis.</p>
<p>In the old system, the product of the intellect was cognition and that of the psyche/mind, thought, “thought is the quest of which cognition is the end.” In other words, the intellect guides us through mental movements (often not without some considerable pain!) in order to arrive at an understanding (the stasis of an authentic vision, or cognition). The two are not the same. Indeed, the mind never stops moving and, more often than not, this random thought movement is not guided by intellect or concluded by cognition.</p>
<p>The author explains that cognition does not involve movement because it takes place outside of time. It is only outside of time that we achieve the unity necessary for true cognition as time implies dispersion and multiplicity. An unperceived timeless stillness enables us to perceive a landscape as an undispersed whole. Here, our senses are saved from being overwhelmed by the millions of individual elements that make up the scene.</p>
<p>However, Teilhard is welded to movement as he sees everything as process. He confuses cognition and thought because his system requires it. He cannot afford to perceive the immutability and stillness of timeless spirit.</p>
<p>Smith is keen to emphasise that he is not talking about the Spirit of God but spirit with a small ‘s’. This is the highest tier of the created world. &nbsp;It is not subject to time but neither is it eternal. It occupies a middle ground between time and eternity. This is essential to Christian metaphysics which has to include this realm of intellect. This is the created heaven that belongs with earth as the centre belongs to the circumference of a circle. It is this mysterious union of opposites that constitutes creation.</p>
<p>Creation then consists of the material world and several levels of the psychic world which is crowned by the spiritual. Logic dictates that the nature of time changes as the levels progress. A thousand years on earth can be as a day in heaven. Indeed, at the summit ‘before’ and ‘after’ merge into a timeless now. For Teilhard, man is trapped in the temporal zone as he denies the intellectual soul that pulls us to the timeless heaven and which defines our humanity.</p>
<p>Chapter Three – Complexity/Consciousness: Law or Myth?</p>
<p>In Teilhard’s directed evolution matter is becoming spirit. It is being spiritualised into life, consciousness and intelligence. This is happening through a process of complexification in which particles become molecules which become cells and eventually Intelligent multi-cellular organisms. Higher levels of complexity produce entities with an interior or psychic life that we call consciousness. So, consciousness is the product of increasing complexity.</p>
<p>In an attempt to establish laws in the biosphere that mirror those of Newtonian physics, this idea is called the Law of Complexity/Consciousness. Teilhard claims that it is empirically verifiable and it forms the foundation of his thought.</p>
<p>However, we are only able to observe the behaviour and not the consciousness of beings outside of ourselves.&nbsp; Neither is it simple to measure, in any meaningful way, living organisms in terms of their degrees of complexity. Therefore, it is not clear how one would asses to what extent consciousness is proportional to complexity. And even if this Law held good does it establish Teilhard’s thesis?</p>
<p>Smith argues that it does not necessarily establish what Teilhard wishes to establish – that the spiritual factor is derived from matter. But this is fundamental to his work. He must deny dualism at all costs in order to establish that the cosmos is comprised of one substance— spirit-matter.</p>
<p>We have at least one mental power, however, that does not seem to be a product of our organised complexity. &nbsp;This is the ability to take the extremely fragmentary elements of our sense experiences and unify them into single or ordered comprehensible perceptions. In some way, we turn these many elements into one. For instance, one photograph may be made up of over a million dots. Yet there are no structures in the brain dedicated to the unifying function that makes these dots into one comprehensible image or the multiple elements of a street scene into a streamlined and coordinated sensory experience. Thus, some other element is at work that is not a spatial entity. It’s position “above” space enables it to combine all the elements of spatial experience so that we can make sense of them.</p>
<p>Consciousness is seen in traditional thought as a power of the soul that is independent of the body. However, some aspects of consciousness (here called empirical consciousness) clearly arise from the interaction of the body and soul as in the processing of sensory perceptions in the waking state. But as we saw above, the processing of the multiple inputs to the senses relies upon the powers of the soul.</p>
<p>The author argues that this power of the soul is created and has not arisen from evolution. However, it does evolve in the sense that it is unfolded progressively through the body. Thus, the body and the soul need each other. &nbsp;This unfolding of the powers of the soul also results in the development of species. But this only takes place within prescribed boundaries—dogs will probably never compose symphonies. So this unfolding does not result in the transformation of one species into another—“nothing can become that which it is not”. This is why mutations of form more often than not result in the death and not the evolution of the organism.</p>
<p>Sometimes Teilhard is self-contradictory in arguing that a primitive kind of psyche must exist in every corpuscle and precedes complexification. This is mystifying as not only does it undermine his own argument but is completely without the scientific verification necessary to establish the credentials of his allegedly science-based theories.</p>
<p>Smith argues that Teilhard will use any argument available to him (no matter how scientifically weak) in his efforts to abolish traditional dualism because it is the one thing that stands in the way of his radical evolutionism.</p>
<p>Teilhard does however retain some Christian teaching such as the doctrine of immortality as the survival of the entire human consciousness. But can this doctrine really survive within his framework?</p>
<p>In place of the soul, Teilhard argues that it is “radial energy” that draws the organism to ever greater levels of complexity and which also survives death. For Teilhard, this scientific soul has evolved out of the primeval stuff of the universe and was not created ex nihilo by God. It develops through complexification until it becomes the self-reflective soul/radial energy of man. At death this energy rises upward carrying its “incommunicable load of consciousness.”</p>
<p>It is clear that Teilhard has now abandoned all pretence of scientific rigour and has entered the realm of the metaphysical. For if consciousness depends on the material complexity of the body, how can it survive the death of the organism that produces it? In traditional teaching the body is made for the soul but the soul is not derived from the body. St Thomas Aquinas explains “The intellect is a faculty of the soul and the soul is the form of the body.” But intellect does not correspond to any bodily organ in the way that sight obviously relates to the eyes.</p>
<p>Thus, whilst the soul may be a weaker entity without the body, there is no reason that the intellectual part of the soul should not survive. This is true in most religious traditions. These traditions may be based on revelation or the pronouncements of mystics but they have an undeniable logic. The soul survives because it is perfectly simple and not because of its complexity!</p>
<p>The idea of immortality does not fit so neatly into Teilhard’s theories.</p>
<p>The author makes the point that outside of his own field (palaeontology) Teilhard’s “scientific” theories have received a mixed reception in the scientific community. He has been most warmly received in so-called theological circles and amongst thinkers such as Julian Huxley who introduced his work to the English-speaking world. He has been charged with self-contradiction and the overuse of metaphor which should obviously be used sparingly in scientific treatises mainly concerned with empirical verification of observable phenomena.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the hint of despair in the voice of the author who notes that:</p>
<p>“To the admiring multitude the Teilhardian pronouncements have become oracles of Science; and the more flagrantly far-fetched, the more earth-shaking do these pronouncements appear.”</p>

							<p>On November 6, 2019, the Electric Coin Company (ECC) signed an <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Trademark-Agreement-ZF_ECC_notarized-pages-and-signed.pdf">agreement</a> with the Zcash Foundation (“ZF” or “Foundation”) to donate the worldwide trademark rights for registered Zcash logos and word marks. This donation is subject to a number of ongoing enforcement and performance obligations that ZF must undertake and maintain in order to remain in compliance with the agreement. The obligations include:</p><p>“Foundation will have the right, at its own expense, to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the trademark applications and registrations included in the Trademark Rights and the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of any new or additional U.S. and non-U.S. trademark applications and registrations for the Trademark Rights […] and agrees to take such actions as are necessary to […] maintain in good standing all trademark registrations”</p><p>In addition to the registration and enforcement requirements in the ECC/ZF agreement, ZF must also comply with trademark laws and regulations in fifteen countries/jurisdictions (including the European Union as one entity), with more likely to follow in the future. This is a significant undertaking by ZF as trademark related activities require both external and internal resources in order to ensure proper enforcement and maintenance of the registered marks.&nbsp;</p><p>Why is trademark enforcement important? In addition to ZF’s required actions under the ECC donation agreement and required actions under all registration jurisdictions, enforcement is important in order to:</p>  Identify official sources of information, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent or incorrect information.  Identify official apps and services, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent activities.  Protect the reputation of Zcash, its associated entities, and the Zcash community.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>How does ZF monitor trademark usage and how is enforcement initiated? ZF utilizes a multi-faceted approach:</p>  We work with multiple trademark lawyers to inform and lead our worldwide registration and enforcement efforts. These efforts include monitoring trademark registrars worldwide to ensure we are disputing potential infringements as early in the registration or renewal processes as possible.  We subscribe to multiple “watch services” that monitor apps, social media usernames, domain name registrations, and other online services. When a trademark violation is identified, we take immediate action to notify the offending party and resolve the violation.   <p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of our enforcement partners identifies Zcash trademark violations with a focus on social media and apps. Through only this one partner, since November 2021, we have flagged 793 incidents and we have successfully enforced 602 infringements, with 78 enforcements currently pending. In addition, we have 8 “major” incidents underway (which may include URLs, apps, social media, and/or trademark registrations) in cooperation with law firms in six countries.</p><p>Enforcement actions can be lengthy (and costly) processes with opportunities for both ZF and the alleged offender to respond and counter-respond multiple times prior to a final resolution.</p><p>ZF will include trademark action tracking statistics, beginning with the Q1 2023 report, to further increase transparency related to our trademark enforcement actions and progress.&nbsp;</p><p>What can you do to help keep current and future Zcash community members safe from scams and misinformation?</p>  Become familiar with ZF’s <a href="https://zfnd.org/trademark-policy/">trademark policy</a>.&nbsp;  If you create, or have created, a project that requires trademark usage approval and you haven’t requested approval yet, please do so <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BTlMl98PCJ8ZwPWDcNd4xprRHtjSbdCj5navaOuPjWY/viewform?edit_requested=true">via this form</a>.&nbsp;  If you create, or have created, a project that does not require trademark usage approval (because it is informational or otherwise isn’t required by the policy), please ensure your project is clearly marked as an unofficial source to avoid confusion.&nbsp;  Report suspected trademark violations <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uXLdYuSxCMuzk4HZULg-J78rrnOE0qey9P8rQHX_LVg/viewform?edit_requested=true">via this form</a>.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>ZF appreciates your assistance and cooperation as we strive to keep the Zcash community informed, safe from scams and misinformation, and presenting a unified and clear message across all online platforms.&nbsp;</p>

 Building games of imperfect information with Aztec’s Noir&nbsp;language <p>Noir was conceived of as an open-source, universal zero knowledge language. It was always meant to make the experience of developing in zero-knowledge much more accessible, by:</p>  having simple to read syntax that’s easy to reason&nbsp;about  abstracting away cryptographic concepts and security considerations  incorporating cryptographic libraries for commonly used crypto primitives  <p>So when we heard about the <a href="https://mach34.space/">Mach34</a> team and their work on BattleZips — a Battleship clone relying on zero-knowledge — we knew we had to work together.</p><p>We met the Mach34 team after they placed at the ETHDenver 2022 hackathon with a Circom-written version of the classic Hasbro game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a>.</p><p>Shortly after we released <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge-ff43f38d86d9">Noir</a>, they expressed interest in rewriting Battlezips, providing us feedback, and creating a tutorial series on writing zk circuits and programs in&nbsp;Noir.</p><blockquote>📺 Watch the BattleZips-Noir YouTube series&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25_FzjlG7ZU&amp;list=PLabpoAlaCBY3SM6xHmZCOhPHlmLB4EY6H&amp;ab_channel=AztecNetwork">here</a>.</blockquote><p>We provided them an Aztec Grant in late 2022, and they were off to the races, culminating in showcasing the Noir-powered Battlezips running in the browser at our sponsored game night at ETHDenver 2023.</p><blockquote>🚢 Play Battlezips <a href="https://battlezips.com/">in your&nbsp;browser</a>.</blockquote><p>Here’s an unabridged conversation with Mach34 on their experience building on Noir and what developers can expect building on the universal zk language.</p> A Noir-ish conversation with&nbsp;Mach34  Q: Tell us about BattleZips. How does the game use zero-knowledge cryptography? <blockquote>A: BattleZips is a zero-knowledge implementation of the popular board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a> that uses proofs to shield ship positions. While this is by no means an original idea for a zero-knowledge application, Battleships was chosen as it is a simple but complete example of integrating arbitrary business logic in zero knowledge circuits.</blockquote><blockquote>By settling zero knowledge proofs in smart contracts, we can create novel digital and economic interactions that make the existing role of Information Escrow by third parties obsolete. BattleZips helped us understand how to apply zero knowledge proofs, and we hope the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25_FzjlG7ZU&amp;list=PLabpoAlaCBY3SM6xHmZCOhPHlmLB4EY6H&amp;ab_channel=AztecNetwork">BattleZips-Noir course</a> gives you the same advantages!</blockquote> Q: What inspired you to start Mach 34 and develop BattleZips? Why explore&nbsp;Noir? <blockquote>A: BattleZips marked the beginning of our journey into zero-knowledge cryptography and expanded our horizon on where this technology could be applied in real world use&nbsp;cases.</blockquote><blockquote>This is one of the factors that lead us to creating Mach 34. Mach 34 is a Web3 and ZK Software Consultancy. We chose to focus on mastering the web3 tech stack for the sake of expertise rather than a specific application. This enables us to explore any industry ripe for decentralization, growing our overall experience with the enterprise of&nbsp;web3.</blockquote><blockquote>Corporations and governments alike habitually abuse the authoritative topology of web2 networks; as Web3/ ZK Consultants, we have the means and the desire to help innovators usurp centralized processes and give sovereignty in cyberspace back to the&nbsp;users.</blockquote><blockquote>It is crucial that we stay up to date with the latest trends in this fast developing space to ensure we provide superior expertise to clients. Our prior experience writing proofs demonstrated to us that there is a significant variation between the different tools that exist, how rapidly they can be applied to an engineering problem, and what they accomplish. This led us to explore Noir upon its official release and see how it differentiated itself from pre-existing alternatives.</blockquote> Q: How did you find the ease of usability of Noir compared to other zero-knowledge domain specific languages you’ve worked&nbsp;with? <blockquote>A: Prior to Noir we used the Circom language and the Halo 2 proving system written in Rust. Proceeding from a first look at the Noir documentation to writing circuits was a fairly quick and straightforward process.</blockquote><blockquote>We thought that Noir lived up to most of what it promised in its introductory <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge-ff43f38d86d9">medium post</a>. If one were to begin learning Noir without wanting to get bogged down in learning the inner workings of ZK and how circuits translate to proofs then they could certainly do so. It does a good job of abstracting away from the more complex aspects of the&nbsp;topic.</blockquote><blockquote>One thing that could improve the developer experience is ensuring that the nargo command-line tool and the Aztec NPM packages compile the same Noir version. This is an issue we ran into mid way through the development process that resulted in a refactor to ensure we could test our circuits with the Aztec NPM packages.</blockquote> Q: As a full-stack development shop, how has the process of incorporating zk-cryptography changed the way you approach software development projects? <blockquote>A: Our interest in zero-knowledge cryptography was one of the driving factors for starting Mach 34. Historically and to this day, one of the most sought after skills in the web3 space is the ability to write smart contracts.</blockquote><blockquote>Similarly as the past few years have shown, we believe enabling privacy and scalability in web3 applications is only going to become more and sought after and ultimately a necessity. In anticipation of this we have positioned ourselves at Mach 34 to have the skills and expertise necessary to help companies engineer ZK solutions.</blockquote> Q: What kind of impact do you think Noir and other zero-knowledge domain specific languages will have on the broader software development community? Where do you see the industry&nbsp;going? <blockquote>A: Noir and other ZK DSLs play a pivotal role in the proliferation of zero-knowledge cryptography by abstracting away from the underlying cryptographic principles.</blockquote><blockquote>As history shows, abstraction is absolutely necessary for any technology to become widely adopted. If engineers were never able to design high level programming languages from low-level opcodes then we would have far fewer and less effective software developers than we do&nbsp;today.</blockquote><blockquote>Once the complexity and thought is removed from the underlying components that make zero-knowledge cryptography possible in the first place, engineers have more time to think about applications that would benefit from ZK. It looks like we are about to enter an exciting phase where we will start to see more examples of the technology applied to real world use&nbsp;cases.</blockquote> Q: What advice would you give to developers who are interested in learning more about zero-knowledge cryptography and how to use it in their projects? <blockquote>A: This is definitely an exciting space to get involved in given it is still very much in its infancy. It is poised to solve issues related to privacy and scalability in public blockchains, as well as contexts out of web3 where there is currently a lack of much needed&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>This being said, resources for learning are still sparse and those that exist often have a technical complexity that can make them hard to digest. It can take quite a bit of patience and perseverance to become acclimated to this space but it is well worth the effort given that you are one of the individuals pioneering the ecosystem.</blockquote><blockquote>If you are a developer that has an interest in getting started in ZK then I think reading some high-level introductory materials would be a good starting&nbsp;point.</blockquote><blockquote>After a basic understanding is gained on the topic then exploring a DSL like Circom or Noir to write a simple circuit would be a beneficial next&nbsp;step.</blockquote><blockquote>Once it becomes clearer to you what can be accomplished and what tools are at your disposal then really the limit is what you can ideate. The cool thing is that there is still so much room for novel innovation that it could very well be the case no one has thought of your idea yet. Don’t sit idle and wait for things to develop further! Now is a great time to jump&nbsp;in!</blockquote> Q: Are there any upcoming projects at Mach 34 that you can share with us that utilize zero-knowledge cryptography or other cutting-edge technologies? <blockquote>A: Mach 34 has been researching and working towards constructing a “Zero-Knowledge State Channel”. While rollups offer fantastic scalability, we were put off by the need for a sequencer. Furthermore, aside from Aztec Connect and a few others, ZK Rollups do not have any private state. Thus, we began to explore how state channels might be repurposed with zero knowledge.</blockquote><blockquote>To open a ZK State Channel, parties will agree on the terms of the execution (like a smart contract). The channel initialization dictates what steps can be taken next, and by whom. Rather than posting every transaction on-chain, a state object is recursively built off-chain.</blockquote><blockquote>While previous state channel constructions had optimistic trust assumptions, we can leverage ZK to perform verifiable computations that have instant, trustless finality. Once a state channel has reached an end condition, the entire state execution is notarized by posting the state channel proof on-chain for all nodes to verify in zero knowledge.</blockquote><blockquote>This final proof further employs zero knowledge to hide most of the intermediate state; only pre-determined derived metrics or public outputs are made publicly available on-chain.</blockquote><blockquote>This has many interesting use-cases; we plan to demonstrate how this construction is useful for credit scoring by adding ELO scores to the State Channel version of BattleZips. This provides a verifiable metric that scores the performance of an individual without revealing any of their in-game&nbsp;moves.</blockquote><blockquote>We envision countless use-cases for ZK State Channels across all segments of web3. Undoubtedly, there are use-cases that we haven’t thought of. For this reason, all of our work on ZK State Channels is free and open source. While we intend to utilize the infrastructure for profit, we want to make sure that all possibilities are explored in service of the best possible future for web3 developers and&nbsp;users.</blockquote> Q: What are some use cases you’re excited&nbsp;for? <blockquote>A: One area of exciting potential outside of blockchain is how zero-knowledge can transform personal identification.</blockquote><blockquote>When providing personal ID, the majority of the time more information is conveyed than necessary. Proving one is of a legal drinking age need only confirm the person is above 21 years of age, yet sharing the ID divulges information such as street address and&nbsp;name.</blockquote><blockquote>Using zero knowledge proofs conceivably one could prove they are at least 21 without having to provide additional information. Another example is having to provide a social security number in a KYC process. Leaking a SSN number can have catastrophic consequences so one would prefer this is done as infrequently as possible. With ZK proofs instead one could prove they bear a SSN number without needing to reveal exactly what theirs&nbsp;is.</blockquote> Explore the BattleZips project <p>We’re thrilled that the <a href="https://mach34.space">Mach34</a> team have done such a deep and candid dive into Noir’s capabilities, and their feedback has been invaluable.</p><p>For developers interested in building on Noir, check out their well-documented BattleZips repo.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/BattleZips/BattleZips">🚢 Explore the BattleZips Github repo and codebase</a>.</blockquote> Build on&nbsp;Noir <p>Interested in building zero-knowledge applications on Noir — or contributing to the open-source project?</p>  Get started in our docs&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">here</a>.

 The Ironic Bearishness of using VEIL as Cash 

<p></p>

<p>I and many others are long-time proponents of using both Veil and Bitcoin as cash. A discussion has arisen in the Veil community of people sponsoring developers working on specific development projects, although this is applicable to any Veil Project role.</p>

<p>One commented that as we are “Veiliens” we would surely prefer all remuneration to be done using Veil. This should communicate our preference for and support of Veil as a currency, and certainly it is superior as a privacy coin, but there are some factors that unexpectedly, or ironically, as some would put it, work the opposite!</p>

<p>Let’s suppose that we are paying a developer who has no other source of income, not even welfare. So we know that he has to pay for food or he will starve, and for computer resources too. While some might suppose that any Veil that gets sold for food must have been bought. Buying and selling pressure should cancel each other out, but this is not going to be the case.</p>

<p>Let’s consider that this Veil is not being bought at the exact same time as the same amounts are being sold, in fact, as a Veilien you already have a bag of it, but we also believe that Veil needs to recover 100 to 1000 times its current value, so we will consider the demand and supply and market sentiment dynamics as they are after a 99.9% drop in the value.</p>

<p>Certainly, if Veil had continued its rise in 2019 from its regular trading in the five to seven thousand satoshi range, with a little-known all time high of ten or twenty thousand sats, Veil would certainly be trading comfortably in the multi-dollar range. 20,000 satoshis today, at the time of writing is $5.63. Well, if you are prepared to pay someone 100,000 Veil for some work, valued at $338.20 today, with a Veil price of 12 sats (since increased before posting this article), knowing that those one hundred thousand Veil should be worth TWENTY BITCOIN, or USD$564,236.20, and with a $100,000 Bitcoin, TWO MILLION DOLLARS, you would not want to part with that Veil knowing that they will be DUMPED on the market and probably not even get the $300 dollars worth of work you are expecting!</p>

<p>We see therefore that the Veilien above, by allowing those 100,000 Veil to be dumped on a weak market is not only communicating that they don’t think Veil should regain its all time high, but his or her action will only further depress the market.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that no Veil team member is receiving 100,000 Veil in a month for their work. So, let’s consider the opposite approach. Paying with a currency that has established value and a highly liquid market. That might be Bitcoin itself, or if the sponsor and the sponsored developer live in the same country, it might be their shared national fiat currency.</p>

<p>Before that, let’s consider a managed approach to using Veil as an incentive. The sponsor has the Veil already, as should be expected for a Veilien believer, so he pays the developer, and at the same time places buy orders for the full amount that the developer will need to sell for his or her essential needs. However low the sponsor places his buy orders is the maximum extractable value that the developer can likely instantly gain from the market, BUT there might be other sellers, and the developer might not manage to sell all of the sponsorship before the sponsor’s BIDs are all taken. So, the sponsor needs to bid for a greater amount of Veil or the value transfer from the sponsor to the developer may fail. This has inefficiencies, as the sponsor has to budget more than the value the developer will gain from the transaction, and both will have to play the market, distracting both from developing Veil.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the fiat sponsorship approach, much as we instinctively abhor and avoid fiat currencies. Assuming the sponsor and the sponsored both are able to use the given fiat currency, not at all certain these days, so long as there are no transaction fees, and no interference from banking or government agencies, the full value of the sponsorship will be enjoyed by the beneficiary of that sponsorship, and they will be able to put their full efforts into the necessary developments they have been hired to do. At the same time, the sponsor, a faithful Veilien, can hold on to their (more) valuable (to them) Veil, to be used when the product of the development work has been able to make Veil more popular. Furthermore, the developer seeing how they are improving the ecosystem, may be motivated to budget some percentage of their earnings, from the sponsorship or from other income, into buying some Veil for themselves! This will be Veil that does not get dumped on the market.</p>

<p>Now, I’m still in favour of using Veil, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and so on, as cash, it is necessary, when you expect a long term price recovery, to replace any amount that has been used for spending, knowing that when you spend what was, and should once again be, ten thousand dollars, but only receive five hundred dollars of value for it, if you really believe that, you will replace it the same day, as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p>Please join our Veil community. We hope you become a “Veilien” and see the merit in sponsoring a developer for the RingCT staking project, or for other projects within the Veil ecosystem, or sponsor or become a marketer. Don’t be too shy to attach your business name to the sponsorship, for example: “Bill’s Bicycle Boutique, sponsor of Sato’s She, Veil RingCT staking developer!”</p>

<p>[ Please note that this approach assumes that the current coin price is as a result of a deep bear market. It is highly likely that the opposite approach would be most popular in the heights of a bull market, where anyone wants to get their hands on the currency as a high priority. ]</p>

      Partnering with Turnkey: Crypto Private Key Infrastructure        Sam, Bryce and Jack are giving builders the protections they deserve—with an accessible, self-serve API.  <p>By Alfred Lin</p><p>Published March 21, 2023</p>      



 
<p>Throughout the ups and downs of crypto financial markets, one thing has remained the same: builders are still building. The number of <a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report">active developers</a> contributing to open-source projects continues to climb, and is now more than 300% of what it was in 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the crypto developer stack takes shape, custody is, of course, a core pillar—but many custody products were originally designed to support buy-and-hold financial use cases, not the development of new products. While existing enterprise custody solutions are helping larger organizations scale, developers have their own unique set of circumstances, and in their search for self-serve solutions, too often encounter long sales cycles, large annual minimums, and delays in support for new chains and tokens. Many developers simply give up on the API dream and settle for integrating existing solutions that don’t fully meet their needs.</p>



<p>Sam McInvgale, Bryce Ferguson and Jack Kearney met while building Coinbase’s innovative Custody product, and have seen these challenges firsthand. They were determined to give developers the custody infrastructure necessary to make building in crypto easier. The result is <a href="https://www.turnkey.io/">Turnkey</a>, a private key management platform offering the same advanced security protections major financial institutions demand, but designed just for developers. Sam, Bryce, Jack and their team have built an accessible, easy to use, API-first product that helps users self-custody their crypto via secure enclaves, a deterministic operating system and a custom language for managing permissions. Developers can go from sign-up to signing a transaction in minutes, not months—and generate thousands of wallets programmatically across chains.</p>



<p>We first met the Turnkey team through Bryce, a Sequoia Scout whose passion for all things crypto we knew well. When he introduced us to Sam and Jack, we quickly realized this was a company with three co-founders who would each be backable on their own.&nbsp; They now are leading an expert team with years of experience securing billions of dollars of crypto across Coinbase, BitGo and Polychain. We are grateful for the opportunity to partner with them and lead Turnkey’s seed round.<br><br>Now, they are <a href="mailto:hello@turnkey.io">expanding that team</a> and launching a <a href="http://www.turnkey.io">closed beta</a> of their platform, and we encourage anyone building in crypto to give it a try. Today’s launch is an exciting step toward the future of the crypto developer stack, and we can’t wait to see how Turnkey empowers the next generation of builders.</p>

<p>Last night we streamed part four in our series “Flow Life,” focused on the rental housing venture launched last summer by Adam Neumann (WeWork) and Web3 venture capitalist Marc Andreessen (a16z). Part of the discussion featured a chapter from the 1973 book, “Emergent Man,” written by former NASA researcher Robert Smith, III. Smith described his proposal for an interplanetary space kibbutz, a project to be led by the United Nations. Adam Neumann has said that he imagined WeWork as a capitalist kibbutz.

      Partnering with Tavus: AI-Personalized Videos        In a video-first world, how do you create customized outreach that scales? Hassaan and Quinn are using AI to crack the code.  <p>By Stephanie Zhan</p><p>Published March 20, 2023</p>      



Tavus co-founders Hassaan Raza and Quinn Favret



 
<p>We live in a world where sales emails often seem too impersonal, where many marketing materials are filled with stock content, and where the efficacy of traditional performance marketing has declined severely. Audience engagement has become a scarce and valuable resource—and capturing attention has become an increasingly acute challenge. Customers want only the content most relevant to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tavus co-founders Hassaan Raza and Quinn Favret knew this pain all too well. By experimenting at their previous company, they discovered that personalized videos that touched on the specific needs and desires of each customer received far higher click-through and response rates compared to content meant for the masses. And so they labored away, creating hundreds of clips for their customers during overnight recording marathons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But they knew there had to be a better way. How could you build a workflow tool that would empower business professionals to create personalized videos, but without needing to manually record each and every one?</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">Tavus</a>: a platform that can build a personalized AI version of any sales or marketing professional. A rep starts by completing a 15-minute&nbsp; recording to train their personalized AI, then records a single template for each set of videos they want to create. Using a simple yet powerful text editor, designing individual videos for every customer is as easy as typing up a script, with unlimited variables for personalization to address their specific needs—and voilà! Tavus automatically creates clips with pixel-perfect videos of you that replicate your facial expressions and voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I first tried the product in late 2021, the night after meeting Hassaan and Quinn. It was in alpha at the time, but even then, it felt like magic. We were delighted to partner with them at the beginning of their journey, and to lead their seed round. They are a special pair, with vision, grit, customer obsession, and a creative lens through which to redefine the way sales and marketing should be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, just 18 months later, Tavus creates video on par in quality with anything you would create manually—and makes it a whole lot easier and faster! Even better, Tavus integrates into a company’s programmatic workflows: if a lead submits a form from your website, for example, they can automatically receive a customized Tavus video follow-up instead of a standard email. Already, these customers are seeing results—including 10x higher engagement and 300% increases in response rates, all while reps report saving 10+ hours per week.&nbsp;<br><br>AI is reshaping every industry, and sales and marketing tools are no exception. We’re excited to be working with the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tavus-io/jobs/">growing Tavus team</a> to supercharge the work of the next generation of sales and marketing professionals. Come check it out here: <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">tavus.io</a>.</p>

   Hester Peirce is one of five SEC Commissioners. She's been a Commissioner since 2018, with her term ending in 2025. Peirce, a previous podcast guest of Bankless, consistently makes first principles statements and is known to often dissent for her colleagues on crypto-related actions…we talk about that in today’s episode. These are a couple of many reasons why we enjoy her and her guidance so much.

<p>A letter from the labyrinth – Bristol, UK. Note the <a href="https://discoveringbristol.org.uk/browse/slavery/historic-site-quakers-burial-ground/">Quaker involvement</a> in the early slave trade as ship owners and financiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>March 18, 2023</p>
<p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>It’s Sea, from Bristol, UK. I thought I’d write and send a few links concerning developments around 4IR and smart cities from my corner of the labyrinth. Bristol is home base for the Merchant Venturers Society, the historic colonialist and technocratic chattel slave masters that operated the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The Merchant Venturers were major players in capitalism’s early technological development and&nbsp; the expansion of the British Empire.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They were also the appointed rulers of the city through the Royal Charter of King Edward in 1552. The charter is still in force to this day, though in the modern times they fob us off with one of their ‘democratic’ tentacles, the Bristol City council. The Merchants made headlines following the toppling of Edward Colston’s Statue a number of years ago. Local people pulled it down following demonstrations here in 2020.</p>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests</a>
<a href="https://www.merchantventurers.com/news/statement-from-the-society-of-merchant-venturers/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.merchantventurers.com/news/statement-from-the-society-of-merchant-venturers/">https://www.merchantventurers.com/news/statement-from-the-society-of-merchant-venturers/</a>
<p>Bristol was selected as a smart city testing ground back in 2014/15. I thought I’d send the links below, as you may be interested. It shows the big push from organisations inside and outside the city that are attempting to develop a framework and infrastructure for the future here. One recent development on the streets, a pilot to draw us in, is cashless payment e-tech skooters and e-bikes for rent. They are leaving this e-tech around all areas and neighbourhoods of the city. This is a test project/partnership between our local council and VOI, a company that’s involved in Bristol’s smart tech roll out.</p>
<a href="https://www.intelligenttransport.com/transport-news/141804/voi-technology-expands-e-scooter-operating-area-to-south-of-bristol/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.intelligenttransport.com/transport-news/141804/voi-technology-expands-e-scooter-operating-area-to-south-of-bristol/">https://www.intelligenttransport.com/transport-news/141804/voi-technology-expands-e-scooter-operating-area-to-south-of-bristol/</a>
<p><br>
Also homeless vendors I know for&nbsp; The Big Issue Charity (a homelessness charity and newspaper), were issued cashless payment devices during the COVID crisis. This paper prints articles in support of e-tech and has entered into charitable promotions with VOI, allegedly donating credits that people spend while using the companies e-bikes to the charity.&nbsp; The general narrative pushed around the tech by local authorities, political parties, and business concerns is that these projects are sustainable, ecological alternatives to conventional transport, with the adage to convince us, they are supporting charity.&nbsp;</p>
<a href="https://www.bigissue.com/life/money/more-big-issue-vendors-are-now-taking-contactless-payments/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/life/money/more-big-issue-vendors-are-now-taking-contactless-payments/">https://www.bigissue.com/life/money/more-big-issue-vendors-are-now-taking-contactless-payments/</a>
<p>It’s a bit weird seeing a once quite rebellious rural, working class city turning into a gentrified technological smart hub, in what is obviously a propaganda exercise for spreading future developments around this island and elsewhere. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a lot more going on in Bristol that can be found online, this city is one of the main testing grounds for 4IR and the promotion of smart cities. I hope this information is helpful. </p>
<p>Much respect,<br>
Sea</p>

Here are a few links related to the Merchants Venturers’ current and past roles within the city, as well as links related to smart city developments in Bristol:<br>

      Vijaye Raji Wants You to Think Impact        <p>By Paul Boutin</p><p>Photography: MERON MENGHISTAB</p><p>Published March 16, 2023</p>        After 20 years working with the powerful tools used inside Microsoft and Facebook, Statsig’s CEO is building versions that can help every company deliver measurable real-world results.      



 
<p>“It takes a special courage to say look, I understand where the data is going, but we’re going the other way,” Vijaye Raji tells me with contagious cheer. The statement might seem against Raji’s interests given that his startup, Statsig, founded in 2021, builds testing and validation tools designed to give organizations the rich real-world data they need to make product decisions.</p>



<p>The more you learn about Raji’s life, however, the more it makes sense that his product isn’t going to tell you what decisions to make. In a 20-year career, he’s learned to defy conventional wisdom and make his own decisions—most recently leaving a post leading thousands of engineers to found an 8-person startup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Sequoia partner Mike Vernal’s words, “Vijaye is the most impactful engineer that I’ve ever worked with. He’s incredibly pragmatic and punctual and just a get-shit-done kind of person. If I could have just one engineer on anything, that would be Vijaye.”</p>



<p>Raji is clearly confident but not overly eager to talk about himself. He’d rather explain at length that organizations often make decisions without the data they really need. Or they look at limited-scope data, which leads to short-term focus while missing the big picture. Or (there are so many ways to fail!) they’ll go overboard the other way and let the numbers decide everything against their better sense.</p>



<p>“Data is always optimizing locally,” he says. “Follow it and you’re climbing to the highest local ground. To get to much higher ground, you may need to go through a dip first.” Collecting data from a wider area, with more local details, is like getting the best possible map of uncharted waters ahead. “You need to have product sense and apply it to the data,” he cautions. But first, you need the data.</p>



<p>With Statsig, Raji wants to give other organizations the breadth and depth of data enjoyed by tech giants.&nbsp; He thinks this will let them make better decisions and choose new directions, informed by real-world data about their customers’ behavior.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Vijaye is the most impactful engineer that I’ve ever worked with.… If I could have just one engineer on anything, that would be Vijaye.”</p>
mike vernal</blockquote>



<p>As a boy in Puducherry, India, young Vijaye took an interest in programming at age 12. A computer was beyond his family’s budget, so he did his coding on a machine at the local library. Once, he convinced the librarian to lock him in overnight so he could pull an all-nighter.</p>



<p>Despite his enthusiasm for tech, Raji was cautious about leaving his family behind. When it came time for college, he attended nearby Pondicherry University rather than one of the top IT schools from which many Indian-born engineers in Silicon Valley have graduated. “I got into a bunch of colleges that were outside my town,” he says, “but I didn’t want to go far from family. My dad was working abroad, so my mom definitely loved for me to stay close. But it was a big decision—there are better colleges that I had to give up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time he graduated, Raji’s father had returned home. Vijaye felt OK to take a job 500 miles away in Hyderabad. Before long, Indian outsourcing giant Wipro tapped him to relocate to Finland for Nokia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having never traveled far, Vijaye says he had to learn a lot that others took for granted: “I had never flown on a plane before. I had to learn how to fasten my seat belt.” In Finland, he quickly learned that spicy food and a meat-free diet were still an anomaly at the time. Then there was Finland’s weather: “I moved there in spring, and when November came I didn’t know what hit me.” Puducherry, on the Bay of Bengal, rarely dips below 70 degrees in winter. Yet, he says, he enjoyed discovering new ways of living and came to appreciate them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After two winters in Finland, Raji got an offer from Microsoft in Seattle. Wipro was paying him $2,600 per year—good for India at the time—but Microsoft’s offer letter promised a $72,000 annual salary. The still unworldly Raji believed that, of course, the number was a ridiculous typo.</p>



<p>Once his friends had convinced him it wasn’t, he was all in to relocate halfway around the world for a company he admired. “I had learned to program on QBasic, and then Visual Basic and Visual C++, all thanks to Microsoft,” he says. “It was like a dream when I got that offer.”</p>



<p>He didn’t know it, but he would work for Microsoft for nearly a decade. He stayed longer than he’d have preferred, to avoid the risk of losing his visa should he leave. “I was stuck in green-card hell for 9.5 years,” he quips. “There was a running joke that the fastest way to get a green card was to get married, have a kid in the U.S., and when that kid is 18 years old, they can sponsor you for your green card.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not that he hated his job. Raji worked on critical projects including the Windows Application Framework, SQL Server Modeling Language, Microsoft TV and Visual Studio, which grew into the VS Code application that millions of programmers worldwide are using today. As a side project, he created the Small Basic programming language designed to appeal to beginners.</p>



<p>Four years in, he met local high-school teacher Ashley Lauren. When they eventually married in 2009, Ashley sponsored him for his green card, which he obtained a snappy three months later. He says now, “Microsoft wasn’t bad, but I was ready to go.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It was time for something new. For that, there’s nothing better or bigger than starting your own company and making it successful.” </p>
vijaye raji</blockquote>



<p>Sequoia partner Mike Vernal had worked at Microsoft in those same years and then moved to Facebook. When Raji, whom he hadn’t met, arrived at Facebook later, Vernal says other ex-Microsoft coworkers told him to pounce to get Vijaye on his team. What they didn’t tell Mike was to make sure he was early. At that point, Raji had no patience for people who don’t show up on time. He passed on joining Vernal’s group, but the two became friends over time.</p>



<p>Raji hadn’t planned to stay at Facebook a full decade either, but they kept promoting him. He joined Facebook’s Seattle campus when it was an office with a dozen people, and ended up leading the operation as it grew to 6,500 people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, he says, a startup seemed the one big thing he hadn’t done: “I’ve done engineering. I’ve done large orgs, I’ve made decisions on where to invest in real estate to house 20,000 planned Facebook employees in Seattle. I’ve done commerce, I’ve done ads, I’ve done gaming, I’ve done entertainment.</p>



<p>“It was time for something new. For that, there’s nothing better or bigger than starting your own company and making it successful. And what I’m doing now is data infrastructure, something completely different from everything I’ve worked on before.”</p>



<p>To be clear, both Raji and Vernal—who had left Facebook to become a partner at Sequoia—toyed with several startup ideas in the late 2010s. When they eventually converged in early 2019 on the idea for Statsig, Raji made plans to wrap up his role at Facebook, when he was still head of Facebook Seattle and also of Facebook Gaming.</p>



<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself—by then only two levels up on the org chart—pinged Raji on Messenger (they had chatted often) with a counter-offer: the head of the company’s Entertainment group was taking the place of another departing executive. To Zuckerberg, Vijaye seemed the obvious choice to step up from managing not only gaming but video, music, movies, sports and who knows what next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entertainment was a major part of Facebook’s future. Even Raji agreed it could be a tough year for Facebook if anyone else took the job. “Organizations are very resilient,” he says, “nothing ever breaks because somebody leaves… but, I felt a sense of obligation. I committed to another 18 months.”</p>



<p>Finally, nearly two years later in February 2021, Raji handed in his Facebook badge to start Statsig.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Raji says that what he experienced at Facebook was a builder-centric culture that most companies just don’t have from the top down. “Decisions were all data-driven,” he says. “No more debates in conference rooms. Products are built quickly, validated with testing, and the successful ones survive while the unsuccessful are discarded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook engineers can do this because the entire company uses the same set of infrastructure tools. It doesn’t just make work more efficient, it enables a cultural shift. Facebook engineers don’t measure themselves by ship goals—“I shipped two features this year”—but by performance results: “I shipped a feature that boosted engagement by 2.5 percent.”</p>



<p>Statsig is the latest of several companies like Honeycomb and <a href="https://www.scuba.io/">Scuba.io</a> that were founded by Facebook alumni looking to bring these tools and the culture they enable to as many other companies as possible—a chance to have an impact on the way software is built at any company, maybe even as an industry.</p>



<p>“So far, we’ve built our own versions of a half dozen of Facebook’s tools,” he says. “We’re adding more every few weeks.” For example, Statsig’s <a href="https://blog.statsig.com/introducing-pulse-b38f25790d09">Pulse</a> is a powerful tool for internal A/B testing based on Facebook’s Deltoid. It’s the kind of super tool that big companies like Uber and Spotify can afford to build for themselves, but most startups can’t. Raji is certain that Statsig will empower a foundational cultural shift among customers—from ship goals to metric goals. For non-engineers: It’s not what you build, but what’s your impact?</p>



<p>“What amazed me off the bat with Statsig was the strength and breadth of user-love that the team has garnered,” shares Dannie Herzberg, a Sequoia partner.&nbsp; “Join their Slack community and you’ll see prospects and customers from early-stage startups all the way to enterprise companies sharing their enthusiasm for the product and celebrating new features as they’re launched.”</p>



<p>For Raji and several Facebook colleagues who jumped ship to join him, starting Statsig meant suddenly downshifting to work with eight people instead of eighty thousand, having to learn the partner ecosystem, having to learn to manage a startup business P&amp;L, and so much else they’d been able to leave to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like most startup teams, they found this exhausting and also exhilarating. But as Statsig sailed off on its own, Raji looked back to Facebook’s shores and realized he’d missed the chance to take something valuable with him: “As the head of Entertainment I had access to the world-class sales team and world-class marketing team, and never once bothered to learn that. Now I kick myself: If only I could go back and spend quality time with the sales leaders, the marketing leaders, the business leaders. I had the opportunity.”</p>



 Delivering impact 



<p>Regrets aside, Raji has a track record of identifying projects and companies where he can have an impact on the outside world. What does he look for?</p>



 
 A unique perspective. A credible vision that isn’t shared by the majority. “If an idea and its value proposition is super-obvious to you, but not so obvious to others, that’s an idea worth exploring.” 



 A short time from plan to product. “The implementation of a minimum viable product should take weeks or months, not years. You don’t want to be developing in a vacuum for too long. Take it to potential customers as soon as possible.” Many startups have gone heads-down for nearly a year, only to emerge with a product that isn’t what the market wants at all. 



 VCs getting excited. “Venture capital investors have a broad line of sight into the market. They can quickly spot if something solves a real pain point.” Few ideas are 100% novel. They’ve seen similar ventures crash, so they perk up when they see one with an approach that could avoid known roadblocks. 
 



<p>Raji is indeed known for being reliably punctual, and impatient with those who aren’t. Contrary to popular tech-industry myth, you don’t win by simply working all waking hours, but by developing good time management. Vijaye keeps a well-honed startup parent schedule: A tightly managed workday, followed by never missing playtime with his children after office hours. Then, after they’re tucked in, you can count on him to respond to critical messages later in the evening.</p>



<p>More important, he says, is not letting your first win or two convince you that you’re always right. He’s seen successful people presume that they have superior insight and use their past success—coupled with either undeniable charisma or a bulldozer persona—to get their way contrary to evidence and objections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Statsig is meant to be a set of tools to keep that from happening, by letting more organizations develop a nimble culture of real-world testing and measurement to drive decisions. “A lot of companies debate the merits of ideas in a conference room,” he says. “Every idea has its merits. The way you understand which one’s working and which one’s not working is actually putting it out to the people that use the product. You don’t have heated debates. If the customers like it, the numbers go up. If they don’t, the numbers go down.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m never attached to a decision that I make,” he concludes. “If there’s new data or evidence that proves that I’m wrong … well, I’m wrong.”</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a revolutionary concept that is gaining traction in the world of digital identity management. In simple terms, SSI is a way for individuals to take control of their own digital identity and personal information, and use it to interact with the world around them. This has the potential to revolutionise many industries, including the travel industry.</p>



 The Benefits of Using SSI in the Travel Industry 



<p>In short, the benefits using SSI in the travel industry can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Travellers control their own personal information 



 Travel companies do not have to worry about storing sensitive personal data 



 The travel process is more streamlined 



 Identity can be verified more efficiently and securely 
 



<p>Let’s explore these benefits more in-depth below!</p>



 Streamlining the Travel Process 



<p>One of the biggest challenges facing the travel industry today is the need for passengers to provide a vast amount of personal information to various parties throughout the travel process. This information is often collected, stored, and shared in an unsecured and decentralised manner. This leads to vulnerability to security breaches and identity theft. And as shown by various research, <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/marriott-british-airways-and-easyjet-fail-on-data-security-with-hundreds-of-security-risks-exposed-by-which-a6a2q2L2YtdZ">many travel companies’ websites suffer from serious data security risks.</a></p>



<p>With SSI, individuals can create a digital identity that includes all of their personal information and documentation, such as passport and visa details. This digital identity can then be used to quickly and easily verify one’s identity with various organisations and services throughout the travel process, such as airlines, airports, and hotels.</p>



<p>This has several benefits for travellers. Firstly, it eliminates the need for passengers to carry physical copies of their documents, which can be lost, damaged, or stolen. Instead, passengers can access their documents digitally. This is done by using their self-sovereign identity, which provides a more secure and convenient way to verify one’s identity.</p>



<p>In addition, it reduces the time and effort required to provide personal information and documentation. It makes the overall experience smoother and more efficient. Finally, it allows travellers to have greater control over their personal data. They can choose which information to share with which organisations. Furthermore, they can revoke access to their digital identity at any time.</p>



 How SSI Helps Companies in the Travel industry 



<p>Another benefit of self-sovereign identity for companies in the travel industry is that it reduces their risks related to storing customer data. With traditional forms of identity verification, companies are often responsible for collecting, storing, and protecting large amounts of personal information about their customers. This can be a costly and time-consuming process. It also exposes companies to potential liabilities in the event of a security breach or data leak.</p>



<p>With self-sovereign identity, customers can securely and easily share only the necessary information with companies. Consequently, this reduces the amount of data that companies need to store and manage. This can help to reduce the risks and costs associated with managing customer data. It can also help to protect companies from potential liabilities.</p>



<p>Additionally, using self-sovereign identity can allow companies to build trust with their customers. It shows that they are committed to protecting personal information and providing a secure and convenient experience. As a result, self-sovereign identity can be a win-win for both companies and customers in the travel industry.</p>



 The Potential Downsides of Using SSI in the Travel Industry 



<p>Using self-sovereign identity in the travel industry has a lot of potential for both companies and travellers. One must know that there are also potential downsides and risks. Namely the following few:</p>



 
 Lack of adoption: Self-sovereign identity is a relatively new concept. It may take some time for it to be widely adopted by individuals and organisations in the travel industry. 



 Compatibility issues: Not all organisations and services in the travel industry may be able to accept self-sovereign identity as a form of verification. This could limit its usefulness for some travellers. 



 Potential for misuse: As with any technology, self-sovereign identity has the potential to be misused by individuals with malicious intent. For example, individuals could create false or fraudulent digital identities in order to access services or commit crimes. 



 Security concerns: While self-sovereign identity can provide a more secure way to verify one’s identity, it also introduces new security concerns, such as the need to protect digital identities from hacking and other forms of cyber attack. 



 User error: Self-sovereign identity relies on individuals to manage their own digital identities. Mistakes or errors made by users could potentially compromise the security of their personal information. 
 



<p>While these potential downsides and risks should be taken seriously and should be addressed adequately, traditional forms of identity (verification) suffer similar downsides and risks. And if implemented correctly while taking various precautions, self-sovereign identities will be able to provide a more efficient and secure way of handling your identity and personal information.</p>



 Introducing: A Self-Sovereign Identity Tool for Travellers 



<p>Zaisan offers tooling that is helping to make SSI a reality for travelers. A <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/identity/">self-sovereign identity platform</a> that allows individuals to create, manage, and share their digital identity in a secure and convenient manner. With this tooling, travellers can easily access and share their travel documents, such as passports and visas, with the relevant parties, making the travel process smoother and more efficient.</p>



 Conclusion: Self-Sovereign Identity is Poised to Transform the Travel Industry 



<p>In conclusion, self-sovereign identity has the potential to revolutionise the travel industry. It allows individuals to take control of their own digital identity and personal information. Despite the potential risks and downsides, SSI is looking to be a solid way to handle personal data. Web3 identity tools are helping to make this vision a reality, making it possible for travellers to securely and easily access and share their travel documents. As SSI becomes more widely adopted, the travel industry is sure to see significant benefits in terms of security, convenience, and efficiency.</p>

<p>Network Disruption Resolution</p><p>On March 11, 2023 the DERO network suffered a chain split due to issues with developer controlled seed nodes. These nodes act as an anchor for network participants to uniformly sync with the rest of the blockchain network. Since services have yet to be restored, the blockchain remains split, which includes a chain that is stuck (seed nodes) and a heavier chain that has more mining activity. Since DERO utilizes proof-of-work consensus and the absence of our seed nodes, all network participants are left to choose which chain to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Together with various esteemed members of our community, we have collectively decided to move forward with the heaviest chain as we continue to restore service to our seed nodes. Below, you will find instructions on how to get your node up and running by using community and foundation hosted public&nbsp;nodes.</p> UPDATE (3/19/2023): The DERO network is no longer reliant on seed nodes. <a href="https://github.com/deroproject/derohe/releases/tag/Release117">The latest release provides these updates</a>. The following solution is no longer required.  Remote Node (Wallets) <p>The default remote nodes are also down, so you will need to specify a node address when launching your CLI wallet. Instead of using the ‘- -remote’ argument, run your wallet with the following arguments:</p> ./dero-wallet-cli-linux-amd64 --daemon-address=node.derofoundation.org:11012 <blockquote>Or specify node.derofoundation.org:11012 in your connection settings when using&nbsp;Engram.</blockquote> Daemon (Node) <p>Run your daemon with the following arguments:</p><p>CLI</p> ./derod-linux-amd64 --add-priority-node=78.159.118.236:11011 --add-priority-node=209.58.186.186:11011 --add-priority-node=23.81.165.146:11011 --add-priority-node=85.17.52.28:11011  <a href="https://github.com/DEROFDN/netrunner">Netrunner</a>  ./netrunner --add-priority-node=78.159.118.236:11011 --add-priority-node=209.58.186.186:11011 --add-priority-node=23.81.165.146:11011 --add-priority-node=85.17.52.28:11011 <p>Alternatively, you can download the following files and place them in your mainnet&nbsp;folder:</p>  <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings/raw/branch/master/peers.json">peers.json</a>  <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings/raw/branch/master/ban_list.json">ban_list.json</a>  <p>You can right-click and “Save As” each file above, or visit the repo: <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings">https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings</a></p><blockquote>Please note: You may need to replace these files before each launch of your&nbsp;daemon.</blockquote><p>Below is a list of public nodes that are available:</p>  ams.derofoundation.org:11011  213.171.208.37:18089 (MySrvCloud)  5.161.123.196:11011 (MySrvCloud VA)  51.222.86.51:11011 (RabidMining Pool)  74.208.54.173:50404 (deronfts)  85.214.253.170:53387 (mmarcel-vps)  163.172.26.245:10505 (DeroStats)  44.198.24.170:20000 (pieswap)   Explorers   <a href="http://explorer.derofoundation.org">explorer.derofoundation.org</a>  <a href="https://explorer.deronfts.com">explorer.deronfts.com</a>  <a href="https://derostats.io">derostats.io</a>   Moving Forward <p>During this time, the decision has been made to keep exchange wallets in maintenance mode for the time being. We will send out further communication once we have an ETA of when they will become available.</p><p>We also aim to eventually remove the use of seed nodes in the future, but our young network and on-going development may require their usage for a bit longer. There are also plans to prevent such issues in the future, which will be provided at a later date. We were delighted to see solidarity win in the end and could not have done it without the help of our community.</p><p>We would like to take this time to thank the DERO community again for their efforts and patience during this&nbsp;time.</p> Privacy together. <p>—</p><p>Join the DERO community!</p><p><a href="https://forum.dero.io/">Forum</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/29GNSJ4">Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/DeroProjectGroup">Telegram</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DERO_Foundation">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeroProject/">Reddit</a></p><p><a href="https://dero.io/">Website</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/deroproject/dero-network-update-2def3c133f38">DERO Network Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/deroproject">DERO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Circle has worked tirelessly to re-initiate services with alternative banking partners, particularly payment and USDC redemption services. We would like to thank our customers for their patience during these unprecedented times.&nbsp;<br><br>On Tuesday, March 14, we went live with a new transaction banking partner for domestic U.S. wires in and out. Today, we went live with that same partner for international wires to and from 19 countries. We also went live today with an existing transaction banking partner for international wires. We expect to bring more capabilities back on line tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>We would like to extend our thanks to all the teams that have worked tirelessly around the clock with incredible professionalism to stand up these new services at unprecedented speed. We will continue efforts to add additional transaction banking partners.</p>

<p>The research below was put together by a friend, Daruchan, who shares my interest in slime mold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a story about the Blob, also known as slime mold.</p>
<p>Physarum Polycephalym</p>
<p>Is it an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blob">alien</a> who came to earth to end humanity?</p>
<p>Or a space traveler who came here to start a (new) life?</p>
<p>It is an enigma wrapped in mystery…</p>
<p>So far, we know that it is an acellular organism.</p>
<p>It’s not fungal, though it thrives between two vegetative states, amoebae and plasmodia.</p>
<p>It propagates via growth and nuclear division without cytokinesis.</p>
<p>It has about 720 different sexes to ensure it can find an appropriate mate for future generations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It cannot see or hear.</p>
<p>But it moves and shows an incredible ability to read environmental clues.</p>
<p>It changes its shape and behavior to survive in its habitat, shadowy and damp places.</p>
<p>It is obvious that it possesses some primal intelligence and senses, but does it feel?</p>
<p>So far the Blob’s <a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012%2F01%2F01%2F185653">cleverness</a> has not been decoded.</p>
<p>Though since its reappearance as a part of a wacky scientific project in Japan in 2000</p>
<p>and after a sci-fi movie career that took the art and technology communities by storm,</p>
<p>the Blob became a science super star.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s helping scientists at the International Space Station study the influence of microgravity or near zero gravity on living organisms.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/halborn-discovers-zero-day-impacting-dogecoin-and-280-networks">Halborn disclosed vulnerabilities in some code forks of Bitcoin Core</a>, which could be exploited to crash nodes. An attacker could potentially take advantage of these vulnerabilities to crash mining nodes, and thus reduce (by approximately 50%)&nbsp; the amount of hashpower required to mount a 51% attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash was one of the currencies affected by this disclosure, as zcashd is a code fork of Bitcoin Core. <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">ECC has released new versions of zcashd that remediate the vulnerabilities</a>. Anyone who runs a zcashd node should update immediately.</p>



<p>There is no evidence to suggest that these vulnerabilities have been exploited on the Zcash network, and there is no reason to suspect that the Zcash network is susceptible to a 51% attack (even if the required hashpower were reduced by 50%).&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra">Zebra</a> is an independent Zcash node implementation, and is not based on Bitcoin Core. Halborn has confirmed that Zebra is not vulnerable to these issues. However, we have taken the precaution of hardening certain sections of our codebase to make Zebra more resilient to similar memory exhaustion attacks.</p>



<p>We would like to express our gratitude to ECC for coordinating the Zcash ecosystem’s response to this security disclosure.&nbsp;We would also like to thank Halborn for responsibly disclosing these vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>Development of new privacy-enhanced zero-knowledge tech can revolutionise the identity industry by ensuring anonymity.</p><p>Austin, Texas, USA — Sunday, 12 March 2023: Today at South by Southwest 2023, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym</a>, the leader in network layer privacy, announced a new privacy-preserving zero-knowledge technology called zk-nyms at a <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2023/events/PP1143244">featured session</a> with CEO Harry Halpin and Chelsea Manning (famous whistle-blower and now-Security Consultant for&nbsp;Nym).</p><p>Combining the key attributes of zero-knowledge technology and anonymous credentials, zk-nyms allows users to selectively only reveal certain information about themselves, such as their nationality or age, to generate credentials. This prevents compromising additional unnecessary and sensitive personal data. Using the strength of cryptography, zk-nyms puts the power of this selective disclosure into the hands of users rather than large companies via decentralisation.</p><p>Harry Halpin, CEO of Nym Technologies, said, “Identity technologies run the risk of reducing us to a number in a database. Our new zk-nym technology puts the power to reveal your identity back in your own&nbsp;hands.”</p><p>The zk-nym technology works like a new kind of drivers license, except that when showing the license, only the parts needed for immediate purpose (for example, name, duration of validity and photo) are revealed while information that is not required is hidden (such as addresses or precise birthdate).</p><p>Unlike previous zk and identity schemes, zk-nym is decentralised and trustless. The zk-nym technology is based on prior work on what is called the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07344.pdf">Coconut signature scheme</a> and has now been extended by Nym researchers Ania Piotrowska and Alfredo Rial Duran. Coconut enables distributed issuance of anonymous credentials, meaning zk-nyms avoid a trusted centralised issuance authority.</p><p>“We analysed the security of zk-nyms and have proven that this technology offers strong user privacy protection. Moreover, we have extended zk-nyms to provide anonymous payment mechanisms that enable both on-line and off-line payments. Off-line payments allow service providers to verify and accept a payment without contacting any issuing authorities.” said Alfredo Rial Duran, Cryptographer, Nym R&amp;D&nbsp;team.</p><p>The first use case for zk-nyms is access credentials to the <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/">Nym mixnet</a>, ensuring a person can prove they have paid for and therefore have the right to use the digital service, without revealing name, wallet address or other sensitive information. Other use cases that are being developed include privacy preserving KYC process, e-cash and a general purpose single-sign on. In general, zk-nyms can be used to ensure privacy, while proving a person’s right to use a digital&nbsp;service.</p><p>The Nym team is releasing a sandbox for zk-nyms. The zk-nym technology represents a breakthrough in making privacy as easy as building a JSON object for programmers, where certain values can be easily hidden (or ‘shielded’) to prevent information leakage. As opposed to more complex zero-knowledge systems, it is meant to be easy for ordinary programmers to use and for people to understand as a list of attributes about themselves.</p><p>The core technology behind zk-nyms was previously demonstrated with various kinds of data including being used for proving COVID-19 vaccination status in a privacy-enhanced and decentralized manner with the support of the <a href="https://ledgerproject.eu/">European Commission via the LEDGER project</a>. Although the European Commission did not use the technology during COVID, zk-nyms represent a privacy-enhanced alternative to current plans in Europe to build centralised identity databases that could be used to track and surveil ordinary&nbsp;people.</p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Candice Teo, <a href="mailto:candice@nymtech.net">candice@nymtech.net</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-unveils-zero-knowledge-anonymous-credentials-zk-nyms-at-sxsw-6d56bd31802a">Press Release: Nym unveils zero-knowledge anonymous credentials, zk-nyms, at SXSW</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Releases 5.3.3 and 5.4.2 harden zcashd code and remediate vulnerabilities inherited from Bitcoin Core that may have affected more than 280 chains,<a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/halborn-discovers-zero-day-impacting-dogecoin-and-280-networks"> according to blockchain security firm Halborn</a>.</p>



<p>We have no evidence that an exploit has occurred on the Zcash network, and these bugs do not compromise user privacy or impact Zcash supply. As always, if you notice any unusual activity in your node, please report it to security@z.cash.</p>



<p>All Zcash node operators on 5.3.1 or 5.3.2 should update to <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.3.3">5.3.3</a> immediately, and all Zcash node operators on 5.4.0 or 5.4.1 should update to <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.4.2">5.4.2</a> immediately. <a href="https://z.cash/download/">Prebuilt binaries and Debian packages</a> will be available in the next few hours.</p>



<p>The vulnerabilities, discovered by Halborn in a 2022 audit of Dogecoin, were first disclosed to ECC and contributors to other affected networks on Feb. 14, and more details were relayed in a Feb. 17 call. ECC initiated our security process immediately and began coordinating with ZecSec.com, the independent Zcash-community-funded security team, and with Zcash Foundation, who analyzed the impact on zebrad, its own implementation of a Zcash node. We also reached out to Horizen, Komodo, and other teams with whom we have disclosure agreements.</p>



<p>Within days, we had zcashd patches ready for third-party testing, but the public releases have been delayed to allow other projects time to complete their own remediations and to allow for coordinated comms, given the sensitive nature.</p>



<p>Halborn found that the bugs could allow an attacker to utilize peer-to-peer network messages to fill the memory of a node and crash it. By crashing other people’s mining nodes, an attacker could potentially reduce, by around one half, the amount of hashpower they would need to mount a 51% attack on the Zcash network. A successful 51% attack could potentially be used to execute a double-spend attack, which could result in users who received transactions from the attackers losing their funds. We have no reason to believe that the Zcash network is currently vulnerable to a 51% attack — with or without the “one half discount” on the attack cost — but out of an abundance of caution, we’ve hardened the zcashd nodes so that they cannot be crashed using this bug.</p>



<p>ECC has a record of fast, coordinated responses to incidents like this and is well-known for delivering safe and secure technology for Zcash users and other privacy-minded projects. For our latest news and product updates, please follow @electriccoinco on Twitter.</p>

 A giant leap toward a fully programmable encrypted zkRollup <p>Today we’re announcing the sunset of Aztec Connect, our privacy infrastructure that served as the encryption layer for Ethereum.</p><p>One week from today, deposits into the Aztec Connect contract both from <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> and other front-ends like <a href="https://zkpay.finance/">zkpay.finance</a> will be disabled.</p><p>Users will continue being able to withdraw with no fees for one&nbsp;year.</p><p>Our sequencer will slowly reduce the frequency of rollup blocks for withdrawal, with a final sunset date approximately one year from now: March 21st, 2024. Here are the critical&nbsp;dates:</p>  13th — 21st March: Aztec Connect normal functionality  21st March 2023 at 2PM UTC: Deposits&nbsp;disabled  One-year withdrawal window (March 13th, 2023 — March 21st,&nbsp;2024)  March 21st, 2024: Last Aztec rollup sent from Aztec sequencer  March 21st, 2024 onwards: users will have to run withdrawal software or rely on community-run sequencers  <blockquote>▶️ Head to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> today to begin withdrawing funds.<br>▶ View withdrawal instructions <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> What’s Next <p>As of March 21st, 2024–approximately one year from now–Aztec will no longer run a sequencer. That means the current system will no longer publish rollup blocks processing Aztec Connect transactions, contract permissions will be renounced, and all rollup functionality will be&nbsp;ceased.</p><p>At that point, withdrawals will be highly technical. While we remain optimistic that a community-operated sequencer will be functional, everyday users will have to rely on that infrastructure or run their own sequencers to withdraw.</p><p>Thus, while withdrawals will always be possible, they will become significantly more burdensome after March 21st, 2024. We therefore recommend users withdraw funds as soon as possible.</p><blockquote>▶️ Head to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> today to begin withdrawing funds.<br>▶ View withdrawal instructions <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> Open sourcing Aztec&nbsp;Connect <p>As of today, Aztec has fully open sourced the entire Aztec Connect protocol complete with scaling upgrades and a new secure&nbsp;SDK.</p><blockquote>▶️ See the open source Aztec Connect repo&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect">here</a>.</blockquote><p>We encourage the Aztec community to fork, deploy, and operate a new version of the system. We’d love to see an independently-operated Aztec Connect and are ready to fund it. Head to our open-source repo and docs to learn more about running an Aztec Connect&nbsp;fork.</p><p>The second wave of our grants program is coming up in April, and we look forward to funding community-run infrastructure then. In the meantime, keep in touch on our <a href="http://twitter.com/aztecnetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://discord.gg/aztec">Discord&nbsp;server</a>.</p> Aztec’s Vision <p>At Aztec, our goal has always been to develop a truly decentralized general-purpose encrypted zkRollup with the security of Ethereum.</p><p>While Ethereum has created a world computer that can read and write to public state, Aztec aims to fulfill the vision by adding the ability to read and write to private&nbsp;state.</p><p>In our mission to achieve that vision, we’ve taken a step-wise, incremental approach to the development of encrypted transactions on Ethereum.</p><p>The first attempt at on-chain privacy using a zkRollup was Aztec 1. Aztec 1 was slow, inefficient, costly, and limited in its functionality to basic private transfers.</p><p>Our latest effort was a set of privacy infrastructure and tools for Ethereum called Aztec Connect. It not only extended privacy functionality on Ethereum beyond simple payments and toward arbitrary smart contract interactions, it hinted at the cost savings that encrypted rollups are ultimately able to achieve through transaction batching.</p><p>Aztec Connect was a critical step in our mission to build a fully programmable encrypted zkRollup. Not only did it provide critical feedback, it proved to us the battle-worthiness of our sequencer and rollup contracts.</p><p>The immense research invested into Aztec Connect will be usable and indeed critical to the development of our next-gen product. Having an encrypted rollup live and in production gives us confidence in our shift to focusing on a fully programmable version.</p> The Future is&nbsp;Noir <p>As we move forward, our mid- and long-term focus will be solely directed towards the development of two major products, which are mutually compatible and interlinked:</p>  Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge  Our next-generation encrypted zkRollup  <p>Noir continues to gain new features by the day, with the Noir tooling team publishing regular releases. We are convinced Noir is the simplest, most powerful way to write programs in zero-knowledge.</p><blockquote>▶️ <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">Install Noir today</a> and go from 0 to programming in zkSNARKs in less than an&nbsp;hour.</blockquote><p>With additional resources at their disposal, the Noir team will only grow its functionality. Not only is Noir useful today as a generalized programming language for zk development — capable of using multiple proving backends and verifying to any EVM chain — a modified version of Noir will be the smart contract language for Aztec’s next-gen zkRollup.</p><p>Expect more Noir features and a full set of specifications for our newest zkRollup in the first half of 2023. To learn more about our next-gen system, check out our&nbsp;docs.</p><blockquote>Learn more about the next generation Aztec protocol&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec3">here</a>.</blockquote> Onward <p>The Aztec community has been a vital part of the development and success of Aztec Connect, and we are incredibly grateful for the 100,000+ users who have used Aztec Connect for private DeFi. It has long been obvious that privacy in a blockchain context is an absolute necessity, and Aztec Connect further validated that&nbsp;thesis.</p><p>It’s undeniable that Aztec Connect was an important stepping stone towards realizing our ultimate goal. It’s now time for us to focus fully on that goal: a decentralized general-use encrypted zkRollup.</p><p>To all our partners: thank you for betting on Aztec. We’re excited to bring you a fully-featured Noir and local devnet for our next-gen network by the end of 2023.&nbsp;Onward!</p> Frequently Asked Questions <p>Q: How do I withdraw&nbsp;funds?</p><blockquote>A: Navigate to <a href="https://zk.money">zk.money</a> or your preferred front-end. View withdrawal instructions for <a href="https://zk.money">zk.money</a> here: <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset</a></blockquote><p>Q: Is Aztec done building privacy products?</p><blockquote>A: Not even close. We’re laser-focused on building more Noir features and bringing you a programmably private L2 to be announced in the first half of&nbsp;2023.</blockquote><p>Q: Is Aztec shutting&nbsp;down?</p><blockquote>A: Nope. Our team has raised <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-raises-100-million-to-build-encrypted-ethereum-dd5062ba949c">over $125 million</a> from investors like a16z and Paradigm to bring encryption to blockchain. Our team is over 40 strong and we’re still hiring aggressively for open roles. <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec?gh_src=935e32f2teu">Join&nbsp;us</a>!</blockquote><p>Q: Is Aztec building an&nbsp;L1?</p><blockquote>A: No — we are utilizing the same rollup technology used in Aztec Connect in a new encrypted L2 powered by Noir, our universal zk language.</blockquote><p>Q: Why are you sunsetting Aztec&nbsp;Connect?</p><blockquote>A: We simply are not able to commit sufficient resources to simultaneously support Aztec Connect and the development of an encrypted zkRollup. Not only are we in the midst of inventing a groundbreaking new proving system, we are building a network with significantly higher complexity than Aztec&nbsp;Connect.</blockquote><p>Q: Are you sunsetting Aztec Connect due to regulatory pressures?</p><blockquote>A: No. We were under no regulatory pressure nor have we fielded any inquiries from law enforcement. Aztec Connect is and was compliant with UK law, given Aztec is a UK&nbsp;company.</blockquote><blockquote>We believe the practical enforcement measures we implemented <a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork/status/1560710567249096704">last August</a> have deterred illicit activity on the rollup without materially restricting users.</blockquote><blockquote>Rest assured our next-gen product will have higher programmability, more functionality, and the same or stronger privacy guarantees than Aztec&nbsp;Connect.</blockquote> Join the Aztec Community <p>We’re always on the lookout for talented engineers and applied cryptographers.

<p>Brave Firewall + VPN, powered by Guardian, is now available on desktop with the recent 1.49 version of the browser, completing Brave’s already available Android and iOS VPN offerings so users can benefit from full cross-platform protection.</p>
<p>The desktop VPN will be rolled out in various regions over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today. The desktop VPN also includes cross-device support, which enables users to connect five devices to one VPN subscription, regardless of platform.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 Affordable cross-device subscription 
<p>Today, almost everyone uses the Internet on more than one device (like your laptop at home, and your phone on the go). Brave’s new cross-device VPN subscription model lets you connect and protect five devices—across Android and iOS, macOS and Windows—to one subscription. Brave’s Firewall + VPN service is available for $9.99/month, or $99.99/year (annual plans for desktop purchases are coming soon). With five supported devices per account, you can protect each device for less than $2 a month.</p>
<p>The Brave browser blocks ads and trackers on every webpage, keeping you much safer while you browse; the Brave Firewall + VPN blocks trackers in every app on your phone, even outside the Brave browser.</p>

 Already using Brave Firewall + VPN on your mobile device? 
<p>If you already have a Brave Firewall + VPN subscription on your Android or iOS devices, visit the VPN section of the Brave browser settings. This will take you to <a href="https://account.brave.com/">account.brave.com</a>, where you can manage your subscription and automatically link more mobile or desktop devices.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 How to get started with Brave VPN on mobile or desktop 
<p>We’ve made the setup process for Brave Firewall + VPN as simple as possible. Don’t worry about downloading any extra apps; simply open the settings menu in the Brave browser on desktop or mobile, and toggle on VPN. You’ll then be taken to account.brave.com, where you can easily complete the setup.</p>
<p>Brave Firewall + VPN is the easiest way to protect all your devices—and all your apps—directly from the browser.</p>

 Brave-level protection, even outside the Brave browser 
<p>Brave browser puts your privacy first by blocking ads, trackers, cookies, scripts, and more while you browse the Web. Brave Firewall + VPN is a premium service that goes even further by enabling you to:</p>
 
 Mask your IP address 
 Change your location online 
 Prevent your ISP from snooping on your activity 
 Access your favorite content no matter where you are 
 Protect your Internet traffic on apps outside the Brave browser 
 
<p>Brave Firewall + VPN, powered by Guardian, extends all the protection you expect from Brave outside of the browser on Android, iOS, and macOS (and Windows, <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/11973307463181">with an added workaround</a>). That means giving you network-level protection against unwanted surveillance on the apps you use, across all your devices. Guardian is a leading Firewall + VPN technology platform that was recently acquired by DNSFilter.</p>
<p>Note that iOS and Android users can use our integrated <a>Privacy Hub</a> (a feature coming soon to desktop as well) to check exactly which trackers are blocked, including outside of Brave. The Privacy Hub highlights risky pages and trackers, and ties those trackers to the tech companies and publishers behind them, showing users how often sites try to invade their privacy.</p>

 Your privacy and anonymity guaranteed 
<p>When choosing a VPN, you’re trusting the provider with your data. Brave’s VPN service is powered by Guardian, stores no log files, and uses no cookies. We can’t store any of your connection or browsing data, because we don’t collect any of it in the first place.</p>
<p>We’ve also implemented an onboarding process that enables you to sign up for Brave Firewall + VPN using only an email address and payment information.</p>
<p>Once you sign up, you’re issued unlinkable daily tokens that validate your subscription when using the VPN. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of the VPN, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>

 Protect yourself from ISPs 
<p>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are the backbone of Internet connectivity; virtually all Internet traffic passes through them. This puts many of them (depending on their jurisdiction) in a position where they could easily collect and sell user data; in fact, various ISPs sell this data to advertising brokers to build a more comprehensive ad profile of the user. Because they have privileged access to user Internet traffic, they can even monitor your activity and slow down your Internet connection speeds as they see fit. But with Brave Firewall + VPN, you can easily mask your IP address and cloak your Internet activity, even from the prying eyes of ISPs.</p>

 More online freedom 
<p>While traveling abroad, you might find that your favorite sites or news outlets no longer work. That’s due to geo-restrictions that prevent certain sites and apps from being accessible from certain locations. With Brave Firewall + VPN, you can connect to the Web from local servers around the world, making it appear like that’s where your traffic is originating. This enables you to bypass geo-restrictions in the browser and access your favorite content no matter where you are.</p>

 Added firewall protection 
<p>A VPN is great for encrypting your internet traffic, but it can’t block harmful trackers and other online nuisances. That’s where a firewall comes in. Most standard, free, and even other premium VPNs don’t include a firewall—which serves as a secure barrier between your device and the Internet. It blocks unwanted trackers, harmful traffic, and other malicious things from ever reaching your phone, tablet, or computer.</p>
<p>How does it work? Brave’s built-in firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing flows of data based on a set of rules. So if an app is secretly broadcasting tracking data, Brave Firewall + VPN will detect and block the offending activity while still ensuring the app functions normally.</p>

 Try Brave Firewall + VPN today 
<p>Ready to protect your Internet traffic across all your devices? You can try Brave Firewall + VPN  with a free 7-day trial. To do so on your desktop device, open the Brave browser and click the new VPN icon in the browser address bar. Or, when using the Brave browser on your phone, go to the Settings menu, and toggle Brave Firewall + VPN to on. (If you don’t see this option, update to the latest version of Brave on your device.) It’s the safest, easiest way to protect yourself online, on every app, on every device.</p>

<p>With the upcoming launch of Polygon's zkEVM mainnet, L2s are undoubtedly a huge narrative that is unfolding in 2023. It is time to take a step back and recognise the incredible amount of effort that has gone into researching and building L2 scaling solutions in general and zk rollups in particular. Tech-wise, we barely scratched the surface of general purpose processors that can handle zk circuits, so there is still tremendous room to grow. As layer 2s become more efficient, so will the applications that are dependent on blockchain throughput.</p><p>We were joined by Jordi Baylina (tech lead) &amp; David Schwartz (CTO) from Polygon's zkEVM, to discuss the different milestones &amp; challenges they had to overcome in designing a zk rollup, from circuits to mainnet.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jordi’s &amp; David’s backgrounds  The idea behind Hermez Network  zkEVM scaling &amp; validity proofs  How different ZK rollup models function  What challenges zkEVM encountered during development  Evolutionary pathways in the realm of ZKPs  Auditing zkEVM  Trusted setup requirement for zkEVM  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jbaylina">Jordi Baylina on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsrz">David Schwartz on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonZK">Polygon zkEVM on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

 The rise of decentralised finance (DeFi) has made Ethereum the go-to platform for building decentralised applications (dApps). One of the most popular stablecoins used in DeFi is USDC (USD Coin), a faster, safer, and more efficient way to send, spend, and exchange money around the globe. It powers apps to provide anytime access to payments and financial services.

  Brave Wallet on desktop now allows users to sell crypto for fiat with expanded Ramp integration.

<p>Starting today, Brave Wallet users in select countries will see a new option to sell crypto into fiat currencies, including US dollars, euros, and pound sterling.</p>
<p>In May 2022, Brave <a>announced</a> a partnership with <a href="https://ramp.network/">Ramp</a> that enabled Brave Wallet users to buy crypto with fiat currency—or “on-ramp”—in Brave Wallet, the Web3 wallet natively-integrated into the Brave browser.</p>
<p>This week, with v1.49 of the desktop browser, we’re delighted to announce the expansion of that partnership: Brave Wallet users can now sell crypto for fiat—or “off-ramp”—with Ramp as well. Users now have the option to both move in and out of crypto entirely through their self-custody wallet, rather than through centralized exchanges that hold custody of users’ assets. With Ramp’s on- and off-ramping services integrated into Brave Wallet, users no longer need to relinquish ownership of their crypto to transact.</p>
<p>After recent events where centralized exchanges mishandled customer funds, it’s more important than ever to offer secure and easy-to-manage self-custody. Before the creation of Bitcoin and the ensuing emergence of Web3 technologies, self-custody wasn’t a common word in most people’s vocabulary. While self-custody has grown in popularity over the past decade, the most common way to hold digital currency and tokens remains with centralized exchanges. We expect to see that shift with innovations in user-experience, like the one we are releasing today.</p>
<p>Off-ramp is available for over <a href="https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/432-what-cryptoassets-does-ramp-support#h_04e4875f6a">38 currencies</a> including Solana, Ethereum, USDC and BAT. For a running list of supported payout methods, see <a href="https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/8992-what-payout-methods-does-ramp-support-for-selling-crypto">their support page.</a></p>

 Using Ramp to sell crypto in Brave Wallet 


    
    

    


    


    
    

 
 
<p>Open the expanded Brave Wallet screen in Brave. This can be done either by clicking the wallet icon in the top right of your browser, or by visiting brave://wallet in the URL bar.</p>
 
 
<p>From the main portfolio page, click the asset you want to sell.</p>
 
 
<p>If the asset is available to off-ramp, you’ll see a Sell button among the list of accounts that hold that asset.</p>
 
 
<p>Click Sell and enter the amount you wish to off-ramp.</p>
 
 
<p>Click Sell with Ramp once you’re ready, and proceed to Ramp’s site to complete the process.</p>

 The humble beginning <p>At Privy, we are building the simplest way to onboard all your users to web3, whether they are new to the space or tried-and-true experts. This means building a library that enables developers to <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3s-coming-of-age-c588af57c94d">meet users where they are</a>, and cater to diverse audiences whose product experiences grow with their engagement.</p><p>Privy’s <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3-for-users-not-experts-52c692c25bb1">embedded wallets</a> allow applications to create fully-functional Ethereum wallets on-demand without requiring users to leave the app. With this feature in place, we believe we are about to unlock a significant UX boost for the Web3 ecosystem!</p><p>The space itself is abuzz with changes that will profoundly shape UX, as threshold-based multi party computation matures, and smart contract wallet architectures (often called “account abstraction”) are standardized. While we are extremely excited about these evolutions and are working with partners to bring them into our own product, our core focus is enabling developers to build meaningful end-to-end solutions from day 1. To that end, we wanted this post to share some technical details on how embedded wallets got their&nbsp;start.</p> In the beginning, there was&nbsp;entropy <p>A wallet is born when 128 bits of entropy are chosen randomly by a CSPRNG. These bits are converted to a mnemonic via <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">BIP-39</a> which is used to derive the user’s wallet key&nbsp;pair.</p><p>While wallet software is many things, the entirety of the wallet can be reduced to these 128&nbsp;bits.</p><p>The choices are 128, 160, 192, 224, or 256 bits. These map to 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 word mnemonics. 128 was chosen for its simplicity. This will be configurable by integrating applications.</p> Sharing is&nbsp;caring <p>It’s critical the entropy (henceforth referred to as the mnemonic) is secured and only accessible by the end-user it belongs&nbsp;to.</p><p>Privy’s embedded wallets achieve this by deploying a Shamir Secret Sharing scheme where the mnemonic is split into N shares and can be recovered using M of N shares. In our implementation, three total shares are allocated, with two belonging to the end-user and one secured by Privy. This has two core advantages: Privy alone cannot reconstruct the mnemonic and access user keys, and the user can always access their keys without needing to go through&nbsp;Privy.</p> We value our&nbsp;clients <p>To protect users and remain non-custodial, mnemonics and other plaintext key material are never transmitted over networks or exposed to servers. Everything happens on the end-user’s device. Wallets are created on the end-user’s device. Shares are reconstructed on the end-user’s device. Requests are serviced on — you get&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thus, clients are responsible for protecting the user’s wallet. While the UI remains under control of integrating applications, we leverage headless iframes to create a sandboxed environment where keys can safely be used to service requests sent to the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Compatibility is&nbsp;key <p>We value interoperability and choice. Users must be able to take their wallet keys with them in the event they no longer wish to use&nbsp;Privy.</p><p>Like all modern wallets, embedded wallets are <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets</a> and adhere to the multi-account hierarchy specified in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">BIP-44</a>. This ensures compatibility across existing wallet software and thus enables users to switch clients at any time with the click of a&nbsp;button.</p> User experience is paramount <p>Private keys and mnemonics are not particularly human-friendly, especially for non-technical users. Therefore, it is imperative that Privy shield users from the technical underpinnings. To the extent possible, Privy creates a Web2-like experience with features your every day user would expect. Examples include social logins, cross-device support, and simple account recovery.</p><p>One feature to highlight here is enabling developers to craft human-readable messages for their users. This enables signature and transaction requests to be on-brand and contextually relevant.</p> Looking ahead <p>Enabling users to come in with their existing wallet, or create one on the fly for app usage unlocks new possibilities in web3. Building for diverse audiences is essential to driving web3 forward all while maintaining that which makes the space exciting: ownership, interoperability and composability of data and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>We believe embedded wallets are going to be huge. Even though we’re just getting started, we’re excited about various improvements across the UX, DX, and the overall security of these wallets. If this sounds like a feature that would give your app a boost, <a href="https://50fzxaracbi.typeform.com/to/v5gtHb74?typeform-source=www.console.privy.io">we’d love to help get you&nbsp;started</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/embedded-wallets-a-birds-eye-view-85557184bfb6">Embedded Wallets: A bird’s eye view</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

    <p>Horizen EON is our first public proof-of-stake sidechain and a fully EVM-compatible smart contracting platform that allows developers to efficiently build and deploy dapps on Horizen, while fully benefiting from the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p>In this step by step guide below, we will walk you through the process of creating an ERC-20 Token on Yuma Testnet – a temporary public testing environment for EON.&nbsp;</p>
 Tools used in this tutorial 
 
 <a href="https://matamask.io">MetaMask</a> 
 <a href="https://yuma-testnet-faucet.horizen.io/">Yuma test token faucet</a> 
 <a href="https://chainlist.org/?search=yuma&amp;testnets=true">Chainlist</a> 
 <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard">Open Zeppelin</a> 
 <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Remix</a> 
 <a href="https://yuma-explorer.horizen.io/">Yuma block explorer</a> 
 
<p>We assume you already have MetaMask installed on your browser for this tutorial. If you do not, you can <a href="https://metamask.io/download/">download MetaMask here.&nbsp;</a></p>
 STEP 1: Connect Yuma Testnet to MetaMask&nbsp; 
<p>You can easily<a href="https://chainlist.org/?search=yuma&amp;testnets=true"> connect Yuma Testnet to MetaMask through Chainlist.</a> Follow the instructions on the screen,&nbsp;Yuma Testnet should appear on your MetaMask:</p>
<p></p>
 STEP 2: Claim test token – TZEN 
<p>You’ll need TZEN as transaction fees to send your newly created tokens. You can get TZEN from the <a href="https://yuma-testnet-faucet.horizen.io/">Yuma test token faucet</a>. Copy and paste your Metamask address in the “Wallet Address” field on the faucet.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 STEP 3: Create your code on Open Zeppelin and create a new contract on Remix 
<p>Now we are ready to create your ERC-20 token! To do so, a simple way is via the <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard">Open Zeppelin wizard</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we are going to create a Javier Token in honor of our team member Manon’s #ZenCat Javier. Here is him supervising Manon.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Select the “ERC-20” tab&nbsp; 
 Complete the following fields:
 
 Name: think of a cool name for your token 
 Symbol: your token symbol 
 Premint: The amount of token you want to create 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 When you are done, click on “Open in Remix” and it will lead you to the Remix webpage 
 Rename your file according to the name of your token/ smart-contract 
 
<p></p>
 STEP 4: Deploy your smart contract on Yuma Testnet 
<p>To deploy on the Yuma testnet, first, make sure Yuma testnet is selected and connected on MetaMask</p>
 
 On Remix, go to “Deploy and run transactions” by clicking the Ethereum icon on the left&nbsp; 
 Select “Injected Provider – MetaMask”&nbsp; 
 Be sure that the address here matches your MetaMask address in the “ACCOUNT” field 
 
<p></p>
<p>Go on the Compiler and make sure that the “Enable Optimization” is checked</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-5.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Go back to “Deploy &amp; run transactions” and click “Compile” (The green play icon)<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-6.jpg"></a> 
 Click on “Deploy”  
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-7.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Click on “Confirm” on MetaMask 
 
<p></p>
 STEP 6: Verify your smart contract on the Yuma block explorer 
 
 On Remix, your contract should appear on the left. Click on “Copy” 
 
<p></p>
 
 Import your token on MetaMask
 
 Click on “import a token” 
 Paste the contract address 
 Click on “Add a custom token” 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 Go on the Yuma Explorer <a href="https://yuma-explorer.horizen.io/">https://yuma-explorer.horizen.io/</a> 
 Paste on the search bar and press “Enter” 
 Your contract should appear&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-11.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-12.jpg"></a></p>
 STEP 7: Flatten and publish 
 
 On Remix, go back in “File Explorer” 
 Use the right-click and select “flatten” 
 Click on the flattened contract 
 Copy the data on the right, you can select all with “Crtl+A” 
 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.05-AM-1.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Go back on the Yuma Explorer at your contract address and click on “Code” then on “Verify and Publish” 
 Select “Via flattened source code”, then click on “Next” 
 Make sure to have the same data on the Solidity Compiler, and the data that appears on the Yuma block explorer and paste the code on “Enter the Solidity Contract Code” 
 Make sure to enter the “Contract Name”. Here “Javier Token” 
 Click on Verify and Publish. Your code is now verified!&nbsp; 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.05-AM-2.jpg"></a></p>
<p></p>
 STEP 8: Send tokens 
 
 Go on MetaMask, to your newly created token, and click on “send” 
 Enter the address where you want to send your tokens to&nbsp; 
 Enter the amount and click on “Next” 
 Click on “Confirm” 
 The tokens are sent, and you can view them on the Yuma explorer! 
 
<p>The recipient may have to import your token in MetaMask. To do so, he must click on “import a token” and then paste the token contract address available on the Yuma explorer. (You can also send him the token contract address, the one you used to import the token on your MetaMask at the beginning of the tutorial)</p>

  Arc Founders on the Problems that Drive Them  <p>Four founders in the Spring ‘23 cohort of Arc, Sequoia’s pre-seed and seed-stage catalyst, share the ideas that brought us together.
</p>  <p>By Team Sequoia</p><p>Published March 9, 2023</p>  



 
<p>This week, we welcome a new cohort of 10 companies to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>—including one second-time applicant. These companies, the majority of which are in stealth, span a variety of industries including health tech, fintech, crypto, AI and more. We asked a few of the founders to share their thoughts on the problems they’re solving, and what drives them and their teams.</p>



 



<p>What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important?</p>



<p>Devin Bhushan, <a href="https://www.squint.ai/">Squint</a>: In industries like manufacturing, a lot of training is done one-on-one or with outdated manuals—people have to navigate multiple sources of information just to get the job done. It’s a slow and frustrating process, and it can undermine productivity and safety. Squint is a mobile app that uses computer vision techniques and augmented reality to help workers quickly map machines and complex processes, to create seamless guides that show the right thing at the right time.</p>



<p>Colin Dunn, <a href="http://visualelectric.ai">Visual Electric</a>: We created Visual Electric because we wanted to make design more accessible by giving people better-designed tools. Artists and designers still get a familiar, moodboard-like environment—but it’s powered by AI, so they can combine inspiration images with text prompts for tasks like “landing page” or “brand.” From there, they can remix and refine to create new concepts.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessechor/">Jesse Chor</a>, Tanda: People who are early in their financial security journey may not have access to—or trust in—traditional banking. They need tools to help them save money, build credit and grow their community. Tanda is a social savings app based on the concept of ROSCA, or Rotating Savings and Credit Association, which is popular around the world. Group members deposit money every few weeks, then each person takes a turn to withdraw—and the ones who go last are rewarded with interest.</p>



<p>Mayank Kishore, <a href="https://www.mirageml.com/">Mirage</a>: Right now, creating in 3D is time-consuming and takes years of experience and specialized training. It’s a very steep learning curve. Mirage uses generative AI to democratize 3D. It allows you to enter prompts to search assets, generate models, add VFX—so you can build an environment in minutes, with no complex software. It’s a resource for game designers, but also concept artists, product marketers, interior designers, VFX artists. We want to make 3D accessible to everyone.</p>



<p>Why now? What has changed—or is changing—about the world that makes this the right time to take this on?</p>



<p>Mayank, Mirage: We’ve seen with diffusion models how AI can aid in the creative process. But it’s still a challenge for designers and other creators to retain sufficient control when they’re using these tools. By redesigning the 3D canvas from the ground up, Mirage gives individuals the control they need over their AI-assisted creations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jesse, Tanda: Access to savings and credit is an ongoing problem, but the recent financial slowdown put a spotlight on it and exponentially increased the need and opportunity for a product like Tanda. In the U.S. alone, close to 20% of adults are either unbanked or underbanked.</p>



<p>Colin, Visual Electric: Generative AI is a paradigm shift in the way we create, and we believe that presents an opportunity to build a new class of design tool—where you are the art director instead of the designer. Visual Electric has the potential to accelerate the work of existing designers, but also to expand the market and empower others to create work of their own.</p>



<p>Devin, Squint: Over the last several years, mobile devices and AI have improved to a point that allows for a product like Squint. In manufacturing, experienced operators are retiring and complex new machines are constantly being introduced, so the need for more intuitive digital tools has never been greater. But we also believe Squint can have applications beyond the factory floor. AR is going to fundamentally change how we interact with information, and it can help all of us spend less time hunting down the knowledge we need.</p>



<p>Why you? What compels you to work on this problem?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jesse, Tanda: I’ve built Tanda before, at Yahoo, and it worked amazingly well. It was killed as part of an acquisition, but in the five years since I’ve been thinking about it non-stop. I always said that if I ever did another startup I would bring it back, better than before.</p>



<p>Colin, Visual Electric: We are our own customers. Visual Electric is built for designers, by designers—along with engineers and ML experts who are passionate about creative tools. We’ve all been thinking about this problem for a long time—working in design at Dropbox, Facebook, and Apple, among other companies, and for my co-founders Adam and Zach, in their previous experience as founders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Devin, Squint: I’ve been working in AR since the early days of ARKit on the iPhone, and I believe it is the future of how we’ll consume content. I have also seen firsthand how clunky user experiences and high barriers to entry can hold back products from breaking through in this space. That’s why it’s so important to me to make Squint simple and seamless.</p>



<p>Mayank, Mirage: My co-founders, Aman and Sree, and I have worked together on 3D software for years—including at NVIDIA, where we developed infrastructure and AI algorithms for autonomous vehicles. We saw how progress could bottleneck because it was so difficult to create environments quickly enough. So we started Mirage to enable anyone to unleash their creativity by replacing complex design software with AI-augmented tools.</p>

<p>Today, all of us at Web3auth moved a step closer to realising our mission of passing the identity ownership back to the individuals and users. We partnered with FOX -owned Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) to provide a seamless Web3 user onboarding experience for The Masked Singer Experience.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1626028978220990464">https://twitter.com/i/status/1626028978220990464</a></p><p>A typical web3 wallet’s user onboarding experience involves setting up a seed phrase for authentication, which is a complex and tedious task. It takes the user anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes. This timeframe has churn written all over it, and it is quite significant in web3 user adoption standards.</p><p>But this has been the standard practice over the years. After we launched Web3Auth and had numerous customers using our wallet infrastructure, several consumer-focused applications have seen a 3x increase in conversion rates, from 24% to about 63%, as opposed to conventional seed phrase wallet solutions.</p><p>In a significant paradigm shift that we have been able to enable today, we joined forces with FOX Entertainment-owned Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) to offer the most seamless onboarding experience possible for the fans of The Masked Singer Experience. This digital fan community is an evolution of the singing competition The Masked Singer — television #1 unscripted series.</p><p>With this partnership, Web3Auth will allow the fan community to connect to The Masked Singer Experience seamlessly, by logging in to the experience and setting up a web3 wallet directly via email, social and Google accounts instead of having to use the conventional seed phrase-enabled wallets. After this collaboration with us, users will need only less than a minute to set up their wallet accounts.</p><p>We decided to give this renewed onboarding journey a special&nbsp;name.</p><p>Two-Factor Wallets&nbsp;(2FW)</p><p>Users can set up a 2FW via 2FA flows — including social logins, phone, laptops, or even biometrics which would take less than a minute. The 2FW also significantly enhances wallet security — if one factor is damaged, users can still recover the wallet using the other&nbsp;factors.</p><p>Our Co-founder and CEO Zhen Yu Yong recommends three key factors for web2 businesses to consider for a successful web3 project&nbsp;launch:</p>  intuitive user experience  familiar user&nbsp;journey  security  <p>He believes that intuitive user experience and accessibility are paramount to allow the show’s fans and crypto enthusiasts to enjoy the reimagined Masker Singer NFT experience.</p><p>But the partnership only makes more sense for Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL). It empowers creators to build their communities through web3-centered fandom experiences that allow people to interact with content in new ways, ultimately reshaping the entertainment industry as we know it by infusing it with a new sense of freedom, access and control. BCL believes the future of the entertainment industry lies within Web3, which will help democratize access to Hollywood, strengthen the bond between creators and their communities and pave new avenues for creativity, innovation and&nbsp;success.</p><p>Today, we have been able to scale Web3Auth to a place where we have already onboarded over 500 web2 and web3 applications and wallets. Today, we are able to clock over 12 million user keys a month, which is an exponential growth from that of last year. But this is only scratching the surface. Having said that, our larger goal is to provide users with Two-Factor Wallets that are secure and seamless.</p><p>“We are all set to partner with larger enterprises within entertainment, gaming and blockchain industries. We want to close the gap between Web2 and&nbsp;Web3.”</p><p>~ Zhen Yu Yong, Co-founder and CEO, Web3Auth.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/how-web3auths-two-factor-wallet-infra-empowered-the-masked-singer-experience-onboarding-experience-83c3498675">How Web3Auth’s Two-Factor Wallet infra empowered The Masked Singer Experience onboarding experience</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Web3Auth Self-host SDK is now Core&nbsp;Kit <p>Simplification in access — a core principle our entire team at Web3Auth consistently strives for. It has been a significant part of our engineering culture. Today, we move a step closer towards our mission to simplify Web3 wallet infrastructure for everyone.</p> Our Self-host SDK is now Core&nbsp;Kit <p>We decided to do a little rebranding to our Self-host SDK, and call it Core Kit. Because it is the core infrastructure that resides underneath all of our products. Simple and&nbsp;easy.</p><p>Of course, there are reasons why we chose to change the&nbsp;name.</p>  The very term self-host could possibly imply that our customers had to do a lot of heavy-lifting.  It could have been very easily interpreted with our Plug &amp; Play&nbsp;SDK.  <p>Here is a little context pertaining to the underlying technological architecture in our two flagship SDKs — Core Kit (previously Self-host) and Plug &amp;&nbsp;Play.</p><p>These SDKs are built on top of an underlying SDK called tKey, which stands for Threshold Key. The <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/tkey/">tKey SDK</a> manages private keys by generating shares using Shamir Secret Sharing, a threshold cryptographic algorithm technique. The image below shows how the tKey SDK architecture plays out in a virtual environment.</p>Web3Auth’s tKey SDK architecture<p>Now when it came to Self-host as a term, ‘hosting by the self’ was a possible misinterpretation we did not want our customers to take away from&nbsp;it.</p>  Self-host offered a bundled package of core components or UI-less SDKs to help a customer customize their desired user interface (UI) to further generate and manage their shares. This implies only one thing — it empowers you to retain your own brand’s user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)&nbsp;flow.  On the other hand, the core purpose of our Plug &amp; Play SDK was to offer a standardized and default user interface (UI) and a user experience (UX) flow from Web3Auth — so that our customers could seamlessly generate and manage their desired number of&nbsp;shares.  <p>By definition, this particular SDK is supposed to be a set of tools that would help you build an authentication engine for your platform — essentially, a non-custodial wallet. But the problem is that our Plug &amp; Play SDK also has a similar purpose, but the only differentiation is that — it allows no room to customize any&nbsp;shares.</p><p>The change of name to Core Kit also refers to exactly what our SDKs offer — a bundled package of UI-less SDKs (or core components) to help you gain better access and control over the user experience (UX) flows, while retaining your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Here is what the Core Kit&nbsp;entails:</p>  tKey JS SDK, which works on web and react&nbsp;native.  A web-based Single Factor Auth&nbsp;SDK.  A NodeJS Server SDK hosted on the backend nodejs&nbsp;server.  <blockquote>“Owing to this potential misinterpretation, we wanted to take this space and opportunity to explain why we decided to do this rebranding.”</blockquote><p>As we move forward, we are soon going to launch the tKey Android iOS SDKs over the coming few months. Besides, we are also going to launch an aggregator SDK for all of the Core Kit in Web, to allow for better ease of integration.</p><p>If you are an enterprise looking to add a powerful web3 component to your existing systems, look no further — Core Kit is&nbsp;here!</p><p>Furthermore, below is a summary of all the other product updates we&nbsp;have:</p> A revamped Plug &amp; Play&nbsp;SDK <p>Our Plug &amp; Play suite now has all UI SDKs, giving you quick and easy access to our platform.</p><p>Here is what the suit includes:</p>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/modal/">Web Modal&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/no-modal/">Web No Modal&nbsp;SDK</a>  an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/android/">Android SDK</a>, an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/ios/">iOS&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/react-native/">React Native&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/flutter/">Flutter&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/unity/">Unity&nbsp;SDK</a>  a Unreal SDK is out, documentation will be launched&nbsp;soon   Updated documentation <p>All of our documentation has been revamped with a new <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/quick-start">quick start</a>, and general flows to highlight our products and integration better.</p><p>Check them out&nbsp;<a href="https://web3auth.io/docs">here</a>.</p> We’re on Discourse, our newest community portal! <p>We have now fully migrated from GitHub Discussions to a brand new community forum on Discourse to enable a superior community support experience, better search capabilities, more accurate suggestions, and quicker responses.</p><p>Join our community forum&nbsp;<a href="https://community.web3auth.io/">here</a>.</p><p>Over the last 4 years, our team at Web3Auth has been able to onboard over 500 applications and wallets across Web2 and Web3. Today, we manage more than 12 million user keys a month, a growth that is significant and exponential from that of our previous&nbsp;years.</p><p>Traditional wallet authentication methods such as seed-phrases, are difficult to remember and are vulnerable to phishing attacks. We have been working hard the last 4 years on various key management technologies and we believe we have been instrumental in pioneering this paradigm shift in the industry, especially after having launched our <a href="https://web3auth.io/mpc.html">Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</a> technology.</p><p>But this is only the beginning. As we continue this journey to achieve our audacious mission, which is to make digital ownership human-centric and accessible to everyone, we want to thank you for being a part of our thriving community and for your support in helping us build this wallet infrastructure for&nbsp;all.</p><p>We’d love for you to try out Core Kit, the Plug &amp; Play SDKs, and join us in the product conversations on <a href="https://community.web3auth.io/">Discourse</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/important-product-updates-web3auth-self-host-and-plug-and-play-590bdf414ef6">Important Product Updates — Web3Auth Self Host and Plug and Play</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is to clarify our response to a detailed internal investigation into a claimed vulnerability attack on Web3 Magic&nbsp;Links.</p><p>Today, we want to take this opportunity to address a claimed vulnerability on Magic Links in Web3 highlighted by DFNS.co. Read more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/24/crypto-wallet-firm-dfns-says-magic-links-have-critical-vulnerability/">here</a>.</p><p>The disclosure describes a phishing attack on passwordless Magic Links, that affects Web2 applications but was aimed specifically toward Web3 applications.</p><p>A short summary of the incident with the timelines:</p>  This phishing method was disclosed to us privately on Thursday, 23rd February 2023, over a voice&nbsp;call.  Between 23rd and 25th February, upon discovery of the phishing attack, the Web3Auth team launched a detailed investigation into potentially affected users and their accounts.  In conclusion, the investigation found no cases of existing users being affected by this&nbsp;attack.  A verification challenge and stricter IP policies were implemented to prevent future phishing attempts on Monday, 27th February, 2023.  <p>A brief overview of the phishing&nbsp;attack:</p><p>When a user wants to sign up and log in to any user account on the internet, the conventional flow is that he or she would get a verification email with a link to confirm and verify the email address. Upon verification, the user would now be able to access the dashboard or the user&nbsp;account.</p><p>But in this case, which happens to be a phishing attack, a malicious third party comes into play. It triggers a login request, because of which it sends out a passwordless web3 Magic Link to the user’s email. The link could possibly have a call-to-action button that prompts the user to log in. When the user clicks on it, the malicious third party would now be able to log in on behalf of the user, but the user is kept in the dark about the consequences until the account is accessed or&nbsp;altered.</p><p>This was how the claimed vulnerability attack unfolded, which turned out to be a well-known phishing&nbsp;attack.</p><p>Upon intimation of the issue on 23rd Feb 2023, Web3Auth conducted a detailed investigation into potential scenarios under which the issue might have occurred.</p><p>The investigation found that there were no such cases of this vulnerability found with respect to our existing user accounts. Our current policies that are already in place, display the origination of login requests as well as open channels for support, for identified malicious requests. These shall effectively prepare us for similar malicious incidents where the user did not activate the request in the first place. Rest assured, we continue to conduct our business and everyday operations while our users have absolutely nothing to worry&nbsp;about.</p><p>Our future commitment</p><p>However, this gave us an opportunity to further tighten our existing security measures. As part of some immediate remedial actions, we have proactively added additional security policies to identify potential and existing phishing attacks. This included matching and verification of a numeric login code to identify false requests, along with more stringent IP blocking, if the attack originated from different locations.</p><p>To ensure that we handle similar issues in a timely and effective manner, we have developed a Security SOP. Further, if you happen to discover any issues with our product, please email us at security@web3auth.io. Our team shall quickly review your submission and respond within 72 hours. While submitting these issues, kindly provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, the potential impact, and any additional information that may be&nbsp;helpful.</p><p>Feel free to refer to our <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/contribute/bug-bounty">bug bounty program</a> as&nbsp;well.</p><p>As part of our commitment to platform security, we will acknowledge your submission and keep you informed of our progress in addressing the vulnerabilities. We would also publicly recognize your contribution, with your permission, in our security hall of&nbsp;fame.</p><p>We take the security of our platform very seriously. We acknowledge your support and extend our gratitude for joining us in our mission to improve the security of Web3Auth and Web3 as an entirety.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auths-statement-on-the-recent-magic-link-phishing-attack-afd7f46566cf">Web3Auth’s statement on the recent Magic Link phishing attack</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Account Abstraction has been all the rage in recent months. But with all the different specifications, implementations, jargon and use cases it entails, it is very easy to be buried in the weeds. For those looking for an easily pluggable AA SDK, look no&nbsp;further.</p><p>Today, Safe Global (previously Gnosis.safe) <a href="https://safe.global/core">announced</a> the Safe{Core} SDK, in partnership with Web3Auth in making Account Abstraction an end-to-end and production-ready experience.</p><p>Here is a snapshot of what the core SDK entails for developers:</p><p>The company (Safe) reports that its custody infrastructure has been closely audited and tested over the last 5 years, and that it is now able to secure $39 billion in assets&nbsp;today.</p><p>With Web3Auth, this SDK enables mainstream users to enjoy the benefits of an experience they’re already familiar with. Social logins to Two-Factor wallets that leverage the security of their devices as well. Here is where we echo a similar philosophy and align with Safe on the&nbsp;same.</p><p>”Today, there is a binary choice for users. They can either completely give up ownership of their assets to a custodian and play in a walled garden, or bear the full responsibility of protecting their assets and scrutinizing every transaction. Small everyday burdens of gas fees, seed phrases, jumping wallets, and switching networks to do simple transactions have made web3 unusable by the&nbsp;masses.</p><p>We need to do&nbsp;better.”</p><p>As for developers, if you want to understand more and build on top of the Account Abstraction experience, join us in a month-long global AA Hackathon. The march for this hackathon starts today, with bounties worth $50,000.

 Web3Auth vs Magic — How to choose your Key Management Solution  Authentication is one of the most important components of any application and as the Web3 movement grows, wallet &amp; private key management becomes its most critical aspect. The right to own your own key and the right to own your own identity.  For any dApps, the fundamental question is — how are you managing your users’ wallet? Keeping in mind this critical question, we are comparing two of the leaders in the wallet management space, Web3Auth and&nbsp;Magic. <p>Before we deep dive into the technical details and comparison, let’s understand what these solutions are trying to achieve. Both Web3Auth and Magic replace seed phrases with intuitive one-click logins making onboarding into web3 seamless while giving control to the application to manage their&nbsp;flows.</p><p>Further to that, the infrastructure and usage of both the platforms is very different and needs a deeper understanding. For this, we will be comparing the two platforms on the following aspects:</p>  Wallet Management: How the users’ private keys are managed and held&nbsp;safe?  Authentications Options: How many types of authentication and 2FA methods are supported?  Multichain Support: How many blockchains are supported and utilised?  White Labelling and Customisation: How much control the developer has on the UX&nbsp;flows?  Scalability: How the platforms perform for applications at&nbsp;scale.  Ease of integration: How easy it is to implement a basic instance of the platform.  Open Source &amp; Native platforms support: How much code is publicly available and audited? How many platforms are supported?  Web3Auth vs&nbsp;Magic Differences in Wallet Management Infrastructure <p>According to the Magic’s <a href="https://magic-whitepaper-key-based-authentication-system.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Magic+Whitepaper.pdf">Whitepaper</a>,</p><blockquote>“Magic’s Delegated Key Management leverages Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) provided by Amazon Web Services’ Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Dedicated user master keys generated using AES-256 with 384-bits of entropy are stored on the HSMs. The master keys never leave the hardware as they are meant to be locked inside and unable to be exported. All encryption and decryption operations happen inside the hardware modules themselves. HSMs are a lot like popular 7 FIDO devices like YubiKeys or hardware-based wallets for cryptocurrency storage such as Trezor or Ledger, but instead of traditional harddrive storage, they sit in the cloud, secured by AWS’s data&nbsp;centers.</blockquote><blockquote>Users’ private keys are encrypted by these hardware-based user master keys, which means that attackers need to gain access to the hardware to be able to retrieve the keys, and are forced to stay within Magic’s adversarial infrastructure — which is capable to detect, impede, and monitor attacker’s progress to prevent and mitigate any damages.”</blockquote><p>Hence, we can see that Magic depends on Amazon Web Service’s (AWS) Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for their key encryption. The users’ private keys are encrypted by these hardware-based user master keys and stored separately in a multi-region MySQL database.. This approach is good in terms of speed and availability, however has a major flaw, wherein the entire private key sits encrypted on the cloud secured by AWS KMS which can be a single point of failure. Hence, we can regard their solution as a semi-custodial system.</p><p>Web3Auth is a<a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-is-here-9387d570990b"> fully non custodial MPC (Multi Party Computation) solution</a> where the user keys are distributed across a network of nodes owned by the top firms in the crypto industry and the user’s own devices. This is enabled by an on chain node network distributed key generation followed by an off chain multi-sig. The key is never fully owned by anyone and only the user has the access to it via their own authentication methods. While making a blockchain transaction, the key is never reconstructed or stored anywhere, rather a series of partial signatures are done across the network and user devices and the final signature is generated for the transaction.</p><p>This infrastructure can be used across the world with node availability throughout the world with industry leading speeds and a surety that user keys are never owned by a single entity&nbsp;anytime.</p><p>You can read more about Web3Auth’s <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/overview/key-management/">Wallet Management Infrastructure</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-is-here-9387d570990b">New MPC Solution</a>.</p> Authentications Options <p>One of key features of Web3Auth and Magic is the support of any social, federated identity ( Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, etc.) and custom JWT auth providers. This allows developers to integrate any kind of login method, provided they are using JWT ID Token for user registration.</p><p>In addition to this, Two Factor Authentication is a key aspect of keeping your accounts secure. Magic supports 2FA with mobile operators like Authy and Google Authenticator and/or SMS authentication giving you the traditional experience of&nbsp;2FA.</p><p>Web3Auth introduces a new layer of security here with the introduction of Two Factor Wallets. Web3Auth actually uses its off chain multi sig to distribute keys into multiple devices and or SMS/ other authentication methods. This enables you to get a true decentralised 2FA setup where your keys are secured even if one of the authentication methods is compromised.</p> Multichain Support <p>Web3Auth’s SDKs are chain agnostic, ie. they can be used on any blockchain. Today there are thousands of dApps built on numerous blockchains that have integrated Web3Auth. On the other hand, Magic supports 20+ popular blockchains.</p> White Labelling and Customisation <p>Web3Auth allows applications and wallets to fully customise and whitelabel the solution. Using the various options of integration available, you can even make Web3Auth totally invisible in the user flow focusing totally on your application end to end. Magic does provide a range of customisation options, but it is limited as compared to Web3Auth.</p> Scalability <p>Both the solutions do very well in terms of scalability of users and availability across multiple regions. Being hosted on AWS HSMs, Magic is available worldwide within their servers. These servers are owned by&nbsp;Amazon.</p><p>Web3Auth’s network of nodes are hosted worldwide and by trusted industry leaders like Polygon, Binance, Tendermint, ENS, Etherscan etc. Additionally, with the new Sapphire network of Web3Auth, applications can choose to run their own nodes in addition to the nodes available publicly giving them flexibility and control over their user scalability.</p> Ease of Integration <p>A basic integration of both the platforms is quite easy and straightforward. With Web3Auth a basic of the Plug and Play SDKs requires just <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/quick-start">4 basic steps</a> and with excellent documentation and examples guiding you throughout the journey of building your own customised solution. A basic integration takes less than 15 mins of work and no extra customisation is required for being production ready. You also have the flexibility to migrate to a more advanced integration with our range of SDKs available for different use cases and platforms. We also have an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/integration-builder">integration builder</a> which, according to your requirements, shapes up a ready to use code that can be directly implemented in your application.</p><p>A basic Magic integration takes a similar approach with one additional step. You need to use custom authentication for using any social login provider apart from email passwordless. Their documentation and guides are great to follow along and one can figure out how to implement them&nbsp;easily.</p> Open Source &amp; Native Platform&nbsp;Support <p>Open source is at the heart of decentralisation. Both Web3Auth and Magic have strong multi platform support and an active open source community around their products. Web3Auth supports Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, Unity and Unreal Engine. Magic supports all of them except Unreal Engine. They additionally support PHP and WordPress logins.</p><p>At Web3Auth, all these SDKs are open sourced alongside our core infrastructural SDKs and smart contracts controlling the nodes as well. These are fully audited by some of the top smart contract auditing firms in the world. For Magic, the SDKs are open source, while the encryption and DKMS remain closed&nbsp;source.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Although Magic is a great product in terms of getting your users onboarded into the Web3 world, it is evident that Web3Auth has a clear advantage on the core infrastructure level over them. Being a more advanced product with a greater emphasis on security, non-custodiality, and customisation, Web3Auth becomes a clear choice in almost every situation where user wallet management and recoverability is an involved&nbsp;factor.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-vs-magic-how-to-choose-your-key-management-solution-10bbbe78e58e">Web3Auth vs Magic — How to choose your Key Management Solution</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In many ways, Africa is rapidly proving how financial technology and digital infrastructure can scale and thrive to serve potentially billions of people. Since the launch of M-Pesa in 2007, people and businesses from across the continent have been at the forefront of using technology to move and manage value. Today, they are increasingly turning to digital currency and public blockchains to efficiently connect to global capital flows. And beginning in 2013, the introduction of digital currencies and public blockchains made it possible to more efficiently connect countries across the continent to global capital flows.</p>

Public voting has long been problematic for DAOs, creating:</p>  11th hour voting&nbsp;problems  vote coercion  bandwagoning effects  <p>Privacy-first governance can solve these issues, providing:</p>  anonymity  vote privacy (confidentiality of&nbsp;vote)  tally privacy (confidentiality of&nbsp;outcome)  <p>The Aztec x Aragon proposal flexibly enables for all 3. Our proposal has minimal off-chain dependency by utilizing Ethereum storage proofs and timelapse encryption.</p><p>Here’s how it will actually&nbsp;work:</p> Phase 1: Nouns Census Using Ethereum Storage&nbsp;Proofs <p>In Phase 1, we develop a system for taking the census of all NFT holders using Ethereum storage&nbsp;proofs.</p><p>This is a unique feature of our proposal enabled by @NoirLang and Aztec’s UltraPlonk prover. The census proves Nouns ownership or delegation rights using on-chain data without revealing owner identities.</p><p>Functionally, it means Nouns owners are able to “find their spot” in the Ethereum data tree, proving that they own a Noun. It’s worth noting the UltraPlonk implementation with Noir is what enables the client-side storage&nbsp;proof.</p><p>To traverse the storage tree, the user may need to run &gt;50 Keccak hashes to get to the right places in the tree and prove those storage slots contain the owner’s&nbsp;address.</p><p>Because Noir compiles to an intermediate representation (the Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation or ACIR), our team can simply substitute a highly optimized UltraPlonk backend to run these hashes efficiently!</p> Phase 2: Vote Obfuscation with Delay-Relayers <p>In Phase 2, we ensure that addresses with multiple Nouns can also preserve privacy with the help of a vote delay&nbsp;relayer.</p><p>The problem faced by holders of multiple nouns is that of a diminished <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/how-aztec-works/privacy-sets">privacy set</a>. That is, voters with only one Noun belong to the largest set of users. The more unique the number of Nouns held by an address is, the easier it is to identify which address cast a&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Therefore it’s important to decompose large holders’ votes into individual ones. Under our proposal, each NFT will have a unique vote, with vote relayers submitting on behalf of owners with multiple Nouns in order to obfuscate their&nbsp;origin.</p><p>The relayer’s sole purpose is to collect votes from Noun whales and spread the votes out over a long period of time. It has no access to the votes themselves, keeping wallet addresses private at all&nbsp;times.</p> Phase 3: Time-Lapse Encryption Service <p>In Phase 3, we propose implementing a time-lapse encryption service.</p><p>This delayed encryption mechanism achieves tally fairness and ensures no one can tally the proposal’s ongoing votes before the period&nbsp;ends.</p><p>This service publishes encrypted public keys regularly, revealing their corresponding private keys at a set time interval and allowing for votes to be aggregated and then&nbsp;tallied.</p><p>Once the private key is revealed, the votes are decrypted and the results tallied — much like opening a real-world ballot&nbsp;box.</p><p>Our proposal means that Noun owners&nbsp;can:</p>  prove Nouns ownership on-chain  permanently preserve vote&nbsp;privacy  obfuscate ownership of multiple&nbsp;Nouns  cast votes in one&nbsp;step  <p>In our <a href="https://hackmd.io/bAen-Lm4RQuvCod8SYkg2g">exploration of further work</a>, we discuss optimizations to the timelapse encryption scheme, support for multisigs, and private gas payment&nbsp;schemes.</p><p>We also want to shout out <a href="https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint/3985">The Anounymous Proposal</a> by Mach34 utilizing Noir to enable private voting — we’re excited to collaborate among all teams regardless of affiliation!</p><p>For more background on our proposal, Nouns, and the private research sprint, check out these resources:</p>  <a href="https://hackmd.io/SVyDLBq7QSWNl0LaYIuqHA?view">Original research sprint&nbsp;spec</a>  <a href="https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint/3954">Full Aztec x Aragon&nbsp;proposal</a>  <a href="https://research.aragon.org/about/">Aragon ZK Research&nbsp;Guild</a>   Build on&nbsp;Noir <p>Private voting.

 Tokenize infrastructure, not people — 5 tips for international women’s&nbsp;day <p>It is International Women’s day today! Which makes it an important historical day to celebrate and take stock of the structural and everyday gender-based discrimination that happens in our ecosystems and industry. But while doing this important work there are some good and some less great ways of going about&nbsp;it!</p><p>Whether for celebratory or derogatory reasons, it can be unsettling as a person to be reduced to their gender (or any physical attribute for that matter!) So, how does one focus on the issue of gender discrimination without awkwardly tokenizing people? Here are five tips to keep in&nbsp;mind...</p> 1. Diversity in the workplace is not just about doing the right&nbsp;thing <p>It is essential for ensuring a healthy ecosystem. Having a variety of experiences and perspectives present ensures that projects and efforts are actually relevant and resonate outside of an otherwise narrow slice of society. To be blunt, it makes the ecosystem more rich (experientially, and well, literally too)! Diversity makes for better projects, products and services because they will be relevant to more people and resonate with more experiences.</p><p>Nym has consistently put the time in to make sure that we get a strong representation of women within the organisation. Not only are 5 out of 9 (55%) of our executive team are women, but also 15 out of our 45 (33%) full time staff identify as women or non-binary. To put this in perspective the UK’ average for women in tech is just <a href="https://www.uktech.news/sponsored/tech-gender-gap-2022-20220121#:~:text=Just%2026%25%20of%20those%20in,lack%20of%20work%2Dlife%20balance.">26%</a> and for women in Web3 industry jobs at just&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcg.com/press/16february2023-women-are-being-shut-out-of-web3">13%</a>.</p><p>How do we do this? By fostering a culture of inclusivity, and understanding that without a strong representation of all backgrounds, Nym would have no chance of being the best Privacy tech company in the&nbsp;world.</p> 2. Put in the&nbsp;effort <p>So, put in the effort! It is far easier to remember one’s pals and the loudest people in the room when recruiting or organising a panel for a conference. Which means it is hardly surprising that there are often all male panels with organisers throwing their hands up saying they tried but simply could not find any women or non-binary people to speak on the topic. Oftentimes, it just takes a little more effort and a shift in focus to take notice of who else is around and doing important work.</p><p>Whether you are onboarding, recruiting or organising a panel for a conference, qualifications and experiences should be the first criteria, so put in that extra effort and not just go with the first person that comes to mind or the easiest option. Don’t assume any woman you meet at a conference is there because they are someone’s girlfriend and don’t assume the guys are always the decision-makers. Make that effort and make sure you highlight talent, not&nbsp;biology!</p> 3. Don’t single people out for their gender (or any other physical attributes for that&nbsp;matter) <p>When you have done that extra work and have found a super talented person in the field, you might be very proud of yourself and you might be extra proud for having put in the extra effort to find a top professional who is a woman or non-binary person. And while it is fine to celebrate this achievement internally, do NOT publicly single this person out for their gender (or indeed for any other physical or biological attributes —it’s never great, it’s just&nbsp;creepy)!</p><p>It can be a disempowering experience for a person to realise they have been hired, added to a speaking panel, or being interviewed for reasons that have nothing to do with the topic at hand. It can undermine a person’s credibility in the eyes of others, distract from their actual expertise and can ultimately undermine their sense of self-worth.</p> 4. Celebrate talent, not&nbsp;biology <p>Make sure to celebrate people for their talent, not for their physical traits. It is an ingrained habit to celebrate men for their achievements, women for their physical attributes and make anyone in between invisible. To remedy this requires a conscious effort. Habits are usually unconscious, and societal habits are ingrained into language, culture and institutions. Talent and achievements come in loud and quiet forms regardless of gender, make sure your organisation is paying attention to and rewarding all contributors!</p> 5. Freedom means self-determination — don’t impose categories on&nbsp;others <p>Finally, let’s talk about why a privacy tech company is publishing a piece about international women’s day — it is not just about good HR practices!</p><p>The problem of surveillance is that it systematically categorises, profiles and targets people. Surveillance is an imposition of an identity that makes you a target and that you have not had the chance to determine for yourself. And this is exactly what gender oppression does too. It is not about whether someone identifies as a woman or not, wears makeup or not or choses parenting over profession when it is on their own terms. It is about the violent imposition of a set of categories, preconceptions and hierarchies onto a person by other people and&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The historical oppression of women has precisely meant forcing a vast, diverse number of people into a biological category and inventing all kinds of truisms about what it means to be a woman. And the violence of either being thrown into or excluded from the category of woman continues to this&nbsp;day.</p><p>It is essential to avoid echoing this historical mistake of reducing people to biology, while nevertheless putting in the effort needed to ensure that people of any gender can participate in building the societal infrastructures of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Remember:</p>  Diversity is a strength.  Put in the&nbsp;effort.  Don’t single people out for their physical attributes.  Celebrate talent.  Freedom means self-determination.  <p>In other words, tokenise infrastructure, not&nbsp;people!</p><p>We are always looking for more talent at Nym, have a look at our <a href="https://nym.teamtailor.com/">open job postings</a>.</p> Join our community <p><a href="https://discord.gg/nym">Discord</a> // <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a></p> Resources   <a href="https://twitter.com/PayGapApp">A bot</a> revealing pay inequality  <a href="https://desfemmesmagazine.com/">A magazine</a> on women in the business of&nbsp;Web3  <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-invention-of-women">A book</a> on how the category of “Women” was exported and imposed across the&nbsp;world  <a href="https://www.sum.si/uploads/downloads/SUM-15_single.pdf">An essay</a> ‘Crypto-politics — an update’ with more than 90% female authors referenced  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cybersecuritycoalition/cyber-security-coalition-international-womens-day-2022">A podcast</a> with Nym Chief Scientist Claudia Diaz on women in cybersecurity from&nbsp;2022  <p>Get in touch if you have questions, comments if you want to share more resources!</p><p><a href="mailto:Jaya@nymtech.net">Jaya@nymtech.net</a> (CSO) or <a href="mailto:Jack@nymtech.net">Jack@nymtech.net</a> (HR)</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tokenize-infrastructure-not-people-5-tips-for-international-womens-day-366f6f53d957">Tokenize infrastructure, not people — 5 tips for international women’s day</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,<br></p><p>It's time for our monthly update on all things Panther! <br></p><p>Let's look back at what happened in February and what we're preparing for March.<br></p> Tech Updates  v0.5 <p>In the beginning of the month, Panther’s dApp front-end faced an issue from IPFS’ side that temporarily impacted access to the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/advanced-staking-overview/">v0.5</a> user interface. However, a new temporary link was quickly set up to remedy this. As a front-end issue, this only impacted the hosting of the application itself and had no relation to user funds.<br></p><p>Panther's dedicated task force has also been working on optimizing the dApp's bundle size for v0.5, which is a crucial aspect of decentralized deployment. Panther's contracts for fees and rewards functionalities are all progressing well, with some already designed.<br></p><p>You can still access 0.5’s dApp and stake tokens by clicking the “Launch App” button on <a href="http://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s home page.</a><br><br></p> Developments towards v1 <p>Regarding the fees/rewards mechanism of Panther's v1, development of its smart contract components is progressing. Mathematical models are now being put to test using modeling based on open data from transactions related to other privacy protocols.<br></p><p>On a similar note, Panther's tech contributors are leading an effort to enhance the underlying processes to conduct <a href="https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/end-to-end-e2e-testing?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">end-to-end testing</a>. This will enable Panther to test roll-outs for both efficiency and effectiveness.<br></p> zSwap integration Swapping zETH for zUSDC through Uniswap on Panther’s v1.<p><br>The core component of Panther's upcoming v1 first DeFi Adaptor, zSwap, represents a significant milestone in the protocol's development. The feature will enable users to swap assets privately through major DEXs, with the protocol fee based on $ZKP. We have also made significant progress in connecting with <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap V3</a> and <a href="https://quickswap.exchange/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/">Quickswap</a> V2, with <a href="https://curve.fi/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve</a> currently in progress.<br></p><p>First deployed on Polygon, zSwap features a DEX-like screen allowing users to choose:<br></p><p>• the token pair to swap</p><p>• their desired amounts</p><p>• the most favorable route with updated values based on fees and price impact. <br></p><p>To use zSwap, users must first deposit tokens into Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.<br></p><p>Once deposited, the assets become private (zAssets), shielded by zero-knowledge proofs and zkSNARKs cryptography. <br></p>Panther’s zAssets screen.<p>By design, zSwap serves a dual function of enabling trading across all available assets and enhancing Panther's privacy set. Since along swapping users are able to trade within the pool, tracing assets back to any particular user becomes impossible.<br></p>Why is zSwap the first DeFi Adaptor by Panther? Let’s just say it’s a matter of (total) value. New roadmap<br> Co-founders Oliver Gale &amp; Anish Mohammed (Left, front) met with Panther’s core contributors.<p>Panther's co-founders and core tech contributors also met up to workshop Panther's roadmap, compliance design, and more, leading to the release of Panther’s <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/roadmap?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">roadmap for 2023-2024</a>.<br></p>Panther’s Roadmap. Updated on 03/01/2023.<p><br>Panther’s newly-published roadmap brings a well-deserved update to our plans leading up to the release of v1. As you can see from it, Q1 2023 will be a time for planning, revising our public materials, and upgrading documentation. We are also moving forward with Decentralization Phase 2, which includes developing a working governance framework, which has kept the Panther community occupied.<br></p><p>Moving into Q2 2023, we will be launching v1’s Testnet, featuring Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) and support for Zones. We will also be introducing DeFi Adaptors, starting with zSwap, and working towards the OTC-like zTrade functionality. Additionally, it will also feature Trust Providers and present the first version of Panther’s relayers. <br></p><p>Overall, we are excited about the progress we have made and the work that lies ahead in 2023.<br></p>Panther Protocol’s first three quarters of the year.

<p>Last night we streamed the first in a six-part video series examining the business model of We Work (data analytics) and how Adam Neumann’s new venture in the rental “experience” market is likely to intersect with a16z’s Web3 investment strategy. Future installments will feature discussions with Leo Saraceno, Lynn Davenport, Cliff Gomes, and Brandi Hartley. We’ll be exploring how “sustainable” pay for success finance in affordable and workforce housing will advance social computing within the context of Neumann’s vision of a capitalist kibbutz. I’ve created an extensive slide deck with links that you can view <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EoorV600wnPpuZqshHpzK7Xf-1lCGV922OVu0PT-tG0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. I plan to run part two with Leo Saraceno next weekend. Be advised that tropes like the 15-minute city are meant to keep people at the surface. “Flow Life” will be a deep dive into the structural aspects of the system with a focus on data, finance, and complex emergent systems. Stay tuned. There’s much more to come.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence needs “diversity.” Homogeneity won’t catalyze ecstatic “emergence.” But the diversity must be managed, that darn progressive “social efficiency” again. For that we need <a href="https://www.diversitydashboard.com/">diversity dashboards</a>, ostensibly for administering equity standards, but in reality used to to tag, track, and guide agents on the game board and direct the state of play. When I was looking into <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dave-robertson">Dave Robertson</a>, professor of applied logic at the University of Edinburgh and chief scientific advisor in the UK to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-robertson-9aab0a13/?originalSubdomain=uk">Huawei</a>, I came across a group of papers published as part of a 2016 conference on “<a href="http://www.ecai2016.org/content/uploads/2016/08/W13-diversity-2016.pdf">diversity-aware</a>” artificial intelligence. The image below shows the agenda for the <a href="http://www.ecai2016.org/sponsoring/sponsors/index.html">International Workshop on Diversity-Aware Artificial Intelligence</a> held at The Hague that year.</p>

<p>The paper “Managing human diversity in diverse multi-agent collaborative intelligence systems,” detailed the care and management of a crowdsourced “citizen science” platform where volunteers annotate scientific images. </p>
<p>Co-authors on the paper were:</p>

<p>The focus of their paper was how to identify a variety of sub-populations identified as “personas” within the overall community and identify targeted strategies to keep them engaged in the work. These included techniques like personalized reminders and special access opportunities for dedicated volunteers and working to find the right mix of people at various levels of expertise to keep the project vibrant. </p>
<p>It was also about controlling access to information, because equal access to all information, equal agency for all people, would create chaotic conditions within the planned circular economy. We are expected to hand our agency over to AI systems, so the platform can manage individual needs against those of the “collective” (or perhaps the profit margins of the investors in the platform).</p>
<p>“To date we have studied sharing economy platforms such as Uber, viewing these as distributed forms of collaborative intelligence. In the case of Uber, human agents (drivers) and computer agents (algorithms that measure and predict demand) ‘collaborate’ to solve a global resource allocation problem. There are powerful economic drivers in this type of system that motivate the participation of drivers and passengers, but also drive actions of Uber (the platform owner), and in particular, how Uber configures the interplay of the intelligences within the system. For example, when requesting a lift, passengers are shown the locations of nearby drivers on a map, but this information is withheld from drivers themselves, as it is not reproduced on the separate app used by drivers. This prevents the drivers using their own intelligence to collectively manage how supply within the system is organized, which they could do by adjusting their own local position on the basis of information about how supply is distributed globally.” <a href="http://www.ecai2016.org/content/uploads/2016/08/W13-diversity-2016.pdf">Source</a>, Page 45, Case Studies</p>
<p>“Participation in collaborative intelligence systems needs to be sufficiently diverse to provide the right mix of capabilities to sustain the operation of collaborative intelligence platforms.” <a href="http://www.ecai2016.org/content/uploads/2016/08/W13-diversity-2016.pdf">Source</a>, Page 46, Diversity in Motivation and&nbsp; Commitment&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Thus attracting and maintaining the contributions of diverse participating groups is a fundamental operational consideration for collaborative intelligence platforms. Considerations of how to do this need to go beyond simple notions of individual motivations, but instead they need to consider the dynamics of the interactions between diverse sub-communities and how these are managed by platform operators.” <a href="http://www.ecai2016.org/content/uploads/2016/08/W13-diversity-2016.pdf">Source</a>, Page 48</p>
<p>This idea of personas and prescribed nudges aligns with outside pressures to reimagine our complex inner lives in broad strokes as archetypes. Archetypes provide structure in game environments – whether they are happening on a tabletop or with cards, in video games, or live action role play (LARP) with <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Social-Wearables-LARP-Games.-UC-Santa-Cruz.pdf">social wearable tech</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s still elusive, but I’ve continued to wonder about Paul and Mary Conover Mellon’s securing the rights to republish English translations of Jung’s work through the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/14/books/with-love-and-money.html">Bollingen Foundation</a> in the late 1940s. Maybe it was simply a long and winding road to get from formalizing <a href="https://www.psychologistworld.com/cognitive/carl-jung-analytical-psychology">archetypes of the collective unconscious</a> to algorithmic simulation modeling of agents in the collective toward a massive program of computation and perhaps ultimately, Teilhard de Chardin’s <a href="https://christogenesis.org/">Christogenesis</a>. </p>
<p>In fact just this morning I received an email from a friend with a link to an extensive interview with Jung in English that I hope to listen to over the next few days. She know’s I’ve been mulling this over – the Mellon’s being a powerful banking family based in Pittsburgh – and she offered this suggestion, which resonates with my findings thus far:</p>
<p>“I would like to point out that after intense reading of Jung again and, luckily, finding an interview with him in English, this might be the much deeper reason for the Mellon family’s interest in his teachings: if they can create archetypal situations for the public (this would go way beyond creating avatars), they can affect the people on such a deep level that they will respond accordingly and the public will stay unaware of why they respond. This is because the great majority of the people has no idea about the unconscious at all. Have you heard about Mattias Desmet’s book “The Psychology of Totalitarianism?”</p>
<p>“Simply put, he elaborates on why “it takes two to Tango” also with regards to establishing a totalitarian regime as no such thing can take place if people are connected with themselves on levels such as Jung describes. Jung stated in the interview cited above that the most dangerous thing on earth is the psyche – because if a deranged psyche sits at the trigger of the atomic bomb then this would mean the end for our planet. No bomb has been invented without the psyche of a man creating the idea beforehand.”</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned in my talks John Fowles’ novel, “<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/specials/fowles-magus1.html">The Magus,</a>” whose plot revolves around a young man engaging in a mythic LARP, or masque, on a Greek island where the lines between reality and fantasy blur to alarming effect. The LARP theme is also seen toward the end of Neal Stephenson’s novel, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/The-Diamond-Age-Novel.pdf">The Diamond Age</a>,” where John Percival Hackworth and his daughter Fiona are drawn in to a surreal theater production where members of the audience unexpectedly end up center stage in dynamically-adjusting, intelligent super-organism. In excerpt below, John Hackworth attempts to get his bearings in the house bar run by Dramatis Personae.</p>

<p>Reading the “Managing Diversity” paper, also brought to mind Cambridge Analytica and the power of narrative to present facts even as it obscures more complex truths. It is my view that the emotionally-charged rhetoric of social media has been used as a sandbox for generating and mapping the psychographic profiles of participants for over a decade. All the clamor in the feeds, one polarizing nugget after another, drip, drip, drip so the algorithms know which buttons to push to rile you up, to affirm you, and to deepen your belonging to a given tribe. THAT my friends is about creating <a href="https://archive.org/details/FromBitcoinToBurningManBeyond/page/n141/mode/2up">digital Holons</a>, modules for the machine, a palette of emotion and intellect and problem-solving frames that in the future can be plucked on demand for a global pool of watchful, hopeful task rabbit laborers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of the Cambridge Analytica scandal was kept pretty tightly to electoral politics. The psychographic data scraped from Facebook for personalized political advertising targeting swing voters was the topic in the spotlight. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/sh/wex94ODaUs/trump-robert-mercer-billionaire/">Robert Mercer</a>, the man who introduced the technology to conservative politics, is a Long Island billionaire and <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/who-are-the-mercers-the-wealthy-backers-of-breitbart/a-42100407">poker player</a> who spent much of his career at IBM developing an expertise in linguistic pattern recognition and then leveraged that skill to boost the profits of <a href="https://www.rentec.com/Home.action?index=true">Renaissance Technologies</a>’ Medallion Fund. Mercer’s research at IBM laid the groundwork for Google translate and Siri.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to economist Richard Baldwin, automatic language translation is a necessary step in order to scale global platform labor. Baldwin imagines a future where Polish accountants “port-in” to New York for the day, working a billable-rate that’s considerably less than their Manhattan counterparts. According to Baldwin it is this arbitrage that will drive the next phase of globalization.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is cognitive capitalism sitting atop a structure of collective token engineering, a newly encoded social contract. I’ve come to view this emergent social structure as the armature of a supercomputing world brain. This mechanistic organism, one whose voice is tinged with plaintive biomimicry, wants to reimagine natural life as a vast network of parallel processors – Balaji Srinivasan’s <a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/">networked “state”</a> . The algorithms Robert Mercer cooked up for IBM and later Renaissance Technologies aided not only efficiencies in translation, but enabled machines to begin to predict human activity parsing the structure of language. It is this predictive capacity that gave him an edge when he began applying these tools to hedge fund bets.</p>
<p>Another computational linguist I discovered researching this series is <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/prof-moshe-koppel-the-judicial-branch-must-be-subject-to-checks-and-balances/">Moshe Koppel</a>, a professor emeritus of computer science at Bar-Ilan University who specializes in <a href="https://thelehrhaus.com/commentary/torah-study-and-the-digital-revolution-a-glimpse-of-the-future/">textual analysis</a> and attribution and social choice theory, which is used in economic modeling. A description of the <a href="https://research.biu.ac.il/labs/prof-koppels-lab/">research conducted in his lab</a> includes automated game playing as well as speech recognition and image processing. A Zionist who <a href="https://en.kohelet.org.il/publication/jewish-state-bill">successfully lobbied for Israel’s nation-state law,</a> Koppel also heads a conservative think tank, Koholet Forum (h/t to <a href="https://gnomes4truth.medium.com/">Sebs Solomon</a> for that information) <a href="https://archive.ph/xOwDe">funded largely</a> by Jeffrey Yass and Arthur Dantchik of Susquehanna International Group. Starting in <a href="https://knesset.gov.il/constitution/ConstOpening_eng.htm">2003</a>, Koppel became involved in the process of developing a constitution for Israel, <a href="https://tikvahfund.org/faculty/moshe-koppel/">consulting on two drafts</a>. The more I research the more I realize how linguistics, language, is code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m thinking back to the first entry in this series that talks about John Holland’s approach to communication: classifier systems, routing tags, containment urns, semi-permeable boundaries, genetic algorithms optimized towards established success metrics, so mathematical logic prevails. It feels like the people working in complex adaptive systems are looking to create a grammar of what it means to be human, a grammar of emotion, a grammar of spirit, so our behavior can be analyzed, interactions parsed out, contorted, labeled like the sentence diagramming I learned to do in tenth grade. They can use the ordered fragments to chart out the next sentence, choreographed social interactions, economic interactions, biological interactions. Once the interface becomes subtle enough, or we become sufficiently entranced by the AI, will we realize we’ve become actors in our own lives?&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Israel being a member of the <a href="https://www.leadingdigitalgovs.org/organization">first cohort of digital nations</a> in 2014, I can’t help but imagine that <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/national-digital-agency/govil-landing-page">electronic governance</a>, possibly with distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, will be incorporated into whatever version finally gains approval. “<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/prof-moshe-koppel-the-judicial-branch-must-be-subject-to-checks-and-balances/">Democracy under threat</a>” and “tyranny of the majority” are narrative tropes that will be used to make a case for this transition to decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I move on, I want to briefly bring Annie Duke back into the conversation. She’s the one who leveraged her notoriety as a high-profile female poker player into a business consultancy pitching decision science around betting strategies. Well, before her gambling career, she was an <a href="https://firstround.com/person/annie-duke/">NSF fellowship-supported PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania</a> with a focus on cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics. In <a href="https://twitter.com/annieduke/status/1570808241634054147">tweet</a> last September she said she was going back to complete her degree stating, “This one is for Leila Gleitman, my advisor back in the 90s, and like a mother to me.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>When reading the excerpt below I invite you to consider how the linguistic analysis Mercer developed at IBM (also seen in Martin Seligman’s <a href="http://wwbp.org/publications.html">World Well Being Project </a>at UPenn and Koppel’s language and social choice theory work) might be applied to speculation on human capital through the development of “learning” and “behavioral” archetypes refined in real time by children’s interactions (and those of adult “lifelong learners) with educational and therapeutic technologies, screen-based and wearables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following is from a 2018 article in Institutional Investor, “<a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b17q91wjnnr68x/renaissance,-cambridge-analytica-connection-should-be-questioned,-experts-say">Renaissance, Cambridge Analytica Connection Should Be Questioned, Experts Say</a>:”</p>
<p>“Cambridge Analytica is largely bankrolled by Robert Mercer, a backer of Breitbart News and other ventures, who stepped down on January 1 as co-CEO of Renaissance following public criticism of his political activism. Mercer continues as a top researcher and part owner of Renaissance.</p>
<p>The specific hot-button issue for Renaissance investors: Cambridge Analytica’s focus on psychographic modeling – using machine-based learning to sort through myriad data points as a way of determining how a person is likely to vote. The techniques are strikingly similar to those Renaissance researchers have harnessed for years, according to quantitative scientists and other experts.</p>
<p>‘The math used in machine learning for the purpose of affecting the election is the same math used in the world of quantitative investing,’ says Peter Carr, chair of the Finance and Risk Engineering Department at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. ‘I believe Renaissance has a fairly deep knowledge of human behavior. Whether [Mercer] passed that on I wouldn’t know.” <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b17q91wjnnr68x/renaissance,-cambridge-analytica-connection-should-be-questioned,-experts-say">source</a></p>
<p>Dallas ISD launched a new hybrid school model during lockdowns, STEM-uli, which founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylorshead/">Taylor Shead</a> calls “a school in a video game.” In this gaming experience, the avatars of children are followed through their digital day in “school” by a floating satellite eyeball.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Bentham-esque satellite-eye view evokes to me the&nbsp; “<a href="https://www.pokernews.com/news/2011/03/travis-makar-leaks-god-mode-email-from-ultimatebet-scandal-9946.htm">god mode</a>” that was at the center of the Ultimate Bet poker scandal. When hedge fund AI bet on life outcomes, each portfolio manager is going to want to have as much information as possible to guide its strategy, more than the other players in the game. I’m sure that’s something Google had in mind when they went after all the school district’s email accounts. In such a future, there’s a twisted logic in children being separated from human teachers. The data economy can’t run without their digital life blood. The data flow is much more robust when everything is seamlessly sucked into the digital vortex, which is exactly what happens in gaming environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simulation companies know this. Gaming firms have made an art out of holding the attention of participants when they are flagging and ready to give up and turn in for the night. It’s about creating in-game experiences that trick the body into releasing endorphins, dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, and cortisol. B.F. Skinner’s conditioning tactics around behaviors that obtain rewards have been encoded into virtual environments as <a href="https://gameanalytics.com/blog/the-compulsion-loop-explained/">compulsion loops</a> where game designers orchestrate complex sets of rules determining the timing and rate of rewards as well as expectations around extinction (when rewards are withheld).&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is the <a href="https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/the-science-behind-game-based-learning/">future of “education”</a> when we become flow state modules in the master computer. With each click we move ourselves closer to becoming digital commodities as algorithmic systems, systems that most of us can’t comprehend, parse the unconscious intent or emotion lurking beneath our keystrokes, our eye movements, our word choices? Makes you look at Grammarly in a whole new way, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Robert Mercer was a key figure putting Trump into office. His daughter <a href="https://www.desmog.com/rebekah-mercer/">Rebekah</a>, a Stanford graduate with a master’s in operations research and engineered economic systems, was on Trump’s transition team. She’s served on the <a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/rebekah-mercer">board</a> of the Heritage Foundation since 2004. Heritage is a strong voice in the school choice space and has been promoting <a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/report/financial-technology-and-parental-choice-education">financial innovation in education</a> (digital wallet vouchers) since 2017. It’s the wallets that put you in the hedge fund futures game. Another daughter Heather Sue graduated from Duke with an economics degree and became a <a href="https://www.wsop.com/players/profile/?playerID=85013&amp;s=PA#HarrahsPhiladelphia">professional poker player</a>. During the holiday season the family hosts heroes and villains parties, one of which was attended by Trump. The house provides chips for an evening of <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-party-donors-villains-heroes-mercers-232156">black jack and poker</a> and the guests get to redeem them for luxury items at the end of the night.</p>

<p>Until his break with Trump and calls for a revolt against Mitch McConnell, Steve Bannon counted Robert Mercer among his closest allies. Mercer bankrolled Bannon’s Breitbart News juggernaut. I pulled the quotes below from Jane Mayer’s 2017 New Yorker feature, “<a href="https://archive.ph/QyjWh">The Reclusive Billionaire Behind the Trump Presidency: How Robert Mercer Exploited America’s Populist Insurgency</a>.” Reading between the lines, and with additional context around cybernetics and psychographics, one could speculate that Breitbart and other purpose-built media outlets (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4F5R2-JpM4&amp;feature=youtu.be">Twitter</a>) are functioning as sandboxes for experimentation in the use of language, imagery, and ideology to activate and steer multi-agent systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Another former high-level Renaissance employee said, ‘Bob thinks the less government the better. He’s happy if people don’t trust the government. And if the President’s a bozo? He’s fine with that. He wants it to all fall down.’”</p>
<p>“Mercer’s colleagues say that he views the government as arrogant and inefficient, and believes that individuals need to be self-sufficient, and should not receive aid from the state. Yet, when I.B.M. failed to offer adequate support for Mercer and Brown’s translation project, they secured additional funding from DARPA, the secretive Pentagon program. Despite Mercer’s disdain for “big government,” this funding was essential to his early success.”</p>
<p>​​After the candidate he initially supported, Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, dropped out of the race, Mercer sought a disruptive figure who could upend both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Patterson told me that Mercer seems to have applied “a very Renaissance Technologies way of thinking” to politics: “He probably estimated the probability of Trump winning, and when it wasn’t very high he said to himself, ‘O.K., what has to happen in order for this twenty-per-cent thing to occur?’ It’s like playing a card game when you haven’t got a very good hand.”</p>
<p>Mercer, as it happens, is a superb poker player, and his political gamble appears to have paid off. Institutional Investor has called it “Robert Mercer’s Trade of the Century.”</p>
<p>“He (Mercer) put ten million dollars into Breitbart News, which was conceived as a conservative counterweight to the Huffington Post… The site played a key role in undermining Hillary Clinton; by tracking which negative stories about her got the most clicks and “likes,” the editors helped identify which story lines and phrases were the most potent weapons against her. Breitbart News has been a remarkable success: according to ComScore, a company that measures online traffic, the site attracted 19.2 million unique visitors in October.”</p>
<p>“Mercer also invested some five million dollars in Cambridge Analytica, a firm that mines online data to reach and influence potential voters. The company has said that it uses secret psychological methods to pinpoint which messages are the most persuasive to individual online viewers…Alexander Nix, the C.E.O. of the firm, says that it has created “profiles”—consisting of several thousand data points—for two hundred and twenty million Americans. In promotional materials, S.C.L. has claimed to know how to use such data to wage both psychological and political warfare. “Persuading somebody to vote a certain way,” Nix has said publicly, “is really very similar to persuading 14- to 25-year-old boys in Indonesia to not join Al Qaeda.”</p>
<p>“In 1993, when Nick Patterson mailed Robert Mercer a job offer from Renaissance, Mercer threw it in the trash: he’d never heard of the hedge fund. At the time, Mercer was part of a team pioneering the use of computers to translate languages. I.B.M. considered the project a bit of a luxury, and didn’t see its potential, though the work laid the foundation for Google Translate and Apple’s Siri. But Mercer and his main partner, Peter Brown, found the project exciting, and had the satisfaction of showing up experts in the field, who had dismissed their statistical approach to translating languages as impractical. Instead of trying to teach a computer linguistic rules, Mercer and Brown downloaded enormous quantities of dual-language documents — including Canadian parliamentary records — and created code that analyzed the data and detected patterns, enabling predictions of probable translations. According to a former IBM colleague, Mercer was obsessive, and at one point took six months off to type into a computer every entry in a Spanish-English dictionary. Sebastian Mallaby, in his 2010 book on the hedge-fund industry, “More Money Than God,” reports that Mercer’s boss at I.B.M. once jokingly called him an “automaton.”</p>
<p>Could it be that libertarian billionaires helped put Trump in office not because they believed he was a competent candidate, but because their ultimate goal was to start dismantling electoral governance as we understand it in favor of a “free market” economic and cybernetic control model grounded in token engineering and digital twin simulations? </p>
<p>The Trump universe, one built in part on gambling, was just the thing to sow profound distrust in the system on all sides and prepare the ground for what is to come – a “democracy” reboot where we’re all tagged as agents in the game to perform our values for the machine and assist its efforts at human social sense-making.</p>

<p>This is the 24th post in an <a>ongoing, regular series</a> describing privacy features in Brave browsers. This post describes work done by Research and Privacy Engineer Shivan Kaul Sahib. This post was written by VP of Privacy Engineering Peter Snyder.</p>



    


    


<p>Starting in version 1.51, Brave will increase user privacy by extending the brower’s permission system to cover legacy Google Sign-In (which needs third-party cookies, or other unsatisfactory techniques, to allow users to log in to sites with their Google account). This new feature will replace Brave’s existing option of a global “allow” or “deny” setting for handling legacy Google Sign-Ins. This feature will be available on desktop and Android, and is another way Brave is retrofitting best-in-class privacy protections to Web APIs that were designed without concern for user privacy.</p>

 The good and the bad of “Google Sign-In” 
<p>Google, like many popular account-based sites, allows people to use their Google account to log in to other sites. This feature, sometimes called single-sign on (SSO), has both security benefits and privacy risks.</p>
<p>SSO systems can be helpful in several ways. First, SSO systems are very convenient for users, and remove the need to go through often-tedious account creation processes on different sites. Second, and more importantly, SSO systems in general (and “Sign in with Google” in particular) can improve user security. Instead of users needing to trust dozens or hundreds of websites with usernames and passwords (sites that may have wide-ranging security practices), users can instead benefit from Google’s top-notch security features, even on sites not belonging to Google. Examples of Google’s security bona fides include two factor authentication (2FA), <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/">advanced account protection features</a>, and a security team that is among the best in the field.</p>
<p>However, SSO systems can also be harmful to users. For example, the centralized nature of SSO systems means that any flaws can have repercussions across the Web<a>1</a>. More relevant to this post, SSO systems can also harm user privacy, depending on how they are built and implemented. SSO systems necessarily involve the SSO-provider learning at least something<a>2</a> about a user’s actions on another site, and many systems allow the SSO-provider to learn a great deal of sensitive and private information.</p>

 “Google Sign-In” in Brave, past and present 
<p>In most cases, Brave already protects a user’s privacy when they interact with Google Sign-In. Unless people intentionally and explicitly use their Google account to log in to sites, Brave prevents Google from learning about those sites.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in">there are many ways sites can integrate with Google Sign-In</a>, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/troubleshooting#third-party_cookies_and_data_blocked">oldest of which relies on unrestricted third-party cookies</a>. To combat this, by default Brave applies the strongest <a>third-party cookie protections</a> of any popular browser. This has the upside of providing robust, best-in-class privacy protections, though with the occasional downside of causing compatibility problems with systems that depend on unrestricted third-party cookies.</p>



    


    



 How Brave previously handled “Google Sign-In” 
<p>Previously, Brave provided compatibility with “Google Sign-In” with a single, global setting, accessible at brave://settings/socialBlocking. If the setting was off, Brave blocked third-party cookies for the “Google Sign-In” system, just as Brave blocks third-party cookies for all other requests on the Web. However, if the setting was on, Brave made a single exception to its third-party cookie policy, and allowed Google’s Sign-In system to access Google’s cookies.</p>
<p>This exception only affected URLs used for Google logins<a>3</a>, and did not allow other Google systems (such as Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, or Doubleclick) to access third-party cookies. But regardless, when enabled, the exception caused Brave browsers on desktop and Android to send third-party cookies to Google in this narrow case.</p>



    


    



 How Brave now handles “Google Sign-In” 
<p>Starting with version 1.51, Brave has removed the exception and the global toggle, and moved to a permissions-based system. This allows users to control when (or if) a third-party cookie is sent to Google, while still taking advantage of the convenience and security provided by “Google Sign-In.” If the website already uses the new <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/overview">Google Identity Services for Web</a> solution which doesn’t use third-party cookies for signing in, there’s no change.</p>
<p>Brave’s new “Google Sign-In” permission builds on <a>previous privacy improvements Brave applies to permission handling in Chromium</a>, including the ability to control how long a permission lasts for, and to partition permissions in third-party iframes.</p>

 Comparison to other browsers 
<p>Brave’s permission-based approach to enabling “Google Sign-In” is unique among browsers. Other browsers use different systems to be compatible with “Google Sign-In”(and other similar services). The approaches other browsers use are incompatible with Brave’s privacy goals and values, requiring us to develop our unique permissions-based approach.</p>

 Chrome’s approach 
<p>Chrome does not need any system to be compatible with third-party, cookie-based SSO systems because Chrome does not meaningfully restrict third-party cookies at all. In Chrome, SSO providers use the exact same techniques that third-party trackers and advertisers use to track you across the Web <a>1</a>. This approach is fundamentally incompatible with Brave’s privacy-first principles.</p>

 Edge, Firefox, and Safari’s approach 
<p>Other browsers apply some restrictions to third-party cookies. Edge restricts third-party cookies if they appear on the <a href="https://disconnect.me/">Disconnect list</a> of known trackers, and Firefox and Safari restrict (i.e. partition) third-party cookies for all sites. These browsers maintain compatibility with systems like “Google Sign-In” by using a system called the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API">storage access API</a> (plus <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Storage_Access_Policy#automatic_storage_access_upon_interaction">various</a>  <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8311/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-0/">heuristics</a> on top). The storage access API was <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8124/introducing-storage-access-api/">originally developed in Safari</a>, and allowed third-party frames to access unrestricted third-party cookies only after getting permission from the user.</p>
<p>The storage access API is both similar and very different from Brave’s “Google Sign-In” permission. The two are similar in that both systems only allow third-parties to access their first-party cookies after the user has given permission. The systems differ in that the storage access API is a general purpose API that allows third parties to request access for any purpose, whereas Brave’s system is purpose specific, and only enables third-party cookies for a narrow, specific purpose.</p>
<p>Brave disables the storage access API in Chromium as we believe this approach is not the right way to protect privacy on the Web. The storage access API asks users to make privacy-risking choices they do not understand, and generally requires users to bear the burden of protecting their own privacy. Brave’s system, by contrast, allows third-party cookies to be sent only for a specific, easily understood purpose, and for a very limited amount of time (i.e. the amount of time needed to complete the login process).</p>
<p>The storage access API was a tremendous improvement over what came before it (i.e. choosing between unrestricted access to third-party cookies, or breaking many third-party integrations). The designers and developers of the storage access API should be congratulated and appreciated for the privacy improvement their work brought. But Brave thinks the storage access API is best seen as a temporary stop-gap approach that has its own serious drawbacks; the Web should instead focus on other, better protections like <a>ephemeral third-party storage</a>.</p>

 The more promising future 
<p>Thankfully, many other browsers agree that narrow, purpose specific APIs are needed for protecting user privacy when sites need to communicate with each other. We at Brave are optimistic about efforts like the <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API</a>, which would allow sites to narrowly request cross-site information for purposes like “Google Sign-In” without enabling the broad, unrestricted access to third-party state that the storage access API allows. Brave is still reviewing the current FedCM proposals, but we’re broadly in support of the effort. In a sense, Brave’s new permission-based approach for enabling “Google Sign-In” is Brave’s effort to bring the future privacy promises of FedCM to Web users today.</p>
<p>Brave’s “Google Sign-In” permission feature is another example of Brave’s approach to Web privacy: provide the strongest possible privacy protections for users today, while working with standards bodies to make sure the future direction of the Web is even more user-respecting.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>For example, <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10339713">researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago recently found</a> that many single-sign on systems do not correctly handle account revocation, can allow for misconfigured site integrations, or suffer from other important security and privacy issues.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a>&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Though what and how much information the SSO provider learns varies widely between systems.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Specifically, URLs matching the patterns <code>https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth/*</code> and <code>https://[*.]firebaseapp.com/__/auth/*</code>&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>Layer 2 scaling solutions are widely regarded as the next step forward in the mainstream adoption of crypto as they enable higher throughput and lower transaction fees. Coinbase’s recent announcement of building an optimistic rollup solution called Base is proof (no pun intended) that major centralized actors view this as an opportunity to onboard new users in a decentralized crypto economy. The following years will abound in innovation as both optimistic and zero-knowledge rollup solutions still have plenty of room to grow, but the involvement of centralized entities will act as a catalyst from a technological, as well as a regulatory standpoint.</p><p>We were joined by Jesse Pollak, Head of Protocol at Coinbase, to discuss the thesis &amp; business model behind Base and how it will act as an interoperable bridge to onboard the next billion users on-chain.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jesse’s background and his role as Head of Protocol at Coinbase  Base’s business model &amp; thesis  Building on the Optimism stack  Permissionlessness  How regulations are going to influence users of Base (vs. Coinbase)  Learning from the competition (BSC)  Different fee markets to offset transaction costs  Why Base chose the Optimism stack  Base’s upgradeability  Tackling Optimism’s withdrawal period  Bootstrapping Base  Future roadmap and mainnet timeline  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jessepollak">Jesse Pollak on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/buildonbase">Base on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase">Coinbase on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/optimismFND">Optimism on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

 Introduction 
<p>2022 was a foundational year for Brave, BAT and Community. Progress with the multichain Brave Wallet and +80 DApps joining the Brave <a>Wallet Partner Program</a> provided additional opportunities to bring pilots to market from our 2022 goals, which we aim to build upon further for 2023. We are also planning on new feature additions and enhancements to the Rewards ecosystem involving BAT and Web3 that we’re excited to bring to market in the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the crypto industry has gone through turbulence in 2022, Brave and BAT continue to build and expand utility to millions of users and Creators. 2023 will be a transformative year for BAT, as updates and upgrades to existing programs will best position Brave’s resources to bring more utility on-chain for users, Creators and Advertisers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following previous State of the BAT posts from <a>2021</a> and <a>2022</a>, the 2023 State of the BAT provides a snapshot of BAT stats, key accomplishments from 2022 and a look ahead at our goals for BAT in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

 BAT Stats 

 Circulating Supply 
 
 As of the time of writing, 1,497,353,045 BAT (99.82%) of the total supply of 1,500,000,000 BAT are in circulation. 
 

 BAT distribution on Ethereum 
 
 With 464,289 on-chain BAT holders, <a href="https://etherscan.io/tokens?sort=holders&amp;order=desc">BAT is currently ranked as the 13th most distributed token</a> on Ethereum. 
 

 BAT on-chain holders growing across networks 
 
 The introduction of the multichain Brave Wallet in 2022, and support for Brave Wallet on some of the leading DApps on those networks has resulted in 489,340 on-chain wallets holding BAT across Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche and Solana. We expect to see greater adoption of BAT on these networks and others into 2023.

 BAT in DeFi 
 
 BAT utility has continued to grow in DeFi over 2022, with over 167.4M BAT (11.16% of total supply)&nbsp;actively being utilized in on-chain defi protocols.
 
 The top 3 defi protocols utilizing BAT in 2023 are Compound, Aave and Uniswap. 
 
 
 

 Brave-initiated BAT Purchases 
 
 Throughout 2022, Brave made a total of 76 BAT purchases for the 70% user revenue share for advertising campaigns paid by advertisers in USD, for a total of 27,169,302 BAT.&nbsp;
 
 Note that fluctuations in the notional USD equivalent value of BAT, Brave Ads monthly campaign sales, and the percentage of advertisers paying in crypto vs. USD result in differences in the quantity and frequency of BAT purchases throughout the calendar year. 
 
 
 

 Brave Ads 
 
 Brave Ads campaigns were supported in nearly 200 countries with over 7.5 billion ad confirmation events to date. 
 There have been over 6,600 campaigns since the inception, from over 900 advertisers, from mainstream brands such as Ford, PayPal, Toyota, Mastercard, Intel, Chipotle, Crocs, BMW, Keurig, American Express, Budweiser, Walmart, Amazon, and The Home Depot, as well as from crypto giants like Binance, Coinbase, eToro, Ledger, Near, and Solana. 
 The average click-through rate (CTR) for a Brave Ads campaign is 8%, well above the industry average of just 2%, with many brands observing even higher engagement. 
 

 Brave Creators 
 
 A total of 1,742,574 Creators have verified with Brave to accept BAT from Brave Rewards users, an increase of over 30% from 2022. 
 

 2022 Progress 

 Brave Ads 
 
 Brave News Ads launched for Android in March 2022.&nbsp; 
 Brave Search Ads Beta launched in December 2022. 
 

 Brave Rewards 
 
 Brave Rewards users have contributed more than 36 million BAT to their favorite registered content creators to date. 
 Work on engineering and implementation of important updates and changes to Brave Rewards (see our <a>Important Changes to Rewards</a> post for more details):
 
 An important step toward helping us combat abuse, so that we can better deliver on our promises to legitimate users and creators. 
 The changes allow Brave to focus efforts on building a more decentralized future by eliminating our current centralized “virtual BAT” system.

 Focus for 2023 

 BAT NFT Creator Collaborations 
 
 With the success of the BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT mint, we observed how bringing the BAT and creator NFT communities together can lead to success (even with extremely turbulent market conditions). 
 Following the upcoming Sage mint for the BAT x Adam Ape for Brave collection, we plan to continue bringing the leading NFT Creators and communities across different blockchains together with the BAT Community and Brave to offer more mints through a formal program. 
 Each collaborative NFT mint will bring BAT utility as a mint option, with the aim of fully denominating NFT mints in BAT this year in NFT marketplaces on Solana, Ethereum and other networks.&nbsp; 
 We’re working closely with the Community on utility opportunities for NFT collectors in the program, where collectors can benefit from utility within the Brave ecosystem for all of the collaborative collections, and additional utility for the projects we collaborate with. We aim to incrementally add these utility offerings throughout the year, providing continuous benefits and enjoyment for the Community.&nbsp; 
 Additionally, we’re working with Wallet Partner Program partners on extending additional utility benefits for BAT and Brave NFT collaborations, with <a href="https://getbased.com/">Based MKRS</a> already providing their NFT passes to our BAT Community to create token-gated communities within their <a href="https://app.getbased.com/">chat app</a>.&nbsp; 
 


    
    

    


    


    
    

 
 In addition, <a href="https://degenroyale.net/">Degen Royale</a> has integrated 3D avatars of NFTs from our first collection into its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2156070/Degen_Royale/">multiplayer PC Steam game</a>. 
 

 
 More information on this program will be released in the weeks ahead. 
 

 Brave Ads 
 
 Following the full rollout of the <a>changes to Brave Rewards</a> announced in January, we plan to introduce support for Brave Search Ads to Brave Rewards users, providing another opportunity for Brave Rewards users to earn BAT. 
 We are aiming to hold a public invitation for the Brave Ads Self-Serve Beta Program to advertisers over the next several weeks, with the goal of transitioning from the Self-Serve Beta Program to the fully accessible public-facing Self-Serve Brave Ads product for advertisers by the end of 2023.&nbsp; 
 With Brave Wallet featuring NFT Gallery support, we’re beginning to work more closely with Brave Advertisers as&nbsp;technology partners to explore additional NFT utility tie-ins for BAT Collaboration NFT holders, along with POAPs and other NFT utility use cases. Brave and BAT are well positioned to provide additional real world value for brands with this innovative technology, and we’re excited for the opportunity to bring more brands into Web3.

 Press release: Nym and Chainsafe bring enhanced privacy to over half a million Ethereum validators worldwide <p>Nym and Chainsafe bring enhanced privacy to over half a million Ethereum validators worldwide</p><p>Denver, Colorado, USA — Thursday, 02 March 2023: Today at ETHDenver 2023, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym</a>, the leader in network layer privacy, announced a Nym integration with Ethereum validators and even clients to provide network-level privacy to the entire ecosystem.</p><p>A libp2p module enables over half a million ethereum validators worldwide to shield transactions via the Nym mixnet. The module will prevent Ethereum validators from leaking their IP addresses and metadata, protecting them from DDoS attacks. The first implementation is being written for the Lighthouse consensus client, in collaboration with <a href="https://chainsafe.io/">Chainsafe</a>, a leading blockchain development and engineering solutions firm.</p><p>Harry Halpin, CEO of Nym Technologies, said “Ethereum is the least private of blockchain networks currently, endangering users who may have their IP address harvested as well as validators themselves. Ethereum’s new proof-of-stake consensus protocol is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, as described by Adam Back and others as early as 2001 in the paper <a href="http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/pubs/traffic.pdf">Traffic Analysis Attacks and Trade-Offs in Anonymity Providing Systems</a>.”</p><p>Ethereum’s transition to a PoS consensus last year requires increased coordination and traffic between validators, which exposes systems sensitive information, notably giving advanced information on which validator will be the block proposer for a given slot. The mixnet integration for Ethereum consensus clients anonymize this traffic between validators, thereby solving vulnerabilities to DDoS attacks, MEV bots and even helping prevent the censorship of transactions.</p><p>Following the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/24/ethereum-software-firm-consensys-reveals-it-collects-user-data/">revelations</a> of how user data was being handled by node infrastructure providers and wallets, the issue of privacy in Web3 became more pressing than ever before. At his talk in ETHDenver, Harry Halpin demonstrated how the Nym mixnet can also be used with Metamask to prevent the harvesting of a user’s IP&nbsp;address.</p><p>“We are incredibly proud to be collaborating with Nym to make Ethereum and libp2p more private, enabling a new wave of innovation with mixnet capabilities. This is a massive step towards the vision of a privacy preserving Ethereum.” said Elizabeth Binks, Privacy Engineering Lead at ChainSafe.</p><p>Further work will continue to ensure improved functionality, including low latency and ease of configuration to ensure scalability as the validator count is predicted to increase exponentially after the impending Shanghai&nbsp;Upgrade.</p><p>Decentralized systems are particularly prone to network layer vulnerabilities due to the sheer volume of traffic that has to pass between nodes. This makes privacy for key infrastructure operations essential for the overall security of decentralized systems. The Nym mixnet, which is chain agnostic, provides metadata protections for the security of both people as well as&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance.</p><p>About ChainSafe:</p><p>ChainSafe is a leading blockchain research and development firm specializing in infrastructure solutions for web3. Alongside contributions to ecosystems such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Filecoin, and more, ChainSafe creates solutions for developers and teams across the web3 space utilizing our expertise in gaming, bridging, NFTs, and decentralized storage.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Candice Teo, <a href="mailto:candice@nymtech.net">candice@nymtech.net</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-and-chainsafe-bring-enhanced-privacy-to-over-half-a-million-ethereum-validators-9792cbdedebd">Press release: Nym and Chainsafe bring enhanced privacy to over half a million Ethereum validators…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As businesses and organisations continue to grow and expand, prioritising environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly important. One way to do this is by implementing blockchain technology into your enterprise. Let’s dive deeper!</p>



 Why Your Enterprise Should Adopt Blockchain for Environmental Sustainability 



<p>Blockchain is a decentralised digital ledger. Blockchain technology allows for the secure recording and verification of transactions without the need for a central authority. This technology has the potential to revolutionise the way businesses operate, including by making them more environmentally friendly. By using blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your enterprise can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future. And outside of the obvious benefits for the environment, it can also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/10/why-corporate-strategies-should-be-focused-on-sustainability/?sh=604551947e9f">help propel your business forward in different ways.</a></p>



 How Blockchain Can Help Your Business Go Green 



<p>Multiple ways exist in which blockchain technology can help your business go green. Summarised below are some of the main ways in which blockchain technology can make an impact:</p>



 
 Tracking and verifying environmentally responsible practices 



 Facilitating the exchange of renewable energy 



 Blockchain-powered waste management systems 



 Creating and managing carbon credits 
 



 Using Blockchain To Track and Verify Environmentally Responsible Practices 



<p>One way that blockchain can help is by enabling the tracking and verification of environmentally responsible practices. For example, by using blockchain technology, a supply chain can track the origin and journey of products, ensuring that they were produced using sustainable methods.</p>



<p>This level of transparency can help consumers make more informed choices about the products they purchase. Moreover it encourages businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices in order to maintain their reputation. Additionally, the use of blockchain can help businesses to detect and prevent fraud, such as the sale of counterfeit or environmentally damaging products.</p>



<p>In this way, blockchain can help promote environmental responsibility and sustainability within the business community. By enabling more transparent and accountable business practices, blockchain technology can support the development of a more sustainable and environmentally friendly economy.</p>



 Facilitating the Exchange of Renewable Energy Using Blockchain 



<p>Blockchain can also be used to facilitate the exchange of renewable energy. It ensures renewable energy can be tracked, traded, and sold in a secure and transparent manner. This can help to create a more efficient and reliable renewable energy market, as well as enable individuals and businesses to easily access and use renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the use of smart contracts on the blockchain can automate the process of buying and selling renewable energy. This makes it even more convenient and efficient. Overall, the use of blockchain in the renewable energy industry can greatly accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly energy system that is less reliant on fossil fuels.</p>



 Using Blockchain To Create and Manage Carbon Credits 



<p>Another way in which blockchain technology can help businesses become more environmentally friendly is by enabling the creation and management of carbon credits. Carbon credits are a way for businesses to offset their carbon emissions by supporting renewable energy projects or other initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



Source:<a href="https://www.shell.com/business-customers/trading-and-supply/trading/shell-energy-europe/clean-energy-solutions/voluntary-carbon-credits.html"> Shell </a>



<p>Using blockchain, businesses can create and trade carbon credits in a transparent and secure manner. This allows for the efficient and cost-effective management of carbon emissions. It provides businesses with a way to offset their environmental impact. Furthermore, the use of blockchain can help ensure the integrity and verifiability of carbon credits, making it easier for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.</p>



<p>Overall, the use of blockchain for carbon credit management can support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Thereof, it can help businesses reduce/offset their environmental impact.</p>



 Blockchain-Powered Waste Management Systems 



<p>In addition to the previous benefits, blockchain technology can also help improve supply chain efficiency, reducing waste and enabling more transparent and accountable business practices through creating decentralised waste management systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a decentralised waste management system, blockchain can be used to track and verify the disposal of waste materials. This can help to ensure that waste is disposed of in a sustainable and responsible manner, reducing the environmental impact of waste. Additionally, one can use blockchain technology to incentivise sustainable waste disposal practices, such as recycling and composting. For example, businesses and individuals could be rewarded with tokens or other digital assets for properly disposing of waste.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the use of blockchain can help to improve the efficiency of waste management systems. By securely and transparently tracking waste materials, blockchain can help to reduce waste and prevent fraud, such as the illegal dumping of waste. This can help to make waste management systems more cost-effective and sustainable.</p>







 Blockchains Do Not Have To Consume Tons of Energy 



<p>But what about the energy consumption of blockchains in general? It is true that many blockchain protocols, such as the one used by the Bitcoin network, rely on energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanisms. This means that validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain requires a large amount of computing power. However, it is important to note that not all blockchain protocols operate in this way.</p>



<p>There are also blockchain protocols that use different kinds of consensus mechanisms, such as the delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is much more energy efficient. In a delegated proof-of-stake system, the token holders are constantly voting on “delegates”. The delegates who have the most votes at any certain point in time run the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>As a result, delegated proof-of-stake systems are much more energy efficient and scalable than proof-of-work systems. They do not require a large amount of computing power to validate transactions. This makes them a more <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">environmentally friendly and viable option for businesses and organisations</a> that want to use public or private blockchains and require high scalability.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Implementing blockchain technology into your enterprise may require significant investment and resources. However, the long-term benefits of environmental sustainability and improved efficiency are well worth the effort. By using blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your enterprise can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>Today we’re thrilled to announce the latest AI-powered feature in Brave Search: the Summarizer.</p>
<p>The Summarizer provides concise and to-the-point answers at the top of Brave Search results pages, in response to the user’s input, solely based on Web search results. Unlike a purely generative AI model, which is prone to spout unsubstantiated assertions, we trained our large language models (LLMs) to process multiple sources of information present on the Web. This produces a more concise, accurate answer, expressed in coherent language.</p>
<p>In addition, the provenance of original sources of data is cited at all times via links. This maintains the rightful attribution of information, and helps users assess the trustworthiness of the sources, both of which are needed to mitigate the authority biases of large language models.</p>
<p>The Brave Summarizer is available today for all users of Brave Search, on desktop and mobile. For users who would prefer not to use the Summarizer, they can easily turn it off by opting out in settings.</p>

<p>Using Web results enables the Summarizer to provide real-time information that is up to date with today’s events. Given the current advancements in AI, it’s crucial to remind users that one should not believe everything an AI system produces, in much the same way one should not believe everything that is published on the Web. At the risk of stating the obvious, we should not suspend critical thinking for anything we consume, no matter how impressive the results of AI models can be.</p>
<p>Besides the summary itself, our AI models are also able to replace the already query-dependent snippets (result descriptions) with a summarized version of those snippets, highlighting the answer when possible. This can be viewed as a summary of a single source (such as a press article), as opposed to the main summary where multiple sources are considered and aggregated to create a more comprehensive answer. The summary at the top of the results page and these special descriptions co-occur, so users will see the overarching summary as well as snippets with highlighted answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    
    


    


    
    
</p>
<p>Note the highlighted answers in the result snippets</p>
<p>“With 22 million queries per day, Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing. We provide independent search results from our own index of the Web, and today we’re further improving the relevance of those results with our AI-powered Summarizer,” said Josep M. Pujol, Chief of Search at Brave. “Unlike AI chat tools which can provide fabricated responses, the Summarizer generates a plain-written summary at the top of the search results page, aggregating the latest sources on the Web and providing source attribution for transparency and accountability. This open system is available to all Brave Search users today to help them better navigate search results.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike many others that have released similar features recently, we do not rely on third parties, nor do we limit access due to scalability concerns. The Brave Summarizer relies on our owned and operated models that are highly tuned to be as efficient as possible at inference time. Today, Brave Search processes daily peaks of 600 queries per second, which are then evaluated against our AI model. Although a summary is generated for about 17% of queries, we expect this number to grow in the near future as we scale our system. The Brave AI model is probably the largest such system in production to date, in that it receives more traffic than others in terms of queries per second, we apply the Summarizer to all queries, and Bing and Google have yet to open up their systems. <a>1</a></p>
<p>Besides scalability, a tremendous effort has been put into ensuring the quality of the generated summaries. However, as the model is still in its early phase of development, there is the possibility of producing “hallucinations,” which mix unrelated snippets into a single result. There is also the possibility of some false or offensive text, but our aim is to continue working on improving the models as our users’ feedback starts pouring in.</p>
<p>The Summarizer was fully developed by the Brave Search team and as such is based on the same principles of independence and privacy that we apply across all products. The Summarizer is not powered by ChatGPT or its backend systems; it is instead composed of three different LLMs <a>2</a> trained on different tasks:</p>
 
 
<p>The first one is QA (question answering): this model is used to try to extract a concrete answer, if any, from text snippets. Brave has been using LLMs for a while to improve search relevance, and this is an extension of what Brave Search already had in place to power its knowledge graph and featured snippets features. The difference lies in the number and length of text snippets analyzed.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>After the QA extraction phase, result candidates are further classified with an ensemble of zero-shot classifiers on a wide variety of criteria (hate-speech, vulgar writing, spam, etc).&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>The final set of candidate text is ultimately processed by the summarizer/paraphrasing model, which tries to rewrite the input so that repetition is removed and that language is kept uniform to improve readability.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>We plan to share more technical details with special emphasis on the scalability aspect and lessons learned after the first weeks of our large scale release.</p>
<p>Note that the Summarizer is currently disabled in Brave Search Goggles (an innovative Brave Search feature that enables users to create filters to alter the ordering of search results) <a>3</a>, while we refine our models to guarantee  the quality of the input source for user-generated Goggles. We’ll be sharing more details about the Summarizer for Goggles in the near future.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions 
<p>The Brave Search Summarizer comes on top of multiple developments we integrated to improve search relevance in the past, and more recent developments that were triggered after the release of ChatGPT last December, notably after the announcement that Microsoft would deeply integrate OpenAI’s models into their search engine Bing. Although it has not been publicly released, early feedback of their model ranges from impressive <a>4</a> to scary <a>5</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the industry is generating much hype around AI, at Brave we are not yet convinced that LLMs can replace search as we know it. However, if used properly, these new models can help the user navigate results, which is the approach we follow with the Summarizer. Chat-like interfaces and oracle-based search remain unproven and, as of today, we remain skeptical that they’ll be useful for all search tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, we are strong believers in any new technology that helps users satisfy their needs and puts them in control of their online experience. We will continue exploring how to apply LLMs not only to the search field, but also to the Brave browser, where we expect the assistant-like capabilities of LLMs to be truly fruitful and revolutionary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave has a history of taking up big challenges, offering credible alternatives to BigTech. The Brave browser has over 57 million monthly active users, and Brave Search serves more than 22 million queries per day out of its independent index, which makes it the biggest search engine after Bing, Google, and other engines relying on Bing or Google APIs. Though it’s still early, we expect our developments with AI to follow a similar path and see proven user adoption.</p>
<p>Brave Search is available on all <a>Brave</a> browsers (desktop, Android, and iOS), and is also available from any other browser at <a href="https://search.brave.com/">search.brave.com</a>.</p>

							<p>The Zcash Foundation has been looking into <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1256.pdf">Oblivious Message Retrieval (OMR)</a> to determine whether it offers a potential solution to the recent performance problems that have affected Zcash wallet users, and whether there are any advantages to be gained from implementing this in a Zcash context. For example, can OMR be used to address the privacy leaks of using lightwalletd? Light wallets like Nighthawk Wallet, Zecwallet Lite, and YWallet use lightwalletd to fetch and send Zcash transactions, without the overhead of running a full node locally. Would running OMR on a full node provide us with any performance advantages when fetching transactions?&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 The Current Lightwalletd Architecture 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Light wallets are typically used to download shielded transactions via a lightwalletd server. To preserve privacy about which transactions a wallet is interested in, one can download all the transactions in full. However, this is expensive and nearly amounts to the full blockchain in size/bandwidth, which is not great for lighter devices or those with low bandwidth/network speed, etc. This is why the lightwallet protocol exists.</p><p>Most light wallets fetch a limited amount of data about every shielded transaction (i.e. a `CompactTx`) from a lightwalletd proxy, just enough to allow trial decryption. The wallet trial-decrypts every `CompactTx` to see if that transaction has been sent to them. This is because all shielded transactions on the Zcash blockchain are encrypted and indistinguishable from the others such that no one can tell which transactions are addressed to whom, unless you have the incoming viewing key to decrypt them. Trial decryption takes more computational effort than transparent syncing, proportional to how many shielded transactions are on on-chain, but <a href="https://hackmd.io/@str4d/dagsync-graph-aware-zcash-wallets">advances</a> in <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zecwallets-blazesync-sync-entire-chain-in-60s/39447">syncing algorithms</a> have made this cheaper. However, to construct new transactions, a wallet needs data that’s not included in CompactTxs or CompactBlocks, so after detecting a transaction, the wallet has to fetch the full transaction via lightwalletd. Everything stays encrypted for shielded transactions (the ‘data’), but now the lightwalletd proxy knows that a wallet with a certain IP address has requested a certain subset of Zcash shielded transactions, at a specific time (‘metadata’). This is an unfortunate and undesirable privacy leak.</p><p>It would be better if we can trial-decrypt and fetch transactions privately, and also not have to download all transactions in full to do so.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 What If We Can Do Better? 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							Oblivious Message Retrieval (OMR) is a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1256.pdf">construction</a> from Zeyu (Thomas) Liu and Eran Tromer that uses lattice-based (LWE) fully-homomorphic encryption. It allows a full node to scan the Zcash blockchain for shielded transactions encrypted for a particular recipient and return just the transactions they need without knowing the full query or the results in plaintext. This would offload more computational effort and bandwidth requirements to a full node while also protecting the metadata privacy of a user or wallet, hiding which Zcash transactions the recipient cares about. The only thing the OMR-compatible full node learns about the user is that they are interested in OMR-compatible transactions, but not which ones.

							<p>At a high level, here’s how a version of Zcash that supports Oblivious Message Retrieval could work:</p><p>A user generates an updated unified address that includes a new clue key (this also supports diversified addresses). When sending money to an OMR-supporting address, the regular Zcash shielded transaction will occur, but the transaction will also include a clue ciphertext. This clue ciphertext is about 1KB of additional data per shielded output.</p><p>The user then generates a detection key and registers that with an OMR-supporting Zcash full node. The node uses that detection key to scan all the shielded transactions on the chain and their attached clue ciphertexts. The scanning involves taking all the transactions, including the clue ciphertexts, and fully-homomorphically, trying to use the detection key to decrypt the clue ciphertexts associated with the shielded transactions.</p><p>This is the magic of fully-homomorphic encryption: the full node cannot distinguish the (encrypted) secret key that is trying to decrypt the clue ciphertexts, as it is homomorphically encrypted, but it can still do the computation and return the encrypted results of the computation to the holder of the detection secret key.</p><p>As the OMR-compatible full node scans all the transactions, it homomorphically accumulates all the transactions whose clue ciphertexts decrypt under the clue secret key, and returns the digest of all the transactions as a new homomorphically-encrypted result. The user can then decrypt those results with the detection secret key, and then have all the Zcash transactions relevant to their wallet ready to go. The full node does not know which transactions are relevant to the wallet, as it processes all of them and computes the matching under fully-homomorphic encrypted computation.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 What might this feel like? (beyond lightwalletd flow) 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>OMR supports two kinds of querying for results that support multiple ways for a wallet developer or other client to interact with an OMR-supporting full node:</p><p>“Sync” querying – In the single-shot model, the recipient makes a stateless query to the full node: it provides a detection key, a range of blocks to scan, and a bound k on the number of pertinent messages, and asks the node to digest those blocks with respect to that key. The detector runs all of the `Retrieve` algorithm. Response latency is high: about 0.145 sec per transaction.</p><p>“Async” querying – The subscribe and finalize model utilizes the streaming variant. The user provides a detection key and asks to subscribe to ongoing (and perhaps some past) transactions. The node starts processing these transactions, doing most of the computation (i.e. homomorphically computing the PV ciphertexts). Later, the user shows up and asks the server to finalize the results and pack them into a digest, with respect to some k. Neither the finalization time nor message bound k need be known in advance. This reduces finalization to 0.35 milliseconds/tx per core.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter approach fits in nicely with the steady-state wallet UX: open up wallet app every once in a while, get an up-to-date view of wallet state ~immediately, then take an action.</p><p>This is attractive to wallet developers and users who value the privacy gains of OMR, but hopefully would not sacrifice usability and experience to achieve them.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 This Sounds Great! Are We Doing This? 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Well, we’re trying to figure that out. Zcash has changed a bit since OMR was first published (we have Orchard Actions now, for example). There are design decisions we would have to make about the Zcash protocol in order to support OMR, and other compatibility, design, and UX questions we’d have to address. Such as:</p>  How backwards compatible is this?  Requires an updated key/address (see below), but also new changes to shielded transactions, specifically the inclusion of 956 bytes of clue data per shielded transaction (or specifically per description: Sapling Output, may need to be updated for Orchard Actions). This is okay but requires a network upgrade and coordination between node and wallet developers. It also increases the transaction size, in addition to the larger Orchard Actions from NU5.  “It would be the cleanest to extend the transaction format with a dedicated clue field,” according to the OMR paper. The clue is 1KB per spend.      Do I need to generate new keys and a new address?  Well, kind of. You need to generate a new clue key to be part of the address, so with Unified Addresses, this can be a new extension with existing Sapling/Orchard key material, but the Unified Address will look different. This clue key uses a different type of cryptography from the Sapling/Orchard keys so we can’t reuse the other keys to support Oblivious Message Retrieval.  Per the constructions proposed in the OMR paper, the clue key is 133KB. That’s right, kilobytes (thanks, lattices!) This is too big for a regular QR code encoding, or hex/ascii string, but, an alternative that should work in the Unified Address framework, and instead of having the full clue key inlined in the address, we encode and inline a link to and hash of the clue key, and fetch it from somewhere else. The clue key is a ~public key.  How can we maintain trust and anonymity if we host OMR keys on another platform? Key transparency?  When you set up a full node to do OMR detection for you, you generate and upload a detection key. This key is not part of your address. It is even larger than the clue key, at ~129MB (yes, megabytes). This is a one-time upload for recipients, but full nodes will have to keep them per-recipient as long as they are privately scanning for that user. The Zcash mainnet chain is coming up on 100GB in size, and storage is relatively cheap, but this does mean adding another recipient client as a full node has non-negligible storage costs as well as the computation costs, and the clue key size may restrict the number of addresses that can be detected live together, as some use cases involve hundreds or thousands of keys.      What about diversified addresses?  OMR clue keys are diversifiable, so that property of unlinkable keys is maintained; incoming payments sent to any of a user’s (multiple) diversified addresses can be retrieved and spent using a single key tuple.      How much compute does this require from full node operators?  “∼$1.02 per million payments scanned (for each recipient served), using commodity cloud computing,” according to the OMR paper. This is about the whole current Zcash mainnet chain right now so it sounds scalable and affordable to serve multiple recipients.      If I serve a lot of OMR recipients on one full node, will query latency suffer?  Hard to say before there is a full implementation to test. Using the subscribe and finalize query model for the general wallet case would indicate it could be quite fast and scale well in general in an async-supporting full node like zebrad.      This is based on lattices, does that mean it’s post-quantum secure?  It looks like it, yes!      How is this different from viewing keys?  Registering viewing keys (incoming, outgoing, or full) with a full node and having them scan the chain on a user’s behalf gets close to the data flow of OMR, but with one crucial difference: the node can see which shielded transactions you are interested in and addressed to you, and can read the memo field, transaction value, and target address. OMR does not allow this.    						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 What's Next? 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>If it were possible to deploy OMR without the need for a network update and/or other significant changes (such as addresses), then we would be looking very closely at doing so. However, given the effort involved, we don’t think it’s a priority at this time, and we would want to consider alternative performance improvement approaches (like detection keys).</p>

<p>The Nym mixnet has a shared history with Bitcoin. Unsurprisingly, we at Nym want Bitcoiners to have the best privacy possible! We are therefore proud to announce that we are supporting Blockstream by adding the <a href="https://blockstream.com/green/">Blockstream Green Bitcoin wallet</a> to <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">Nym Connect</a> due to its <a href="https://liquid.net">Liquid</a>’s privacy features. We want to take this opportunity to delve into the pre-history of Bitcoin and its shared history with&nbsp;mixnets…</p><p>With the invention of Bitcoin, Satoshi brought together major work by the cypherpunk movement, who were working on technologies for anonymous communication like mixnets — the technology for network-level privacy, launched by Nym. Reviewing this history can help us understand how technologies can promote human freedoms and evolve in the most unexpected ways. The cypherpunks were prophetic in their understanding of how easily the internet would become a vehicle for mass surveillance. It is time to join forces and put their solution to work. Looking towards the future evolution of Bitcoin, the combination of the two technologies via integration into Liquid, Lightning and the wider Bitcoin ecosystem would bring to fruition much of this important work.</p><a href="https://blockstream.com/green/">Blockstream Green</a> over the mixnet using <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a> Mixnets: a short pre-history of&nbsp;Bitcoin <p>Mixnets like Nym were originally invented by David Chaum in his famous paper <a href="https://chaum.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chaum-mix.pdf">“Untraceable electronic mail, return addresses, and digital pseudonyms”</a>. A mixnet mixes packets to unlink the sender and the receiver. Unfortunately, every time you use Bitcoin (or Lightning), your IP address and the timing and volume of your information leak. Nym Chief Scientist Claudia Diaz has shown how this leaking ‘metadata’ about your communications can be used to uniquely identify you. We recommend you read her paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11860">On the Anonymity of Peer-To-Peer Network Anonymity Schemes Used by Cryptocurrencies</a> with Piyush Kumar Sharma and Devashish Gosain — (which will be presented at <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/">NDSS</a> this&nbsp;week!)</p><p>Proof of work was invented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdwOXWmAs8Y">Adam Back’s work on mixnets</a>: Adam Back was running the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixminion">Mixmaster</a> mixnet (a pre-Nym mixnet), which provided anonymous e-mail services to spread information anonymously. When anti-privacy fanatics attacked his mixnet by flooding it with fake messages, Adam Back decided he needed a way to stop this e-mail spam. Importantly, to do so without assigning each person a unique identity, allowing users of the mixnet to remain anonymous. He implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash">HashCash</a> to serve as a way to defeat sybil attacks, by forcing any user of the mixnet to solve a hash puzzle. This effectively defeated spam&nbsp;attacks.</p><p>Famously, Satoshi Nakamoto then used this idea from HashCash to reach consensus in the Bitcoin blockchain (solving the <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/byz.pdf">Byzantine Generals Problem</a>) without uniquely identifying nodes in the Bitcoin network. It is this fundamental invention that makes Bitcoin permissionless. And with this history, we dare say it’s quite likely that Satoshi Nakamoto was a mixnet&nbsp;user!</p><p>While Bitcoin creates different public keys per transaction and so allows some basic privacy, a well-resourced attacker like a government or Chainalysis can identify Bitcoin users by using only on-chain information. Enter the <a href="https://liquid.net/">Liquid</a> sidechain, whose use of confidential transactions via homomorphic encryption and blinded (stealth) addresses allow more privacy on Bitcoin than our prior integration with Electrum, at the cost of dependency on a federated side-chain. We strongly encourage Bitcoin users to look into Blockstream Green with Nym Connect for improved privacy for Bitcoin. This is especially useful as the Tor network typically used by Liquid is under <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-network-ddos-attack/">a mysterious attack</a> that makes it harder to use with Blockstream Green.</p><p>We’re happy to see Nym go full circle. The NYM token was originally the NYMPH token on the Liquid blockchain, and since then we’ve launched a NYM token <a href="https://www.regservices.ch/en/definitions/nym-technologies-sa-neuchatel-switzerland/">prospectus</a>. We’ve rewarded early contributors, users and token holders with NYM — although the community has had to go through KYC/AML with long-time Bitcoin supporter <a href="https://stokr.io/">STOKR</a>. Our privacy-first approach will require many other integrations to diverse applications in order to maintain the anonymity of Bitcoin users, but we think even Nakamoto would be thrilled to see Bitcoin transactions going over a mixnet. Further integrations with Bitcoin and Blockstream are in the&nbsp;works!</p>Harry Halpin and father with Blockstream gear that Adam Back sent&nbsp;over<p>Links</p>  Download <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>  Join our <a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> communities!   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/how-mixnets-led-to-bitcoin-blockstream-green-supported-by-nym-connect-85d2ee325012">How Mixnets led to Bitcoin: Blockstream Green supported by Nym Connect!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is a transcript of Panther’s AMA session with CEO Oliver Gale and Head of Product Saif Akhtar. &nbsp;The AMA was conducted with questions collected from Twitter, Discord, and Telegram.<br><br>This article &nbsp;is an edited version of an automatic transcript generated from the live session, so we have included exact times for answers in case you want to visit the video below to listen to a specific section. <br></p><p>Here’s the AMA’s audio in case you want to check it out: </p>     AMA ROAD TO v1 w OLIVER GALE SAIF AKHTAR  0:00 /51:17 1×    When will it be possible to clone the $ZKP token from GitHub? ZKP token is still a private repository, but it is needed as a dependency.<br><br> <p>Saif Akhtar - 2:41</p><p>In the docs, it does mention that the rest of the repositories are going to be opened up progressively. So I think they’re due, and they will be. However, I do want to mention that the token contract itself it's a dependency because everything works together with the token contract. <br></p><p>However, from a dev perspective, and from trialing out perspective, you can pretty much deploy any token, and attach that token contract address and the rest of the places and pretty much test that stuff. <br></p><p>So for a dev, it shouldn't be a blocker. But in general, if the questions about opening up all the other repositories, I think they are a work in progress. It's just that it wasn't part of the advanced staking itself. It might have been overlooked, but they will be progressively opened up.<br></p> What are the potential risks and drawbacks associated with using zkSnarks technology, and how does the project mitigate or address these risks?<br> <p>Oliver Gale - 4:22</p><p>I think one of the well-known risks of zkSnarks is the trusted ceremony setup phase for the Snark itself, and so how that works when it goes right is if one party in this essentially multi party, trusted setup ceremony, is honest, then you have assurances that the zkSnark has no backdoor. However, if all of the parties are dishonest, then the Snark itself has a backdoor: They can recreate the keys and decrypt the information. <br></p><p>So, generally, what you find with snark-based projects is they will seek a relatively large, trusted ceremony and also include actors who have a reputational stake in the privacy space or, in this case, in the blockchain space. <br></p><p>So, I think Saif can share more information on our trusted ceremony setup. Other drawbacks of zkSnarks versus say, Starks are: Starks are more scalable as transaction types, and they don't have a trusted setup. But the Starks themselves have a much higher gas cost for verification of proofs which makes them good for different use cases and bad for other use cases.<br></p><p>One of the interesting things with the zkSnarks space, and both STARKS and SNARKS are progressing rapidly. There's a lot of research and activity around it. But there are things like Halo which may provide the early validation that zkSnarks can also operate using recursive proofs which removes the need to have a trusted setup.<br></p><p>So, there's a lot of promising technology. Obviously, it's been put into production by multiple players in the web three space for different use cases. I think, for what Panther is building. Our team has chosen the right technology, and zkSnarks are more appropriate than a Stark-driven approach, given where Starks are today.<br></p><p>Carlos - 6:57</p><p>Would you would like to add anything to that Saif?<br></p><p>Saif - 7:00</p><p>No, I think that was well said. Just one point. I think the question also says: what are we doing to mitigate? <br></p><p>I mean, we're using Groth16, which is kind of the standard SNARK system used today. It's proof size, and verification time are the best from the perspective of what it does. <br></p><p>Although, Oliver mentioned the pre-processing setup, and the ceremony that is done. In other words, what we have been thinking of is the eventual movement to PLONK, which increases a little bit on the proof size. The verification time also increases a little bit as compared to Groth16.<br></p><p>But the advantage is there’s a universal set up, rather than a setup for each circuit. So that's a big advantage of PLONK. However, I wouldn't say this is the exact next step for us, or that this is in the roadmap. For us, the most important part is to deliver with Groth16. And then look at how things evolve and how new STARKs systems evolve. Then the community decides, from a technical front, how things should move for Panther.<br></p> When it comes to DAO and community proposals, users could use coins and NFTs to vote. How can Panther protect voters’ privacy in governance proposals?<br> <p>Saif - 9:26</p><p>Private voting is a good use case for the ZK technology in general. And proving membership from a set is one of the applications of ZK, where private voting can be, can be utilized. You basically prove that you are one of the DAO members and you're voting, but you don't disclose which member it is exactly, and how much voting power he had. <br></p><p>So, it's a good concept. From a Panther perspective, this is not on the roadmap. Again, I would say these are the adjacent solutions that are good to have. I really want to focus on delivering what is on the roadmap in the next six to nine months. And then we evaluate, and the community evaluates, what adjacent technologies could be built around it.<br></p><p>Oliver - 10:26</p><p>I think -- just to add on the adjacent technology component. You know, our focus is to deliver what we committed to, which is the primary use case that what we think is the primary driver of utility for the protocol. That’s the multi-asset shielded pools and the ecosystem of DeFi integrations and bridges. <br></p><p>That said, yes, the core Panther protocol technology can enable things like private voting. For those who have been in this community From the earlier days, we actually had a sub-protocol called LaunchDAO, which was used to vote on whether or not Panther protocol should be launched with basic staking. We utilized a zero-knowledge private token scheme, which also had implicitly built into that some identity functions as well.<br></p><p>So we do recognize that the building blocks are there. And it's an exciting opportunity to explore in later iterations of the protocol. I think also, just to add a comment – my view on identity standards and trying to tackle the identity space is that you have to create the use cases for the identity first. Identity sort of emerges as a byproduct. It would, in my view, not be an advisable strategy to tackle things like digital identity, and to a lesser extent, voting, head-on when the primary driver should be to create utility, grow the user base of Pather Protocol. From that user base, we can then assess implementing additional products or features.<br></p><p>Carlos - 12:17</p><p>Yeah, great answer. Especially when it comes to private voting, people can, in fact, look at LaunchDAO and the way Panther was launched, as an example of some private voting mechanism. Although I reckon, if we implement private voting, it will be with a different style. <br></p> Will zSwap be available in v1. And when will v1 be launching?<br> <p>Saif Akhtar - 13:01</p><p>Short answer is yes. The work has been started and is in progress. Whether it will be included in v1 is a good question. I think it depends on a lot of other things that are being done from a core v1 perspective and the compliance tech. However, if you ask me, I would love to have it on v1.<br></p><p>Carlos - 13:28</p><p>Yeah, we're also preparing more content related to zSwap. Because, as we have started to show the community, a lot of the UI components of it are ready for production or are in the near-final stage, although they're still pending some minor changes. So we will continue to introduce stuff related to it because it's very important for Panther's mission of private DeFi access. <br></p> Which DeFi protocol will be the first integrated into Panther? Or will it just bridge different blockchains? <p>Carlos -</p><p>I would like to just quickly clear the second part of the question there. Panther's vision is to enable private DeFi access, not just enable a cross-chain ecosystem. So yes, we want to integrate with DeFi protocols. As for which ones will be the first to be integrated, I'll let Saif answer that.<br></p><p>Saif - 14:31</p><p>Yeah, I mean, it will be. Again, these are the parts where the community will come out and make suggestions. However I will say the testing is being done on Polygon as we speak, with three major top three DeFi protocols: Uniswap, Quickswap, and I believe, Curve. And those three integrations’ work is in progress. <br></p><p>However, I expect that there is some discussion going on. And people come up and say, you know, these discussions or these integrations make more sense. And also the pair. I mean, for me, and for testing the product, the obvious choice is, hey, let's look at the top three by TVL. Let's look at the top 10, or top 20 pairs. That makes more sense from Panther’s perspective. And then put it out there, let the community also contribute to those key decision-making process and go from there.<br></p><p>Carlos - 15:39</p><p>Anything that you'd like to add, from your perspective, related to v1 or to zSwap, Oliver?<br></p><p>Oliver Gale - 15:47</p><p>I mean, no, not really. The first principle of target liquidity is target where there is demand and serve that. It’s a fairly logical conclusion to come from, or come to, and that's what we are aiming to do to tap into protocols that have TVL. <br></p><p>And so I'm just commenting on the issue of bridging into different chains. Here's the issue. The issue is, there are many L1 and L2 chains who are competing with one another for developers and for locals to deploy on their L1 or L2. <br></p><p>The bottom line is, what is the organic reason to deploy on anyone else's smart contract protocol? The answer is because there is an active user base there, there's liquidity there, there is value locked on these chains. And it makes sense for us to participate in and add to this ecosystem. <br></p><p>So you can sort of look at the top protocols by these types of metrics. And those are the protocols that Panther is most inclined to build bridges and DeFi adapters and shielded pools on to. <br></p><p>Then on the other side, there's, of course, the token incentive mechanism, which usually comes in the form of grants. So, whenever we see ambitious protocols which are willing to subsidize – and it's usually a subsidy and not a full coverage of development costs – subsidize the cost of deployment and other chains, then we are happy to deploy on those chains and support them in their vision and their growth. <br></p><p>One other metric which we don't see but which is important, is really the Ecosystem Development Partnership. Some protocols and their foundations or teams take a more proactive approach to actually fostering partnerships. So when we see, L1 and L2 chains that propose that they will make introductions and help Panther Protocol partner with other players – CeFi or DeFi players – we find that to be a compelling reason as well. But again, obviously, those additional incentives. It's really just a function of “where is the activity?”. That's where Panther protocol should be.<br></p> How far are we from launching on different additional chains? If Panther is close to v1, what about Avax, Belux, Aurora, NEAR, or even other blockchains?<br> <p>Carlos - 18:40</p><p>I reckon the question should be thought about in terms of not how far we are, but of the overall rollout strategy for different chains. Saif, could you enlighten us on that?<br></p><p>Saif - 19:26</p><p>Yeah, the overall strategy is: work with these partners and align/agree on what is the best time for them and for Panther. <br></p><p>Having said that, the goal is that Panther should be launched on multiple chains at v1 as individual solutions. In the future then, those individual solutions or individual MASPs are integrated through our ZK bridging technology and that's how the interchain starts to work. <br></p><p>So the Flare discussion is ongoing. Again, we have sent a complete, detailed task list to Flare. <br></p><p>Like I said before, I think there's a lot of dependency on other chains. So that's one. The second part about BNB is, I think the BD team just recently submitted a grant application for Binance. If that is approved, then obviously, we will prioritize Binance. <br></p><p>So two things there. In short, one is the prioritization from a grant perspective. And then the second one would be, if there is no grant, then we will prioritize based what makes sense for Panther.<br></p><p>I would like to deploy on one chain, make sure it's battle-tested, make sure everything is where everything works well, and then continue to expand on other chains, rather than dumping everything on multiple chains and having to deal with multiple problems. So there will be technical decisions versus also commercial decisions that come to play in terms of how it will be integrated.<br></p> When will we have more liquidity on Polygon and Ethereum?<br> <p>Carlos - 21:26</p><p>I reckon we may have an interesting perspective now that the DAO has also experimented with centralized exchange listings. <br></p><p>Oliver - 21:50</p><p>Yeah, well, so the answer is, we are right now amid discussion about a proposal coming to the DAO to add liquidity to Uniswap. <br></p><p>There are also some, you know, Uniswap v2, Uniswap v3, potentially on ETH, as opposed to purely just on Polygon. There are questions of, do you want to build utility directly onto the trading pair? Or is there also benefit in providing access to new users to come into the ecosystem liquidity onto Ethereum. These are valid utility drivers in both cases. <br></p><p>There's also some evaluation of v3 active liquidity managers, by way of protocol-to-protocol partnerships that we're exploring. You know, with the recent uptick in the market, this is a good time to be evaluating these. I'm looking forward to seeing how the MEXC listing resolves itself, and then the next priority will be taxability.<br></p> What costs will be on the protocol itself?<br> <p>Carlos - 23:06</p><p>So, for example, how much ZKP it will cost to turn one ETH into one zETH. I know that there has been some progress on the design of fees that is not final, because anything related directly to the protocol will have to go through a DAO proposal, but what can you tell us about the fee mechanism design, Saif? <br></p><p>Saif - 23:45</p><p>For that specific question, I will say there is no fee, or there is no fee in the design structure to convert an asset into a zAsset. Nothing other than the gas costs or the transaction, which again, is something that is being considered on how to handle that.<br></p><p>Carlos - 24:10</p><p>Okay, yeah, we're speeding up the pace a little bit, because we have 15 minutes left, more like 10 right now, at most. So yeah, let's say –<br><br></p><p>Saif - 24:20</p><p>Just to add there, I would refer all the “fees and rewards” questions – I don't know if we have docs already out there – but as we are finalizing the coding and as the testing is coming into play, there should be a good set of docs available to understand how fees impact, you know, what transaction include fees and things like that.<br></p><p>Oliver - 24:51</p><p>Panther’s shielded pools are a DEX type infrastructure. So the idea is you don't really make money on way-in and way-out. That will be the case on v1 because there are no fees inside of the shielded pool. The shielded pool operates like a same-type, same-asset swap mechanism.</p><p>So, Panther protocol will be looking into things which are equivalent to the fees charged on DEXes. That's the core service. Charges and fees will be DAO governed but will be determined on the basis of the comparable costs for bridging assets across chains. And then, because its privacy and computation costs are higher, there will be some premium on that. So that's how you figure out how fees work.<br></p> What makes ZKP distinct from other ZK technology, such as a zkEVM. How is ZKP different and what is the better ZK solution?<br> <p>Saif - 26:16</p><p>Well, if you're talking about Panther in itself, you know Panther is not zkEVM. And the question is, how is $ZKP different? I'm trying to understand where the reference to ZKP is ZKP proofs in general or if $ZKP means Panther in this question.<br></p><p>Oliver - 26:36</p><p>I would say answer it as Panther. I think that's the question.<br></p><p>Saif - 26:42</p><p>Yeah, so zkEVMs are dedicated blockchains, where the zero-knowledge proving happens inside the EVM itself. Panther is chain agnostic. It's a smart contract, utilizing the zero-knowledge libraries to create these circuits that prove the zero-knowledge aspect. Basically, we use zSNARKs and Grant 16, in that respect, to be precise. So this is something that can be deployed on any EVM chains at this moment, hence the difference. What was the other question, Carlos? <br></p><p>Carlos - 27:27</p><p>A follow-up from me, if you don't mind. Am I right to assume that a zkEVM does not necessarily imply privacy, just scalability?<br></p><p>Saif - 27:38</p><p>No, there is privacy there. It's not just scalability. I mean, when you're looking at scalability, those are more the roll-ups, the zk-rollups. Those are more specific to solutions to scale. But the zkEVM itself is more sort of a privacy solution at the EVM level.<br></p><p>Oliver - &nbsp;28:07</p><p>I just want to say something on that. If you're building a zkEVM, you're competing in the L1 and L2 space. So your goal is to beat the other L1s and L2s with a superior proposition. They almost suffer from the same problem at the core, which is that they need developers, they need network effects. They need TVL and they need users. The competition for zkEVM is higher. So there are trade-offs between transaction latency, fees and security – the typical blockchain trilemma problem. That's the space that any smart contract protocol is operating within. <br></p><p>Panther is not operating within that space. We're operating within the dApplication space. Often every fund, every asset manager, every broker, every exchange, every user, and every computation may have some requirements for privacy at some point or the other. And if we deploy this protocol onto these virtual machines, we can enable the other ecosystem applications to function. If we were to bet on a zkEVM, that would be all of our eggs in one basket. By building Panther we've said we’re multi-asset. We're not interested in who wins 10 years from now. We're just interested in Panther being on that protocol. Higher expected outcome.<br></p> What is the go-to market strategy for the project? And how does it plan to gain traction and adoption in the DeFi ecosystem?<br> <p>Oliver Gale - 29:52</p><p>For the community, members have been tracking the conversations happening in Telegram. As many in our community would know, we've been reevaluating the architecture in light of the Tornado Cash sanctions and the likely further restrictions of who've been facilitating things like laundering of North Korean funds, and stuff like that – criminal proceeds. &nbsp; <br></p><p>So we've taken all of that into account and extensively assessed what it looks like and the summary of Panther is: Panther is going to launch a zone that is currently codenamed T1000. &nbsp;<br></p><p>The first thing is, the Panther multi-asset shielded pool is being subdivided into zones, and each zone will be run by a guardian. The Guardian is your Creator of the zone, and they take responsibility for the actions and transactions that happen within their zone. It is a separate environment that shares the anonymity set of the entire multi-asset shielded pool. <br></p><p>And so, in that sense, new entrants don't have to start bootstrapping from zero, as far as privacy is concerned. At the same time, these actors can actually run the institutional dark pools, which is an example of how well-used things like dark pools are. Now, these are compliant, alternative trading systems in the TadFi world. So in the DeFi equivalent, Panther is enabling this type of deployment along with any permutation, for example, payment networks, brokerage services, etc. <br></p><p>So Panther is looking at enabling these bespoke zones to service different niches within multiple markets across multiple chains, and to bridge transactions between zones and between chains. That’s the end game. Stepping back from that, the goal of the market is to deploy a limited retail zone, if you will. This zone–we’re codenaming T1000, which is indicative of the fact that users will do basic sanction screening, identity checks, and so forth and will be able to transact within that zone, under $1,000 per day. They can do that as long as the zone is operating, which we expect will be in perpetuity. <br></p><p>In parallel to that, we're having discussions with some of these regulated FinTech broker crypto players, to get them to run their own zones and to begin offering private or confidential DeFi services to their user bases and their networks. We're seeing a lot of interest in that. So it is this approach where we're not – if the audience is familiar with Aztec, Aztec has implemented some sanction screening. We've taken a more thorough look at what this looks like in terms of data controller relationships, transaction amounts, due diligence, and so forth, and have come to a place where we can launch this zone, and have it be a permission zone, but with some checkpoints built around it. Essentially, it will be the DAO's responsibility to approve that proposal when it's made. So that's the go-to market and in parallel, we're also signing up zones. <br></p><p>Now, there is a day some time at the end of the roadmap when Panther is “sufficiently decentralized”. At that time, we will evaluate the essential handover of the entire protocol to the community and other parties. In that world, it is possible that zones of other designations – they may be DAO-driven zones, as opposed to regulated financial service provider-driven zones, or government-driven zones – those types of things become possible. That's sort of the progression from public beta, to the full main net to the end of the roadmap.<br><br></p> How will Panther make sure to stay compliant for retail users? <p>Oliver - 35:04</p><p>Panther does not need to be compliant. Panther is a protocol, and Panther Ventures is a development team. So the idea of the protocol being compliant is not the correct way to assess it. If we were building with the idea of the protocol being compliant, the likely outcome will be – and this is unfortunate for many DeFi protocols and many builders out there — is that they're going to find their projects come to a swift conclusion as they are attempting to do something and doing it ineffectively. <br></p><p>So if you are compliant, you're compliant, and if you're non-compliant your non-compliant. And then, if you're compliant in Country A, are you compliant in Country B through Z? And if you're not, then you're non-compliant somewhere. So there are a whole set of very difficult, if not impossible, challenges to solve when a protocol tries to take on the job of compliance itself, in any sort of long-term structure. <br></p><p>When Tornado Cash was sanctioned, that was what we expected in 2020. And that was why we built compliance into the vision; because we thought it was a short-term game plan to go for privacy with a dowel-type structure if you're not building your own L1. And extrapolating again from where we are with some more evidence, my expectation is many of the current DeFi privacy players are going to find themselves out of the market, or having to dramatically adjust their infrastructure to figure out how compliance works. The simple answer to it is: compliance is the responsibility of who uses the protocol – and the protocol design should facilitate operators to take that responsibility into their own hands. And at no time should the protocol custody the data, custody the keys, or control what is happening. At the same time, the protocol should enable those operators, if you will – “guardians” in our case – to respond to their own idiosyncratic legal-jurisdictional requirements. The protocol should be resistant to shutdown or blanket sanctioning, which is what happened with Tornado Cash as an early iteration of an on-chain privacy protocol for Ethereum – one that didn't contemplate the “what if?” questions from the perspective of compliance.<br></p><p>There's always this trade off. The question is: can you sufficiently decentralize? <br></p><p>“Sufficient” is not clear in the market. There is no lawyer on Earth who will tell you what “sufficient” actually means. They may tell you what they think it means, and what one thinks it means might not be what it actually means. That is going to be clarified over the coming months to years. Panther's position is that if you want to be the player that services both retail and enterprise – ultimately if you want to serve all vectors in the market – then you have to be around for that conversation. <br></p><p>So the retail MASP is sort of a risk-managed instance of a zone operating within the shielded pool. It can be thought of as a public eta. It's a step past the test-net because it's actually production privacy. But it's not fully untethered and available in “do-whatever-you-like” mode. That will be something that will be determined by, again, the guardians that utilize the protocol. They're free to do what they like with the protocol and deal with the repercussions of that, whatever those may or may not be.<br></p> What happened to the 100k $ZKP Zafari rewards?<br> <p>Saif - 39:25</p><p>Yeah. So it's not about what happened. It's about when the rewards are going to be processed, &nbsp;and how. The fact that this whole Zafari and the testnet process is evolving. At least from my perspective, what we're trying to look at is: how can these rewards be issued in a decentralized fashion, and how can you actually create these external triggered PRPs on Mainnet? <br></p><p>So as you understand, the team itself does not custody the ZKP or the reward pool. If you have looked at the structure of how vesting happens and how rewards are logged in the pool, I did not want it to go forward and create a proposal to extract 1000k and do manual distribution and things of that nature. So, again, there is a bit of a novel mechanism where, when you perform or contribute to the testing in the test net, how can those contributions be validated and turned into a reward on the Mainnet that itself can happen? <br></p><p>So that one idea was created. There's work going on. The design changes have been done on the PRP creation on the Mainnet itself. I'm waiting for the protocol to be launched, and for all these external triggers be applied on v1. I understand that means there's a bit of waiting that has to be done. But again, these will be clubbed with the additional testing or basically the testing for v1 that is shortly coming. So there will be a lot of testing when the v1 code is deployed. And I think we can basically combine all of those efforts and contributions from the community and the rest of the team that test, and start this PRP generation on Mainnet when things launch.<br></p><p>I would love to hear feedback on that, and what the community thinks. But this is, I think, a novel and a good mechanism to reward users for their efforts and contribution on testing the product itself.<br><br></p> Will v1 rollout with all components at once, and which ones? Or will it be a gradual release?<br> <p>Saif Akhtar</p><p>There is this updated, long pending roadmap that should be published this week. As far as “will it contain all of the features?”, I guess the question would be what are the features that you're talking about? <br></p><p>But, I will say high-level that v1 will contain the DeFi integrations, the ZSwap and basically interactions inside the MASP as its core feature. So those three are going to be included in the v1. I think eventually the rest of the features will be added as we move forward. <br></p><p>I think when we are in the test net, and when we all start to test the product, we would know exactly the maturity levels of different features, and this discussion of what feature to include will be more relevant then. But, from a planning perspective, what I said is in the plans.<br></p><p>My goal is to give more use-cases that all of us can use rather than just, you know, get-in and get-out. That's not the end game for the protocol itself. So more use-cases the user can interact with and deploy strategies from within the Panther is what would make Panther unique in terms of what you can do within that ecosystem.<br></p> How is the zSwap feature shaping up? Are there any new developments related to it? <p>Saif - 47:32</p><p>It's not what new development it is, it is the development for zSwap itself. So trades within the shielded pools are the features that are being worked on. Which kind of, in the background, is an atomic swap within the shielded pool.<br></p><p>It's like I said, this is supposed to be part of the v1 release. So there is development going on. The sub-team that is working on the DeFi integration, is at the final stages of the first prototype for the DeFi integration. Once they've done that then they will pick up working on the zSwap features. The same team basically will work on the zSwap as well.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>
