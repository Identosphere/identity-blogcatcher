<p>Today the Zcash Foundation bids farewell to Dan Wolande, better known as <a href="https://twitter.com/decentralistdan">decentralistdan</a> amongst the Zcash community. <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-zcash-foundation-welcomes-a-new-ecosystem-relations-manager/">Dan joined us in October 2021 as Ecosystems Relations Manager</a> and, during his tenure at ZF, he was embraced by the Zcash community, who recognized his enthusiasm and deep commitment to Zcash. One of Dan’s primary responsibilities was fostering relationships within the Zcash ecosystem, convening conversations, and ensuring that diverse voices were heard. Dan excelled in this role of facilitating productive conversations and collaborations, notably Zcon planning and execution, ZCG and grantee support, and countless community calls including the Arborist and Light Client Working Group.</p>



<p>Dan’s departure is bittersweet for ZF because, while he will no longer be part of our team, we are thrilled that he will continue to be actively involved in the ecosystem in a different capacity at the Electric Coin Company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of Zcash Foundation and the broader ecosystem, we thank Dan for advancing Zcash conversations, look forward to continued collaboration, and we wish him the best of luck!&nbsp;</p>

 In some countries around the world, currency inflation impacts local economies and their citizens’ ability to save. Businesses, individuals, and families in these places lack access to a more stable alternative to their local currency and are often forced to watch the purchasing power of their money fall rapidly over time, making everyday goods and services like food, housing, and medic

<p>In some countries around the world, currency inflation impacts local economies and their citizens’ ability to save. Businesses, individuals, and families in these places lack access to a more stable alternative to their local currency and are often forced to watch the purchasing power of their money fall rapidly over time, making everyday goods and services like food, housing, and medicine more expensive. In recent years, some countries have experienced annual inflation of more than 200%.1</p>

 Anonymity — From signal to noise: Nym Gallery art&nbsp;contest  $5,000 up for grabs for the best art around noise and&nbsp;privacy <p>Calling all artists-agitators, privacy-enthusiast memers, and weirdo dreamers! Want a chance to earn some cash with your clever designs? The new Nym Gallery is launching a contest to generate the best images around noise and online&nbsp;privacy.</p> What is Nym&nbsp;Gallery? <p>Images are a powerful way to convey complex ideas and systems. And privacy technologies like the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/what-is-a-mixnet-and-how-does-it-power-the-most-private-vpn">Nym mixnet</a> are no exception. Nym thus invites everyone to come up with new and innovative ways to represent becoming anonymous online through&nbsp;noise.</p><p>The goal is to give people around the world aesthetic illustrations of how online anonymity works and why it is so important. In this way, art can also be pedagogical and activist, helping people understand the need for new, sophisticated privacy technologies.</p><p>All images will be public, allowing anyone to enjoy, learn from, discuss, or even just laugh about the Nym Gallery masterpieces.</p><p>Read on for how to participate!</p> “From signal to noise — for anonymity!” <p>Noise: Interference, cover, scrambling, asynchrony, confusion, the&nbsp;unclear.</p><p>What do these “noise” senses and effects have to do with privacy? A lot, actually.</p><p>Imagine you’re being followed, and you can’t shake the trail. Suddenly you see a large crowd gathering — say in a street festival — and you decide to blend into the noise and commotion of the crowd. Tracking you in the mass of bodies and sounds gets quite difficult. Noise hides, protects, cloaks&nbsp;you.</p><p>Or imagine you’re trying to have a private conversation at a party, and you move closer to the speakers so that your whispers are drowned out by the noise of the&nbsp;music.</p><p>These are basic situations, but they convey something important about how communication signals can be protected by noise techniques, cover traffic, and the blurring or scrambling of the messages we want to transmit. Afterall, our basic need to be private online is constantly threatened by complex surveillance systems always snooping in on what we do and&nbsp;say.</p> How to participate <p>It’s simple:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/nymproject?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Follow @Nymproject</a> on Twitter/X if you haven’t&nbsp;already  Reply to the contest notification with your best image of noise for anonymity  Retweet the <a href="https://x.com/nymproject/status/1823728933671424274">open call</a> tweet to spread the&nbsp;word  <p>The artwork doesn’t need to be new: it can be old, minted, unminted, on any&nbsp;chain!</p> Winners and&nbsp;awards <p>$5,000 USD is available to be split between the five best&nbsp;images.</p><p>Winners will be determined by a popular vote by the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squad-league-dawn-of-the-nymja-268b7c4b4b6a">Nym Squad League</a> on the <a href="https://forum.nymtech.net/">Nym&nbsp;forum</a>.</p><p>The NFTs will then be part of the NYM&nbsp;Gallery.</p> Deadline <p>The contest will be open for submissions today, August 14, and will close on August 26,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>So get creating and let’s make some noise around&nbsp;privacy!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/anonymity-from-signal-to-noise-nym-gallery-art-contest-667f89e228fc">Anonymity — From signal to noise: Nym Gallery art contest</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This post describes work done by Kleomenis Katevas, Stefanos Laskaridis, Aravindh Raman, Mihai Plesa, and Hamed Haddadi. This post was written by Senior Machine Learning Researcher Kleomenis Katevas.</p>
<p>In today’s fast-paced market, continuous evaluation of product releases is essential. Companies must regularly assess their products to stay competitive and meet evolving customer expectations. This process also provides crucial insights when comparing a product with competitors. However, there are significant challenges.</p>
<p>Automating cross-device mobile app activities—including shipping new features, simulating Web browsing user activity across different browsers and evaluating on-device machine learning models—is challenging, primarily due to inherent operating system (OS) restrictions. Moreover, accurately profiling the power consumption of these activities is difficult because of unreliable OS estimates and often lower sampling rates (number of samples per second).</p>
<p>To address the above challenges, we introduced BLaDE (BatteryLab Device Evaluations) as a successor to BatteryLab <a>1</a> <a>2</a> (originally released in 2019), which serves as Brave’s open-source solution for automated performance evaluations on mobile devices. Supporting both Android and iOS, BLaDE is capable of recording power consumption, CPU utilization, device temperature, and network traffic (bandwidth) in a highly precise and configurable frequency, while simulating user actions using different types of automation methods. By open sourcing the system design and code base, any developer or researcher can replicate this setup to conduct comprehensive performance evaluations on their own mobile devices.</p>

 BLaDE System Design 
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    </p>
<p>Our system is designed with the following key hardware components:</p>
 
 
<p>Main controller (Raspberry Pi 4, 8GB): The central device coordinator (internally known as BLaDE Runner) that’s responsible for managing and orchestrating all system activities.</p>
 
 
<p>Mac controller (Mac Mini, M2, 8-core): A Mac-based machine to support iOS-based automation through <a href="https://github.com/appium/appium">Appium</a>, and to build iOS apps through Xcode.</p>
 
 
<p>Power monitor (Monsoon HV): A critical component for measuring the power consumption of the connected devices at a maximum frequency of 5KHz.</p>
 
 
<p>Programmable AC switch (Keene KPS1): Utilized to control the power supply to the power monitor, enabling automated power cycling to the device.</p>
 
 
<p>Programmable relay board (Yizhet 5V, 8 Ch.): Utilized for controlling the power distribution from the power monitor to the devices. This is to programmatically select which device is powered on.</p>
 
 
<p>Programmable USB hub (YKUSH 3): These hubs allow selective powering on/off of USB connections, providing isolated power control for each port.</p>
 
 
<p>IR-thermometer (MLX90614): Deployed for continuous monitoring of device temperature.</p>
 
 
<p>LCD display (Waveshare LCD1602): A notification unit that reports the system state (device being monitored, real-time power consumption, etc).</p>
 
 
<p>Mobile devices: A variety of iOS (iPhone 14 Pro, SE 2022) and Android (Galaxy S23, Pixel 6a) devices, configured to be compatible with our BLaDE infrastructure.</p>
 
 
<p>Surveillance camera (Anker PowerConf C200): Employed to remotely monitor the status of evaluations. Although remote screencasting options are available via the OS, they are avoided as they could interfere with performance metrics.</p>
 
 
<p>Router (UniFi Dream Router): Connected to a 70MBit dedicated VLAN network, it provides Ethernet network access to the controller and Mac Mini, and WiFi 6 network access to all mobile devices. Additionally, it is capable of forwarding Internet traffic through a VPN service, if required, allowing simulation of Internet access from different geolocations.</p>
 
 

 Device configuration 
<p>To facilitate accurate power measurements, we stepped away from the available software-based options and utilized a battery bypass technique. This involves disassembling each device to remove its battery, extracting the internal battery controller, and exposing the power terminals via cables. This method allows us to monitor the devices’ power consumption directly from their power terminals, achieving precise measurements at a maximum frequency of 5 kHz using the power monitor.</p>
<p>Further configurations are made in the device’s OS to minimize the influence of extraneous factors. These include disabling automated OS and app updates, turning off adaptive brightness/charging/battery features, enabling dark mode, and standardizing the brightness level to 25% across devices.</p>

 Device testing automation 
<p>Automating testing on mobile devices, especially in this custom setup, can be a complex task. BLaDE provides a comprehensive set of APIs that facilitate various aspects of device management, such as reading device status, controlling power states, and managing measurement processes.</p>
<p>Consider the following example of the “switch on” API call for switching a mobile device:</p>
 
 
<p>Initialize and connect: Begin by switching on the power monitor. BLaDE waits until the monitor is available and establishes a connection.</p>
 
 
<p>Enable USB power: BLaDE then enables the USB power to the device, ensuring it is ready for further operations.</p>
 
 
<p>Relay activation: The appropriate relay on the relay board is activated to manage the power flow.</p>
 
 
<p>Voltage setting: Set the required voltage for the device to switch on.</p>
 
 
<p>Device synchronization: BLaDE waits for the device to become available and synchronizes its clock with the controller’s clock. This ensures time measurements are accurate.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlocking the device: For iOS devices, BLaDE connects using the Bluetooth HID service and enters the PIN to unlock the device. This step is required to allow the device to communicate via USB after boot.</p>
 
 
<p>When measuring the power performance of a phone, it is crucial to disable the USB power lanes. This step ensures that the USB current does not interfere with the power monitor readings. All communication with the device must be wireless, using either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, before or after the measurement has happened.</p>
<p>Currently, BLaDE supports automation via Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Bluetooth HID, and Appium-based frameworks:</p>

 Android Debug Bridge (ADB) automations (Android only) 
<p>The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a versatile command-line tool that allows developers to communicate with an Android device. It supports a wide range of device operations, such as installing and debugging applications, transferring files, and interacting with the device’s screen and keyboard. ADB commands can be executed via USB, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. BLaDE builds on top of this tool to support actions that are required for device automations, such as “type text”, “tap”, “scroll down”, “close foreground app”, etc.</p>

 Bluetooth HID automations (iOS, Android) 
<p>Automating third-party apps on iOS presents challenges due to the absence of a publicly available ADB-like API that operates over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. To address this, we have virtualized a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard by creating a virtual Human Interface Device (HID) service at the controller. We also created an automation library that translates keyboard keystrokes, mouse clicks, and gestures into HID actions, effectively simulating user interactions with the controlled device. This approach allows for the automation of tasks—such as locating and launching apps and interacting with them—by mimicking user actions.&nbsp;</p>

 Appium-based automations (iOS, Android) 
<p>As an alternative approach, we experimentally support an Appium-based framework to automate actions, minimizing the overhead of the above automation methods when aiming multiple platforms. Appium uses ADB for Android and Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest">XCTest</a> for iOS automations. Although Appium is generally used for testing features of custom application builds, we currently experiment with the framework to predominantly measure the performance of Android and iOS apps.</p>

 BLaDE for product evaluations 
<p>The use of BLaDE is crucial to our product pipeline, ensuring the performance, robustness and reliability of various features, including on-device performance of LLMs, cost efficiency of modules, and browsing capabilities. When a new development build is ready and a specific feature needs to be tested, it is dispatched on-demand to BLaDE for an in-depth performance assessment across devices. This process helps identify new regressions and bottlenecks, enabling us to address issues swiftly and maintain the high standards our users expect. With BLaDE’s continuous monitoring, we can confidently release updates, assured that any potential performance issues have been proactively managed.</p>

  The AI Supply Chain Tug of War  <p>Big Tech is absorbing demand risk from the AI supply chain. How long can it last?</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 



Published August 12, 2024
  



 
<p>Here’s the question now being asked all across the AI ecosystem: Is there a way for someone else to take on the demand risk from AI, while I capture the profits?</p>



<p>Today, Big Tech companies have stepped up to alleviate some of this tension. They are acting as risk-absorbers within the system, taking on as much demand risk as they possibly can, and driving the supply chain toward greater and greater CapEx escalation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In part one of this piece, we’ll walk through the tug of war between supply chain players over risk and profit. In part two, we’ll unpack the instability of today’s equilibrium.</p>



 



 Who Should Bear the Demand Risk from AI? Who Should Capture the Profits? 



<p>In the supply chain, risks are transferred from suppliers, who need to build CapEx to manufacture products, upstream up to their customers, who pay a margin that compensates for this capital expenditure over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each player wants to maximize profit while minimizing risk. This creates supply chain conflict, which lurks behind the scenes, and exposes itself in pairwise game theoretic interactions between suppliers and their customers. Below, we’ll give one example of how this tension manifests for each layer of the supply chain.</p>







 
 Foundry Layer: TSMC is Nvidia’s manufacturing partner. The more manufacturing capacity TSMC builds for Nvidia, the more it is exposed to future demand fluctuations. The fewer fabs it builds, however, the more problems Nvidia will have with its supply shortage. Thus arises the core tension in this relationship: TSMC’s incentive is to have just enough availability to serve Nvidia, and nothing more. Nvidia’s incentive is for TSMC to build as much CapEx as possible, to maximize availability. In this relationship, TSMC has all the leverage—it is the dominant pure play foundry globally and serves many customers, including Nvidia’s competitors. Thus, as we try to forecast the future of AI, we should expect the stable equilibrium to be that TSMC underbuilds capacity relative to peak demand. An example where this will manifest: TSMC is currently planning out future CapEx for its <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21413/tsmc-performance-and-yields-of-2nm-on-track-mass-production-to-start-in-2025">2nm node</a>. We might expect that however much capacity TSMC chooses to build, it will be less than the amount that Nvidia and other AI chip companies will have requested. 
 



 
 Semiconductor Layer: One of the great ironies of AI is that while the big cloud companies and Nvidia are all members of the “Magnificent 7”—and their fates tend to be correlated as investors wax and wane on AI’s potential—these companies are actually diametrically opposed on many dimensions. For example, the cloud companies are extremely resistant to Nvidia’s profit capture in AI, and they are all working on their own competitive chips. At the same time, Nvidia has been trying to compete with its biggest customers by directing chip supply to new entrants like Coreweave and by building its own cloud business with DGX cloud. The semiconductor tug of war is primarily about profit margins. 
 



 
 Industrial Supply Layer: The industrial supply chain is another realm where we can see the ripples of risk transfer at work. When we talk to Big Tech companies, one consistent refrain we hear is that they are trying to buy out all the manufacturing capacity they can get for industrial components like diesel generators and cooling systems, and also for commodities like steel and electrical transformers. Their suppliers find these orders volumes almost hard to believe and are actually resistant to serving this demand; they are concerned that if they double their manufacturing capacity, they will be left with excess capacity in the future. To resolve this conflict, the cloud companies are making big commitments—promising to buy many years of supply ahead of time—to incentivize industrial CapEx. 
 



 
 Cloud Layer: The cloud layer is the lynchpin holding everything together. We will discuss this in depth in part two of this post. 
 



 
 Model Layer: If you are OpenAI, Anthropic or Gemini, you want to get as much compute as possible for your frontier model, because more compute means a more intelligent model. If you are Azure, AWS or GCP, however, you want to direct GPU or CPU compute to Enterprise customers—this is your main business. Thus, the main conflict at the model layer is over data center capacity allocation. Since the model layer today is not profitable, these allocations are negotiated between cloud executives and research lab leaders. These negotiations are made more complicated by ownership structures, where the research labs are either partially or wholly owned by the clouds. As model sizes grow by 10x, these power struggles will only be exacerbated.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Customer Layer: Hooray for the customer! At the end of this long and complex chain, there is an application layer AI startup or an Enterprise buyer calling an API and querying a foundation model. What is “demand risk” to everyone else is “the luxury of choice” to the customer. Customers can use AI models on-demand, and they can easily switch between vendors at their discretion. If customers ever decide the AI is not useful enough, they can turn it off. The entire supply chain is in service of this customer, who benefits from competition and supply chain efficiency.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The entire supply chain hinges on the last link—the customer. The supply chain is to some degree positive sum: Everyone benefits as the total profit dollars in AI increases. However, as the prior examples highlight, it can also be zero sum: My revenue is your cost, in the case of Nvidia and the clouds. My CapEx is my risk and your benefit, in the case of TSMC and Nvidia.</p>



<p>The tug of war dynamic also helps to explain some of the supply shortages we continue to see in AI, such as shortages in the industrial supply chain. No matter how much pressure they get, there’s only so much demand risk suppliers are willing to take on.</p>



 



 A Fragile Equilibrium: Big Tech is Propping up the Supply Chain 



<p>Today, the big cloud giants are acting as risk-absorbers in this system. They absorb risk from their downstream partners Nvidia and TSMC through large orders that generate huge short-term profits for these companies. They also absorb risk from upstream partners: The cloud companies are the largest source of funding for frontier model companies and they subsidize end customers in the form of low API prices and bundled credits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are four concrete examples of this risk-absorption mechanism at work:</p>



 
 GPUs—Now or Later? It’s in Nvidia’s best interest to sell as many H100 GPUs as possible now, and then sell more B100s and next-gen chips in the future. It’s in hyperscalers best interest to <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4708295-microsoft-corporation-msft-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript">fill their data centers</a> with GPUs on as-needed basis (this means building data center “shells” and then only installing GPUs once demand materializes). What is actually happening in the market? Hyperscalers seem to be competing with one another for GPU supply and placing big orders with Nvidia to make sure they don’t fall behind. Rather than waiting, they are stockpiling GPUs now and paying twice: First, a hefty upfront expense, and second, higher expected future depreciation. 
 



 
 Data Center Construction: The real estate developers who build and assemble data centers are getting a pretty sweet deal. These companies take on almost no demand risk. Developers like CyrusOne, QTS, and Vantage build data centers for big tech companies, but they will only start construction after they’ve signed a 15 or 20-year lease. And they structure these deals so that they can pay back their investment during the lease period alone—they limit their “residual risk” around the long-term value of the data center asset (e.g., even if prices collapse after the lease period, they can still make money). The long-term demand risk squarely sits with the cloud providers. 
 



 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We’ve all seen headlines of late about GPU financing deals and the debt that’s being issued to finance GPU purchases. What many people don’t realize is that most of this debt is actually backed up by rental guarantees from Big Tech. These agreements seem so robust that many debt investors see themselves as investing in Big Tech corporate debt, not in GPUs. The incentive for Big Tech in these deals is to turn an upfront capital expense into a recurring operating expense. This is a very clear example of how Big Tech companies—even when they are not directly doing the financing—are actually backstopping much of the investment activity happening in AI today. 
 



 
 Research Lab Funding and Exits: The Big Tech companies are the largest source of funding today for AI research labs. The biggest labs—OpenAI and Anthropic—are each backed by one of the large clouds. The recent exits of Inflection, Adept and Character demonstrate that it may be increasingly difficult to operate without such a backstop.&nbsp; 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Supply chain players understand <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">AI’s $600B question</a>, and they are working to navigate it—maximizing their profit margins and minimizing their demand risk. The result is a dynamic tug of war between some of the most sophisticated companies in the world.</p>



<p>Today, the tug of war has resulted in a temporary equilibrium. Supply chain players are offloading their demand risk to Big Tech, to the maximum degree possible. Big Tech companies—either due to AI optimism or <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/">oligopolistic competition</a>—are stepping in to absorb this risk and <a href="https://x.com/DavidCahn6/status/1816146922060890542">keep CapEx cranking</a>.</p>



<p>This equilibrium is fragile: If at any point the tech giants blink, demand all along the supply chain will decline precipitously. Further, the longer the Big Tech companies continue to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/steel-servers-and-power/">double down on CapEx</a>, the more they are at risk of finding themselves deeply in the hole should AI progress encounter any stumbles.</p>

<p>Chelsea Komlo joined the Zcash Foundation (ZF) in <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-zcash-foundation-welcomes-a-core-engineer-and-researcher/">August 2019</a>, as a core engineer and researcher, and was later appointed to the role of Chief Scientist, leading ZF’s research efforts. Prior to joining ZF, Chelsea worked as an engineer on open source security and privacy projects, most notably Tor and the Off-The-Record (OTR) messaging protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During her time with ZF, Chelsea’s primary research focus has been threshold signature schemes. She collaborated with Ian Goldberg at the University of Waterloo to create <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf">FROST</a>, a Schnorr threshold signature protocol that is compatible with Zcash shielded transactions. Chelsea then worked with others across the industry to standardize the FROST signing protocol, which was recently published as an <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html">RFC</a>. Most&nbsp;recently she has been participating in the NIST standardization effort for threshold signature schemes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chelsea is leaving ZF to take up another research role, focusing on post-quantum cryptography. However, she remains an avid supporter of the Zcash mission, and will remain involved as a member of the ZF’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the Zcash Foundation, and Zcash ecosystem as a whole, we want to thank Chelsea for her contributions to Zcash and the broader mission of financial privacy. While we are sad to see her leave, we are thrilled that she has found an opportunity to advance her already-distinguished career.&nbsp;</p>

  Steel, Servers and Power: What it Takes to Win the Next Phase of AI  <p>The qualifying round is over—in the new era construction is king. </p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 



Published August 5, 2024
  



 
<p>The race to model parity has been the defining project of the last 12 months in AI. This phase was characterized by the search for new research techniques, better training data and larger cluster sizes.</p>



<p>The next phase in the AI race is going to look different: It will be defined more by physical construction than by scientific discovery.</p>



<p>Up until now, you could fit your training cluster into an existing data center via colocation or retrofit. If you needed to increase cluster size from 15k GPUs to 25k GPUs, you found a way to plug-in more GPUs. This is changing: The “<a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html?ref=blog.heim.xyz">Bitter Lesson</a>”—which most market participants in AI have internalized—says that model size is the number one driver of performance. As a result, the next generation of models are aiming for a 10x increase in model scale to 300k GPUs. To house one of these models, you need to build an entire new data center.</p>



<p>This changes AI in two fundamental ways: First, it changes the lead time between models. If before you could train your model in 6 to 12 months, now you need to add 18 to 24 months of construction time before you can actually start training. Second, it changes the source of maximum competitive advantage. In the new era, construction efficiency may matter more than research breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This sea change in how AI works was a major theme of big tech earnings last week. Annualized CapEx for big tech increased from $138B to $229B year-over-year. This incremental $91B in run-rate spending is a good proxy for new AI data center construction—an enormous investment.</p>



<p>Today’s CapEx will likely yield fruit somewhere between late 2025 and early 2026, at which point we’ll find out if these larger models are intelligent enough to unlock new revenue streams and generate a return on investment.&nbsp;</p>



Source: Earnings transcripts, public filings. “Incremental CapEx” is a proxy for run-rate spend on new AI data centers.



<p>So what exactly is going to happen over the next 1 to 2 years, and how does one “win” in this new phase of AI?</p>



<p>Building data centers is a messy and complex business. We think day-to-day operational execution is going to have the biggest impact on who is most successful. Here’s how it works behind the scenes:1</p>



 
 A real estate developer—QTS, Vantage and CyrusOne are three popular ones—goes and buys land and power that they believe a data center can be built on. 



 The developer approaches the big tech companies and offers them a 15-year or 20-year lease on the data center, for a total cost of $2-10B. 



 Once the developer has a signed deal, they go to the capital markets, and they raise debt against the deal, usually from banks or real estate investors. 



 The debt investors are not underwriting the future AI demand in the data center—they are underwriting the credit of the customer, say Microsoft or Amazon, and expect a yield that is a slight premium to corporate debt. 



 The developer goes and hires a general contractor—for example, <a href="https://www.dpr.com/">DPR</a>, one of the most popular data center builders. 



 The general contractor goes and hires subcontractors. The subcontractors then go and recruit labor. Labor is a huge component of the cost of data center construction. 



 Labor moves to the location where the data center is getting built—for example, a small town or city—and they are put up in hotels or other accommodations in the area. 



 Over a two year period, a massive construction project takes place, starting with steel and concrete for the overall structure, and ending with industrial parts and GPUs being installed. 



 During this whole process, the end-user of the data center (e.g., Microsoft or Amazon) is negotiating with their own supply chain for diesel generators, liquid cooling systems, and other necessary equipment. 
 



<p>Today, five companies have arrived at the starting line in this new race toward data center scale-up: Microsoft/OpenAI, Amazon/Anthropic, Google, Meta and xAI. Each has a model that has held up against serious benchmarks, and the necessary capital to proceed.</p>



<p>With the market structure now crystallized, we can begin to see how each player will take a unique approach—derived from their own business fundamentals—in order to win:</p>



 
 Meta and xAI are consumer companies, and they will both vertically integrate, hoping to benefit from each having a single founder decision maker who can streamline and tightly couple model building efforts with data center design and construction. Both companies will seek to launch killer consumer applications on the back of more intelligent models. 



 Microsoft and Amazon have grizzled data center teams and deep pockets, and they’ve leveraged these assets to forge partnerships with the top tier research labs. They hope to monetize through 1) Selling training to other companies, and 2) Selling model inference. They will need to manage resource allocation between their frontier models (GPT 5 and Claude 4) and other data centers being built for Enterprise customer use. 



 Google has both a consumer business and a cloud business, and also has its own in-house research team. On Friday, the company announced it was bringing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/02/character-ai-ceo-noam-shazeer-returns-to-google/">Noam Shazeer</a> back into the fold. Google also has vertically integrated all the way down to the chip layer with TPUs. These factors should provide long-term structural advantages. 
 



<p>With CapEx plans now firmly in place and the competitive landscape set, the new AI era begins. In this new phase of AI, steel, servers and power will replace models, compute and data as the “must-wins” for anyone hoping to pull ahead.</p>



 
 In this example, we assume a lease structure. In the case of an internal build, the hyperscaler acts both as the customer and as the real estate developer.

<p>TL;DR: In July, we launched Empe Blockchain’s open Empe Testnet, drawing 100+ validators in 48 hours. Key updates include monitoring tools, wallet support, CosmWasm integration for smart contracts, enhanced vesting accounts, and a linear inflation model for stable token release. These steps are vital for a secure and efficient blockchain platform.</p><p>Our journey to create the highest value End-to-End verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI) on the market is marked by continuous improvement and a deep commitment to our users. As we continue to pour precious hours into research and development, always listening closely to your feedback, we’re excited to share our progress in&nbsp;July.</p> Empe Blockchain Infrastructure Development <p>In anticipation of the upcoming <a href="https://empe.io/technology/">Empe Blockchain</a> mainnet launch, we have built and configured our core network infrastructure. At its heart are the main validator nodes, which form the backbone of the system. To safeguard these critical components, we’ve established sentry nodes as a protective shield. These nodes act as the primary interface between the validators and the external network, mitigating potential threats. This robust infrastructure is essential to ensure the network’s stability and security as we approach the highly anticipated mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p> Open Empe Testnet&nbsp;Launch <p>July marked the successful launch of our open <a href="https://explorer-testnet.empe.io/">Empe Testnet</a>, attracting over 100 external validators within the first 48 hours of operation. To facilitate this successful launch, we integrated essential tools like <a href="https://testnet.ping.pub/">testnet.ping.pub</a> for comprehensive monitoring and <a href="https://www.keplr.app/">Keplr wallet</a> support for EMPE tokens, and published comprehensive <a href="https://docs.empe.io/">technical documentation</a>, to ensure a smooth onboarding experience.</p><p>The current validator count exceeds 150 and is steadily climbing. This surge in validator participation brings forth a multitude of advantages. Enhanced network security safeguards the system against potential attacks. Decentralization fosters trust and transparency within the Empeiria ecosystem. Moreover, the robust foundation laid by the Testnet paves the way for future scalability. This achievement wouldn’t be possible without the incredible support of our community, highlighting the growing excitement surrounding Empeiria’s innovations.</p> Integration of CosmWasm for Smart Contract Functionality <p>Empe Blockchain now supports <a href="https://cosmwasm.com/">CosmWasm</a>, enabling smart contract functionality from day one. This integration allows developers to create and deploy smart contracts seamlessly, enhancing the versatility and utility of our platform. The addition of CosmWasm support marks a significant milestone in our journey towards creating a more versatile blockchain ecosystem.</p> Vesting Accounts Module Enhancements <p>To provide greater control and security for vested assets, we’ve enhanced the vesting accounts module. Users can now create new vesting accounts based on existing ones. These new accounts adhere to the same or more stringent lock-up periods and parameters as the original accounts. This functionality ensures that funds remain securely locked and transparent for all stakeholders, providing a robust framework for managing vested assets and fostering trust and confidence among all stakeholders.</p> Linear Inflation Model&nbsp;Adoption <p>To address the limitations of the dynamic inflation model traditionally used in Cosmos-based blockchains, we have adopted a linear inflation model for Empe Blockchain’s minting module. This new approach releases a fixed number of tokens over specified periods, as defined during the genesis stage. Additionally, the inflation rate will gradually decrease over subsequent periods. This predictable and transparent model aims to provide a more stable economic environment for our blockchain ecosystem.</p> Proof of Attendance with Passwordless Authentication based on the Proof of&nbsp;Purchase <p>We have successfully integrated a passwordless authentication system, allowing users to securely access their Proof of Attendance (PoAP) using Proof of Purchase (PoP) credentials. This system leverages unique PoP tokens to authenticate users without the need for traditional passwords. The backend services have been enhanced to generate and manage unique PoP tokens for each purchase, ensuring secure and verifiable access to related PoA records. The user interface has been updated to streamline the passwordless login process, providing a simple and intuitive flow for users to authenticate using their PoP credentials.</p> Schema Update for Proof of Attendance &amp; Proof of&nbsp;Purchase <p>The new data schemas for Proof of Attendance (PoAP) and Proof of Purchase (PoP) have been finalized and approved, ensuring compatibility with industry standards. Backend services have been updated to support the new schemas, including adjustments to the data storage architecture and API endpoints to handle the additional data fields and&nbsp;types.</p><p>These advancements are crucial steps toward a more secure, efficient, and developer-friendly verifiable data infrastructure. Your ongoing support and insightful feedback play a vital role in this journey, and we sincerely appreciate both.</p><p>Follow Empeiria on <a href="https://twitter.com/empe_io">X</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/empe-web3/">LinkedIn</a> for the latest news &amp; updates.

Building Community Through Education <p>Recognizing the importance of community engagement, our strategic approach included reaching out to <a href="https://x.com/empe_io">our community on X</a> to release a series of educational content. By sharing valuable insights and fostering open dialogue, we not only increased awareness but also created a foundation for future growth. This initiative played a crucial role&nbsp;in:</p>  Educating the Community: We provided valuable insights into the benefits and implications of verifiable data, helping our audience understand its importance and&nbsp;impact.  Fostering a Supportive Network: By engaging with users through informative content, we cultivated a dedicated community that supports and values our technology.  Strengthening the Ecosystem: This educational outreach not only informed, but also built a network of advocates who contribute to and enhance the overall strength of our ecosystem.  <p>Through these efforts, we successfully created a knowledgeable and engaged community that reinforces the foundation of our&nbsp;project.</p> 5. Testnet Phase 2: Opening to External Validators <p>The culmination of the project was the launch of Testnet Phase 2, which invited external validators to join the network. The response was overwhelming, with over 100 validators joining within 48 hours. This rapid expansion demonstrated the platform’s appeal and the strength of the community built through education and engagement. This phase marked a pivotal&nbsp;moment:</p>  Onboarding External Validators: We began by integrating our first external validators into the network. Their involvement was crucial for expanding and testing the system’s capabilities in a real-world environment.  Viral Engagement: The news of our open Testnet quickly spread, generating significant interest. The momentum was remarkable, with additional validators joining the network within hours of the initial&nbsp;launch.   Conclusion <p>In just 48 hours, Empeiria successfully decentralized its network with over 100 validators.

Technical Setup &amp; Troubleshooting <p>Q: How many tokens do I need to register as a validator? <br>A: You need 1 EMPE token, equivalent to 1,000,000 uEMPE&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Q: Why can’t I register as a validator? <br>A: Ensure your node is synchronized and you have enough tokens. Refer to the technical documentation for more details: [Technical Documentation](<a href="https://docs.empe.io/validators/overview">https://docs.empe.io/validators/overview</a>)</p><p>Q: How do I use the EMPE faucet? <br>A: Check the Telegram group for Validators for the faucet link: [Empeiria Validators](<a href="https://t.me/EmpeValidators">https://t.me/EmpeValidators</a>) <br>1. Use the tokens to register your validator. <br>2. Opening a validator does not guarantee a position in the active set. <br>3. Tokens can be claimed only&nbsp;once.</p><p>Q: I ran a script and got an RPC error. What happened? <br>A: Your RPC might not be synchronized, or you may not have enough funds in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Q: How can I access the binary code? <br>A: Binary code access will be available on the&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Q: What is a moniker? <br>A: A moniker is the name you give your validator to help identify it&nbsp;easily.</p><p>Q: Can I edit my moniker after registering? <br>A:&nbsp;Yes.</p><p>Q: What should I do if I have a technical issue? <br>A: You can always ask other validators for support: [Empeiria Validators](<a href="https://t.me/EmpeValidators">https://t.me/EmpeValidators</a>). If it’s a major problem, contact the Empe&nbsp;team.</p><p>Q: How do I get my validator unjailed?<br>A: Use the command:<br>emped tx slashing unjail --from &lt;&lt;KEY_NAME&gt;&gt; --fees&nbsp;40uempe</p><p>Q: Once my validator is jailed and I used the above command to unjail it, how many EMPE tokens do I need to return to the active set?<br>A: You need to have more tokens than the last validator in the active&nbsp;set.</p><p>Q: How do I set up EMPE GAS FEE?<br>A: If you are getting a gas error, increase the fee and make sure you have enough tokens to cover the gas&nbsp;cost.</p><p>Q: Can I park my validator, close it, and return later? Can I use any VPS for running the Empe testnet validator? <br>A: Yes, you can park your validator and use any VPS. However, be aware that shutting down a node with bonded tokens might result in jailing. To prevent this, avoid keeping your validator offline for extended periods. You can delegate your tokens to another validator while your node is offline. When restarting, make sure only one instance of your validator is running to avoid issues with trapping your validator and tokens. Always keep your private keys secure, and do not run a second instance with the same private keys, as this will lead to permanent jailing.</p><p>Q: Can I use the Empe wallet to register my validator on the Empe network? <br>A: No, the Empe wallet is designed for managing decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, not for crypto tokens. Please use the Keplr wallet for claiming tokens and validator registration.</p><p>Q: Do I have to create a DID (Decentralized Identifier) using the EMPE wallet to join the Empe testnet as a validator? <br>A: No, use the Keplr wallet&nbsp;only.</p><p>Q: When I create a fee, which values should I use for Empe tokens? <br>A: Use uEMPE, where 1 EMPE = 1,000,000 uEMPE, similar to how Satoshi is used for&nbsp;BTC.</p><p>Q: How can I provide feedback on the testnet? <br>A: You can share your thoughts and experiences through our official communication channels. Contact moderators from the Empeiria Validators Telegram group for any feedback you may&nbsp;have.</p> 2. Rewards &amp;&nbsp;Staking <p>Q: Is the Empe testnet incentivized? Will I get rewards or more delegation for creating validator services? <br>A: Yes, active testnet participants who maintain their nodes until the mainnet launch and for at least 60 days will receive a bonus in the form of foundation delegation on the mainnet. Additional incentives to increase the delegation allocation will be announced later.</p><p>Q: Is it possible to receive delegation from the team? <br>A: Team delegations are currently not available. Focus on building a strong validator reputation to attract delegations from the community.</p><p>Q: How do I join the testnet active set? <br>A: Be in the top 200 validators.</p><p>Q: What is the reward for helping other validators? <br>A: There is no direct reward for helping other validators, although contributing to the community can enhance your reputation and support the network’s overall&nbsp;health.</p><p>Q: Will I get rewards or additional delegation for creating validator services? <br>A: You may be considered for bonus delegation on the mainnet if your validator services provide additional value to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Q: What is the duration for validators to vote? <br>A: The voting period for validators is 24 hours, and you must use your wallet with tokens to cast your&nbsp;vote.</p> 3. Project Overview &amp;&nbsp;Updates <p>Q: How long will the testnet run? <br>A: The testnet does not have a specified end date. It will continue to serve as an environment for testing new features and applications built on&nbsp;Empe.</p><p>Q: Where can I find the updated roadmap for validators and the Empeiria project? <br>A: The updated roadmap will be announced soon.

<p>How many days have passed since the last major data leak or security breach? Most likely, zero. From the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197052/att-data-breach-call-text-records-hack">phone records of AT&amp;T110 million customers exposed in a recent leak</a> to the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/aadhar-data-leak-personal-data-of-81-5-crore-indians-on-sale-on-dark-web-report/articleshow/104856898.cms?from=mdr">815 million passport details, names, phone numbers, and addresses stolen by hackers in India</a>, one thing is clear — our private data is anything but&nbsp;secure.</p><p>The repercussions of these breaches are profound. Beyond financial implications — the average global cost of a data breach exceeds 4.45 million U.S. dollars per incident — trust is the main casualty, eroding confidence in digital interactions and services.</p><p>Given this ever-present vulnerability, the question becomes: how can we reclaim control of our data and navigate the digital world with confidence? At Empeiria, we understand these challenges and have developed a technological toolbox to help you achieve just&nbsp;that.</p> Why is Our Data So Vulnerable? <p>In today’s digital world, our private data forms the cornerstone of countless online interactions. We entrust companies with a vast amount of information, from financial details to browsing habits. However, a critical issue persists: the vulnerability of this data to unauthorized access and data breaches.</p><p>But why is that? Why is our data so vulnerable? The answer lies in the inherent weaknesses of the current data frameworks, which leave your information exposed in several&nbsp;ways:</p>  Centralized Storage: Currently, user data is usually stored on centralized company servers. This creates a single point of failure — if hackers breach these servers, a massive amount of data can be compromised all at&nbsp;once.  Data Silos: Our information is often scattered across numerous platforms and services. This fragmentation makes it difficult to track and control how our data is used and protected.  Weak Encryption: While some companies encrypt data, encryption practices can vary. Weak encryption algorithms can leave information vulnerable to attackers.  Human Error: Accidental data leaks by employees can occur due to mistakes or social engineering attacks. Traditional access controls might not be granular enough, granting access to more data than necessary.  The Evolving Regulatory Landscape: The legal landscape surrounding data security is constantly evolving. Regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aim to give individuals more control over their data. However, these regulations can be complex and challenging for companies to navigate, creating additional hurdles in securing user information.  <p>In the end, the current state of data security leaves much to be desired. Our information resides in silos, on centralized servers, vulnerable to breaches and misuse. Traditional frameworks leave us at the mercy of companies, hoping they’ll act responsibly with our data — a trust that’s often&nbsp;broken.</p><p>But there’s a solution, and it lies in technological innovation. By leveraging cutting-edge tech advancements, we can build a future where users reclaim control of their data and change how we ensure the security of our data&nbsp;forever.</p> The Solution: End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI) <p>Here at Empeiria, we believe data ownership is the key to the future of digital interactions. This is why we built our <a href="https://empe.io/technology/">End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI)</a> on the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). This framework empowers users with unprecedented control over their information. Within it, it’s the users themselves and not third parties who own and control their&nbsp;data.</p><p>By expanding upon the concepts of SSI, EVDI offers a new approach to data security by addressing the fundamental weaknesses of traditional data frameworks:</p><p>Data Ownership: In EVDI, instead of centralized data silos, data is securely stored in users’ verifiable data wallets. These wallets act as personal vaults where individuals manage their information securely. EVDI gives users full control over their data. No third party, or even Empeiria itself, has access to users’ data. By storing data in users’ wallets, EVDI fixes one of the main vulnerabilities of the current system: a single point of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Built-in trust: EVDI operates on a trustless architecture of Empe Blockchain, where trust is not assumed, or delegated to a third party, but built into the technology itself. Traditional systems typically rely on centralized authorities to manage, protect, and verify data. In contrast, EVDI leverages decentralized networks and cryptographic techniques to ensure data integrity without the need for intermediaries. No sensitive data is stored on Empe Blockchain, which serves as an immutable record of data ownership and a tool for data verification, without compromising data security.</p><p>Streamlined Compliance with Regulations: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding data security can be challenging. EVDI lets companies forget the compliance headache. It keeps data in the user’s control, automatically adhering to regulations. This simplifies compliance for businesses, saving them time, effort, and&nbsp;money.</p><p>In a world where data breaches are increasingly commonplace and traditional security measures fall short, Empeiria’s End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI) offers a practical solution. By empowering individuals with control over their data and leveraging advanced decentralized technologies, it paves the way for a more secure digital experience.</p><p>Follow Empeiria on <a href="http://www.x.com/empe_io">Twitter/X</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/empe-web3/">LinkedIn</a> for the latest news &amp; updates.

<p>Before we announce the exciting new features available for testing in Stage 7, we want to extend our gratitude to our community of over 3,500 testnet users. Your diligent testing and valuable feedback are critical to our mission.</p><p>We are pleased to share that testing for Stage 6 is now complete, providing valuable insights and resulting in updates to our codebase.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we are excited to announce that Stage 7 of our testnet is live. This stage includes simulated Swap functionality, Data Escrow, and major upgrades to the user history interface.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: Panther’s test network is now on Amoy, Polygon’s test network and can be accessed <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Swap functionality <p>Swap functionality is now simulated in the testnet. Users can “swap” their shielded assets (zAssets) within Panther Protocol’s Shielded Pool while interacting with test versions of external decentralized Swap protocols like Uniswap V3 and QuickSwap, both of which are on Amoy, Polygon’s test network. These transactions occur inside Panther Protocol’s shielded Zones, ensuring the privacy of the transactions is preserved.</p> How to test the swap feature <p>To prepare the transaction, a user (1) selects the token types (Target Pairing) for the swap and (2) set the amount to send (swap from). The user can see the estimated amount to receive (swap to). Then select which token is being sent and which is being received.&nbsp;</p><p>The following features are included with the release, and must be specified by the user prior to making the swap.&nbsp;</p>  Routing: By default, the protocol selects the most efficient route. The user can override this option based on preference.  Slippage: Panther Protocol will allow users to prevent transactions where slippage exceeds their preferences.  Transaction Deadline: Automatically sets the time frame after which a pending transaction will autoif not completed. The current setting is fixed at 5 minutes.&nbsp;  <p>Prior to submitting the swap request, users can review details such as any impact that the resulting swap will have on price, using information such as liquidity, order book depth and order size; the fees from using the external swap protocols, guaranteed minimums received and exchange rate/conversion ratios.</p> Data Escrow <p>Data Escrow is an important Product Feature that supports Compliance Data requirements. Panther Protocols has implemented different types of Data Safe mechanism based on the roles that the DAO, Institutions (also referred as the Zone Manager) and Compliance provider perform to support this.</p><p>In the next stage, we will continue to build the decryption mechanism for those roles to access the data. The whole process will be tested when those roles participate in the testing process - essentially we see this as a process to Zone Manager testing the protocol along with other participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> History page <p>The History page UI has been updated with more of the details you will want to track, enabling you to keep records of your testnet transactions (including transaction types,amounts, asset types, value and date and time), mimicking how it will work once the protocol is live.&nbsp;</p> Disclaimer <p>For the avoidance of doubt, tZKP, tzZKP, tPRP, test MATIC, and any other tokens mentioned in this announcement or within the product are for testing purposes only and have no economic value, nor can they be exchanged for value.&nbsp;</p><p>Participation on our incentivized Testnet versions may result in you earning rewards, but such credits are not represented on any blockchain as tokens.</p>

<p>In 2017, Vitalik Buterin defined the ‘Scalability Trilemma’ which consisted of 3 attributes that every blockchain had to balance depending on its intended use cases: decentralisation, scalability and security. While Ethereum sacrificed scalability in favour of security and decentralisation, others prioritised throughput over the other two. However, a solution was proposed, inspired from Web2 computer science - sharding. Despite the fact that Ethereum’s ossification and significant progress in zero knowledge research led to a shift in Ethereum’s roadmap away from execution sharding towards L2 rollups, there were other L1s that were designed from the get-go as sharded blockchains. One such example was Elrond, who implemented the beacon chain PoS consensus alongside a sharded execution layer. Their recent rebranding to MultiversX alludes to a multi-chain, interoperable ecosystem, in which sovereign chains can communicate in a similar manner to cross-shard transaction routing.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Lucian’s background and founding Elrond (MultiversX)  Elrond’s validator &amp; shard architecture  Cross-shard composability  VMs, smart contracts and transaction routing  Self sovereignty and modularity  MultiversX vision  Roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/lucianmincu">Lucian Mincu on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/MultiversX">MultiversX on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/xPortalApp">xPortal on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

 Imagine a DeFi world without front-running, back-running, or sandwich attacks. A world where every user gets a fair price, and transaction fees don’t suddenly skyrocket. This isn’t a distant dream — it’s the reality with Verus. MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) is rampant on VM-based blockchains like Ethereum, causing users to lose money and suffer unfair trading practices. But Verus has changed the game with its innovative protocol design, making MEV attacks a thing of the past. Let’s explore how Verus is redefining DeFi with its MEV-resistance at the protocol&nbsp;layer.  MEV and its Consequences <p>Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in cryptocurrency networks, beyond the standard block&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>A block producer, whether a miner or staker, can make a profit by their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce. There are also bots that continuously search the pool of pending transactions (the mempool) for profitable opportunities. This behavior by block producers and bots leads to users being front-run, back-run or sandwich attacked on their transactions.</p><p>Front-running involves placing a transaction before a target transaction, while back-running places one immediately after. Sandwich attacks combine both, surrounding a target transaction. This behavior takes advantage of the time between when a transaction is announced (it’s in the mempool) and when it’s processed, allowing manipulators to benefit from price movements caused by the target transaction.</p><p>This malicious behavior leads to worse-than-expected execution prices and high transaction fees for regular users doing swaps or trades on AMMs (automated market makers) or DEXs (decentralized exchanges). A sudden high transaction fee can also lead to failing transactions, costing users gas fees without completing the intended trade. At worst, it can even lead to protocol instability.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is the possible problematic merger of traditional finance and decentralized finance. Front-running, and back-running are illegal practices in traditional finance but common in DeFi. Regulators are likely to view these tactics as unacceptable market manipulation, especially when applied to RWAs (real-world assets). VM-based blockchains have to balance the open, permissionless nature of the blockchain with the expectations of fairness and protection that come with mainstream financial adoption. The giant elephant in the room asks… Can blockchain protocols where MEV is endemic be used for mainstream adoption?</p> MEV Resistance in&nbsp;Verus <p>How Verus is MEV-resistant is actually really simple and doesn’t need complicated ways that try to mitigate it. It is inherently not in the protocol by forward-looking protocol&nbsp;design.</p><p>You can find Verus DeFi within the consensus layer of the protocol. All currencies (e.g. tokens, liquidity pools) are accounted for by the miners and stakers. This is very different from Ethereum, for example, where only ETH is accounted for by the stakers, and where ERC-20s are not. On VM-based blockchains DeFi is programmed at the smart contract layer, which has many vulnerability surfaces, and what is happening in those smart contracts is not verified by the block producers.</p> No Transaction Ordering <p>All VM-based blockchains solve transactions sequentially. This is their fundamental design flaw. Because of this, transactions can be ordered, by either block producers or bots paying higher gas fees to “skip the line.” This is what makes MEV possible.</p><p>Unlike VM-based blockchains that solve transactions sequentially, Verus, a UTXO-based blockchain, solves transactions simultaneously. Front-running, back-running and sandwich attacks are impossible since there is no “front” or “back”. Transactions (and thus conversions) are not&nbsp;ordered.</p><p>Conversions are solved simultaneously within 1 to 10 blocks, depending on how many conversions are made. The conversions are triggered when there are 10 transactions made, or 10 blocks have passed if it’s not busy. If it’s busy all the time, then conversions are solved every 2 blocks. This leads to a MEV-resistant protocol, but also to fair pricing and enhanced liquidity through offsetting.</p> Fair Pricing and Enhanced Liquidity <p>Because all transactions (conversions) are solved simultaneously (1 to 10 blocks), all conversions on the same “trading pair” get the same fair price. Keep in mind that there can be many “trading pairs” that are the same, but when they are in different basket currencies, they are treated as separate.</p><p>Important to note is that orders are offset against each other. For example, if one user wants to sell 100 currency X (for Y) and another wants to buy 80 currency X with Y, 80 of that currency is directly matched, leaving only 20 to affect the overall market price. This also means there is reduced price impact, and thus less slippage.</p><p>Another benefit is enhanced liquidity. Instead of each conversion drawing from or adding to the liquidity pool sequentially, the net effect is applied, making more efficient use of the available liquidity. The actual liquidity in the pool might not change, but the offsetting effect makes it behave as if there was more liquidity available because offsetting orders are matched directly, reducing the need to draw from or add to the&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Then you also have the market arbitrageurs, who now not only make a profit for themselves, they also stabilize the market overall, giving all participants a fair price. With a very low fee of 0.025% or 0.05% of the conversion (without gas fees), it is a great system for all kinds of market participants.</p><blockquote>Verus DeFi protocol wide volume in July 2024 was close to $14M. Source: on-chain&nbsp;metrics.</blockquote> Real Fair&nbsp;DeFi <p>Whatever market participant you are, you are best served with the Verus Protocol. Verus DeFi is fully functional on mainnet for everyone to&nbsp;use.</p>  No MEV (no front-running, back-running or sandwich&nbsp;attacks)  Truly decentralized (it’s a credibly neutral protocol — not a business, company or otherwise rent-seeking)  The same fair price for all market participants within 1–10&nbsp;block(s)  Secured at the protocol&nbsp;level  Low conversion fees of max.&nbsp;0.05%  Permissionless launching of liquidity pools  Bridged to Ethereum (all ERC-20s can be bridged to the Verus Protocol, in a non-custodial and trustless manner, and vice&nbsp;versa)  Decentralized crowdfund mechanisms for your currency (e.g. token, liquidity pool, native PBaaS coin), such as pre-launch discounts, pre-launch carveouts and pre-allocations   💡 Bridge Your Community to&nbsp;Verus <p>If you are in a community that has an ERC-20 as a token consider moving over to Verus. Not only do you get fair, MEV-resistant DeFi, you can also tap into the self-sovereign identity protocol (VerusID) and experience unlimited scale (no more high gas fees). <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html">You can do it permissionlessly!</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Join the Discord</a>, the worldwide community is happy to answer any questions and help you&nbsp;assist.</p><p>In the meantime you can try Verus DeFi on your mobile and <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">desktop</a> now.

 See Nym’s global reach with newly improved&nbsp;explorer <p>As <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> steams through alpha and beta testing, the global network of operators powering the world’s most private VPN is&nbsp;growing.</p><p>The privacy of a VPN service depends on the strength and distribution of its network. Nym’s decentralized network is expanding to be ready for the coming demand of users of NymVPN, which will be the first commercial app to run on the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>775 mixnodes are now being run in 88 countries around the world. To improve network performance, there have been important advancements in community governance, the Nym rewards system, and optimizing the active set of nodes. And new operators are joining the Nym community everyday.</p><p>Take a look at the current state and distribution of the network through the newly improved explorer tool. If you’re already running a node, check in on how you and the overall network are&nbsp;doing.</p> Why scaling the Nym network&nbsp;matters <p>The Nym network is made possible by the work of independent service providers. These are community members that believe in Nym’s privacy mission. Or maybe they are simply interested in Nym’s novel tokenomics which gives crypto a real world impact: incentivizing a self-sustaining privacy&nbsp;network.</p><p>With NymVPN running on the Nym mixnet, the whole world will be able to sign up for a truly decentralized privacy tool and have unprecedented protections for their traffic patterns.</p><p>But the level of privacy depends on the state of the network itself. The bigger and more distributed the network of mix nodes and gateways is, the faster and more accessible it will be for people around the world. And the bigger the crowd of traffic passing through the network, the more anonymous NymVPN users will be. Nym’s goal is thus scaling with demand for increased privacy returns for&nbsp;users.</p><p>The other importance for scaling is based on Nym’s tokenomic model: network operators running gateways and mixnodes can gain compensation for their service in providing privacy to millions of users. As usage picks up, the more rewards can be earned from the mixmining pool. The network will also grow fast on the operator front according to demand and available rewards.</p> Snapshot of the Nym&nbsp;network <p>While anyone can run a mixnode, only those with sufficient performance will be selected to be part of the active set which routes traffic through the Nym mixnet. And a lot of work by the Nym core team has gone into incentivizing improvements to the quality of node performance.</p><p>Nym has been working closely with the community this summer on quality of service, and the tight-knit community of 775 mixnodes has been very active in community governance initiatives to determine their own reward schemes. What Nym wants is actually coming to fruition: not just servers routing traffic, but a collective of service providers enabling a more private&nbsp;world.</p><p>Having a globally distributed network is crucial for both decentralized privacy and censorship resistance. There are currently operators running mixnodes and gateways in 88 countries worldwide. Take a&nbsp;look!</p>Orange represents the highest concentration of nodes, pink and white the medium respectively, and black countries without any current&nbsp;nodes.<p>88 is a good number, for now, but Nym needs to continue growing with your help. There are many people all over the world struggling with censorship, access to information, and extreme infringements on their privacy and personal wellbeing. Having active gateways in regions that are currently underrepresented in the Nym network is a crucial goal not just for the network, but for the&nbsp;world.</p> Improved explorer and harbour&nbsp;master <p>In the meantime, check out the latest improvements to the Nym <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">explorer</a> and <a href="https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/">harbour master</a> tools for keeping up with the growth of the Nym&nbsp;network.</p><p>Harbour master received a facelift and now supports mixnodes as well as gateways. You can also get crucial information about the status of particular nodes, including configuration, binary version, and more. This is especially important for node operators to check if their nodes are up to the task and configured properly.</p> Grow the network, drone out the surveillance <p>Want to join the Nym community? Consider <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/changelog.html">setting up your own node</a> and participating in the Nym’s growing network. Nym community mentors will help you do so, as well as troubleshoot, keep up with new binary releases, and apply for/enter the Delegations Program when you are&nbsp;ready.</p><p>If you are already running a top notch node, <a href="https://delegations.explorenym.net/">apply for delegations</a> via the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-delegations-program-2-0-rolling-registrations-now-open-9bc44739f1b7">Nym Delegations Program</a>! 32m NYM are available from the Nym Treasury for this Summer Season.

  Partnering with XBOW: The Gold Standard in Offensive Security  <p>Oege and his team are using AI to stay ahead of cyber attackers and deliver security that scales.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a>	 



Published July 30, 2024
  



XBOW founder Oege de Moor.



 
<p>Great offensive security requires getting creative—to safeguard against risks, you must imagine what bad actors might do. For decades, human experts have been the gold standard in this critically important work. Penetration testers (or pentesters), bug hunters and security researchers simulate attacks and find the gaps, so developers can close them.</p>



<p>But with the rise of AI, we have seen an exponential increase both in the amount of code that must be protected and in the volume of exploits, which now cost businesses more than <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/2023-official-cybercrime-report">three times</a> what they did less than a decade ago. Human experts simply can’t keep up; last year, nearly two-thirds of organizations <a href="https://www.coresecurity.com/blog/how-manage-pen-testing-skills-shortage">reported</a> their biggest challenge in maintaining a pentesting program was finding enough skilled personnel to do the work.</p>



<p>Companies must modernize—and thankfully, <a href="https://xbow.com/">XBOW</a> founder Oege de Moor and his team are establishing the new state of the art, leveraging large language models to automate pentesting that scales. XBOW <a href="https://xbow.com/blog/introducing-xbow/">solves</a> an impressive 75% of web app security benchmarks, and it does so with zero human intervention. Customers don’t have to choose between keeping their software secure and sacrificing speed and growth.</p>



<p>XBOW is designed to think like a hacker. It simulates real-world attacks and identifies novel exploits other tools might miss. When it spots a vulnerability, it automatically pinpoints the cause, runs tests to demonstrate how the issue could be exploited, and provides actionable guidance on how to fix it.</p>



<p>This is a transformative innovation for offensive security, and as a world expert in code analysis, Oege is uniquely suited to lead the way. A former Oxford professor turned founder, he sold his first company, Semmle, to GitHub and went on to create the company’s Copilot and Advanced Security products. Along the way, he built a reputation as a brilliant but pragmatic and clear-thinking leader—and a talent magnet, as the highly skilled, deeply committed team at XBOW now attests. We at Sequoia were grateful for the chance to lead their seed round and to welcome Oege to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, our company-building immersion for pre-seed and seed-stage founders. It has been a privilege to support him and the team as they grow.</p>



Oege takes the mic at the Arc story slam.



<p>No doubt XBOW’s mission is an ambitious one. But Oege and the team understand that the stakes are high not just for businesses but for national security, as well, and they are moving quickly to stay ahead of attackers and develop the best offering in AI offensive security. Their work is helping security professionals and everyone they protect—and setting a new gold standard for the industry in the process.</p>

   The results of the ZCAP Dev Fund runoff poll are in. The community has voted to support the "Hybrid Deferred Dev Fund" proposal, which allocates 20% of the block rewards to a Dev Fund for one year, with 8% earmarked for the Zcash Community Grants program, and 12% to be stored in a protocol lockbox.

<p>On July 21st, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a7ece604-47a7-11ef-baa0-7eadb9c373c3/view">runoff poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (ZCAP), to determine which of two Dev Fund proposals should be implemented when the current Dev Fund ends in November. The poll closed this morning, and the results are as follows: </p>



 
 <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-2-hybrid-deferred-dev-fund-transitioning-to-a-non-direct-funding-model">Hybrid Deferred Dev Fund: Transitioning to a Non-Direct Funding Model</a> – 91 votes (67%) 



 <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-3-lockbox-for-decentralized-grants-allocation-20-option">Lockbox For Decentralized Grants Allocation (20% option)</a> – 40 votes (30%) 
 



<p></p>



<p>Four voters (3%) abstained by choosing neither option, and 135 votes were cast in total. </p>


 
 


<p></p>



<p>We can therefore conclude that the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-2-hybrid-deferred-dev-fund-transitioning-to-a-non-direct-funding-model">Hybrid Deferred Dev Fund</a> option enjoys majority support across the Zcash community. This conclusion is reinforced by the results of <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/alternative-dev-fund-sentiment-polls/47848/67">alternative polls</a> of the ZecHub DAO, Zcash Brazil community, and the Zcash Spanish-speaking community. </p>



<p>This result bodes well for the future of Zcash. It ensures that the Zcash Community Grants program will continue to receive funding over the coming year, supporting its ongoing mission to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, and ensuring that the Zcash ecosystem can continue to become more decentralized. </p>



<p>This result is also an important step in the geographic decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem, as it lays the path for the Zcash Community Grants program to migrate from the Zcash Foundation (based on the United States) to the <a href="https://www.financialprivacyfoundation.org/">Financial Privacy Foundation</a> (based in the Cayman Islands). </p>



<p>We’d like to thank everyone who participated in this process, including those who drafted proposals; the many community members who took part in the discussions and debate on the Zcash community forum, on other social media, and in community calls; those who conducted alternative community polls; and everyone who voted in those polls. </p>



<p>Onward! </p>

<p>In our hyper-connected world, consumer data is the new gold, highly sought after by companies eager to gather, analyze, and utilize it for various purposes. But with great power comes great responsibility, and companies that fail to safeguard this valuable asset face a double whammy: an exodus of privacy-conscious customers and potentially crippling regulatory fines running into the billions.</p><p>Just consider this: according to a recent <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/data-privacy-benchmark-study.html#~about-the-study">study by CISCO</a>, a staggering 94% of customers refuse to do business with companies they don’t trust with their information. That’s right, nearly all customers gone, simply because they don’t trust the vendor with their&nbsp;data.</p><p>And the pain doesn’t end there, with the consequences of data breaches extending far beyond lost trust. Regulatory bodies are wielding data privacy violations like a financial hammer. Take, for example, the record-breaking <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en">€1.2 billion fine imposed on Meta (formerly Facebook)</a> in May 2023 by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for unlawful data transfers. This wasn’t an anomaly. In fact, the GDPR in Europe alone saw <a href="https://dataprivacymanager.net/5-biggest-gdpr-fines-so-far-2020/">fines surpassing €4 billion in 2023</a>, a significant jump from previous&nbsp;years.</p><p>But it’s not all doom and gloom. As consumer attitudes are beginning to shift, companies are starting to see data privacy not as an inconvenient obligation, but as a strategic investment, with massive value waiting to be unlocked. According to the CISCO study, privacy programs have shown an average of 160% ROI, with some respondents declaring even 500% ROI in privacy. This means that by prioritizing data privacy, companies can not only avoid the hefty fines and reputational damage associated with breaches but also unlock significant financial benefits.</p><p>This brings us to Empeiria and its groundbreaking privacy-preserving End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI). By leveraging advanced Web3 technology, Empeiria offers innovative solutions that simplify the deployment of decentralized data ecosystems, ensuring robust privacy and compliance while driving efficiency and trust. Read on to learn how Empeiria is revolutionizing data privacy and benefiting users and companies alike.</p> Data Privacy Today: A Breach of&nbsp;Trust <p>We’ve established that while private data is a highly valuable asset, companies either fail to handle it with the care and responsibility it requires, or, worse yet, actively misuse it for&nbsp;profit.</p><p>Let’s delve deeper into the shortcomings of the current data privacy systems that allow this to&nbsp;happen:</p>  Centralized Storage: Imagine a single, monolithic vault overflowing with every detail of your online activity — purchases, searches, clicks. This vulnerability-laden approach is how many companies store data. These centralized repositories become prime targets for hackers. A single breach can expose millions of users, leading to financial ruin and a collapse of&nbsp;trust.  Transparency Deficit: Companies often operate with a shroud of secrecy regarding data practices. Data privacy is often not more than a footnote in user agreement and vague terms and conditions offer little insight into how our information is collected, stored, and used. This lack of transparency fosters a deep sense of distrust.  Complex Regulations: The global data privacy landscape is a complex and fragmented maze. A patchwork of regulations across different jurisdictions creates a compliance nightmare for businesses. They’re forced to navigate a minefield, risking either overreaction with stifling regulations that hinder innovation, or under-reaction that exposes them to hefty fines and reputational damage.  Inadequate encryption: Technology advances at an unrelenting pace, constantly introducing new security threats and vulnerabilities. Keeping systems secure and data properly encrypted is a never-ending battle. Emerging technologies like AI and the Internet of Things raise additional privacy concerns, as they often involve vast amounts of highly sensitive personal data. Companies struggle to keep pace with securing these new frontiers.  Resource Strain: Building solid data privacy walls requires significant resources. Regular monitoring, audits, and security updates are essential, but they can strain the budgets and manpower of companies. This resource disparity leaves them vulnerable to breaches and non-compliance issues, further eroding trust within the digital ecosystem.  <p>These are just some cracks in the foundation of our current data privacy system. This lack of robust safeguards incentivizes some companies to prioritize short-term profits over long-term trust.</p><p>Having established the reasons behind the current data privacy failures, it’s time to pose the most pressing question: what can we do about it? The answer lies in leveraging advanced and innovative technology to rebuild the foundation of data privacy. This is where Empeiria’s End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI) comes into&nbsp;play.</p> EVDI: A Technological Solution to Data&nbsp;Privacy <p>EVDI represents a paradigm shift in our approach to data privacy, offering a comprehensive solution that addresses the core issues plaguing the current system. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology and Web3 innovations, Empeiria has developed a robust framework designed to enhance data privacy, transparency, and user&nbsp;control.</p><p>Data privacy is built into the very fabric of EVDI, ensuring that data protection is not an afterthought but a fundamental feature. Our solution is compliant with data privacy regulations and provides users with privacy-enhancing features that add a new layer of trust to digital interactions:</p>  Data Ownership: EVDI builds on and expands the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), a data framework designed to prioritize data ownership privacy. SSI uses technologies like blockchain and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to allow users to privately store their information in verifiable data wallets and prove their identity without revealing unnecessary personal information. Only users have access and control over the data they hold in their&nbsp;wallets.  Independent Data Verification: EVDI allows verifiers to check data without informing the issuer of what is being verified. Verifiers can confirm the accuracy, integrity, and validity of credentials stored in users’ data wallets without disclosing the specifics to the issuer. This ensures robust privacy while maintaining full verification capabilities.  Consent &amp; Selective Disclosure: Consent is a cornerstone of Empeiria’s approach. EVDI empowers users to give explicit consent for data sharing and usage, ensuring transparency and trust in every interaction. Furthermore, EVDI enables selective disclosure, allowing users to share only the necessary aspects of their data while keeping other information private. This means that users can prove their identity or other credentials without exposing unnecessary personal information.  Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP): Empeiria employs ZKPs, a cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information. This technique ensures that sensitive information remains private while still verifying its authenticity.  Inherent Compliance: By placing data ownership in users’ hands, EVDI meets and exceeds global data privacy regulations. This means that companies using our infrastructure can be confident that they are compliant with laws such as GDPR and CCPA. This built-in compliance simplifies the regulatory landscape for businesses, reducing the risk of fines and enhancing their reputation.   Examples of EVDI Implementation <p>Healthcare Sector: Secure Patient Data Management</p><p>Imagine a major hospital struggling to keep patient records safe and secure. This puts them at risk of fines and, more importantly, breaks patients’ trust.</p><p>Empeiria offers a new way to handle healthcare data. Instead of a centralized database, patients store their health records privately, in their verifiable data wallets. This keeps patient information secure and makes it easier for the hospital to follow strict privacy rules, like HIPAA in the&nbsp;US.</p><p>Doctors can still request the information they need to treat patients, who have more control over their data and feel confident knowing their privacy is protected. This leads to fewer data breaches, better, personalized treatment, happier patients, and a more trusted healthcare system for everyone.</p><p>Financial Services: Enhanced Security and Compliance</p><p>Financial institutions today face a significant challenge: safeguarding vast amounts of sensitive customer data across multiple jurisdictions, all while adhering to increasingly complex privacy regulations like GDPR and&nbsp;CCPA.</p><p>Empeiria’s EVDI offers a solution to this challenge, by empowering customers to store their private data in verifiable data wallets. These wallets act as personal vaults for your financial information, providing enhanced privacy and granular&nbsp;control.</p><p>Through zero-knowledge proofs, banks can verify the existence of specific financial information within those wallets, without ever actually seeing the details themselves and only with user consent. This innovative approach fosters trust by ensuring the highest levels of data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Ultimately, by prioritizing customer privacy, financial institutions can build stronger client relationships and unlock new business opportunities.</p><p>E-commerce Platform: Customer Trust and Data Transparency</p><p>Imagine an e-commerce platform facing a crisis of confidence. Customers are wary of how their data is stored and used, leading to regulatory scrutiny. Empeiria’s EVDI offers a transformative solution that prioritizes user data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>EVDI empowers customers to take control of their personal information through secure, verifiable data wallets. The platform benefits from increased transparency in data handling practices, with EVDI’s built-in compliance with data privacy regulations ensuring peace of&nbsp;mind.</p><p>This proactive approach attracts privacy-conscious customers seeking a secure and transparent shopping experience, ultimately fostering trust, satisfaction, and reduced regulatory risk.</p><p>These are just three examples of numerous potential use cases for EVDI. As privacy becomes paramount in an increasing number of our digital interactions, the potential for more practical use cases will only&nbsp;grow.</p> Conclusion <p>Empeiria’s easily deployable, cost-effective End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure paves the way for a future where data privacy is no longer an afterthought but a foundational element of digital interactions. This user-centric approach benefits everyone. Users gain complete control over their digital identities, while companies build trust and streamline compliance. It’s a win-win situation.</p><p>Looking ahead, EVDI has the potential to create a more resilient digital ecosystem, where trust is earned through technological innovation, not empty promises. By championing data ownership, selective disclosure, and robust security measures, EVDI paves the way for a future of empowered online interactions, with data privacy never compromised.</p><p>Follow Empeiria on <a href="https://twitter.com/empe_io">Twitter/X</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/empe-web3/">LinkedIn</a> for the latest news &amp; updates.

<p>Web3’s decentralisation is currently limited to smart contracts as they can be verified on-chain. However, until scalability and UX become on par with that of Web2, the only realistic way for crypto to reach mass adoption is threw off-chain dApps. This creates the premise for a security bottleneck in the form of centralised APIs used for on-chain querying. Mel Project aims to expand on-chain security and decentralisation (consensus) to off-chain apps, basically achieving off-chain composability through trustless light clients. Earendil, the backbone of their ecosystem, designed to resist ISP-level censorship, is a decentralized anonymous communication and payment network that enables autonomous applications and true P2P protocols.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Eric’s background and founding Mel Project  Why Ethereum came short  Is Infura a security bottleneck?

 Head of Marketing and two new devs joining the Nym privacy&nbsp;project <p>New Head of Marketing will lead NymVPN into a growing market of users, and new devs will help optimize the performance of the app and network through its Beta phase and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Nym is excited to introduce the Nym community to three new team members, including a new Head of Marketing joining Nym from&nbsp;NordVPN.</p><p>As <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> enters its Beta testing phase in preparation for its full launch, it is crucial now more than ever to make sure the app is up to scratch. And it is equally important to make sure that Nym’s public image communicates the privacy-enabling power of its technology. The whole world deserves to finally have and understand the real tool we needs to protect our data against surveillance and&nbsp;misuse.</p> Meet Nym’s new Head of Marketing <p>First off, Nym is very excited to welcome Robinson Jardin to the Nym core team as Head of Marketing.</p><p>Before joining Nym, Rob spent four years at NordVPN as the Head of Digital &amp; Social Media, which he helped scale to over 14 million users. Rob will play a crucial role in building Nym’s marketing team and launching NymVPN to the world. Privacy through a mixnet, remember, needs real&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Two things drew the Nym team to Rob. First, there is his experience in promoting a massively successful VPN product, and NordVPN needs no introduction. Second, Rob has a lifelong obsession with all things design, from popular advertising to 16th century tapestries. Every technology needs a good design. And Rob is well-positioned to give NymVPN the public image it deserves as the world’s most private VPN technology with unique aesthetic tastes.</p><p>The challenge that Rob will be tackling is how to get millions of ordinary people to realize that NymVPN solves a real world problem: being genuinely private online. By scaling client traffic through the mixnet, all users will essentially have more privacy: the larger the crowd, the greater the anonymity. Nym taking a note from NordVPN’s playbook also means changing the nature of the&nbsp;game.</p><p>As digital surveillance and threats grow, everyone in the world needs strong privacy protections more than ever. But few actually have it through available VPNs. Online privacy is a legitimate expectation, as Rob says, but unfortunately it’s not yet a reality. For Rob, NymVPN is one of the few real cybersecurity solutions that can be trusted because it does not involve trust by&nbsp;design.</p><p>Any groundbreaking product must do more than simply work: it also has to communicate to people what it does for them. And with Rob on board, Nym can really begin the work of communicating NymVPN’s global potential.</p><p>Don’t miss a chance to meet Rob and hear his strategies for Nym at the next <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05KQfw0kW1Y">Nym community live-stream</a> tonight at 4:00&nbsp;CET.</p> Meet Andrej Mihajlov, Lead Desktop&nbsp;Engineer <p>Also joining Nym as Lead Desktop Engineer is Andrej Mihajlov. Andrej brings a ton of VPN dev experience from his work as Lead Rust Engineer &amp; Architect at Shiva VPN and Senior Engineer at Mullvad VPN.

The limitations of this are that there is not a full transaction history, just the most recent state that the state-sync RPC has stored. An advantage of state-sync is that the database is very small in comparison to a fully synced node, therefore using state-sync to resync your node to the network can help keep running costs lower by minimizing storage&nbsp;usage.</p><p>By syncing to the network with state-sync, a node can avoid having to go through all the upgrade procedures and can sync with the most recent binary&nbsp;only.</p><p>For nodes that are intended to serve data for dapps, explorers, or any other RPC requiring full history, state-syncing to the network would not be appropriate.</p><p>Testnet state-sync</p><p>Snapshot are operated on rpc1 and&nbsp;rpc2</p><blockquote>WARNING: This documentation assumes you have followed all previous instructions.</blockquote><p>The state-sync configuration (in app.toml) is as follows (no need to update&nbsp;it):</p> # snapshot-interval specifies the block interval at which local state sync snapshots are<br># taken (0 to disable).

<p>This post describes work done by Stefanos Laskaridis, Kleomenis Katevas, Lorenzo Minto and Hamed Haddadi. This post was written by Machine Learning Researcher Stefanos Laskaridis.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  As we are entering the new era of hyper-scale models, it is indispensable to maintain the ability to host AI locally, for maintaining privacy and sustainability. This is the first study that measures the deployability of Large Language Models (LLMs) at the consumer edge, exploring the potential of running differently-sized models on smartphones and edge devices <a>1</a> instead of the cloud.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>Large Language Models, such as Llama-3, Mixtral, or ChatGPT, have recently revolutionized the machine learning landscape, enabling use-cases that were previously unfathomable, including intelligent assistants (including our own <a>Brave Leo</a>), creative writing, as well as agent-based automations (<a>Brave Search Integration</a> in Leo, for instance). At the same time, devices in our pockets have been getting increasingly capable <a>2</a>, integrating evermore powerful System-on-Chips (SoCs). Based on this trend, and maintaining our true commitment to preserving users’ privacy, we explore the feasibility of deploying LLMs on device, a model in which user prompts and LLM outputs never leave the device premises.</p>
<p>To do this, the Brave Research team has built their very own LLM benchmarking infrastructure, named BLaDE, for measuring the latency, accuracy, memory, and energy impact of running LLMs on-device. At the same time, acknowledging that these models are oftentimes too large, we leverage edge devices to accelerate execution locally, which can be co-located with smart devices at the consumer side <a>3</a>. This can also be deployed with our most recent <a>BYOM</a> (Bring Your Own Model) self-hosting option.</p>
<p>Our experience has shown that while the GenAI ecosystem is growing increasingly large, local on-device deployment is still in its infancy and remains very heterogeneous across devices. Deploying LLMs on device is possible, but with noticeable impact latency, comfort and accuracy, especially on mid-tier devices. However, hardware and algorithmic breakthroughs can significantly change the cost of execution and user Quality of Experience (QoE). At the same time, SLMs (Small Language Models) <a>4</a> are gradually making their appearance, tailored for specific downstream tasks.</p>

<p>BLaDE (BatteryLab Device Evaluation) is a state-of-the-art benchmarking infrastructure that is capable of automating the interaction with mobile devices for performance and energy measurements. It can be used for neural or more generic browser tasks. MELT is the component responsible for the benchmarking of neural workloads on various devices.</p>
<p>MELT adopts a server-client architecture, with the central coordinating process being responsible for the following:</p>
 
 
<p>Organizing the execution of the benchmarking suite;</p>
 
 
<p>Scheduling and dispatching jobs to connected devices;</p>
 
 
<p>Controlling the downstream interaction with the application;</p>
 
 
<p>Monitoring their runtime, temperature and energy consumption;</p>
 
 
<p>Tracing the events of interest in the downstream task and capturing the associated device behavior.</p>
 
 
<p>To this end, it integrates the following components:</p>
 
 
<p>a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB, which adopts the role of the coordinator;</p>
 
 
<p>a Mac Mini, for building packages;</p>
 
 
<p>a Monsoon power monitor connected over a Raspberry Pi GPIO addressable relay to control power to individual mobile devices;</p>
 
 
<p>a programmable YKUSH USB Switchable Hub for communicating and selectively disabling USB power to devices;</p>
 
 
<p>a Flir One edge wireless camera along with an custom-built IR thermometer (based on MLX90614) for monitoring temperature of the device; and last,</p>
 
 
<p>a set of mobile devices, shown on Table 1, which have undergone a battery bypass procedure.</p>
 
 
<p>In parallel, the coordinator is connected over Ethernet to the same network as our Nvidia Jetson boards with SSH access to them. Jetsons are able to provide power and temperature metrics through SysFS probes available.</p>

 MELT Workflow

        </a>
     
 
<p>The measurement workflow we follow is depicted in Figure 1b. MELT’s infrastructure consists of the following components:</p>
 
 
<p>Model Zoo, responsible for the download and compilation/quantization of models. We used the models of Table 2.</p>
 
 
<p>Evaluator, responsible for the evaluation of the accuracy degradation of models due to their conversion/quantization. We used the datasets of Table 4.</p>
 
 
<p>Builder, responsible for the compilation of the respective benchmarking suite backend, shown in Table 3, namely llama.cpp and MLC-LLM.</p>
 
 
<p>Runner, responsible for the deployment, automation and runtime of the LLM on the respective device. Integrated devices are shown on Table 1.</p>
 
 
<p>Monitor, responsible for the fine-grained monitoring of resource and energy consumption of the execution</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Result Highlights 
<p>Below, we provide the most interesting results of our analysis and their consequences for on-device deployment and future product research.</p>

 Throughput and Energy per Device 
<p><a>

    </a></p>
<p>Figure 3 illustrates the prefill and generation throughput of various models on different devices when used in a conversational setting. Prefill refers to the preparation and processing of input tokens before actual generation begins (e.g., tokenization, embedding, KV cache population), while generation refers to the autoregressive generation (i.e., decoding) of output tokens. Throughput expresses the rate of token ingestion/production, measured in tokens/sec.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4 depicts the discharge rate per token generated, for different model, device and framework combinations. This is expressed in mAh/token.</p>
<p>Insights: We witnessed a quite heterogeneous landscape in terms of device performance across models. Prefill operations, typically compute bound, are much higher than generation rates, which are typically memory bound. MLC-LLM generally offered higher performance, compared to llama.cpp, but at the cost of model portability. Surprisingly, 4-bit models ran faster than their 3-bit counterparts, but at the expense of higher memory consumption, which caused certain models to run out of memory during runtime. Last, the Metal-accelerated iPhones showed higher throughput rates compared to the OpenCL-accelerated Android phones, for the case of MLC-LLM.</p>
<p>Energy-wise, larger networks offer larger discharge rates, as traffic between on-chip and off-chip memory consumes a significant amount of energy. Indicatively, if we deployed Zephyr-3B (4-bit quantized) on S23 on MLC-LLM, iPhone Pro on MLC-LLM and iPhone 14 Pro on llama.cpp, it would take 542.78, 490.05 and 590.93 prompts on average until their battery was depleted. Last, the CPU execution offered lower energy efficiency, attributed to the latency of running inference compared to accelerated execution.&nbsp;</p>

 Quality Of Experience 
<p>In real-world settings, running a large model on device can adversely affect the user experience and render the device unstable or unusable. There are largely three dimensions to consider:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Device responsiveness refers to the general stability and reliability of the device during runtime of LLM inference. Factors that affected the device responsiveness included long model loading times, out-of-memory errors which killed the application and device restarts, causing effectively a DoS by rebooting the device.</p>
 
 
<p>Sustained performance refers to the device’s ability to offer the same performance throughout the runtime of multiple inference requests. We noticed in our experiments that performance under sustained load was not stable, but fluctuated. Reasons for this behavior include DVFS, thermal throttling and different power profiles, along with potential simultaneous workloads.</p>
 
 
<p>Device temperature does not only affect device performance, but also user comfort. Devices nowadays come in various forms, but mostly remain passively cooled. Therefore, heat dissipation is mainly facilitated by the use of specific materials and heat management is governed by the OS. The power draw did cause temperatures to rise to uncomfortable levels, reaching 47.9°C after one full conversation with Zephyr-3B (4-bit) model on the iPhone 14 Pro.</p>
 
 
<p>Insights: Tractability of the LLM inference workload does not imply deployability.</p>

 Accuracy Impact of Quantization 
<p><a>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    </a></p>
<p>Today’s LLMs are quite large in size. At the same time, the memory that most devices come equipped with is in the region of 6 - 12 GB. This means that deploying such models on device is usually only possible through compression. Quantization is a compression technique which lowers the precision with which weights and activations are represented. However, this happens at the expense of accuracy. We measured the impact of using different model architectures and sizes, quantization schemes and precision to the accuracy of four natural language tasks (HellaSwag, Winogrande, TruthfulQA, ARC-{E,C}).</p>
<p>Insights: The most evident performance difference comes from the model architecture and parameter size, and this performance difference persists across datasets. In terms of quantization schemes, it is obvious that bit width is correlated to model size, but also to accuracy, i.e., lower bit width means higher error rate.On the other hand, there was no single quantization scheme that performed uniformly better across the board. For larger models (≥7B</p>
<p>parameters), AWQ <a>5</a> and GPTQ <a>6</a> performed slightly better, at the expense of elevated model sizes.</p>

 Offloading to Edge Devices 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Since QoE and accuracy of LLMs is impacted by running on device, as evidenced earlier, we visit an alternative model of offloading computation to nearby devices at the consumer edge. Such devices may be a dedicated accelerator (e.g., an Edge-AI Hub) or another edge device (e.g., a Smart TV or a high-end router). For this reason, we employ two Jetson devices, namely Nano (mid-tier) and AGX (high-tier) to check the viability of this paradigm.</p>
<p>Insights: Overall, generation throughput is significantly higher than the equivalent mobile runtime, and this runtime can also be sustained for longer periods. Indicatively, for Zephyr-7B (4-bit), the average throughput is 3.3× and 1.78× higher, for prefill and generation respectively. At the same time, we witnessed that the energy efficiency is moving the same direction as the device’s TDP.</p>

 Key Takeaways 
<p>This work highlights the potential and challenges of deploying Large Language Models on consumer mobile devices for both iOS and Android ecosystems. While advancements in hardware and algorithmic breakthroughs such as quantization show promise, on-device deployment currently impacts latency, device stability, and energy consumption. Offloading computation to local edge devices offers a viable alternative, providing improved performance and energy efficiency. Continued innovation in both hardware and software will be crucial for making local AI deployment practical, preserving user privacy, and enhancing sustainability.</p>

  Partnering with rift: Sales, simplified.  <p>If you’re tired of manually stitching together multiple tools, this is the platform for you.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/">Stephanie Zhan</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a>	 



Published July 24, 2024
  



rift co-founders Fil Twarowski and Eddie Eriksson.



 
<p>The Greatest Salesman in the World, Og Mandino’s bestseller on the philosophy of success, tells the story of a young entrepreneur who rises from tending camels to running a massive trade empire after studying ten scrolls about the importance of persistence, love and other virtues. It’s one of our favorite books here at Sequoia, in part because&nbsp;persistence and love are foundational in sales.</p>



<p>But today, persistence and love alone aren’t enough—sales is hard and probably <a href="https://diginomica.com/selling-stuff-getting-harder-salesforces-state-sales-report-reflects-changed-buyer-behaviors">getting harder</a>. Modern B2B sales teams juggle research, prospecting and thousands of Zoom calls. They pull off heroics at the finish line. There are all kinds of distractions in the way, from updating the CRM to cleaning contact data. And making things more frustrating, the average sales team works across <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-sales/">10 different tools</a>, with no single home base where they can focus on doing their jobs.</p>



<p>Fil Twarowski and Eddie Eriksson became obsessed with this problem when they ran sales and growth at the equity-management company Pulley. In the process of integrating the dozens of tools they used to make Pulley the new default for thousands of companies, Fil and Eddie recognized that running exceptional campaigns required exceptional amounts of manual work. It’s one thing to dump generic copy into mass emails. It’s another to craft personalized outbound to exactly the right audience—and to deal with the endless technical details involved in getting those messages seen, such as caps on how many emails you can send per day.</p>



<p>Now, as co-founders of <a href="https://www.rift.com/">rift</a>, Fil and Eddie are freeing up salespeople to shift their focus back to the core of their work. The platform combines the tools modern sales teams need, in one place. It’s an email solution for perfect sequencing to prospects. It’s a dialer to make calling leads more efficient, and a scheduler for automatically routing them and booking meetings. It’s the infrastructure for managing mechanics like email deliverability. It’s applying LLMs not to replace salespeople, but to lighten their load with features such as custom copy. And it’s all in one—no more passing data back and forth between multiple tools.</p>



<p>In short, rift does more than just give sales teams new capabilities. It creates a delightful, focused home base where they can do their best work.</p>



<p>Since Fil and Eddie started rift in late 2022, leading companies including Gusto, Capchase and Rhombus have come to rely on what the team has built—and they’re getting results. One customer, for example, replaced an outbound email program paralyzed by spam issues with a more personalized approach, and generated $300,000 in pipeline in just one sequence.</p>



<p>And this is just the beginning. We at Sequoia are beyond excited to lead rift’s seed round and partner with Fil, Eddie and their team as they scale their vision to empower exceptional sellers.</p>

  Better Agents Need Better Documentation  <p>Using AI effectively requires a new kind of structured data that AI itself cannot yet produce.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/pat-grady/">Pat Grady</a>	 



Published July 23, 2024
  



 
<p>In February, Klarna boldly announced that its new OpenAI-powered assistant handled two thirds of the Swedish fintech’s customer service chats in its first month. All kinds of customer satisfaction metrics were better, but what got everyone’s attention was the $40M boost to its bottom line from replacing 700 full-time contract agents.</p>



<p>Since then, every company we talk to wants to know, “how do we get the Klarna customer support thing?” Against the backdrop of flashy demoware and eye-popping pre-revenue valuations, Klarna’s practical application of GPT-4 was a welcome relief. But as Klarna founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski explains in this week’s <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/sebastian-siemiatkowski-klarna/">Training Data podcast</a>, the reality of this accomplishment is both more prosaic and more profound than it first appears.</p>



<p>To explain the insight that fueled this breakthrough, Siemiatkowski invokes the classic computer science concept of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">garbage in, garbage out</a>” (GIGO). All the way back to Babbage, scientists have understood that “if you put into the machine wrong figures,” the right answers will not come out. For Klarna, this meant that the team needed to pay special attention to the language they gave the model as context for specific customer service tasks—in other words the documentation and training manuals they made for the agents themselves. “That helped us a lot to think about it that way, that we just needed to make sure that the documentation and the manuals were clear enough and of quality enough, and then it can actually execute,” says Siemiatkowski.</p>



<p>Klarna has not disclosed “the secret sauce” for how they built their assistant beyond using a form of RAG (retrieval augmented generation), so it’s not clear how much of its successful performance is due to data quality alone or to “custom cognitive architectures”1 adapted to specific tasks. Either way, this is a prime example of what we call “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/goldilocks-agents/">Goldiocks agents</a>” that benefit both from guardrails (in this case, the specific ways that Klarna handles customer service requests) as well as the ability of LLMs to fluidly merge information in a coherent manner.</p>



<p>The needs of large language models bring what has been a niche concern front and center. Since it was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401">formalized in 2020</a>, RAG has become the industry standard to wrap the expressive elasticity of LLMs around the key facts needed to reliably execute a task, particularly in mission-critical business settings. Curating the quality of examples to retrieve from is key to success.</p>



<p>There are people in the world who love writing documentation, but not many. For most of us, we bemoan the bad but don’t contribute to making it better. However, high-performance companies like Stripe have pioneered “<a href="https://slab.com/blog/stripe-writing-culture/">writing culture</a>” where social norms encourage participation. Gitlab, one of the first remote-only companies, has developed a <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first/">handbook-first approach to communication</a> as a pillar of their operational excellence2.</p>



<p>More generally, in the case of Klarna, the company has built an elaborate knowledge graph3 to power not only their external-facing customer service reps (human and agentic) but also their internal chatbot, Kiki. This focus on the quality of documentation has dual benefits, Siemiatkowski explains: “So actually our agents have better tools today to be successful in helping the customers as does the AI. So both experiences are improving as a consequence of that.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski believes that Klarna has derived a lot of value through experimentation and building internally with AI. But in both cases he discussed—LLM-powered internal knowledge management systems and external-facing customer services agents—buying rather than building is now a very viable option with solutions like <a href="https://www.glean.com/">Glean</a> and <a href="https://sierra.ai/">Sierra</a>. However, buyer beware, GIGO still applies.</p>



<p>This focus on high-quality data is a large theme in contemporary AI. Microsoft released a paper last year, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11644">Textbooks Are All You Need</a>, that showed how a significantly smaller model trained on better data could outperform far larger models on coding exercises. On the large model side, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott told us in <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/training-data-kevin-scott/">Episode 4</a> that it’s “a good thing that quality of data matters more than quantity of data, because it gives you an economic framework to go do the do the partnerships that you need to go do to make sure that you are feeding your AI training algorithm a curriculum that is going to result in smarter models. And, honestly, not wasting a whole bunch of compute feeding it a bunch of things that are not.” When it comes to enterprise use cases, particularly consumer-facing ones like Klarna’s, the quality bar is high because customers are comparing against human agents.</p>



<p>What Klarna’s experience suggests is that AI will work best when paired with human effort to understand other humans (something that LLMs seem a long way from achieving). This is actually the same customer-centric approach that is at the heart of all great businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greetings community,</p><p>June 17th, 2024 ushered in the successful Alexandria upgrade of Shade Protocol — bringing advanced protocol &amp; SILK analytics, the prices page, liquid $SHD staking, Spartan NFTs, and&nbsp;more.</p><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/analytics">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/analytics</a><p>Now that this upgrade was complete, the time has now come for Shade Protocol to prepare its next upgrade on September 24th:</p> Argos. <p>Argos was an ancient Greek city spanning from 1600 BC — 146 BC, a natural cultural hub during its time. Argos produced notable poets, sculptors, and architects. Poets such as Telesilla + Ario and sculptors Polykleitos and Ageladas left their mark with a focus on proper proportions of their sculptures, emphasizing symmetry and balance. The Canon (from the Greek “Kanōn,” meaning “measure” or “rule”) was a theoretical work by Polykleitos that outlined his mathematical approach to achieving perfect proportions in sculpture. Polykleitos sought to create a formula that could be applied to sculpt the ideal human&nbsp;figure.</p><p>Principles of the&nbsp;Kanōn</p>  Symmetria (Proportion): Polykleitos emphasized the harmonious relationship between different parts of the body. This concept is akin to symmetry, where each part of the body is in balanced proportion to the&nbsp;others.  Mathematical Ratios: He believed that beauty in the human form could be achieved through specific numerical ratios. For instance, the head was considered one-eighth of the total height, and the length of the foot was one-sixth of the&nbsp;height.  Contrapposto: This stance, where the weight is shifted onto one leg, creating an asymmetry in the hips and shoulders, was crucial for achieving a naturalistic and dynamic pose. It demonstrated a balance of tension and relaxation in the body, reflecting Polykleitos’ focus on&nbsp;harmony.  <p>Polykleitos’ Canon was a significant contribution to the field of art, emphasizing a scientific and mathematical approach to beauty and aesthetics that resonated throughout the history of Western&nbsp;art.</p><p>In many ways, Shade has long carried an unnatural contrapposto where privacy has placed undue tension on certain parts of user interactions, creating an unnatural disharmony.</p><p>The Argos update aims to bring symmetry, balance, and harmony to the Shade UX as we continue on the quest to refine user stories &amp; the ease of traversing the Shade Protocol application.</p><p>Streamlined Permit Implementation: We’re reducing the token balance viewing and storing process from 60+ paid transactions to handle all of the encrypted tokens on the Shade app to instead just 3–4 clicks, all of which will be free txs. This will significantly enhance the Shade Protocol user experience and cross multi-device management.</p><p>Balance Stores V2: Say goodbye to latency issues. We’re revolutionizing how balances are stored on local devices. Real-time updates mean you’ll always see accurate balances as you navigate the&nbsp;app.</p><p>Eliminate wrap UX / improve to Automatic Wrap Functionality: We’re eliminating the need for manual wrapping in most cases. Don’t worry, power users can still access this feature on the utility page. And of course, we’re keeping everything private and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>Portfolio V2: Get ready for a visual treat! We’re beautifying the historical view of your assets and their performance. Expect cleaner, more intuitive charting that makes tracking your investments a&nbsp;breeze.</p><p>Money Market Sneak Peek: We’re working on a comprehensive whitepaper for our upcoming Money Market feature. Keep an eye out for a sleek mockups &amp; a potential testnet.</p><p>We believe Shade Protocol through its relentless drive towards ease of use can help unlock &amp; reveal the power of private DeFi for the whole world to&nbsp;use.</p> Argos: Classical Ideals and Heroic&nbsp;Legacy <p>As we prepare for the upcoming Argos upgrade on September 24th, we are inspired by the historical and mythological significance of Argos. In Greek mythology, Argos was not only a cultural hub but also the realm of Diomedes, a legendary hero renowned for his strength and valor. Diomedes played a pivotal role in the Trojan War, leading 80 ships into battle and famously participating in the strategic deception of the Trojan Horse, which led to the fall of Troy. His contributions and heroic feats are emblematic of the balance and precision we aim to bring to the Shade Protocol through&nbsp;Argos.</p><p>Just as Diomedes’ leadership and prowess shaped the course of the Trojan War, the Argos upgrade represents a transformative moment for Shade Protocol. We are dedicated to bringing a new level of harmony and efficiency to our platform, inspired by the principles of symmetry and balance embodied by Diomedes’ legacy. The upgrade will enhance user experience with a powerful transaction engine, refined portfolio management, and streamlined interactions, mirroring the ideals of precision and coordination that Diomedes exemplified. Join us as we honor this rich legacy and strive to advance private DeFi with the elegance and effectiveness of classical ideals.</p> Conclusion <p>As we move forward, inspired by the historical significance and the enduring principles of Argos, Diomede, and Polykleitos’ Canon, Shade Protocol remains committed to evolving and enhancing our platform. By fostering an environment where balance and symmetry guide our development, we aim to create a seamless and harmonious user experience. The Argos upgrade represents not just a step forward in technology, but a stride towards a more refined, accessible, and powerful DeFi ecosystem. Join us on this journey to bring the elegance of classical ideals into the future of private decentralized finance.</p><p>Twitter → <a href="https://x.com/Shade_Protocol">https://x.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p><p>App → <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/analytics">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/analytics</a></p><p>Telegram → <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">https://t.me/ShadeProtocol</a></p>

 The Spring season of the Nym Squad League has just ended and the community has achieved a lot over the past three&nbsp;months! <p>Nym Squad League sets out missions for the community and broader ecosystem. These missions contribute to fixing the broken internet by enabling privacy. Community members are rewarded for completing missions from the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squad-wealth-fund-e02129306b1b">Squad Wealth Fund</a> (community treasury).</p><p>With the Spring season now over, it’s time to take a look back at what has been achieved and assess the state of the community treasury.</p> Spring season achievements <p>The Spring season missions had four key objectives for the community. Let’s take them in order and see how we&nbsp;did!</p> 1. Prepare mainnet for the NymVPN&nbsp;Launch   <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/incentivizing-privacy-not-surveillance-nym-nodes-approve-min-profit-margin-8bbfa5732128">Governance proposals</a>: four on-chain proposals were discussed and voted on. These determined a minimum profit margin, as well as the distribution of rewards across layers in the Nym&nbsp;network.  Node testing and upgrade: 365 Nym nodes were upgraded (<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/faster-better-stronger-smooshier-improving-mixnet-coverage-with-project-smoosh-eaf4b215507f">smooshed</a>) to improve the&nbsp;network.  The core team and node operators worked closely to boost network reliability and performance.  Community program of operator mentorship was expanded, with more experienced operators teaching new ones all about running Nym&nbsp;nodes.   2. Test NymVPN with different audiences   Community Testing: Nym community continued testing the NymVPN Alpha release across four different continents, providing valuable feedback through 150 bug reports and feature requests.  Global Outreach: the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> was showcased at 15 events and workshops worldwide, reaching audiences from Vietnam to&nbsp;Brazil.   3. Build new tools for the Nym ecosystem   <a href="https://delegations.explorenym.net/">CRM System</a>: Improvements were made to the community-developed CRM system to enable the Nym Delegations Program.&nbsp;.  <a href="http://mixplorer.xyz">Mixplorer.xyz</a>: This community-built explorer for the Nym network is seeking further development funding.   4. Grow and strengthen the Nym community   New Members: 250 new members joined the Nym Squad League, with most staying&nbsp;active.  Increased Contributions: Contributions grew from 22 to 52, with members taking on roles like community management and translations.  <p>To find out more about these achievements, download the full Spring season report&nbsp;here.</p> State of the Squad Wealth&nbsp;Fund <p>The Nym Squad League takes rewards generated from the official <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-delegations-program-2-0-rolling-registrations-now-open-9bc44739f1b7#:~:text=The%20Nym%20Delegations%20Program%20was,for%20operators%20in%20underrepresented%20regions.">Nym Nodes Delegations Program</a> and puts it into a community treasury called the Squad Wealth Fund. Rewards are redeemed and distributed from this treasury to the Nym ecosystem on a quarterly basis for outstanding contributions.</p><p>Squad Wealth Fund spending increased from 150k to 260k NYM compared to the Winter season. This is because the Squad League grew a lot! In fact, 250+ new participants registered and over twice as many notable contributions were submitted this&nbsp;session.</p><p>The <a href="https://mixnet.explorers.guru/account/n1rnxpdpx3kldygsklfft0gech7fhfcux4zst5lw">Nym treasury</a> delegated 29,750,000 NYM tokens this season. The <a href="https://mixnet.explorers.guru/account/n1j25nq67nt836s4qxp440cjlsptdy69uumfwz76">fund</a> earned 490k NYM and ended with a positive balance, leaving over 530k NYM in the Nym community’s warchest for future&nbsp;use:</p> Looking Ahead to the Summer&nbsp;season <p>The Spring 2024 season of the Nym Squad League was a success, with significant community growth and achievements.</p><p>As the league prepares for the summer season, the focus remains on fostering innovation, improving the network, and engaging the community.</p><p>Various improvements are in the pipeline for the Squad League framework. The Summer season objectives for the Nym community will&nbsp;be:</p>  Advancing the Alpha, boosting the beta of&nbsp;NymVPN  Strengthening and optimizing the Nym&nbsp;network  Developing tools and apps on the Nym&nbsp;mixnet  Growing the global Nym community  <p>The community treasury already has 530k NYM to support these objectives, with more rewards being accrued over the next season.

<p>Earlier this month, the Zcash Foundation (ZF), Electric Coin Company (ECC) and various other members and groups across the Zcash community conducted a series of polls to determine whether the was clear consensus in favour of introducing a new Dev Fund when the current one ends later this year. </p>



<p>The results of the polls varied. While there is clearly strong support for a new Dev Fund, there was no clear consensus regarding which proposal should be adopted.  However, two proposals garnered strong support across all the polls (and were the top two proposals in the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap-dev-fund-poll-results-july-2024/">ZCAP poll</a>). </p>



<p>The <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-2-hybrid-deferred-dev-fund-transitioning-to-a-non-direct-funding-model">Hybrid Deferred Dev Fund: Transitioning to a Non-Direct Funding Model</a>&nbsp;proposal would last for one year, and would allocate</p>



 
 8% to the Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF) for the Zcash Community Grants program, and 



 12% to a protocol lockbox. 
 



<p></p>



<p>The <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-3-lockbox-for-decentralized-grants-allocation-20-option">Lockbox For Decentralized Grants Allocation (20% option)</a> proposal would allocate 20% of the block rewards to a protocol lockbox for two years (with no funding for Zcash Community Grants).</p>



<p>Under both proposals, the remaining 80% of the block rewards would be allocated to the miners. Funds that are directed into the protocol lockbox will remain there until a distribution mechanism is introduced in a future network upgrade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ZF (along with ECC and and others across the community) are conducting a runoff poll to determine which of these proposals should be adopted. Today, we opened <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a7ece604-47a7-11ef-baa0-7eadb9c373c3/view">a Helios poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (ZCAP), which will close at 09:00 UTC on 29th July 2024.</p>



<p>As always, we welcome the community’s feedback. If you have comments or suggestions, please join the conversation on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/">Zcash community forum</a>.</p>

         TL;DR   Horizen 2.0 Upgrade is Full Steam Ahead: Community voted in favor of the upgrade to a more advanced blockchain architecture.  Binance Monitoring Tag Removed: $ZEN demonstrates stability and meets Binance’s listing criteria.  ZenIPs: Six ZenIPs were voted on, including the removal of shielded pools and the technical roadmap for Horizen 2.0.  Technical Upgrades: Significant upgrades include new node software, EON 1.4, and EON Forger Nodes.  New Ecosystem Partnerships: New integration with partners such as Magic Link, Rabby Wallet, and Math Wallet.  Media &amp; Events: Highlights include the Horizen Buidler House at ETHDenver and appearances at major Web3 conferences.  <p>2024 has been quite the year so far for the Horizen Ecosystem and for $ZEN. Completing the transition away from being a privacy coin and currently undergoing the Horizen 2.0 upgrade to become the next-gen EVM optimized for ZK apps. From ZenIPs to new partners, product upgrades, Horizen turning 7, and more, let’s dive in and see what happened for the first half of 2024.</p><p></p> Horizen 2.0 Upgrade is Full Steam Ahead <p></p><p>In June of 2024, the community voted overwhelmingly in favor for&nbsp; transitioning $ZEN from the legacy Horizen mainchain and Horizen EON EVM to a more advanced blockchain architecture, we call this upgrade Horizen 2.0.&nbsp;</p><p>At a high level, Horizen ($ZEN) and EON are currently built on older technology stacks. The Horizen Mainchain is a fork of the Bitcoin C++ codebase with a block time of 2.5 minutes, while EON is written in Scala based on the Scorex SDK with an 18-second block time. To address the limitations of these legacy systems and align with the vision of Horizen as a home for ZK and an enduring utility for $ZEN, a ZenIP was proposed to upgrade to Horizen 2.0, which introduces more advanced features and optimizations to enhance the network performance, security, and utility of $ZEN.</p><p>To learn more about ZenIP 42406 and Horizen 2.0, check out <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42406-eon-and-zen-migration-high-level-overview/">this high-level overview</a> that breaks everything down.&nbsp;</p> Binance Removes the Monitoring Tag for $ZEN <p>On July 1st, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-extend-the-monitoring-tag-to-include-bal-ctxc-cvp-cvx-dock-hard-iris-mbl-pols-snt-sun-and-remove-the-monitoring-tag-for-mln-zen-on-2024-07-01-782b121c462b499487dc8f20e0edc6b2">Binance announced</a> the removal of the monitoring tag for $ZEN recognizing its stability and performance.&nbsp;</p><p>The monitoring tag was placed in Jan 2024 along with several other privacy-featured coins. In the same month, the Horizen community<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/"> voted in favor of removing the privacy feature</a> from the Horizen mainchain, removing regulatory and delisting risks for $ZEN, allowing the Horizen network to maintain its versatility and compliance in the competitive landscape of web3. The shielded pool was removed from the Horizen mainchain on February 2024.&nbsp;</p> What else does this mean for $ZEN?&nbsp;   Consistent Stability and Confidence: Indicates that $ZEN has demonstrated consistent stability and security, reducing concerns over volatility and risk.    Improved Listing Criteria: Indicates that $ZEN meets Binance’s stringent listing criteria, including regulatory-compliance, strong development activity, team commitment, and a secure network.    Positive Market Perception: Reflects a positive outlook on $ZEN, increasing user confidence and encouraging more participation in the Horizen ecosystem.  <p>In the same month of July, <a href="https://x.com/horizenglobal/status/1811121186757312572">$ZEN is ranked a top 10 ZK Project by Market Cap on Coingecko</a></p><p></p> ZenIPs&nbsp; <p>The Horizen community voted on 6 ZenIPs in the first half of this year:&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">ZenIP 42207</a>: Removal of the Shielded Pools from the Horizen Mainchain – 99.97% in Favor  <p>This ZenIP represents a necessary evolution of the Horizen network to maintain its competitiveness, versatility, and compliance in the changing landscape of blockchain regulation and technology. The passing of this proposal speaks to the community’s desire to strategically pivot away from privacy-focused features towards a more scalable and regulatory-compliant framework.&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/">ZenIP 42400</a>: Modernizing Horizen Technology via a Modular Proof Verification Layer – 100% in Favor  <p>This ZenIP details a comprehensive understanding of the new modular system proposed by Horizen Labs. It outlines the strategic approach and delves into the technical aspects of a modular proof verification layer.

<p>We are sad to announce that Teor is leaving the Zcash Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teor joined ZF in <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-zcash-foundation-welcomes-jane-and-teor/">June 2020</a>, having previously worked with the Tor Project. They quickly became a key member of the engineering team, acting as engineering lead for extended periods of time, and helping onboard and mentor new engineering hires as the organisation grew. They were a leading contributor to the successful development and launch of Zebra, and played an important role in responding to the Halborn security disclosure. They contributed to several ZIPs, regularly attended ZIP editors meetings, and formally became a ZIP editor in September 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teor went on sabbatical in early 2024, and has now decided to explore new challenges in non-Proof of Work Web3 technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teor remains a firm supporter of the Zcash mission, and will continue to support ZF as a member of our Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of their colleagues, both with ZF and across the broader Zcash ecosystem, I want to thank Teor for their contributions and service to the Zcash community, and wish them the very best as they embark on the next phase of their career!</p>

 BlueYard Crypto 3: backing the ultimate capital x compute coordination machine with our latest $75m early-stage crypto&nbsp;fund <p>As we began to deploy our 3rd dedicated crypto fund, BlueYard Crypto 3* (raised last year), we took a step back to reflect on our thesis and approach behind crypto investing. What are the core belief pillars underpinning our strategy?</p><p>In the history of technology, economics and organizations — never has there been a technology and incentive system that can autonomously coordinate machines (compute, storage, etc), algorithms, data and capital at such an incredible scale, so quickly — all while providing independent, robust and trustless infrastructure for economic activity and data. Although still early in its development, crypto might be the ultimate solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem#:~:text=A%20collective%20action%20problem%20or,individuals%20that%20discourage%20joint%20action.">collective action</a> problem. Also, if one believes in a future where the autonomous coordination between compute, data and capital will play an increasing role, crypto networks could be the “under the hood” operating system for large economic networks.</p><p>Societies and economies will highly value censorship-resistant money and information flows enabled by decentralization, the ability to cut out intermediaries in many large-scale markets — thereby unlocking higher degrees of innovation and efficiency. The creation of portable internet-native assets with the ability to create mass- &amp; user-centric ownership of traditionally centralized businesses will enable a new economic paradigm.</p><p>If large networks of coordinated machines and capital can be transformative to many industries and markets relying on computation, data and economic flows in the future — one might reasonably conclude that crypto networks, with their unique properties, have the potential to form a key backbone of such future markets — ranging from software / data / compute markets to physical infrastructure. If crypto can be the future of many markets and financial systems, today’s crypto infrastructure and applications are a call option on that future. This is what BlueYard has always believed — and is reflected in our investment hypothesis and applied strategy of investing at the earliest stages&nbsp;in:</p>  the core functionality of the capital x compute coordination machine, such as the creation of consensus and the economic and technological enhancement of chains (e.g. <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs / IPFS</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>, <a href="https://www.kiln.fi/">Kiln</a>, <a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a>)  the augmentation of core chains to make their consensus and compute useful &amp; usable for developers and users (e.g. <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a>, <a href="https://tableland.xyz/">Tableland</a>, <a href="https://cryptio.co/">Cryptio</a>)  an emerging application layer that leverages crypto’s unfair advantages (e.g. <a href="https://www.3num.co/">3NUM</a>, <a href="https://nudge.xyz/">Nudge</a>, <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle / Drips)</a> in web services and financial products (e.g. <a href="https://centrifuge.io/">Centrifuge</a>)  <p>We further augment this by selectively investing in liquid tokens that are a match for our thesis (e.g. <a href="https://rendernetwork.com/">Render</a>, <a href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium</a>, <a href="https://dimo.zone/">Dimo</a>) and some large-cap L1s for purposes of working capital (e.g. Solana, ETH, Cosmos), with a view to re-deploy the asset base into their native ecosystems.</p><p>So if you are building along our thesis or want to open our minds to something completely new — we would like to hear from you. Or if you are looking to work on some open-ended research without committing to scaling a startup, take a look at our <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/announcing-the-blueyard-dyor-do-your-own-research-funding-program-9be5f2f23d37">DYOR program</a>.

We are just aligning our naming policy to be less confusing. Right now we are investing BlueYard 3 ($175m) and BlueYard Crypto 3&nbsp;($75m).</p>

  The Game Theory of AI CapEx  <p>“Will AI change the world” and “Are CapEx levels too high” are different questions.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 



Published July 16, 2024
  



 
<p>Imagine you knew for certain that AI was going to be as transformational as the internet, and that you control the only AI company in the world. How fast would you build CapEx?</p>



<p>I believe the answer is: You would take your time. “AI CapEx” is a euphemism for building physical <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-data-center-buildout/">data centers</a> with land, power, steel and industrial capacity. If you were the only company in AI, you’d wait to digest some AI revenues. You’d see how liquid cooling systems perform, and alter your data center designs as needed. You’d build new power generation assets in the right locations, and then build your data centers in proximity to fiber optic cables. What you would not do is immediately lock in multiple years worth of CapEx, because you’d know that as models and architectures shift, so too will your data centers need to evolve.</p>



<p>Many market participants today would have you believe that there is a choice between being an “AI bull,” who believes that infrastructure building is justified by AI’s enormous potential or an “AI bear,” who believes that overbuilding sets future expectations too high. The thought experiment above illustrates that this is a false dichotomy. The CapEx debate is a debate about speed, not about magnitude.</p>



<p>In fact, the more you believe in AI, the more you might be concerned that AI model progress will outpace physical infrastructure, leaving the latter outdated. For example, once everyone has 100k clusters, big tech companies will need to figure out what to do with their 50k and 25k clusters. We’ve heard a few industry experts make comments along the lines of: No one will ever train a frontier model on the same data center twice—by the time the model has been trained, the GPUs will have become outdated, and frontier cluster sizes will have grown. There is also the issue of how much power you need for a given real estate footprint and how dense to pack your GPU racks, decisions that are dependent on GPU power efficiency—a moving target.</p>



<p>The key to understanding the pace of today’s infrastructure buildout is to recognize that while AI optimism is certainly a driver of AI CapEx, it is not the only one. The cloud players exist in a ruthless oligopoly with intense competition. This is no small prize to defend—the cloud business today is a $250B market, roughly the same size as the entire SaaS sector, combined. The cloud giants see AI as both a threat and an opportunity and do not have the luxury to wait and see how the technology evolves. They must act now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The arms race between Microsoft, Amazon and Google is thus game theoretic. Every time Microsoft escalates, Amazon is motivated to escalate to keep up. And vice versa. We are now in a cycle of competitive escalation between three of the biggest companies in the history of the world, collectively worth more than $7T. At each cycle of the escalation, there is an easy justification—we have plenty of money to afford this. With more commitment comes more confidence, and this loop becomes self-reinforcing. Supply constraints turbocharge this dynamic: If you don’t acquire land, power and labor now, someone else will.</p>







<p>For smaller players, the urgency is even higher. If Microsoft and Amazon buy up all the land and power, buy up all the diesel generators and buy up all the liquid cooling systems, then how will you compete? When you look one notch below the scale of Amazon, Google and Microsoft, there is a sense of desperation. If you do not move now, you will never get another chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This helps explain another potential motive for the aggressive behavior we’re seeing from the cloud providers: Defense. There is a real-sense in which only companies that have the balance sheets to withstand big write-offs can now afford to play in the AI infrastructure race. From this perspective, overbuilding may be perfectly rational.</p>



<p>Whether for reasons of optimism or reasons of competition, today’s rapid construction of new AI data centers should have a big positive effect on startups going forward. Much of the risk in AI today is being borne by infrastructure providers. This is effectively a subsidy for the startups who are building on top of them. Competition between Microsoft, Amazon and Google should assure lower API pricing in the future. It’s also good for the AI ecosystem—these CapEx investments will enable us to test scaling laws and learn more about AI’s future potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like governments did in the past, big tech companies are making high upfront infrastructure investments that will spur innovation. Whether or not these investments end up being profitable before they depreciate, they are on the critical path to AI’s long-term impact.</p>

<p></p><p>Dear community members.</p>



<p>Our transformative upgrade to Horizen 2.0 is full steam ahead since the community voted in favor of the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42406-proposed-technical-roadmap-for-the-migration-of-zen-and-eon/648">ZenIP 42406, which proposes a roadmap for the upgrade of $ZEN and EON</a>! </p>



 Security Best Practices  



<p>Please follow the steps below to ensure a smooth and safe experience during the 2.0 upgrade and keep your ZEN safe from scammers:</p>



 
 Do NOT send funds to anyone claiming to be from Horizen. 
 
 We would never ask the community to send us ZEN or any other type of funds. 
 
 



 Do NOT share your private keys with anyone. 
 
 We would never ask for private keys. If your private keys are not safe and secure, neither are your crypto assets. 
 
 



 Do NOT install anything on your device that is not from the official sources.  



 Do NOT give anybody remote access to your device. 
 
 We’d never ask you to install any software for remote access.   
 
 



 Do NOT trust any DMs that give instructions for any type of Horizen airdrop. 
 
 Official team members would never DM you. We only communicate the procedure on our official public channels.

<p>The <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fced56fc-3eab-11ef-8a1f-f21b2a043e20/view">Zcash Dev Fund poll</a> has now closed and the results are in!</p>



<p>The purpose of this poll was to determine whether there is clear consensus amongst the Zcash community that a new Dev Fund should be established when the current Dev Fund expires in November, and, if so, which Dev Fund proposal should be adopted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Members of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) were asked to indicate their approval for each of the six proposals for a new Dev Fund, and for allowing the current Dev Fund to end without establishing a new Dev Fund. </p>



<p>Here are the results: </p>







<p>Under the Majority Choice Approval (MCA-M or Modified Bucklin) voting method, the winning proposal is the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-3-lockbox-for-decentralized-grants-allocation-20-option">Lockbox for Decentralized Grants Allocation (20% option)</a>, which directs 20% of the block rewards to a lockbox, for future disbursement in a manner that is consistent with results of community polling.</p>



<p>Note that cumulative percentages may not total to 100% due to abstentions.</p>



<p>The poll also asked voters to express their approval of direct and non-direct funding models, with an additional option of “I wish to reserve judgment until more information about a Non-Direct Funding Model is available”. </p>



<p>Here are the results: </p>







<p>Thank you to everyone who voted! </p>

NFTs vs VCs comparison tableVCs (Verifiable Credentials)<p>TL,DR: NFTs and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are both important for web3, but they serve different purposes. NFTs are like public certificates of ownership for digital assets, while VCs are secure digital documents that you own and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Forget data silos, the constant login battles with the data-hungry giants of today, the data leaks and hacks. Web3 promises a more user-centric future rooted in individual sovereignty and ownership. How? All thanks to technology. Amongst all the tech underpinning the ongoing shift to web3 — blockchain, smart contracts, dApps, and more — two tools are tasked with establishing ownership and authenticity: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). And while they both play a crucial role in this web3 revolution, they serve distinct purposes. This article will define what they are, why they matter, and how what use cases they are best&nbsp;for.</p> What are&nbsp;NFTs? <p>NFTs, which stands for Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital certificates stored on a blockchain that act like ownership deeds for digital assets, proving ownership of things like artwork, music, in-game items, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Here’s what’s worth remembering about&nbsp;NFTs:</p>  Digital Asset: An NFT can represent various digital things like artwork, music, videos, in-game items, and&nbsp;more.  Unique: Each NFT is one-of-a-kind and cannot be replicated.  Ownership Verification: The blockchain record ensures everyone can verify who owns a particular NFT.  Public: NFTs are public and transparent, allowing anyone to view the ownership history and details of a digital asset on the blockchain  Use Cases: NFTs are used for collecting digital art, establishing the ownership of virtual assets (for example in games), representing real-world assets, and&nbsp;more.   What are&nbsp;VCs? <p>VCs, short for Verifiable Credentials, are cryptographic attestations of data attributes. They function as secure and verifiable proofs of a variety of information. They can be issued by trusted entities across industries, such as governments, educational institutions, service providers, and others. VCs are crucial for <a href="https://medium.com/@Empeiria-web3/deep-dives-self-sovereign-identity-0d8b7ba6d2d2">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> — a transformative approach to digital identity that empowers individuals to take control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Here’s what’s worth remembering about&nbsp;VCs:</p>  Self-Sovereign Identity: VCs are a secure and verifiable way to own and showcase your digital identity.  Verifiable: Blockchain ensures the VCs’ authenticity can be easily verified.  Interoperable: VCs are designed to be interoperable across different platforms, ensuring they can be seamlessly used and verified without compatibility issues.  Privacy-Focused: VCs allow you to disclose specific, selected details without revealing all your information.  Use Cases: VCs can streamline KYC, KYB, AML, age verification, secure sharing of health information, validation of academic credentials, access rights management, inspection rights and traceability, insurance claims, digital product passports, and&nbsp;more   How are NFTs and VCs different? <p>Use Cases</p><p>NFTs represent unique digital or physical assets, publicly verifying ownership and enabling transactions of digital art, collectibles, and more. Example use cases&nbsp;include:</p>  Art and Collectibles: Artists and creators can sell digital art and collectibles as NFTs, providing proof of ownership and authenticity to&nbsp;buyers.  Gaming: NFTs are used in gaming to represent unique in-game assets, such as characters, skins, and items, which players can own, trade, and&nbsp;sell.  Music and Entertainment: Musicians and content creators can release their works as NFTs, offering exclusive content and experiences to&nbsp;fans.  <p>VCs allow individuals to control and selectively share verified personal information, such as educational degrees and professional licenses. Example use cases&nbsp;include:</p>  KYC/KYB, AML age verification  Education: VCs can be used to verify educational qualifications and certifications, reducing fraud and making it easier for employers to authenticate credentials.  Healthcare: Patients can use VCs to share verified health records with healthcare providers, ensuring accurate and secure data exchange.  Employment: Employers can issue VCs for employment history, skills, and achievements, making it easier for individuals to prove their professional background.  Financial Services: VCs enable efficient KYC (Know Your Customer) processes. They can be used to verify customer information, streamline customer onboarding, enhance security, and ensure compliance with regulations.  Digital Product Passport: VCs revolutionize retail with the Digital Product Passport, allowing consumers to scan product QR codes for instant access to specifications, purchase history, and authenticity tracking. Brands leverage this to gain insights, optimize operations, and enhance customer loyalty through personalized engagement.  Credit Scores: VCs can help securely share credit scores with financial institutions, landlords, or entities in need of credit assessments. No intermediaries are&nbsp;needed.  Insurance: VCs can simplify insurance processes by allowing individuals to share verified identity, driving history, or claims history with providers. This improves risk assessment and speeds up policy issuance.  Inspections: VCs can be used to verify compliance and inspection records for various industries, such as construction, food safety, and manufacturing. This ensures that standards are met and simplifies the verification process.  <p>Privacy</p><p>NFTs are publicly visible on the blockchain, and showcase ownership of digital assets for everyone to see. This transparency is crucial for things like collectible art, where ownership history is part of the value. However, for personal data, this public visibility might not be&nbsp;ideal.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs) take a different approach. Imagine a noncustodial digital wallet containing your verified credentials. In this wallet, your data is encrypted and entirely private, safeguarded against unauthorized access. Unlike NFTs, VCs do not expose sensitive information on the blockchain; instead, blockchain technology is used solely for storing <a href="https://medium.com/@Empeiria-web3/deep-dives-decentralized-identifiers-dids-b1b723c954f1">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>, which facilitate data verification. You can selectively share specific details with relevant parties, ensuring only the necessary information is disclosed. This granular control over your data is particularly valuable in an era of privacy concerns, data breaches, etc.</p><p>Empe Verifiable Data Wallet is noncustodial and provides unmatched data security and privacy, safeguarding users’ information against unauthorized access.</p><p>Transferability</p><p>NFTs are great for proving and transferring ownership of digital assets. They function like public certificates on the blockchain, showcasing who owns what. This facilitates the trading of virtual assets since the ownership of an NFT can be transferred from one person to&nbsp;another.</p><p>In contrast, VCs prioritize ownership and control over data. VCs act as secure digital documents of verified achievements, qualifications, etc. These documents are connected to the user’s unique decentralized identifier (DID) and cannot be sold, exchanged, or transferred.</p><p>Blockchain usage</p><p>Both NFTs and VCs rely on blockchain to perform their tasks. However, they use it in distinct ways. NFTs are stored on the blockchain, publicly revealing digital assets’ ownership history and authenticity.</p><p>VCs, on the other hand, are stored securely and privately off-chain, in the user’s Verifiable Data Wallet. Blockchain is used solely for storing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) which allow for data to be verified without compromising data security or&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness</p><p>NFTs tend to be more expensive overall. Minting and trading them often involve transaction fees on the underlying blockchain, which can fluctuate significantly based on network congestion. Additionally, creating and selling NFTs might incur platform-specific charges depending on the chosen marketplace.</p><p>VCs, on the other hand, are more cost-effective as they mostly rely on off-chain cryptography with zero marginal cost for issuance and verification and generate low and predictable transaction fees for on-chain operations like DID creation, revocations, and timestamping.</p><p>Technology and Standards</p><p>NFTs rely on blockchain standards such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155 (on Ethereum), facilitating their creation and trade on diverse NFT marketplaces.</p><p>VCs, on the other hand, typically leverage standards like the Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDataModel) from W3C, OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credentials (OIDC-VC), JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), and other industry-specific frameworks. These standards ensure that VCs are securely managed and interoperable across various platforms, empowering individuals with control over their data securely and privately.</p> Conclusion <p>NFTs and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) function differently, but are not rivals — they’re powerful allies in web3. Both technologies significantly contribute to a future of enhanced data privacy, security, and interoperability, and the right technology choice always depends on the underlying use case. Understanding their strengths and differences allows people and organizations to leverage the full potential of decentralized data ecosystems.</p><p>Follow Empeiria on <a href="https://twitter.com/empe_io">Twitter/X</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/empe-web3/">LinkedIn</a> for the latest news &amp; updates.

  Fireworks: Production Deployments for the Compound AI Future  <p>The advent of intelligence as an API ushered in an explosion in AI—and Fireworks is emerging as a leader in the market.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/romie-boyd/">Romie Boyd</a>	 



Published July 11, 2024
  



Team Fireworks



 
<p>It is a similar arc at every company: developers begin their AI journey using a “Cadillac”—a very large, closed-source model to bootstrap a demo. But as they prototype to product-market fit and start to move their AI prototypes into production, they quickly start stumbling over a common set of hurdles:</p>



 
 Latency: Customers expect applications close to real time, and milliseconds can degrade their experience—and their conversion.&nbsp; 



 Cost: At production volume and scale, closed-source model bills rack up quickly. 



 Quality: For some tests, a larger model may underperform relative to a smaller, finely tuned model with specific examples.&nbsp; 



 Model and data ownership: Many enterprises are wary of sharing their secret sauce with an external provider, and prefer to host inference within their own virtual private cloud. 



 External dependencies: Companies want multiple models from a reliable cloud service provider, with no single source of failure for critical applications.&nbsp; 
 



<p>In short, once companies hone in on a specific AI use case, the “Cadillac” often becomes overkill: too heavy, too slow and too expensive to best serve production workloads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, teams are also increasingly shifting to compound AI systems, which combine multiple model calls, retrievers or external tools, offer better performance, reliability and control, versus relying on a single model.</p>



 A growing need 



<p>Thus enterprises are balancing a constellation of needs as they enter production: they crave the ease of a closed-source model provider; the latency, cost, quality and security that open-source models offer; and the versatility of compound systems. We at Sequoia have noticed a sharp inflection point over the last 6-9 months as more open-source alternatives have become viable.</p>



<p>It is a massive opportunity. The AI compute market alone is measured in tens of billions of dollars annually, and we expect a shift from majority training to majority production over the next several years. We also believe that the tailwinds behind the AI inference market are as durable as they are large. Silicon Valley has a long history of infrastructure providers making ever-more-ambitious applications possible by pushing the price-performance curve. By meeting the pragmatic needs of enterprises and pushing the boundaries of that curve, <a href="https://fireworks.ai/">Fireworks</a> has a chance to become a defining infrastructure provider for the age of AI.</p>



 An emerging leader 



<p>This market is not only large, but brutally competitive, with every startup claiming to have the best latency, throughput and cost. But as we talked with AI companies in our portfolio, a crowded market started to become crystal clear: Fireworks was the emerging market leader, with the best technology and the best team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-founders Benny Chen, Chenyu Zhao, Dmytro Dzhulgakov, Dmytro Ivchenko, James Reed, Lin Qiao and Pawel Garbacki bring together deep expertise from Google and Meta, including leadership of Meta’s PyTorch, which became the dominant framework for training neural nets including all modern large language models and diffusion models. Now, the Fireworks team is using those learnings to build a proprietary inference stack. And just as PyTorch was known for, among other things, its performance, which required multiple layers of optimization between hardware and framework, Fireworks’ custom CUDA kernel <a href="https://blog.fireworks.ai/fireattention-serving-open-source-models-4x-faster-than-vllm-by-quantizing-with-no-tradeoffs-a29a85ad28d0">FireAttention</a> has exceptional performance compared to other providers’ open source inference and serving frameworks. In particular, FireAttention v2 is the leading low-latency inference engine for real-time applications, with speed <a href="https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v2-long-context-inference">improvements</a> up to 8x and beyond.</p>



<p>What’s more, their latest offering is purpose-built to address the growing shift toward compound AI systems. FireFunction V2, an open-weight function-calling model, can orchestrate across multiple models, as well as their external data and knowledge sources and other APIs. It also seamlessly integrates with a range of tools and frameworks, allowing developers to quickly and easily build scalable multi-inference workflows.</p>



<p>Fireworks is also approaching this market holistically; rather than simply providing a suite of tools (e.g., inference and fine-tuning), they are building a full solution that delivers the optimal mixture of models and functions based on customers’ specific requirements. And by choosing to partner, rather than compete, with cloud providers and enabling deployment into existing virtual private clouds, they have created a win-win for customers. Cloud vendors can focus on hardware purchasing, data center capex and service availability, while Fireworks can focus on delivering the most performant inference engine and the best developer experience for Generative AI. They’ve made running popular open-source models inside your cloud provider not only faster and cheaper, but more ergonomic, as well.</p>



 Grand ambitions 



<p>Already, the customers Fireworks has signed reflect its stellar reputation. Following competitive bake-offs, enterprises (Uber, DoorDash, Upwork, Quora) and AI-native startups (Cursor, Superhuman, Sourcegraph Cody, Cresta) alike have chosen to build their stack around Fireworks. The platform is making it easier for these to achieve large model performance from small model cost and latency—and to build agentic workflows that utilize specific underlying models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Fireworks’ vision is not simply to provide the fastest inference engine. In addition to FireFunction V2, recent product announcements such as FireOptimus, an LLM inference optimizer that learns your traffic to provide better latency (2x) and quality (&gt;= GPT-4), offer a glimpse of the innovations ahead.</p>



<p>In the months and years to come, the grand ambition is to build the single best platform enterprises can rely on as they deploy AI into production. We are excited to double-down on our partnership with Lin and the rest of the team as we lead Fireworks’ Series B, and to continue supporting the growth of both the platform and <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/fireworks.ai">the team</a>. As more companies make the choice that latency, cost, quality, ownership and developer experience matter for production AI—and as compound systems expand access to the sophisticated solutions once available to only a select few—the underlying technology this team is building will keep getting better, enabling an ever-expanding set of delightful customer experiences.</p>

<p>In 2020, the Zcash community decided to <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014">establish a Dev Fund</a>, consisting of 20% of block rewards, allocated between the Electric Coin Company, the Zcash Foundation, and a major grants program, now known as Zcash Community Grants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the Dev Fund was established, the Zcash ecosystem has evolved and changed significantly, becoming more decentralized as new teams have joined the ecosystem. However, that Dev Fund will end later this year, and the question we now face is how best to support this continued evolution, growth and progress towards greater decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, the community began discussing whether there should be a new Dev Fund, and, if so, what it should look like. After months of discussion, debate, community calls, Twitter spaces, and exploratory polls, we now have a slate of six proposals for the community to consider: </p>

<p></p>



<p>If the community does not reach clear consensus in favour of adopting a particular proposal, the Dev Fund will expire in November as planned.</p>



<p></p>



 A Note on Impartiality 



<p>One of proposals was drafted by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), based on the results of exploratory polling. However, ZF is not endorsing or advocating for any specific Dev Fund proposal. This is a decision for the community to make, and our primary objective is to help the community reach consensus, even if the end result is no funding for ZF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at ZF believe that the work we have carried out over the past few years has been of benefit to Zcash and the Zcash community, and we hope that the Zcash community agrees, and is willing to continue funding that work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, for the avoidance of any doubt, if the Zcash community decides that the Dev Fund should end and not be replaced (or that it should be replaced but that ZF should not receive any funding), ZF will support that decision, and do what is necessary to enact it (including implementing the new consensus rules in Zebra).&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Polling ZCAP&nbsp; 



<p>Today, we opened a Helios poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), which will close at 09:00 UTC on 15th July 2024.</p>



<p>The purpose of this poll is to determine whether there is clear consensus amongst the Zcash community that a new Dev Fund should be established when the current Dev Fund expires in November, and, if so, which Dev Fund proposal should be adopted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first question asks respondents to indicate their approval for allowing the current Dev Fund to end without establishing a new Dev Fund, and sending 100% of the block rewards to miners.</p>



<p>The next six questions ask respondents to indicate their approval for each of the six proposals for a new Dev Fund. A summary of the various Dev Fund proposals can be found <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/important-deadline-for-zips-likely-dev-fund-related-that-want-to-be-activated-next-halvening/48004/17">here</a>, and the poll includes links to the relevant ZIPs, which we strongly encourage you to review in detail.</p>



<p>The poll asks respondents to indicate their approval for each proposal on a five-point scale:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Strongly Approve 



 Approve 



 Neutral 



 Disapprove 



 Strongly Disapprove 
 



<p></p>



<p>The outcome of the poll will be determined using a Majority Choice Approval (MCA-M or Modified Bucklin) voting method, which works as follows:&nbsp; Respondents rate each proposal on the 5-point scale. First, only the “Strongly Approve” ratings are counted. If one or more proposals is rated “Strongly Approve” by more than 50% of respondents, the proposal with the highest number is selected for implementation in NU6. If not, the number of “Approve” ratings is added to the “Strongly Approve” counts. If a proposal now is approved of by more than 50% of respondents, it is regarded as the preferred proposal. If there is still no clear consensus, “Neutral” ratings are added, and so on. The proposal with the highest combined total in each step is regarded as the preferred proposal if it reaches more than 50%.</p>



<p>In the event that two or more proposals garner majority support, but there is no clear community consensus, there will be a runoff poll.</p>



<p></p>



 Future Evolution of Development Funding Models 



<p>The final two poll questions solicit respondents’ input regarding the future evolution of the Dev Fund, specifically regarding direct versus non-direct funding models. Electric Coin Company CEO Josh Swihart has proposed that the current Direct Funding Model (which allocates block reward directly to specific entities or organizations by embedding their wallet addresses into the protocol) be replaced by a Non-Direct Funding Model, which instead allocates a portion of the block rewards to a multi-sig wallet. Those who seek funding to contribute to Zcash would then be required to submit proposals and compete for funding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the design, governance and implementation details have not yet been fleshed out, several community polls have indicated strong community support for a Non-Direct Funding Model, and several of the current Dev Fund proposals direct a slice of the Dev Fund to a “lockbox”, in anticipation that a Non-Direct Funding Model may be established in the future. Therefore, we want to ensure that ZCAP members have the opportunity to express their views on this topic.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>The Helios poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 15th July 2024.&nbsp;</p>

  Partnering with Skild: The Future of Embodied Intelligence  <p>Most people think robotics is a hardware problem—but Deepak and Abhinav know it’s a software problem.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/">Stephanie Zhan</a>	 



Published July 9, 2024
  



Deepak, Stephanie and Abhinav at Sequoia.



 
<p>Robots performing extreme parkour. Robots manipulating objects, including doors and drawers, with their hands. Robots scaling stairs as high as themselves—forwards, backwards, indoors and outdoors. Robots moving with the fluidity of nature. These advancements have broken the internet over the last few years, and nearly all of them can be traced back to two elite researchers: Deepak Pathak and Abhinav Gupta.&nbsp;</p>



 Different Perspectives 



<p>Unlike most in the world of robotics, Deepak and Abhinav come from computer vision and deep learning backgrounds. While traditional robotics focused on gathering specific data to train robots for specific tasks in specific environments, Deepak and Abhinav leveraged large-scale data to build a foundation model using their adaptive architecture, based on transformers. What they got by doing this was totally unique: a way to unlock intelligence in the embodied, physical world, and create a model for robotics that is generalized, robust, and leads to emergent behavior.&nbsp;</p>



 Outlier Founders 



<p>Deepak comes from a small town in India. While most promising students moved to bigger cities to prepare for national exams, he opted not to leave—and still got into the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. His accomplishment made local headlines. Deepak learned how to program by manually writing code on paper at home, which he vigorously double-checked before using his limited minutes at the local cafe to run programs he built. He excelled at IIT, winning a gold medal in computer science (and later, was the youngest winner of the school’s Young Alumnus Award). He went on to pursue a Ph.D. in AI at Berkeley while joining Facebook AI Research (FAIR), co-founded a startup that was later acqui-hired, and then became an assistant professor at the Robotics Institute at CMU, where he has since published cutting-edge research. It goes without saying: Deepak is a force of nature.</p>



<p>Abhinav, too, is a legend in the field: a tenured professor at the Robotics Institute at CMU, and a former founding member and research leader at FAIR Robotics. He and Deepak discussed starting a company for a decade. In early 2023, they saw the acceleration of technical advancements in their field—so many of which they had contributed to—and knew the time was now to scale their work to the next level.</p>



 The Opportunity 



<p>What exactly was the monumental shift Deepak and Abhinav saw coming? In the years they’d spent pursuing the goal of building general intelligence for robots, the key challenge had been how to build a large-scale model to train a robot when no data at that scale exists. Unlike for large language models, there was no internet of data readily available. So they explored different strategies to learn from what was available: online videos, tele-operation, real world data, simulations and more.&nbsp; In 2015, they reached their first unlock, scaling robotics data by 1,000x, and in the next few years, they were among the first to experiment with human teleoperation and low-cost robotic teleoperation platforms. In 2017, they proposed the famous curiosity-driven learning algorithm for building agents that can continuously explore and learn on their own. In 2021 and 2022, they broke through again with a promising strategy that used large-scale adaptive SIM2REAL, or virtual-to-real-world training, winning the Best Robotic System Award at the Conference on Robotic Learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These were the building blocks that led to the vision for <a href="https://www.skild.ai/">Skild</a>: a general-purpose model capable of tackling any task, in any environment, without specific training. If Deepak and Abhinav could accomplish that, they would achieve a breakthrough on the scale of GPT-3—with results that could apply to nearly every field.&nbsp;</p>



 Robotics’ GPT-3 Moment 



<p>Today, Skild has the potential to build in the real world what OpenAI has built in the digital world. In fact, Deepak and Abhinav’s approach challenges our current notion of AGI—that it can be built by learning from digital knowledge alone. In their vision of AGI, we learn by doing. We build an understanding of how things work by attempting novel tasks in novel environments, and combining the near-instant feedback of what happens with everything we already know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine that world: where a foundation model for AI robotics exists that is capable of performing any task, in any environment, on any robot hardware. It would mean a massive expansion of the types of robots we could then build, and at orders of magnitude lower cost to what we see today.&nbsp;</p>



 Potential Scale 



<p>I’ve now been at Sequoia for nine years, and once in a blue moon, I’m lucky enough to hear the vision of a founder where the ambition and potential scale of impact stops me in my tracks. I first met Deepak and Abhinav on a Thursday afternoon, as they were raising their initial seed round, and we were partners by Tuesday. I remember the awe, wonder, and almost daunting curiosity I felt as I imagined how the world would change if they succeeded. And as we’ve partnered together over the past nine months, those feelings have only grown. This <a href="https://www.skild.ai/">team</a> is onto something that could change the world we live in forever.</p>



<p>I’m excited to finally announce our partnership together, join the board, and share the team’s latest fundraising milestone: a $300M round valuing the company at $1.5B.&nbsp;</p>

  AI is Now Shovel Ready  <p>Five predictions for the upcoming data center construction boom, and its implications for energy and the economy.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 



Published July 8, 2024
  



 
<p>We have written here extensively about the revenue side of the AI infrastructure buildout. My last piece, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">AI’s $600B question</a>, focused on the implied revenue expectations for AI, and questioned the time horizon in which we’ll be able to meet those lofty goals.</p>



<p>This piece turns to the cost side of the equation. In particular, we will focus on the data center buildout, the rise of the “AI factory,” and its implications for energy, construction and the industrial supply chain. We believe that 2025 will be the “Year of the Data Center” and that we are on the cusp of transitioning from a hype cycle into an industrial-driven build cycle.</p>



<p>A few predictions, and then let’s get into the details:</p>



 
 AI will catalyze an energy transformation. New solar construction, battery innovation, a resurgence in nuclear energy—these will be long-term effects of the AI wave 



 Some hyperscalers will find that they are not nimble enough to address rapidly changing data center requirements—new industrial AI players will emerge to fill this gap 



 Starting in the next 6 months, there will be a lot of headlines about delays in data center builds due to issues with liquid cooling, cluster size and power access 



 The industrial capacity needed to build new AI data centers will serve as an economic stimulus and create jobs in the real economy: Steel, energy, trucking and construction 



 When new data center capacity comes online, the cost of training and inference delivered by AWS, Azure and GCP will go down, to the benefit of startups 
 



<p>In contrast to the big technical unknowns about the future of AI, there is a glimmer of clarity here: we can begin to plan for a 2-3 year period of industrial scaling. We are ready to move beyond abstract commitments (see below) to shovels hitting the ground.</p>



<p>Here is a summary of the new data center projects that have been announced in the last year— which we believe construction is now set to accelerate:</p>



 
 Amazon: In the first half of 2024, AWS announced $50B in new data center projects, including <a href="https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/data-center/amazon-will-spend-100b-on-ai-data-center-development-124938">216 new buildings</a>. Overall, Amazon has committed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/amazon-bets-150-billion-on-data-centers-required-for-ai-boom">$100-150B</a> over the next 15 years. Recent commitments include: An $11B campus in <a href="https://iedc.in.gov/events/news/details/2024/04/25/gov.-holcomb-announces-amazon-web-services-plans-to-invest-11b-to-create-a-new-data-center-campus-in-northern-indiana">Indiana</a>, $10B across two campuses in <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-10-billion-investment-mississippi">Mississippi</a>, $5.3B in new data centers across <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/1311730/aws-to-invest-5-3-to-build-data-centers-in-saudi-arabia-to-bolster-tech-in-the-region.html">Saudi Arabia,</a> a new nuclear-powered data center near <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-acquires-talens-nuclear-data-center-campus-in-pennsylvania/">Salem, Pennsylvania</a>, a new planned data center near <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/amazon-plans-data-center-in-round-rock-texas/">Round Rock, Texas</a> and a $15B commitment in <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2024/01/19/aws-will-invest-15b-japan-expand-local-data-center-footprint/">Japan</a>. Germany, Taiwan and Singapore are also being considered for new projects.&nbsp; 



 Microsoft: Microsoft now has 5GW of energy capacity and is reportedly <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-to-double-new-data-center-capacity-this-year-report/">doubling</a> new data center construction in 2024. Recent announcements include: $3.3B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2024/05/08/microsoft-announces-3-3-billion-investment-in-wisconsin-to-spur-artificial-intelligence-innovation-and-economic-growth/">Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin</a>, $1B in <a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/microsoft-cloud-azure-data-center-investments-generative-ai/717897/">Northwest Indiana</a>, $1B in <a href="https://developromefloyd.com/2023/10/updated-microsoft-to-invest-1-billion-in-data-center-in-floyd-county/">Floyd County, Georgia</a>, $4.3B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2024/05/13/microsoft-announces-the-largest-investment-to-date-in-france-to-accelerate-the-adoption-of-ai-skilling-and-innovation/">France</a>, $3.5B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/de-de/fit-fuer-das-ki-zeitalter-microsoft-investiert-32-milliarden-euro-um-ki-infrastruktur-und-cloud-kapazitaeten-in-deutschland-mehr-als-zu-verdoppeln-sowie-fachkraefte-zu-qualifizieren/">Germany</a>, $3.2B in the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/30/uk-ai-skilling-security-datacenters-investment/">UK</a>, $3.2B in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/microsoft-makes-3-2-billion-ai-bet-on-swedish-data-centers?sref=Hhue1scO">Sweden</a>, $2.1B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/es-es/2024/02/20/microsoft-quadruples-its-investment-in-ai-and-cloud-infrastructure-in-spain-to-promote-the-deployment-of-responsible-and-secure-artificial-intelligence-in-companies-and-public-administration/">Spain</a>, $2.2B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2024/05/02/microsoft-announces-us2-2-billion-investment-to-fuel-malaysias-cloud-and-ai-transformation/">Malaysia</a>, $1.7B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2024/04/30/microsoft-announces-us1-7-billion-investment-to-advance-indonesias-cloud-and-ai-ambitions/">Indonesia</a>, $1B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2024/05/22/microsoft-and-g42-announce-1-billion-comprehensive-digital-ecosystem-initiative-for-kenya/">Kenya</a> and a new data center in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/es-xl/microsoft-launches-its-first-hyper-scale-cloud-datacenter-region-in-mexico/">Mexico</a>. There have been reports of a $100B <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-openai-planning-100-billion-data-center-project-information-reports-2024-03-29/">Stargate</a> data center, although this is not confirmed. 



 Google: Google is the smallest of the three cloud providers by a wide margin. The GCP pitch has long been that it’s better for AI companies. Now, that is being put to the test. Google is building a new $2B data center in <a href="https://www.iedc.in.gov/events/news/details/2024/04/26/gov.-holcomb-announces-google-is-building-a-2b-data-center-in-northeast-indiana">Indiana</a>, a $1B data center in <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-to-build-1bn-data-center-in-kansas-city-missouri/">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, a $1.1B data center in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-invests-1-billion-euros-finnish-data-centre-drive-ai-growth-2024-05-20/">Finland</a> and a $576M data center in <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/local-government/google-named-as-company-behind-proposed-576-million-cedar-rapids-data-center/">Cedar Rapids, Iowa.</a> Google has the added challenge of scaling its own TPU clusters at some sites.&nbsp; 



 Meta: Meta does not operate a cloud business, but has nonetheless been scaling its data center capacity to support Llama and other internal AI initiatives. Meta recently announced that it has accumulated <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/">350k H100 GPUs</a>, as part of a total fleet of 600k H100 equivalents. The company also announced two 24k GPU clusters dedicated for <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/">Llama 3 training</a>. Meta has four new data centers in the works, including in <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-resumes-construction-of-texas-and-idaho-data-centers-with-new-ai-design/">Kuna, Idaho</a>, <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-resumes-construction-of-texas-and-idaho-data-centers-with-new-ai-design/">Temple, Texas</a>, <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-named-as-company-behind-328-acre-data-center-in-davenport-iowa/">Davenport, Iowa</a> and <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-officially-announces-data-center-in-cheyenne-wyoming/">Cheyenne, Wyoming</a>.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The sheer industrial scale of what’s happening is tremendous. These announcements represent an industrial scale-up that happens once or twice in each generation.</p>



<p>It’s important to understand how unique the upcoming challenges will be, and how pressing. There is a <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/grid-interconnection-queue-berkeley-lab-lbnl/712926/">long backlog</a> of energy projects that need to be connected to the grid. Even with faster interconnection, we will need more <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/why-the-ai-industrys-thirst-for-new-data-centers-cant-be-satisfied-93c7eff5">power</a> to support all these new data centers. Generation capacity will need to be added, largely in the form of solar and wind power, and we will need to be creative in leveraging existing energy resources. These power constraints are especially profound in “prime” data center markets like Virginia, Nevada and California. As a result, a lot of the newer developments are happening in “secondary” markets like Wyoming, Indiana, Iowa and Illinois. The need for more power and a better functioning grid was clear before AI. Now, it is becoming urgent.</p>



<p>Other technology issues abound: Next-gen Nvidia chips will require <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nvidias-ceo-confirms-next-dgx-will-be-liquid-cooled/">liquid cooling</a>, and there is now a shortage in the liquid cooling supply chain. There is a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/why-the-ai-industrys-thirst-for-new-data-centers-cant-be-satisfied-93c7eff5">two-year wait</a> for diesel generators. Cluster sizes are reaching unprecedented territory: Elon Musk has announced a <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/elon-musk-claims-300000-b200-gpu-supercomputer-for-xai-by-next-summer-the-usual-caveats-apply/">300k GPU cluster</a>. Models are getting so big, they may eventually need to be trained on distributed clusters across multiple data centers. <a href="https://www.coresite.com/blog/lithium-ion-in-the-data-center">Lithium-ion batteries</a> have become a staple of new data center buildouts; new approaches are being contemplated to further lower cost and increase capacity.</p>



<p>Hyperscalers are known for their operational rigor in building data centers, but this new wave of construction will test even their best teams. Expect to see some distribution in outcomes across the hyperscalers—there will be winners and losers here. New industrial AI players will have an opportunity to fill any operational gaps. Existing market participants like Equinix, Digital Realty and CyrusOne are experiencing a “demand shock”—either they will step up and benefit from this, or they will lose share to new entrants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expect to see a lot of headlines in 2025 about data center construction delays. Also expect to see some big, unexpected successes. When we exit the realm of bits and enter the realm of atoms, a new skillset takes hold and operational rigor becomes paramount. As we’ve seen with SpaceX and Tesla, the types of companies that thrive in these messy, fast-moving environments are not always the existing incumbents. Strong leadership and agility pay their biggest dividends during moments of complex change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AI industrial phase should have a real economic stimulus effect, especially in areas of the economy that badly need it. Beneficiaries will include component makers in the industrial supply chain, energy companies building new generation assets like solar and wind, nuclear reactor operators and many others. For example, we are visiting a battery factory this week in West Virginia, which is being built on the site of an old coal plant. In the near-term, more job gains are likely to accrue to construction and industrial labor than to the small group of researchers architecting models in Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>How is all of this growth being financed? For the most part, Big Tech companies are deploying capital off their balance sheets. With the Magnificent 7 now representing approximately 30% of the S&amp;P 500, the scale and speed at which they can deploy capital is awesome. Financial firms are participating as well, generating additional leverage. Many private equity firms are happy to provide <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/news/press/coreweave-secures-7-5-billion-debt-financing-facility-led-by-blackstone-and-magnetar/">upfront capital</a> for construction and GPU purchases, in return for an IOU from Microsoft and a reasonable yield.</p>



<p>When all is said and done, we’re going to have a lot of AI factories. Whether there will be enough demand to fill them, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">we still don’t know yet</a>. At the very least, training and inference costs should continue their decline, a boon to startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are building in this space, we’d love to hear from you. Please reach out at <a href="mailto:dcahn@sequoiacap.com">dcahn@sequoiacap.com</a>. We’re especially interested to hear from founders building at the intersection of energy, industrials and AI.</p>

<p>We know that technology has changed art, and that artists have evolved with every new technology — it’s a tale as old as humanity, moving from cave paintings to computers. Underlying these movements are endless debates around inventing versus remixing; between commercialism and art; between mainstream canon and fringe art; whether we’re living in an artistic monoculture now (the answer may surprise you); and much much more.&nbsp;</p><p>So in this new episode featuring Berlin-based contemporary artist Simon Denny -- in conversation with a16z crypto editor in chief Sonal Chokshi -- we discuss all of the above debates. We also cover how artists experimented with the emergence of new technology platforms like the web browser, the iPhone, Instagram and social media; to how generative art found its “native” medium on blockchains, why NFTs; and other art movements.&nbsp;</p><p>Denny also thinks of entrepreneurial ideas -- from Peter Thiel's to Chris Dixon's Read Write Own -- as an "aesthetic"; and thinks of technology artifacts (like NSA sketches!) as art -- reflecting all of these in his works across various mediums and contexts. How has technology changed art, and more importantly, how have artists changed with technology? How does art change our place in the world, or span beyond space? It's about optimism, and seeing things anew... all this and more in this episode.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Find Denny on Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/dennnnnnnnny">https://x.com/dennnnnnnnny</a></p><p>Find Sonal on Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/smc90">https://x.com/smc90</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you think: <a href="https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z">https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.8.0">Zebra 1.8.0</a>. This release includes the following changes and improvements.</p>



<p>Given that most wallets have now implemented support for the fees outlined in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317">ZIP-317</a>, we have set a default unpaid actions limit of 0 in Zebra, dropping transactions with any unpaid actions from the mempool and excluding them when selecting transactions from the mempool during block template construction.</p>



<p>Other changes to keep feature parity with zcashd include a change to the end-of-support (EOS) time interval back to 16 weeks and an update to the RPC serialization of empty treestates to also match zcashd. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the <a href="https://zcash.github.io/developers/zcash-zcashd-deprecation-dag">work to deprecate zcashd</a>, we have been working with ECC to replace the built-in zcashd wallet with a Zebra backed alternative. In order to do this in a safe manner we are implementing a <a href="https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash/issues/1373">new architecture</a> that separates the functionality for scanning for shielded transactions from Zebra. As such, the zebrad binary no longer contains this and it also means that zebrad will no longer have the ability to store registered viewing keys for users.</p>



<p>With this release we have also enhanced support for custom Testnets and Regtest by allowing more parameters to be configured for custom testnets, as well as an NU5 activation height on Regtest. In order to support block creation, we have restored parts of the experimental internal-miner feature for use on Regtest and added support for constructing Canopy proposal blocks from block templates. Details on how to use these new custom testnets features are documented in the <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/custom-testnets.html">Zebra book</a>.</p>



<p>In order to improve the maintainability of future versions of Zebra, we are using a <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/releases/tag/v0.2.0">new zcash_script callback API</a> in zebra-script. This will allow Zebra’s ECC dependencies to be upgraded independently of zcash_script and zcashd in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, we are pleased to announce that we have once again included Windows in our <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/supported-platforms.html#tier-2">Tier 2 platform support</a>.&nbsp;You can see a full copy of all of the included changes in the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.8.0">v1.8.0 Release Notes</a> on GitHub.</p>

  The New Ideas Needed for AGI  <p>The strength of LLMs is also their weakness. A truly general intelligence may require a certainty in thinking and reasoning that cannot be found in language.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/pat-grady/">Pat Grady</a>	 



Published July 2, 2024
  



 
<p>“Scale is not all you need. New ideas are needed.” And not just new ideas, but new benchmarks. This was the succinct contrarian perspective of <a href="https://arcprize.org/">ARC Prize</a> and Zapier co-founder Mike Knoop when we talked to him on the most recent <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/training-data-mike-knoop/">Training Data podcast</a> episode. ARC Prize is based on a benchmark created by Knoop’s co-founder, <a href="https://fchollet.com/">François Chollet</a> back in 2019 that has stubbornly resisted solving.</p>



<p>The current AI moment is all about the unreasonable effectiveness of scaling the transformer architecture and LLMs, leading to the toppling of one “human-level” benchmark after another. What’s different about ARC-AGI? Why are current methods ineffective against it? What exactly are the new ideas needed?</p>



<p>To start with, as Chollet claims, the ARC-AGI benchmark is hard in a way many other AI benchmarks are not. It was designed to be resistant to memorization despite the amount of data and compute thrown at it. It is easy for humans, but hard for AIs. In fact, its solution would mean that the system was able to learn a novel task from a very small amount of data—precisely the opposite of what is now possible.</p>



 The puzzle at the heart of the problem 



<p>Founders in the AI application space can see where customers are deploying LLM-based solutions—and more critically where they are not. It is no surprise that customer service is the leading outbound use case. It is a labor-intensive undertaking that has previously been automated badly, with notoriously low NPS scores. And there’s already a human in the loop, but with LLMs that engagement is limited to only escalated cases.</p>



<p>There are also many internal use cases that are able to save workers significant time even if they fail some of the time. But the big bottleneck to more widespread adoption of AI products is the lack of trust stemming from the unconstrained nature of LLMs. Workflow automation software, like Knoop’s Zapier, is formally verifiable to do what it says on the tin. LLMs, by contrast, can perform off-label fabrications (unpredictably) unless constrained by the structure of a robust cognitive architecture.</p>



<p>Knoop is a big admirer of Rich Sutton’s prescient essay, <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">The Bitter Lesson</a> (as is everyone we’ve talked to on the podcast). He points out that although Sutton is even more correct about the effectiveness of scaling learning and search today than he was five years ago, the one aspect of AI that has not benefited yet from scaling is architecture search itself. Indeed, the solutions that have been most effective so far against the ARC-AGI benchmark all explore architecture space in an automated and dynamic way, rather than hand-crafting static architectures as most researchers continue to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chollet defines AGI as the efficiency of acquiring new skills. The ARC-AGI benchmark itself is a set of 400 matrix puzzles that unambiguously describe patterns that humans are able to match intuitively based on a core set of knowledge priors, like symmetry and rotation, that machines have had difficulty learning precisely and reliably. Chollet designed the tasks so that a human-level score across the test set would mean that the system could efficiently learn a novel task in this highly variable but internally consistent puzzle space.</p>
 







 
<p>What this suggests (and what <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/19/science/brain-language-thought.html">contemporary neuroscience is proving</a>) is that there are <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/linguistics/2024-fedorenko.pdf">non-linguistic aspects to thinking</a> and reasoning that need to be represented with something other than language. All the words in the world wouldn’t provide sufficient training data to actually learn these priors. Solving ARC would seem to require different tokens learned in a different way from the likes of GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet.</p>



 Transforming the transformers 



<p>Knoop also observes that the transformer architecture is formally capable of representing very deep deductive reasoning chains with 100% accuracy, but what’s missing is the proper learning algorithm. The great progress with LLMs in the past few years—along with the explosion of available compute—may turn out to be necessary but not sufficient for AGI.</p>



<p>Benchmarks have a long history in AI, going back to the Turing test, which took 50 years to beat and yet proved nothing about the true nature of intelligence. The ARC-AGI benchmark provides a clear contrast to a previous challenge of intelligence called the Winograd Schema. Named after a pair of ambiguous sentences formulated by Stanford professor <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/">Terry Winograd</a> (who, by the way, taught Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page), the schema was proposed in 2012 by Hector Levesque as an alternative to the Turing test. Although Winograd claimed in 1972 that such sentences would be impossible for computers to correctly disambiguate without “understanding” real world context, by 2019 a BERT language model was sufficiently powerful to claim 90% accuracy and the benchmark was considered solved.</p>



<p>ARC, by contrast, is constructed to model deterministic certainty. Each puzzle can be solved, and can be solved only one way. To learn such a set of puzzles is to learn a sense of invariance in the way that 1 + 1 = 2 or that a note is a pitch perfect C. This precision is exactly what’s missing in the intelligence generated by LLMs.</p>



<p>Knoop describes LLMs as “effectively doing very high dimensional memorization.” The power comes from running inference on the resulting models to generate high-dimensional output with the appearance of veracity. You can think of LLMs as looms on which you can weave digital media to order on demand.</p>



<p>The models that might win ARC would generate artifacts more solid and precise than these language looms—perhaps forges? What AGI requires is an armature flexible enough to learn new things but certain enough to be reliable about what it has learned.&nbsp;</p>



 Outsiders wanted 



<p>What we want AI to learn—what we hope AGI will be—is obviously way beyond the two dimensional puzzles contained in the ARC test set. It would be easy to dismiss this benchmark as another toy problem without real world application. But the style of learning that a winning system implements will most likely be something new, something that goes beyond the scaling of data and compute that all of the current frontier labs are pursuing. Such an AGI would also likely be safer and slower to roll out, less a singularity than a continuation of human stair step technological progress.</p>



<p>An important part of the ARC Prize is promoting the open sourcing of solutions to the ARC-AGI benchmark. By calling attention to the problem, and offering more than $1M for a better than 85% solution, Knoop and Chollet hope to reshape the research space back towards the kinds of open collaboration that led to our current breakthroughs.</p>



<p>The big labs are also clearly exploring new ideas, but perhaps more as a side quest than a main quest. From our experience with founders we know that the singular focus of, as Factory’s Matan Grinberg says, being “more obsessed than everyone else working in this space” is what leads to breakthroughs.</p>



<p>Knoop and Chollet’s quest to advance progress on an unmoved benchmark has echoes of Patrick Collison’s calls for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/">increasing the velocity of science</a> through developing more <a href="https://arcinstitute.org/">agile and interdisciplinary institutions</a>. When we asked Knoop who he thought would provide the winning solution to ARC Prize he said, “I think it’s going to come from an outsider, somebody who just thinks a little bit differently or has a different set of life experience, or they’re able to cross pollinate a couple of really important ideas across fields.”</p>

        <p>On June 26th, 2024, Bryan Nowlan, Marketing Project Manager from Horizen Labs, participated in a text AMA with the StealthEX community to discuss all things Horizen Ecosystem, Horizen Labs, zkVerify, and more!&nbsp;</p><p>In case you didn’t get a chance to catch it live, we put together this recap blog of the questions and answers.&nbsp;</p><p>Question: What technical support and resources are available for developers and users of the ZKVProtocol? How does HorizenLabs ensure the long-term sustainability and maintenance of the protocol?</p><p>Answer: zkVerify has in-depth technical documentation available for developers and builders that are looking to interact with the project. The documentation can be reached here: <a href="https://docs.zkverify.io/">https://docs.zkverify.io/</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ranging from an overview of zkVerify, to the zkVerify Hub with important links and recommendations, to a tutorials section, users can find all they need to get started with the project.&nbsp;</p><p>Our tech teams are also very responsive on the zkVerify Discord, if any users run into any issues or have any questions, members of the team can jump in there to provide support: <a href="http://discord.gg/zkverify">discord.gg/zkverify</a></p><p>Horizen Labs is the builder of zkVerify, so we are deeply invested in the long-term sustainability and maintenance of the protocol. We have extensive experience with zero-knowledge technologies and an entire team dedicated to ensuring zkVerify’s success!</p> <p>Question: How does the ZKVProtocol integrate with other Horizen technologies, such as the Horizen EON blockchain and the Horizen Wallet? What are the benefits of this integration?</p><p>Answer: The Horizen Community recently voted to pass ZenIP 42406, the technical proposal for the migration of EON and $ZEN, included in that proposal is an overview of how zkVerify will integrate with other Horizen technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Horizen 2.0 will be a fully-compatible EVM, which means that existing smart contracts on EON will be transitioned over, including $ZEN in current liquidity pools. Horizen 2.0 will also be built using the Substrate framework (written in Rust), which will allow for a tight integration with the zkVerify protocol (which is also built on Substrate) for fast and cost-effective verification of zk proofs. Specifically, EON 2.0 will be a parachain connected to the zkVerify Relay Chain.</p><p>The benefits to this integration allow Horizen to become optimized for ZK-based Apps, the seamless integration with zkVerify ensures the most efficient process for all ZK projects. This sets the groundwork for innovative ZK apps that will make Horizen the home for ZK and also provide more utility for $ZEN.</p> <p>Question: Given Spencer’s remarks on the necessity of evolving with blockchain technologies in the previous StealthEX AMA, how is the marketing department planning educational initiatives or community outreach programs to address the complexities of ZKVerify?</p><p>Answer: Great question, this is something that the Horizen Labs Marketing Team is extensively focused on and planning for. We have established a developer relations team, whose responsibility will be to ensure sufficient educational and community outreach programs will be created for zkVerify, some of which have already kicked off or will be starting soon.&nbsp;</p><p>The zkVerify documentation hub has tutorials already available to developers and builders: <a href="https://docs.zkverify.io/tutorials/tutorials/">https://docs.zkverify.io/tutorials/tutorials/</a></p><p>This includes which wallets to use to get started, how to connect the wallets to zkVerify, how to request test tokens ($ACME), and many guides on how to submit proofs with various verifiers such as Groth16, Fflonk, Risc0, and more! I’d encourage anyone who is interested to explore this to check out our documentation linked above. The team is always available on Discord for any questions or any support needed.&nbsp;</p><p>We will also be launching an educational program with Metaschool soon for zkVerify. This will be an interactive course in which users can learn more about zero knowledge technology, the modular blockchain stack, and how zkVerify fits into all of it. There will be some user actions to take as part of the course, like following some of the tutorials above, additional information to come soon on that!&nbsp;</p><p>The zkVerify Twitter &amp; Youtube is a great source of educational content for users as well, to make sure that zkVerify is as builder friendly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>zkVerify Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/ZKVProtocol">https://x.com/ZKVProtocol</a></p><p>zkVerify Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zkVerify">https://www.youtube.com/@zkVerify</a></p> <p>Question: How does HorizenLabs approach governance and decision-making within the project? Are there any specific mechanisms or processes in place to ensure community involvement and transparency?</p><p>Answer: The Horizen Ecosystem follows a DAO structure and is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem, including miners, developers, node operators, and $ZEN holders.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horizen DAO, governed by the Horizen Foundation follows various processes regarding community proposals, called ZenIPs (ZEN Improvement Proposals) – starting with a proposal idea and research, idea modification, community feedback, draft creation, voting period, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horizen DAO Discourse is the community hub, this is where many of the ZenIPs are discussed among the community members, as the proposals go from the idea phase to the draft phase and on to the formal voting phase. Community members are encouraged to express their thoughts and provide feedback on each proposal or discussion topic that comes in.&nbsp;</p><p>Voting on these ZenIP proposals is done via Snapshot, the Horizen Foundation Snapshot is a great way to check out previous community votes, what the participation levels were like, what was being voted on, and what was the community sentiment for each of the votes: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth</a></p><p>I’ll add a few resources that might be of value to learn more about this:&nbsp;</p>  Introducing Horizen DAO Blog: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/</a>  Horizen DAO Discourse: <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">https://horizen.discourse.group/</a>  Horizen Discord: <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">https://horizen.io/invite/discord</a>  Horizen Governance Documentation: <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about</a>   <p>Question: As horizenglobal expands its network of partners and collaborations, how do you plan to maintain a cohesive and unified ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders, and what challenges do you foresee in managing such a diverse portfolio of projects?</p><p>Answer: Horizen Labs prides itself on being one of the major collaborators in the crypto space. This means that our Business Development, Marketing, and Tech teams have extensive experience working with many different partners on many different initiatives, ensuring that the ecosystem is functioning efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the primary ways that we ensure alignment across many different partners within the ecosystem is through our communication. When it comes time for a network upgrade, update, new integration, new tool available, etc, we are always sure to communicate that both our community, as well as all of our ecosystem partners. This helps to ensure that all of our partners are aligned.&nbsp;</p><p>At Horizen Labs we have worked with the teams at Offchain Labs, Yuga Labs, Animoca Brands, Darewise, ApeCoin DAO, and more on various projects and initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, with the Horizen ecosystem running as a DAO structure, there is extensive community involvement in all that goes on within the ecosystem. From Discourse, to Discord, to Twitter and Telegram, the Horizen community is constantly in discussion and this is where we share updates, to ensure that everyone is aligned!</p> <p>Question: How does HorizenLabs leverage its expertise in zero-knowledge cryptography and modular blockchain to address the scalability and efficiency challenges faced by the Web3 ecosystem?</p><p>Answer: Horizen Labs has built zkVerify, the Modular Blockchain for ZK Proof Verification. zkVerify is dedicated to verifying ZK proofs across diverse blockchains efficiently, reducing proof verification costs by 90%+, which would have saved ZK Rollups $42.8 Million in 2023 alone.&nbsp;</p><p>By drastically reducing cost, zkVerify is empowering organizations and dApps to achieve economies of scale, bringing in the next generation of use cases that achieve blockchain’s ultimate potential.</p><p>zkVerify Enhances network performance by decoupling the computationally heavy proof verification process, allowing for faster and more precise operations free from the constraints of multi-purpose chains and seamlessly integrates with existing blockchain ecosystems and multiple zero-knowledge proving schemes, minimizing technical overhead with a developer-friendly environment.</p><p>I’d encourage anyone who is looking to learn more about zkVerify to check out their website: <a href="https://zkverify.io/">https://zkverify.io/</a></p> <p>Question: How could the successful implementation of ZenIP 42406 impact the value and adoption of the ZEN token? What are the potential economic benefits for ZEN holders and the broader Horizen ecosystem as a result of the migration and the new EON 2.0 parachain?</p><p>Answer: I won’t go into details on any price predictions with this answer, but I will say that there is a lot to unpack with the passing of ZenIP 42406.&nbsp;</p><p>At a high level, Horizen ($ZEN) and EON are currently built on older technology stacks. The Horizen Mainchain is a fork of the Bitcoin C++ codebase with a block time of 2.5 minutes, while EON is written in Scala based on the Scorex SDK with an 18-second block time. To address the limitations of these legacy systems and align with the vision of Horizen as a home for ZK and an enduring utility for $ZEN, Horizen Labs proposed to migrate to Horizen EON 2.0 with ZenIP 42406.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially Horizen/EON 2.0 will have a new target block time of ~6 seconds, be built on the Substrate framework written in rust, ZK-Optimized, and have backward compatibility.&nbsp;</p><p>On ZK-Optimization:&nbsp;</p>  Leverage fast, native zk proof verification from zkVerify Protocol  Modular and upgradable architecture for future zk advancements, such as new proving systems.&nbsp;  <p>On Backward Compatibility:&nbsp;</p>  Preserve max $ZEN supply  Full Solidity and EVM support  $ZEN, EON snapshots  Prolonged Claim Window  Enable Incentives for Ecosystem Partners  <p>In Addition:&nbsp;</p><p>-Enhanced Performance: Incorporating the latest advancements in zero-knowledge proof systems, improving transaction speeds, and increasing security</p><p>-Expanded Ecosystem with Full EVM Compatibility: Enhances interoperability with other blockchains, opening up a world of possibilities for cross-chain collaborations and integrations. This means more opportunities and partnerships for the Horizen community</p><p>-Community Growth: With these improvements, we are fostering a better environment for developers and web3 users to join our network, making Horizen stronger and more vibrant than ever before!</p><p>I’d encourage those who are interested to learn more about ZenIP 42406 and everything it means for the Horizen Ecosystem to check out our high-level blog post which provides an overview to the proposal: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42406-eon-and-zen-migration-high-level-overview/">https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42406-eon-and-zen-migration-high-level-overview/</a></p> <p>Question: How do @HorizenLabs and @ZKVProtocol plan to stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape?</p><p>Answer: Horizen Labs has an incredible research and product marketing team that works extensively to stay up to date with the latest and greatest in the industry. Many of our Cryptographers and Engineers actively contribute to various research projects and initiatives, both within and outside of Horizen Labs.&nbsp;</p><p>We also leverage our vast network of connections and industry partners for this, which helps us to stay ahead of the curve and to learn of the latest developments as they are emerging in the space. Our Business Development team is constantly out in the field discussing with prospective partners and projects to see what their needs are, and how we can help to address them, providing a valuable feedback loop for our team.</p> <p>Question: In what ways can developers take advantage of Horizen’s fully EVM-compatible blockchain to seamlessly migrate or build their Ethereum-based dApps, and what tools and resources are available to support this process?</p><p>Answer: The Horizen Ecosystem is quite vibrant, I’d encourage everyone to go check out the full list of our Ecosystem: <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/">https://eon.horizen.io/</a></p><p>There are many developer tools available on Horizen EON currently, such as Thirdweb, Remix, Truffle, and Hardhat. The Ecosystem includes infrastructure, bridges, an NFT Marketplace, many different Wallet Integrations, Oracles, DeFi integrations such as SpookySwap, Interport, Yuzu, and more!</p><p>In addition, there is extensive documentation available for Horizen EON that explains how to get and connect a wallet, receive test tokens, conduct a forward or backward transfer and learn more about how to set up forger nodes. Be sure to check out our documentation hub: <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/">https://docs.horizen.io/</a></p><p>To answer your specific question, we have a tutorial available that explains how to deploy a dApp using the Remix IDE here as well: <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/tutorials/todolist">https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/tutorials/todolist</a></p> <p>Question: A strong community not only brings interesting ideas to the project but also attracts larger partners. So how is its initiative&nbsp; planning to build its community? And is there a plan to recruit people with Blockchain experience to the initiative team??</p><p>Answer: I figured this would be a great way to end this text AMA, and I wanted to provide as many relevant links as possible for this community to learn more about Horizen, zkVerify, and Horizen Labs, and to join our communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Horizen:&nbsp;</p>  Horizen Website: <a href="https://www.horizen.io/">https://www.horizen.io/</a>  Horizen Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/horizenglobal">https://x.com/horizenglobal</a>  Horizen Discord: <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">https://horizen.io/invite/discord</a>  Horizen Discourse: <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">https://horizen.discourse.group/</a>  Horizen Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/horizencommunity">https://t.me/horizencommunity</a>  Horizen Documentation: <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/">https://docs.horizen.io/</a>  <p>Horizen Labs:&nbsp;</p>  Horizen Labs Website: <a href="https://horizenlabs.io/">https://horizenlabs.io/</a>  Horizen Labs Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/HorizenLabs">https://x.com/HorizenLabs</a>  <p>zkVerify:&nbsp;</p>  zkVerify Website: <a href="https://zkverify.io/">https://zkverify.io/</a>  zkVerify Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/ZKVProtocol">https://x.com/ZKVProtocol</a>  zkVerify Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/zkverify">https://discord.gg/zkverify</a>  zkVerify Telegram: @zkverify  zkVerify Documentation: <a href="https://docs.zkverify.io/">https://docs.zkverify.io/</a>  <p>On both the Horizen and zkVerify Discord servers there are many different channels tailored to various languages and communities around the globe, such as French, Korean, Chinese, Turkish, Spanish, Portuguese, and more!&nbsp;</p><p>The Horizen Community has many dedicated and passionate Ambassadors who help to moderate the Discord Server and other community channels, provide community support, answer questions, and are amazing resources for our community.

<p>The <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/f219e72a-2f12-11ef-a4d3-360fad1b0509/view">ZCG Election &amp; Second Exploratory Dev Fund poll</a> has now closed and the results are in!</p>



<p>The purpose of this poll was to elect two members of the Zcash Community Grants committee, and to solicit input from the Zcash community regarding a potential future Dev Fund, with a view to drafting a formal proposal based on that feedback.&nbsp;</p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The results of the ZCG election are as follows:</p>



 
 GGuy – 79 votes 



 Wobbzz – 73 votes 



 Peacemonger – 65 votes 



 Roosevelt Gordones (gordonesTV on the forum) – 63 votes 



 Samara – 52 votes 



 Chidi (lisa001 on the forum) – 41 votes 



 Kworks – 26 votes 
 



<p></p>



<p>Congratulations to GGuy and Wobbzz, who are duly reappointed to the ZCG Committee. Thank you to all the candidates for volunteering to serve the Zcash community.</p>



 Exploratory Dev Fund Poll &amp; Survey 



<p>We included two questions alongside the ZCG election poll on Helios to gather further input from the community on the design of a proposal for a future Dev Fund. </p>



<p>The results of the Helios poll are as follows: </p>



<p>If the Dev Fund is renewed, it: </p>



 
 Should remain 20% of the block reward – 78 votes 



 Should be less than 20% of the block reward – 35 votes 



 Should be more than 20% of the block reward – 18 votes 
 



<p></p>



<p>If the Dev Fund is renewed, how long should it last for before having to be renewed again?</p>



 
 1 year – 50 votes 



 2 years – 81 votes 
 



<p></p>



<p>We also ran a Jotform survey to solicit community input regarding how the Dev Fund should be allocated between the recipients.&nbsp;While Helios is our preferred polling platform, it does not support arbitrary input by poll respondents. In this case, we want to allow ZCAP members to enter percentages to indicate how they believe the Dev Fund should be allocated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked the question: What percentage of a new Dev Fund should be allocated to each recipient?</p>



<p>67 people responded to the survey, and the average of their responses is as follows: </p>



 
 Bootstrap Project (parent of the Electric Coin Company): 28% (rounded up from 27.66) 



 Zcash Community Grants program: 40% (rounded down from 40.44) 



 Zcash Foundation: 32% (rounded up from 31.90) 
 



<p></p>



<p>Thank you to everyone who voted in the Helios poll and completed the survey. We will use these results to draft a proposal in the form of a proposed ZIP for the community’s to review and evaluate, alongside other proposals from ECC and community members. We plan to run a final run-off poll to determine whether any proposal has consensus support across the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>

 Nym team in full force at Blockchain Week in&nbsp;Kyiv <p>Nym had an amazing time last weekend in Ukraine for Blockchain Week in&nbsp;Kyiv.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/nym-%D0%B2-%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5-f76269c3f724">Русский</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/nym%E6%8D%A2nym-%E6%A1%A5%E6%8E%A5%E5%8E%9F%E7%94%9F%E4%BB%A3%E5%B8%81%E5%92%8Cerc20%E4%BB%A3%E5%B8%81-e678f544ce29">中文</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nym-ukraynadan-canl%C4%B1-yay%C4%B1nda-6aae606d4cd6">Türkçe</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/nedd2e38d1ace">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/nym-en-direct-dukraine-b472a0b40928">Française</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym.community/nym-%D0%B2-%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D1%96-170ded2ec0af">українська мова</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/nym-langsung-dari-ukraina-cbd15e143f9d">Bahasa Indonesia</a></p><p>Members of the Nym core team — including Harry Halpin, Nym’s co-founder and CEO — got to meet and speak about digital privacy surrounding blockchain with crypto, hacker, and Nym enthousiasts.</p><p>In addition to troubleshooting with like-minded privacy-advocates on the state of the world, Nym also showcased the coming <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> app. With a new sandbox interface, event participants got to try out NymVPN which started <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-alpha-private-testing-has-begun-6bdb6f130eb5">alpha testing</a> last month. Participants were also shown how easy it can be to run a NymNode and be an active part of the Nym privacy ecosystem.</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of the many talks and events over the weekend. Check out the links to watch the talks by Harry and crew, including how AI is being used to empower digital war machines.</p>Testing NymVPN Bitcoin Meetup <p>The first step on the Nym tour was the Bitcoin Meetup organized by <a href="https://x.com/victoriazaiche1">Victoria Zaichenko</a> on 20 June. Harry gave a keynote address on how tracking, profiling, and other anti-privacy measures impact the anonymity of Bitcoin users and their transactions. Companies like Chainalysis can link a company or individual to their wallet, and network traffic analysis technologies continue to compromise the privacy of crypto transactions.</p><p>Harry broke down how we can counter these tracking efforts to secure the privacy of your wallet. Most importantly, he showed how the Nym mixnet can protect crypto wallets from transaction linkage to IP addresses and locations better than existing network technologies.</p>Harry Halpin with RawBox team and the meetup organizer, Victoria Zaichenko<p>Nymja <a href="https://x.com/oleksky">Oleksky</a> also presented on their <a href="https://medium.com/@RawBox/introducing-rawbox-your-gateway-to-genuine-online-privacy-9ca3286311eb">RawBox</a> project, an ultra-private router developed by their team in Ukraine. The RawBox can do many things, including allowing local communities to share and economize on the same privacy-protected bandwidth, and even provide mobile protections for activists and journalists while traveling in high-risk zones.</p> KyivETh Hackathon <p>For the KyivETH Hackathon on 22 June, Harry gave a talk on the privacy vulnerabilities of Ethereum-based wallets like MetaMask. At the network level, metadata leaks through centralized third parties (Infura) that MetaMask relies on by default. Fortunately, Nym is <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-for-nym-swapper-app-bridges-cosmos-and-ethereum-wallets-b9dc8e6446ec">working on</a> integrating the Nym mixnet with MetaMask and other popular cryptocurrency wallets to provide seamless anonymity in applications you already&nbsp;use.</p><p>Watch Harry’s KyivETh talk&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/fhdoGWA8Obk?feature=shared&amp;t=20591">here</a>!</p>Harry Halpin discussing the Nym&nbsp;mixnet Nym Meetup with&nbsp;KEC <p>On Saturday, Nym also organized a Nym Meetup with the <a href="https://x.com/kyiv_ethereum?lang=en">Kyiv Etherium Community</a> (KEC). Nym’s own front-end Developer <a href="https://x.com/yana_tnfl">Yana Matrosova</a> gave a talk on the Nym Squad League, and then tested the upcoming NymVPN live with Nym Ambassador <a href="https://x.com/Beyond_Karto">Volodymyr</a>.</p><p>A Nym community member and RawBox contributor did a run-through on how to install and run a Nym node. And Oleksky, the founder of the RawBox, gave a compelling presentation visualizing how Nym Meetup members traffic data is visible while using NymVPN and without&nbsp;it.</p>Yana Matrosova presenting NymVPN<p>Harry presented on the “Present and Future of Nym.” The talk covered a wide-range of crucial topics, including why “the internet is broken,” why we all need anonymity online, and how the Nym mixnet can help us stay anonymous in what we do better than any existing technology. He went into detail on the projected course of the Nym project, its scalability and goals, and what to expect next. Be sure to check out the talk to understand the advancement of Nym’s concrete developments in providing genuine privacy for everyone.</p>Volodymyr with Harry Halpin and Yana Matrosova<p>Watch all the Nym Meetup talks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J28eaj5fdqo">here</a>!</p><p>And Yana’s live <a href="https://x.com/yana_tnfl/status/1805579675424448810">reporting</a> on the presentation and participants</p> Incrypted Conference <p>For the Incrypted Conference on 23 June, Nym ran a booth with much-loved merch! Nym left empty handed, but find our swag at upcoming&nbsp;events.</p><p>Meanwhile, Harry gave a very well-attended keynote talk on “Surveillance and AI in times of war: How NymVPN can help!” AI is all the rage, but what we don’t see is how its developments are making data surveillance much easier, and even deadly. When it comes to war technologies like drones, which are now regularly powered by AI-identification algorithms, surveillance is no longer simply about privacy: it’s a question of life or death for&nbsp;many.</p>Incrypted audience for Halpin&nbsp;talk.<p>Watch Harry’s Incrypted talk&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dhIZA8rCAt4?t=5528&amp;si=O0Sz4G5WIQDK2ONi">here</a>.</p><p>And of course, Yana’s deligent <a href="https://x.com/yana_tnfl/status/1806634497351278978">reporting</a> on the&nbsp;event.</p> The Nym community <p>A big part of participating in a great event like the Blockchain Week is being able to spend time and discuss with Nym community members, present and to come. The Ukrainian contingent has been a really influential and integral part of the Nym community since the beginning, so being there in support of them was truly an&nbsp;honor.</p><p>Nym was able to demonstrate the upcoming NymVPN with test users live via the new sandbox interface to show how NymVPN works step-by-step. But also how anyone who wants to build a private web can be a part of the the Nym project by running a&nbsp;node.</p><p>But for us Nym devs, what mattered most was to hear face-to-face, and face-to-interface, how what we’re developing might help others, in Ukraine and everywhere. It’s with this feedback that the Nym privacy network, and the first product to run on it, can genuinely provide seamless anonymity for everyone when they need it the&nbsp;most.</p><p>And of course, there were Ukrainian treats!</p><p>Nym is looking forward to being at upcoming events this summer, so look for us at: EthCC and the Modular summit in Brussels in&nbsp;July!</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-live-from-ukraine-2baef0adf5ca">Nym Live from Ukraine!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Privacy is critical for institutional crypto traders. Trades on public blockchains expose institutions to risks, including strategy theft, front-running, and MEV bots. Dark pools offer institutions a promising way to execute large trades privately. However, their adoption has been slow. One major issue is the association between Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET) and illegal activities like money laundering and terrorist financing, as seen with Tornado Cash. Other problems include concerns about compliance with regulations, inefficiencies in handling large transactions, poor integration with existing financial systems, limited scalability, and the risk of censorship.</p><p>This blog will discuss the reasons behind the slow adoption of dark pools by institutional users such as asset managers, market makers, and broker-dealers, their benefits, and how Panther Protocol will help resolve these issues. Panther is building modular, compliance-supportive DeFi access infrastructure for regulated financial market operators. The protocol will include customizable private trading Zones, strong compliance support, direct access to major decentralized exchanges, and privacy-preserving transaction methods to improve digital asset management security, efficiency, and regulatory compliance.</p><p>*For brevity, organizations with users such as asset managers, market makers, and broker-dealers are all referred to as institutions throughout this blog.&nbsp;</p> Reasons behind the slow adoption of dark pools by institutions  Lack of regulatory compliance <p>Inadvertently facilitating illegal activities can result in severe penalties, loss of reputation, and operational disruptions for institutions. AML and KYC regulations are of utmost importance, ensuring that bad actors, such as sanctioned individuals and entities are off their platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Many dark pools in DeFi, such as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/08/crypto-mixing-service-tornado-cash-blacklisted-by-us-treasury/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Tornado Cash</a>, do not align with regulatory standards. This non-compliance poses significant risks, as seen with Tornado Cash being sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and other regulators around the world due to its use by malicious actors like the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lazarus Group</a>. This has led to many institutions being cautious about using dark pools due to potential legal repercussions and the risk of funds being associated with illicit activities.</p> Need for liquidity and handling of large transactions <p>Institutions need solutions that ensure privacy without compromising transaction efficiency. Large trades can see significant slippage or delay if a Dark Pool faces liquidity issues. Any perceived transaction inefficiency naturally leads to challenges with adoption.&nbsp;</p> Poor integration with existing financial systems <p>Institutions prefer solutions that easily integrate with their existing systems, allowing for seamless interoperability and efficient workflows. Poor integration capabilities hinder adoption and can lead to operational bottlenecks. Currently, most of the dark pools available in the market lack integration with existing financial systems and tools. This creates a barrier for institutions that need to incorporate these solutions into their broader financial operations.</p> Vulnerability to censorship&nbsp; <p>For institutions, the risk of transaction censorship is unacceptable. Robust mechanisms are needed by these types of investors to ensure their transactions are processed fairly and securely without being subject to censorship.&nbsp; A number of high-profile regulators, including the <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-proposes-new-regulation-enhance-transparency-convertible-virtual-currency?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">U.S. Treasury, have proposed rules that identify virtual currency mixing as a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern</a>. <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/174977/flashbots-product-lead-addresses-concerns-over-tornado-cash-censorship?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Tornado Cash</a> is a prime example of how transactions can be excluded by OFAC-compliant block builders.&nbsp;</p> Why institutions should care about dark pools  Privacy and confidentiality <p>One reason why the adoption of Web3 dark pools is slow is as a result of misconceptions related to the use of CEXs. While CEXs can provide partial privacy by breaking transaction links, CEXs also custody their user’s assets, introducing exposure to risks ranging from fraud to security issues. Crypto exchanges have a history of high-profile custody issues, such as FTX, whose litany of deceptive practices, including the lending its customers’ assets to Alameda research led to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/darreonnadavis/2023/06/02/what-happened-to-ftx-the-crypto-exchange-funds-collapse-explained/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">one of the worst crises in crypto’s history</a>. Other high profile examples include Mt. Gox, which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mt-gox-begin-repaying-defunct-062550904.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">lost approximately 850,000 BTC to hacking incidents</a>; Bitfinex’s infamous security breach resulting the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60310783?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">theft of 120,000 BTC</a> and <a href="https://www.osc.ca/quadrigacxreport/quadriga-launch.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">QuidrigaCX</a>, where the sudden death of the CEO, who was the sole person with access to the exchange’s private keys, led to the loss of $190M in customer funds, among others.</p><p>Many institutional users find the risks associated with centralized custody unacceptable, particularly given CEXs only offer partial privacy. Dark pools provide essential confidentiality for institutions. In both traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi), large trades can significantly impact market prices and reveal trading strategies if executed publicly. Dark pools prevent market manipulation and front-running by hiding the details of your trades. This protection is essential for institutional investors to execute large transactions without other market participants exploiting this information. The ability to trade anonymously ensures that institutions can protect their trading strategies and investment returns from manipulative practices.</p> MEV Protection <p>MEV bots exploit the transparency and structure of blockchain transactions to extract additional value, often at the expense of other users. Their activities can lead to higher transaction costs, market manipulation, network congestion, and financial losses for other users of the platform. Dark pools such as Panther are using multiple approaches that can significantly reduce MEV risks. While no solution is entirely foolproof, the following strategies, currently under consideration for Panther Protocol’s designs will help create a more secure trading environment:</p>  Approach 1: Offchain Order Book with P2P Library  <p>Using this design choice, users communicate and negotiate trade details offchain using a peer-to-peer (P2P) library. For example, User A submits an offer, and User B handles the matching. They generate cryptographic proofs of the transaction offchain, and only one user submits a single transaction onchain for settlement via a smart contract. This approach minimizes onchain data exposure, reducing the information available to MEV bots and thereby lowering the chances of exploitation.</p>  Approach 2: Onchain Order Book with Onchain Interaction  <p>This design choice involves maintaining the order book and interactions entirely onchain. Users generate proofs and submit transactions onchain with a smart contract performing the settlement. Although this approach benefits from transparency and simpler implementation, it exposes trade details on the blockchain, making it more susceptible to MEV exploits.</p>  Approach 3: Hybrid Model  <p>A hybrid approach combines the strengths of both offchain and onchain methods. Sensitive data like user identities and trade amounts are exchanged offchain, while only cryptographic proofs are submitted onchain. This limits the onchain exposure to essential verification elements, enhancing privacy and reducing the likelihood of MEV attacks.</p><p>Dark pools inherently offer resistance to MEV bots because they typically involve peer-to-peer transactions and minimize onchain exposure, making it difficult for MEV bots to gather the information they need to exploit trades. In summary, by leveraging offchain communication, cryptographic proofs, and strategic onchain interactions, dark pools provide a robust framework for reducing MEV risks and enhancing transaction privacy.</p> Market efficiency and liquidity management <p>TradFi dark pools face significant reputational issues due to their history of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35456219?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=Barclays%20and%20Credit%20Suisse%20have,but%20keep%20the%20prices%20private.">exploiting information advantages</a> to the detriment of their clients. Unlike traditional dark pools, on-chain dark pools such as Panther are working to contribute to market efficiency by allowing large trades to be executed without causing significant price movements. This stability benefits institutions that need to manage liquidity effectively without impacting market conditions. By enabling large, discrete trades, dark pools help institutions maintain optimal portfolio balances and manage risk efficiently. Efficient liquidity management is critical for institutions, and dark pools provide a platform where large orders can be matched without slippage or adverse market impacts. Mechanisms such as peer-to-peer order matching and liquidity aggregation from various sources ensure that institutions can access necessary liquidity while maintaining trade secrecy. This capability is vital for managing large transactions seamlessly.</p> Enhanced security and trust <p>Security is paramount for institutional investors, and dark pools offer a secure environment for executing trades. Privacy-enhancing technologies like zero-knowledge proofs ensure that trade data remains confidential and secure from external threats. Robust security protocols in dark pools build trust among institutional investors. Features like remote attestation and secure multi-party computation enhance the security of dark pool transactions, ensuring that the system remains trustworthy and reliable for institutional use. This trust is essential for institutions to engage in large-scale trading activities confidently.</p> How Panther will enable private, compliant DeFi access for institutions <p>Panther Protocol is set to enhance privacy, security, and efficiency in digital asset management. Panther is building compliance-enabling DeFi access infrastructure, complete with dark pool functionality for regulated financial entities. Panther Zones will enable institutions to create private trading Zones with customized asset lists, user lists, transaction limits, and access to DeFi applications. This modular approach will allow institutions to tailor their trading environments according to specific regulatory and operational needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Want to learn more about Panther Zones?

Or if you are simply interested in just how much is going on in the deepest depths of one of the most advanced privacy infrastructures in the&nbsp;world.</p> Reward split vote is&nbsp;live! <p>Recently, the operator community passed a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/incentivizing-privacy-not-surveillance-nym-nodes-approve-min-profit-margin-8bbfa5732128">vote on minimum profit margin</a>, an initiative to prevent a “race to the bottom” of operator rewards and quality of service. Over the past week, a <a href="https://forum.nymtech.net/t/poll-what-should-be-the-split-of-mixmining-rewards-among-the-layers-of-the-nym-mixnet/407">new vote</a> has been ongoing to determine the reward split across network&nbsp;layers.</p><p>With the Nym network, user traffic passes through five layers to ensure strong protections: an entry gateway, three layers of mix nodes, and an exit gateway to the clearnet. The Nym reward algorithm currently rewards mix nodes, but not entry or exit gateways. To solve this and ensure gateways are rewarded for their work, a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/improved-nym-node-reward-scheme-acd8f1123a27">new reward scheme</a> has been presented to the community for feedback.</p><p>The new reward scheme will ensure that all operators in the active set — whether acting as a mix node, entry gateway, or exit gateway — are rewarded for their work. Operators simply run a “Nym node” and may be selected for any layer at each epoch, with top performing, reliable nodes more likely to be selected as entry or exit gateways. All nodes also function as entry and exits for the simple, two-layer VPN&nbsp;mode.</p><p>But the question is, what share of rewards should each of these layers receive? Operating gateways, particularly exit gateways, may come with operational risks in some regions. Therefore, the community is currently voting on how much premium gateways should be receiving in compensation.</p><p>The Nym network is used in two different modes: as a high speed VPN with two layers, or as a powerful privacy mixnet with five layers. The vote therefore has two&nbsp;parts:</p> Part 1: Reward split for high-speed, 2-layer&nbsp;VPN  Part 2: Reward split for high-privacy, 5-layer&nbsp;mixnet <p>Establishing the right incentive for the community to operate enough exit gateways is crucial going forward in maintaining a reliable and viable privacy infrastructure!</p>  Read <a href="https://nymtech.net/api/media/governance_proposal_rewards_distribution_per_layer.pdf">detailed more explanation</a> here  Watch the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTCAPU_I_fQ"> community call</a> dedicated to this topic with Claudia Diaz (Nym Chief Scientist) and Igor Smirnov (Technical Delivery&nbsp;Lead)   Operator Terms &amp; Conditions implemented <p>The Nym network and NymVPN app promise strong privacy to end-users, including a promise of no logs.

<p>AI assistants have become a common part of modern Web browsers. Brave has Leo, Edge has Copilot, Opera has Aria, Arc has Max… This new wave of AI integration has raised many questions among developers and users alike. What’s the best way to interact with an AI assistant within the browser? What unique opportunities arise when AI is brought directly into the browsing experience? And, perhaps most importantly: How can we effectively safeguard a user’s data, and allow them to configure their own AI models?</p>
<p><a>In our Leo roadmap</a>–where we outlined how Brave is thinking about Leo and the future of AI integrations within the browser (aka Browser AI)—we pointed out the need to allow users to run models locally, and to configure their own models. Running models locally (i.e. directly on device) ensures that data like conversations, webpages, and writing prompts exchanged with the AI assistant never leave the user’s device. This approach will also open more opportunities for assisting users with their local data while safeguarding end user privacy. Additionally, by allowing users to configure their own AI models, whether running locally or hosted remotely, Brave empowers users to tailor the AI’s behavior, output, and capabilities to their specific needs and preferences.</p>

 Your model, your rules 
<p>Our first step towards that promise is called “bring your own model” (or “BYOM” for short). This optional new way of using Leo, Brave’s native browser AI, allows users to link it directly with their own AI models. BYOM allows users to run Leo with local models running safely and privately on their own machines. Users will be able to chat or ask questions on webpages (<a>and docs and PDFs</a>) to Leo without their content ever having to leave the device.</p>
<p>BYOM isn’t limited to just local models, either–BYOM users will also have the flexibility to connect Leo to remote models running on their own servers, or that are run by third-parties (e.g. ChatGPT). This opens new possibilities for users and organizations to leverage proprietary or custom models while still benefiting from the convenience of querying the AI directly within the browser.</p>
<p>With BYOM, the requests are made directly from the user’s device to the specified model endpoint, bypassing Brave entirely. Brave does not act as an intermediary and has absolutely no access to—or visibility into—the traffic between the user and the model. This direct connection ensures end-to-end control for the user.</p>
<p>BYOM is currently available on the <a>Brave Nightly channel</a> for developers and testers, and is targeted to launch in full release later this summer. Note that BYOM is initially for Desktop users only.</p>

 Getting started Using Local Models with BYOM in Leo 
<p>No special technical knowledge or hardware is required to try BYOM. The local LLMs landscape has evolved so fast that it is now possible to run performant local models on-device in just a few simple steps.</p>
<p>For example, consider a hobbyist-favorite framework for running local LLMs: <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a>. The Ollama framework supports an extensive <a href="https://ollama.com/library">list of local models</a> that range from 829MB to 40GB in size.</p>
<p>You can get started using a local LLM in Brave Leo in two easy steps:</p>

 Step 1: Download and install Ollama 
<p>First, visit <a href="https://ollama.com/download">https://ollama.com/download</a> to download Ollama. Select your platform and continue with the download. Once you download and unzip the file, make sure to move the application somewhere you can easily access, such as your computer’s desktop or Application folder. You will have to start the serving framework whenever you want to use the local model.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Next, click the application and wait for it to open, and complete the install steps.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>After you complete these steps and click Finish, you’ll be able to run Meta’s Llama 3 model on your machine just by opening your terminal and typing:</p>
 <code>ollama pull llama3
</code> <p>You should see that the model manifest and the model are being downloaded (note this step may take a while to complete, depending on the file size and your connection speed). Once the model has been pulled successfully, you can close your terminal.</p>
<p>Llama 3, at 4.7GB for an 8B parameter model, strikes a good balance between quality and performance, and can be easily run on a laptop with at least 8GB of RAM. Other models we found suitable to be run locally are Mistral 7B (by Mistral AI) and Phi 3 Mini (by Microsoft). <a href="https://ollama.com/library">See the full list of models supported by Ollama</a>.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Now that the model is running locally on your device, no data is being transmitted to any third party. Your data remains yours.&nbsp;</p>

 Step 2: Plug your model into Leo 
<p>To add your own local model to Leo, open the Brave browser and visit Settings, and then Leo. Scroll to the Bring your own model section and click Add new model.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>You’ll then be brought to a new interface where you can add the details of your model. The required fields are the following:</p>
 
 
<p>Label: The name of the model as it will appear in the model selection menu.</p>
 
 
<p>Model request name: The name of the model as it should appear in the request to the serving framework, e.g. llama-3 (note that if this name doesn’t match exactly what is expected by the serving framework, the integration will not work).</p>
 
 
<p>Server  endpoint: The url where your serving framework is “listening” for requests. If you’re not sure, check the serving framework documentation (For Ollama, this is always <code>http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions</code>).</p>
 
 
<p>API Key: third party frameworks may require authentication credentials, such as an API key or an access token. These will be added to the request header.</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Click Add model; your local model should now appear in the Leo model menu. Simply select it to use it to power your browser AI.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Note that while we’ve used Ollama in this section, as we think it’s one of the most user-friendly frameworks to set up and run local models, the BYOM feature can be used with any local serving framework with an exposed endpoint and that conforms to the OpenAI chat protocol.</p>

 Using Remote Models (ChatGPT) with BYOM in Leo 
<p>To connect Leo to a remote model or a third party API, such as <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction">OpenAI API</a>, follow these steps:</p>
 
 
<p>Enter <code>https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions</code> as the endpoint, and add the name of your desired model (e.g. <code>gpt-4o</code> see <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models">model list</a>) in the <code>Model request name</code> field.</p>
 
 
<p>Enter your private API key in the <code>Authentication Credentials</code> field to authenticate your requests to the API. The key is then stored safely in your browser.</p>
 
 
<p>Note that—at the time of writing—Brave Leo only supports textual input and outputs; outputs of any other modality will not be processed. You can now use Brave Leo with ChatGPT through your OpenAI API account.</p>
<p>If you’re a Brave Nightly user, please give BYOM a try, and let us know what you think on X <a href="https://x.com/bravenightly/">@BraveNightly</a> or at <a href="https://community.brave.com/">https://community.brave.com/</a>!</p>

 <a href='https://brave.com/blog/brave-shields-manifest-v3/'>What Manifest V3 means for Brave Shields and the use of extensions in the Brave browser</a>

</h3>

  Brave is committed to maintaining Manifest V2 support, allowing users to keep their favorite extensions functioning beyond the industry-wide deprecation.

<p>In late 2021, Google first announced plans to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/mv2-deprecation-timeline">deprecate Manifest V2</a> (MV2), the longstanding Chrome extension manifest file format, and force extensions to be built using Manifest V3 (MV3) going forward. What does this mean for Brave users? In short:</p>
 
 
<p>Manifest V3 will not weaken Brave Shields in any way</p>
 
 
<p>For as long as we’re able (and assuming the cooperation of the extension authors), Brave will continue to support some privacy-relevant MV2 extensions—specifically AdGuard, NoScript, uBlock Origin, and uMatrix</p>
 
 
<p><a>Brave Shields</a> block ads and trackers by default, and they’re built natively in the Brave browser—no extensions required. Since Shields are patched directly onto the open-source Chromium codebase, they don’t rely on MV2 or MV3.</p>
<p>Thanks to this independence, Google’s forced removal of MV2 will not weaken Brave Shields. The filter lists (such as EasyList and EasyPrivacy) we rely on to protect users from invasive ads and trackers are open for community contribution, and we expect the privacy community at large to continue maintaining these lists. Brave’s privacy research and engineering teams will do so as well.</p>
<p>No matter what happens with the deprecation of MV2 and the shift to MV3, Shields will continue to offer better, more stable protection than extensions.</p>

 Will MV2 extensions still work in Brave? 
<p>Yes, for now. We recognize the importance of supporting existing Manifest V2 extensions. We <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/blob/master/chromium_src/extensions/common/extension_features.cc">have force-enabled Manifest V2</a> support in the Brave browser, ensuring that you can continue to use your favorite extensions without interruption. In June 2025, Google plans to remove all remaining Manifest V2 items from the Chrome Web Store. While Brave has no extension store, we have a robust process for customizing (or “patching”) atop the open-source Chromium engine. This will allow us to offer limited MV2 support even after it’s fully removed from the upstream Chromium codebase.</p>

 Which MV2 extensions will work in Brave? 
<p>As of now, the MV2 extensions we plan to explicitly support are <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adguard-adblocker/bgnkhhnnamicmpeenaelnjfhikgbkllg?hl=en&amp;pli=1">AdGuard AdBlocker</a>, <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm?hl=en">NoScript</a>, <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">uBlock Origin</a>, and <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/umatrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf">uMatrix</a>. This feature will be best-effort: we might have to modify support based on either Google’s plans or what extension authors ultimately decide to do. If extensions become stale or obsolete, we may remove support for them rather than offer our users an out-of-date (potentially even unsafe) experience.</p>
<p>We’re gradually rolling out a new page in Settings that lists these extensions. Once you have the update, you will see it in brave://settings/extensions.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 What’s the issue with Manifest V3? 
<p>As a recap, Manifest V3 restricts the blocking capabilities of Web extensions, <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions-%28FAQ%29#filtering-capabilities-which-cant-be-ported-to-mv3">making it harder</a> for privacy-enhancing extensions such as uBlock Origin to protect users. The privacy community has already begun releasing experimental versions of ad block extensions that are rebuilt from the ground up to meet the new constraints of MV3: <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adguard-adblocker-mv3-exp/apjcbfpjihpedihablmalmbbhjpklbdf">AdGuard AdBlocker MV3 Experimental</a> and <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh">uBlock Origin Lite</a> are just two examples. And we’ve seen that these experimental versions do block ads and other unwanted Web content. However, MV3 imposes new limitations, such as a cap on blocking rules, the removal of background scripts, and changes around cosmetic filtering. Overall, these new MV3 extensions lean on workarounds to solve problems MV3 itself introduces.</p>

 The increased importance of user-first browsers such as Brave 
<p>Brave provides best-in-class privacy, no extensions required. We’re also actively working on new features such as procedural filtering, which will give us more flexibility in blocking invasive ads and trackers, ensuring a cleaner and safer browsing experience for our users. If you’re not able to use Brave, browser extensions can be helpful to achieve some (though not all) of Brave’s protections in other, less private browsers. Most ad block developers put a lot of thought and care into the performance and safety of their extensions, and they can provide some additional privacy.</p>
<p>Brave also builds a host of other privacy protections adjacent to ad blocking, such as <a>fingerprint randomization</a>, <a>ephemeral storage partitions</a>, and more; such protections would be impossible in an extension-based solution. By building natively in the Brave browser, we’re saying these features are table stakes, not something that should be offered as an optional add-on.</p>
<p>While Brave will continue to offer limited support for MV2 extensions, the real solution is to use Brave’s industry-leading, native features. All are available by simply downloading the Brave browser.</p>

Thanks to the trustless and neutral <a href="https://learn.cheqd.io/governance/advanced/cheq-erc20/gravity-bridge">Gravity Bridge</a> provider, the Swapper allows users to easily exchange NYM tokens between MetaMask and Keplr&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Here’s why the new Swapper app makes token economics much easier for Nym community members, mixnet operators, crypto enthusiasts, and the Nym ecosystem as a whole. And of course, Nym has a step-by-step guide to getting it up and&nbsp;running.</p>NYM Swapper explained Nym Swapper’s here to&nbsp;help <p>NYM tokens live on two blockchains: native tokens on the Cosmos chain called Nyx, and fungible ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. While there is a much easier availability of NYM on Ethereum, only native tokens on Nyx can be staked on Nym nodes and be received as rewards for network services. So getting Ethereum tokens over to Nyx for staking, and rewards over to Ethereum, has been an ongoing difficulty for the Nym community.</p><p>But no longer! With the Nym Swapper, NYM tokens can now be easily exchanged between the native Nyx (Cosmos) chain and Ethereum. Nym community members no longer need to go through an <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/transfering-nym-erc20-to-nym-cosmos-for-bonding-or-delegating-in-nym-mainnet-introducing-gravity-821e417cb0ab">arduous transfer process</a>. With this new swapper interface, it can be done easily by connecting your MetaMask and Keplr wallet to the web application, thus making NYM tokens more liquid for staking and&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Here’s all you need to know about how to set up the Nym&nbsp;Swapper.</p> Nym Swapper requirements <p>Nym Swapper is a <a href="https://swapper.nymtech.net/swap">stand alone web interface</a> for swapping tokens between MetaMask (Ethereum) and Keplr (Cosmos) wallets, but more wallet integrations are to come! If you do not have these wallets installed, or if they are not detected on your browser, the interface will prompt you to install&nbsp;them.</p> Nym Swapper: Step-by-step setup  Install <p>Once the wallet extensions are <a href="https://swapper.nymtech.net/swap">installed</a>, you can then connect these to the swapper to get&nbsp;started.</p> Connect Wallets <p>MetaMask will prompt the user to choose which accounts they’d like to connect to the swapper. Users can select multiple accounts if they like, and Nym Swapper will automatically update depending on whatever is selected in MetaMask.</p><p>Similarly, you can connect your Keplr wallet and it’ll detect the Nyx address automatically.</p> Swapping NYM <p>Swapping from ERC-20 NYM to native NYM on Nyx chain is straightforward. Simply enter the amount you want to swap and click “Accept &amp; Start Transaction.” The swapper will then show your existing Ethereum NYM&nbsp;balance.</p><p>If you’re transacting for the first time, or if your NYM tokens are not approved to be spent by the Gravity Bridge contract, a MetaMask prompt will appear asking you to create an approval transaction. This allows Gravity Bridge to interact with your tokens on your&nbsp;behalf.</p><p>In order to make this a one-time process and save time in the future, the swapper automatically suggests a high spending&nbsp;cap.</p><p>Once the transaction is successful, MetaMask will prompt you to sign another transaction to initiate the transfer of tokens from Ethereum to your Cosmos address. This transaction interacts with the Gravity Bridge contract on Ethereum, locks up the ERC-20 NYM tokens on Gravity Bridge, and unlocks tokens on the native&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Once the transaction is signed, the application will track the progress of the transaction and alert you when the transaction succeeds.</p> Swapping from Native NYM to&nbsp;ERC-20  Connection <p>First, connect both wallets. This will show the native token balance as well as any fees to be paid, which you should take note of&nbsp;below.*</p><p>* Note that Nym does not itself charge users any fees. All the fees displayed are dependent on factors like how busy Ethereum network is and Gravity Bridge’s operating parameters. Unfortunately this is outside of Nym’s&nbsp;control.</p> Breakdown of&nbsp;Fees <p>Bridge Fee&nbsp;: The amount of tokens required to incentivise an Ethereum relayer to bridge your Nym tokens to Ethereum. This is used to pay for the gas incurred by the&nbsp;relayer.</p><p>Gravity Chain Fee: The payment to Gravity Bridge chain for processing the transaction.</p> Transfer <p>The app will prompt you to sign a transaction to transfer tokens from Nyx chain to Gravity Bridge using&nbsp;IBC.</p><p>Once the tokens are transferred to Gravity Bridge, the app will automatically detect this and initiate another transaction to send the tokens to Ethereum.</p><p>Once the transaction is signed, the web application will wait for an Ethereum relayer to pick up this transaction to be relayed to Ethereum. This can take a few minutes to an hour, depending on availability of relayers. Again, this is a factor outside of Nym’s&nbsp;control.</p> Completed transaction <p>Once the transaction is completed and tokens are relayed, the app will report the transaction as complete.</p><p>The tokens will now be available in the Metamask&nbsp;wallet.</p> Move your delegations and&nbsp;rewards <p>NYM is much more than a cryptocurrency: it’s also a resource in supporting and incentivizing a privacy network for operators and users all over the world. The Nym Swapper makes delegations and rewards reaped from this network easier to manage. There’s no longer a need to tiresome external bridge providers.

 to fill two seats on the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee, and&nbsp; 



 to solicit further input from ZCAP regarding the design of a potential future Dev Fund, with a view to drafting a formal proposal based on that feedback. 
 



<p></p>



<p>ZCAP members should check their mailbox for instructions on how to vote. In the past, Helios emails have sometimes been flagged as spam, so if you can’t find the instructions please check your spam folder.&nbsp;</p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>Members of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), and serve a one year term. Two of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of June. Last month, we invited candidates to express their interest in serving on the committee.</p>



<p>Seven candidates are standing for two seats on the committee. Here is the list of candidates, with links to their candidacy announcements on the Zcash community forum:&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Last Monday, the candidates took part in a Community Call, during which they introduced themselves and answered questions from the Zcash community. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/3z3E2lhBUH0?si=6VKdBolWIr9gVw4u">a recording of the call on Youtube</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The poll will be decided by approval voting for two members out of the seven candidates. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st July 2024. As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The two candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 30th June 2025.</p>



<p>Good luck to all the candidates, and thank you for volunteering to serve on the ZCG committee!</p>



 Polling ZCAP on the Design of a Proposal for a new Dev Fund 



<p>The results of the <a href="https://zfnd.org/results-of-the-first-exploratory-dev-fund-poll-june2024/">first exploratory ZCAP poll</a> indicated support for a new Dev Fund, and majority approval of the Bootstrap Project (parent of the Electric Coin Company), the Zcash Community Grants program (ZCG), and the Zcash Foundation as potential recipients of a future Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the question of how long a new Dev Fund should last, the results were ambiguous, with substantial minority support for both a 1 year and 2 year duration. This aligns with the result of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XOhprdj0iVDPqlUOM8D3IfYMF6UMz67J6849pQbTL0s/edit#gid=0">alternative polls</a> conducted by community members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of this Helios poll, we are asking the following questions:&nbsp;</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q2: If the Dev Fund is renewed, it: </p>



 
 Should remain 20% of the block reward 



 Should be less than 20% of the block reward 



 Should be more than 20% of the block reward 
 



<p></p>



<p>Q3: If the Dev Fund is renewed, how long should it last for before having to be renewed again?</p>



 
 1 year 



 2 years 
 



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>We are also conducting a separate survey to solicit input regarding how the Dev Fund should be allocated between the recipients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Helios is our preferred polling platform, it does not support arbitrary input by poll respondents. In this case, we want to allow ZCAP members to enter percentages to indicate how they believe the Dev Fund should be allocated.&nbsp; Therefore, we will be using the Jotform platform for this survey.</p>



<p>The Jotform survey will ask the question: What percentage of a new Dev Fund should be allocated to each recipient?</p>



<p>Respondents will be able to enter percentage values to reflect how they believe the Dev Fund should be allocated between the Bootstrap Project (parent of the Electric Coin Company), the Zcash Community Grants program (ZCG), and the Zcash Foundation (ZF).&nbsp;</p>



<p>ZCAP members will receive emails directly from Jotform inviting them to register their responses. Those responses will be averaged, and rounded to the nearest whole percentage point to produce an allocation that will form part of the ZIP proposal that the Zcash Foundation will draft and present for the community’s consideration, alongside other proposals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note that ECC has <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/eccs-position-on-the-zcash-dev-fund/">stated</a> that they are open to either (a) allowing the Dev Fund to expire in November, while the community works on a model where development funds flow into a grants pool(s) that are managed in a decentralized way, or (b) <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/draft-zip-to-modify-zip-1014-extending-the-dev-fund-by-one-year/47732">extending the existing development fund for no longer than one year</a>.</p>



<p>In the event that ECC declines to accept funding under a proposal that is drafted based on the results of this survey, ZF may adapt the proposal accordingly, taking into account other feedback from our exploratory polling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the community indicates a preference for a two year Dev Fund but ECC will only accept funding for one year, the remaining funds will be assigned to ZCG.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As previously stated above, the objective of this exploratory Dev Fund polling process is to obtain sufficient insight into the Zcash community’s collective sentiment to draft a Dev Fund proposal that reflects that sentiment, and can be assessed alongside other proposals from ECC and other community members. We expect that there will be a final run-off poll to determine whether any proposal has consensus support across the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both the Helios poll and Jotform survey will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st July 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, we welcome the community’s feedback. If you have comments or suggestions, please join the conversation on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/moving-the-dev-fund-discussion-forward/47464">Zcash community forum</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 More snake oil lubricating new attempt at mass surveillance in&nbsp;EU <p>The specter of mass surveillance continues to loom over Europe. Despite all the advancements made by the General Data Protection Act (GDPR), getting around data encryption is still a&nbsp;target.</p><p>Unfortunately it is all too common for violations to our civil liberties to clothe themselves in promises of protecting us from monsters. The EU proposal for the “Regulation laying down rules to prevent and combat child sexual abuse” (CSA Regulation, or CSAR) is a stunning case in point. The regulation was once again up for vote in the European Parliament this week. Thankfully it was ultimately postponed yesterday due to the controversy surrounding what <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/most-criticised-eu-law-of-all-time/">privacy advocates</a> are calling possibly “the most criticised draft EU law of all&nbsp;time.”</p>Screenshot taken on 21 June&nbsp;2024<p>CSAR essentially provides web clients with AI-powered surveillance technology to undermine the encryption protecting everyone’s personal files and communications. This is all in the name of combatting child sexual abuse, but don’t be fooled by this wolf in sheep’s clothing. EU citizens are being given a false choice: private communications or sexual predators? Fortunately, many, including those in the Nym core team and community, are speaking out urgently against&nbsp;it.</p><p>The Nym team has been closely following the creeping advancement of versions 1.0 and 2.0 of <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-cop-in-every-pocket-client-side-scanning-in-the-uk-and-europe-7eeac45e82b5">“Chat control” since its inception in 2022</a>. It is once again seeking a discussion and possible vote with deceptively revised language. However, the changes simply dampen the tone of its mass surveillance strategy. This is all just a sleight of hand to try to bypass GDPR commitments to protect end-to-end data encryption. While encryption may be left untouched by CSAR, a more ominous backdoor on encryption is proposed which would carry out an even deeper device surveillance en&nbsp;masse.</p><p>Below is what is at stake in the CSAR proposal and why it is such a threat to the online privacy of everyone in the EU and globally.</p> What is chat&nbsp;control? <p>The <a href="https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2024/05/2024-05-28_Council_Presidency_LEWP_CSAR_Compromise-texts_9093.pdf">CSAR legislation</a>, which has come to be known by critics as “chat control,” is a regulatory attempt to locate and block the traffic of child pornography and abuse “prior to transmission.” While few should disagree with the objective, experts have been <a href="https://threema.ch/en/blog/posts/stop-chat-control">shouting from the rooftops</a> that the proposed regulation will simply not be effective. Worse, it authorizes and enforces a surveillance backdoor into the devices of a whole continent of&nbsp;users.</p> Client-Side Scanning&nbsp;(CSS) <p>CSAR’s proposed solution to the problem of child sexual abuse material (otherwise called CSAM) is mass surveillance through <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07450">Client-Side Scanning (CSS)</a>. Rather than compromising encrypted transmissions, it essentially scans data on devices or servers before encryption occurs. This would undermine the security of communications and the principles of end-to-end encryption for everyone.</p><p><a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/what-is-encryption">Encryption</a> is the cornerstone of secure communication. When you do something online through an encrypted connection — sending personal photos to friends or family, or using your credit card online — you can rest reasonably assured that outside parties cannot access or exploit your data. Original CSAR efforts hoped to compel web services to break the encryption protecting the contents of clients’ communications. With encryption broken, all messages could be scanned for targeted material. Fortunately this was met with a <a href="https://cepis.org/app/uploads/2022/03/Open-letter-on-a-right-for-encryption-CEPIS-2022-nosig.pdf">huge backlash</a> from civil society and privacy advocates.</p><p>What is currently being proposed are CSS technologies which would legally permit and enable web services to scan or “monitor” the files and communications on your device before encryption is even applied. Imagine that Apple is able to regularly scan your iPhoto or iMessenger apps for pre-programmed data points deemed to be a threat. Or that a private communications service is given the legal order to do so. In fact, Signal’s president has even <a href="https://x.com/mer__edith/status/1796508893822238881">publicly stated</a> that they will withdraw their services from EU jurisdictions rather than allow such a compromise on the security of their&nbsp;users.</p>Screenshot taken on 21 June&nbsp;2024 CSS technology “deeply flawed,” scientists say <p>Any surveillance scanning program needs to search for something particular. The big question is: can it discernibly find its targets without hauling in unrelated data? In the case of CSAR, the stated goal is to scan users’ devices for potential instances of CSAM. This means, for example, photos depicting children nude or sexually, or messages describing such acts. But how would this even work&nbsp;exactly?</p><p>Essentially a data analysis program likely powered by AI will be given access to everyone’s unencrypted content on a device or server. The system will flag mass amounts of potential threats based on data points before sending all cases to a human team for verification. This team will then have access to your personal files and communications to determine whether you’ve done anything wrong. Suspicious content or activity will then be forwarded to law enforcement authorities for further investigation.</p><p>Researchers have been <a href="https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Open-Letter-CSA-Scientific-community.pdf">very vocal</a> in warning of how error-prone this technology can be, both technically-speaking and as a detriment to civil liberties. Imagine a false-positive, where a parent’s personal photos of their children are flagged by an algorithm and then viewed and reviewed by analysts before being passed on to law-enforcement. Data scientists have <a href="https://nce.mpi-sp.org/index.php/s/eqjiKaAw9yYQF87">warned</a> that such “scanning is doomed to be ineffective,” and done on a large scale will create “side-effects that can be extremely harmful for everyone online, and which could make the Internet and the digital society less safe for everybody.”</p> Timeline <p>CSAR has been struggling through the EU Parliament since its introduction in 2022. It is back this week with a strategically scheduled discussion under the radar of the recent parliamentary elections. Here’s the key timeline to see its advance, changes, and current&nbsp;status.</p>  11 May 2022: The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A209%3AFIN">original CSAR proposition</a> is introduced.  June 2022: it was revealed that Hollywood actor <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2022/dude-wheres-my-privacy-how-a-hollywood-star-lobbies-the-eu-for-more-surveillance/">Ashton Kutchner had been working with Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson</a> lobbying for the then called CSAR, to the benefit of Thorn, an organization he co-founded. <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/">Thorn sells the AI tools</a> that would be used to scan people’s devices. (Kutchner later stepped down as chairman of Thorn <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2023/09/26/thorn-ashton-kutcher-ylva-johansson-csam-csa-regulation-european-commission-encryption-privacy-surveillance/">after defending a convicted rapist</a>).  13 April 2023: A report commissioned by the European Parliament on the impact of the CSAR proposal was presented to the EU Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home&nbsp;Affairs.  July 2023: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Aeex72MtFBjKhExRTooVMWN9TC-pbH-5LEaAbMF91Y/edit">Open letter</a> from 465 scientific and research signatories is sent to the EU commission. Scientists warn explicitly against the likely inefficiencies of the proposed technologies and their undermining of “a secure digital future for our society” and “democratic processes in Europe and&nbsp;beyond.”  2 May 2024: New <a href="https://nce.mpi-sp.org/index.php/s/eqjiKaAw9yYQF87">open letter</a> from 312 scientists and researchers in 32 countries is sent to the EU. They reiterate that the language changes to the CSAR proposal will not change “deeply faulty” and dangerous technology. The letter is co-authored by Bart Praneel, privacy advocate, professor, and Nym Tech&nbsp;advisor.  13 February 2024: <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#%7B%22itemid%22:[%22001-230854%22]%7D">Ruling</a> by the European Court of Human Rights in Podchasov v. Russia emphasizes the role of end-to-end encryption for “securing and protecting the privacy of electronic communications” and insuring “the enjoyment of other fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression.”  20 June 2024: Discussion and vote on revised CSAR is <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11316-2024-INIT/fr/pdf#page=4">scheduled</a> after postponement (see item 28 under “Justice and Internal Affairs”). Vote is finally cancelled!  <p>It’s important to note that the CSAR document is a legislative proposition and has no legal effect unless approved by the parliamentary body. Nonetheless, it is important for EU citizens to contact their representatives and protest against these efforts to violate civil liberties.</p> Legislative language&nbsp;games <p>How things are expressed in language can have significant effects on us: a luring turn of phrase can make us want something we probably don’t, or turn us off to something that’s really not that bad. Sometimes, phrasing can be so monotonous and abstract that we don’t even notice that what we’re digesting a poison&nbsp;pill.</p><p>Enter the CSAR’s latest proposal for “technologies for upload moderation.” When reading through hundreds of pages of parliamentary regulations, phrases like this can easily go unnnoticed, which is exactly what they are designed to do. So what does it mean&nbsp;exactly?</p>Screenshot taken on 21 June&nbsp;2024<p>Let’s break this&nbsp;down.</p><p>[1] “Providers of interpersonal communications services” means any web service that handles your digital communications with other people. This is a broad scope. It clearly applies to messaging apps like WhatsApp, even privacy-focused and encrypted ones like Signal. But it also applies to larger companies like Apple which provide photo and messaging services, let alone operating systems.</p><p>[2] The legal order of “shall install and operate” this CSS technologies entails that communications services will not only will be able to do so, but that they must (or “shall”).</p><p>[3] This is the crux of the matter: detecting the object of surveillance [4] “prior to transmission” means before encryption. Once encryption is in place, detection of any sought after digital material would require breaking encryption, which is not on the table. So this technology amounts to mass device scanning, which only device providers or app and web service operators can perform on behalf of authorities. Since the goal of encrypted data is to protect against third-party access, this technology is essentially a backdoor to encryption.</p><p>[4] While the goal of this scanning might well be the detection of CSAM, locating it means that the AI programs first have access to all of our data or communications. First, there is a big difference between “known child sexual abuse material” (for instance, a photo or video already identified by authorities) and “new child sexual abuse material.” With the latter, the capacities of any AI-program are capable of making tremendous errors in distinguishing between child pornography from private family photos with no sexual&nbsp;intent.</p><p>So “upload moderation,” which sounds as innocuous as “making sure people only post a reasonable amount of material online,” actually means “AI-enabled data surveillance on all users’ devices before encryption for law enforcement purposes.” Add “untested” and “scientifically improbable and error-prone” to this “technology,” and we’re closer to the&nbsp;truth.</p> Breaking encryption or taking it from&nbsp;behind? <p>A lot of the backlash against CSAR has revolved around whether it “breaks” end-to-end encryption for data transmissions. Data encryption was protected by the GDPR and recently reinforced by the recent European Court of Human Rights decision in Podchasov v. Russia (2024). As Meredith Whittaker, the President of Signal, has <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pdfs/upload-moderation.pdf">noted</a>, this amounts to nothing more than a play on language or “rebranding”:</p><blockquote>“[M]andating mass scanning of private communications fundamentally undermines encryption. Full stop. […] We can call it a backdoor, a front door, or ‘upload moderation.’ But whatever we call it, each one of these approaches creates a vulnerability that can be exploited by hackers and hostile nation states, removing the protection of unbreakable math and putting in its place a high-value vulnerability.”</blockquote><p>By enabling web services who facilitate our data to scan it all on our devices or on their servers before any encryption is applied during transmission is not technically “breaking encryption.” In fact, it’s much worse: a backdoor for automated AI algorithms to serve an intermediary surveillance role in connecting our personal data with authorities.</p><p>The CSAR proposition has much contradcitory praise for the value of end-to-end encryption. “[E]nd-to-end encryption,” the CSAR admits, “is a necessary means of protecting fundamental rights and the digital security of governments, industry and society.”</p><p>And yet what it is seeking to create would explicitly undermine the same data privacy that data encryption is meant to protect. The surveillance or “monitoring” technology, the proposition makes clear&nbsp;(26a),</p><blockquote>“ensures that the detection mechanism can access the data in its unencrypted form for effective analysis and action, without compromising the protection provided by end-to-end encryption once the data is transmitted.”</blockquote><p>How surveillance can “access the data in its unencrypted form […] without compromising” end-to-end encryption is a brazen piece of bullshittery.</p> User consent <p>Another big change in the CSAR proposal is that users must be asked to consent to these surveillance technologies being&nbsp;used:</p><blockquote>“child sexual abuse material should remain detectable in all interpersonal communications services through the application of vetted technologies, when uploaded, under the condition that the users give their explicit consent under the provider’s terms and conditions.”</blockquote><p>What does this mean exactly? Any user that <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/majority-for-chat-control-possible-users-who-refuse-scanning-to-be-prevented-from-sharing-photos-and-links/">does not give their consent</a> to having their data scanned can still use the web service, as long as it “does not involve the sending of visual content and URLs.” This can effectively render many communications services inoperable. So imagine that you want a private messaging app, but the EU forces them to scan your data beforehand, and you refuse for good reason. Since the app also allows the sending of photos and links, you simply can’t use the&nbsp;service.</p> Conclusion <p>The vote on CSAR has been postponed, but it is by no means over. The bill will raise its ugly head once again, maybe with further revisions to language that will try to calm the waters to push mass digital surveillance on&nbsp;Europe.</p><p>However, what is clear to many is that this sort of mass surveillance will not solve the problem, which is a social problem rather than a technical one. As Bart Praneel, one of Nym’s close advisors, has <a href="https://x.com/bpreneel1">commented</a>: it’s “unclear why some governments keep pushing for this mass surveillance approach rather than focusing on prevention of sexual abuse of children.”</p><p>Harm against children should be prevented through funding of social services and other preventative means. Ella Jukubowska and EDri have been researching <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/chat-control-10-principles-to-defend-children-in-the-digital-age/">real alternatives</a> to the problem of CSAM and child abuse, online and off. Abuse should not be used as a cynical PR stunt to break encryption and compromise the privacy and security of the entire European population in the process. And we should not be willingly allowing governments to violate our rights to privacy out of fear for monsters.</p><p>Hopefully this latest delay to vote is a sign that regulators are starting to wake up to this&nbsp;fact.</p> Nym Dispatch <p>The Nym Dispatch series deep-dives into the online and social privacy ecosystem.

<p>Proprietary investment strategies have always been among the most closely guarded secrets in finance. Traditionally, these strategies were protected by the nature of how trades are transacted, giving brokers and financial institutions the ability to leverage their proprietary strategies to their advantage. The rise of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new level of transparency. This openness, while fostering trust, poses significant risks as it exposes sensitive trading patterns and strategies to public scrutiny.</p> Exposure of investment strategies <p>In traditional finance, investment strategies are often the real value of what is being provided to the client or fund. Hedge funds, asset managers, and brokers invest significant resources into developing proprietary trading strategies that provide them a competitive edge. However, in the realm of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), the inherent transparency of public ledgers poses a significant threat to these proprietary strategies.</p><p>Every transaction on public blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin is recorded in a publicly accessible ledger. While this transparency promotes trust and verification, it also means that anyone can analyze transaction data to uncover trading patterns and strategies. This exposure can be detrimental to asset managers,&nbsp; brokers and financial institutions that rely on the confidentiality of their trading methods.</p><p>Blockchain analytics tools such as Nansen have made it increasingly easy to scrutinize and interpret blockchain data. Nansen, for instance, labels and analyzes millions of wallet addresses, providing insights into the activities of various market participants. These tools can track large transactions, identify trends, and even link transactions to specific entities. For asset managers, this means that their trades can be monitored, virtually in real-time. It’s possible that their strategies could be reverse-engineered by competitors or malicious actors.</p><p>When proprietary trading strategies are exposed, the risk of financial loss increases substantially. Competitors can replicate successful strategies, diluting competitive advantage. Worse still, malicious actors can engage in counteracting strategies such as front-running, where they anticipate trades and execute their own trades in advance to profit from the price movements triggered by the asset manager’s transactions.</p><p>For example, if an asset manager plans to purchase a large amount of a specific cryptocurrency, front-runners can detect the initial buying activity and buy the cryptocurrency themselves, driving up the price. By the time the purchase is complete, the price has increased, causing the asset manager to pay more than intended. Once the asset manager’s purchase is complete, the front-runners can sell their holdings at a profit, leaving the asset manager at a disadvantage.</p><p>In addition to financial losses, the exposure of investment strategies undermines the trust and credibility of asset managers and other financial professionals. Clients expect their asset managers, brokers and other advisors to maintain the confidentiality of their strategies and transactions. If asset managers cannot guarantee this privacy, they risk losing clients to non-crypto or private alternative investments.&nbsp;</p> Front-running <p>One of the most significant issues that comes with transparent blockchain ledgers is front-running. Front-running occurs when malicious actors observe patterns that suggest an impending transaction is coming and execute their trades ahead of it to capitalize on the expected price movement. For example, if an asset manager intends to buy a large amount of a particular token, front-runners might detect the client’s typical pre-cursory activity and purchase the cryptocurrency first. This buying activity drives up the price, and by the time the transaction is completed, they end up paying a higher price than anticipated. The front-runners then sell their holdings at the increased price, profiting from the transaction while the portfolio suffers from the inflated costs.</p><p>This lack of privacy not only results in financial losses but also erodes your ability to execute effective trading strategies. With open blockchains, competitors can analyze trading patterns, replicate successful strategies, or even devise counter-strategies that exploit your clients’ positions. This constant surveillance can lead to a loss of competitive edge, as asset managers, brokers and others are unable to maintain the secrecy of their clients’ strategies.&nbsp;</p> MEV Bots <p>MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bots underscore the importance of privacy in the trading strategies used by asset managers. These bots are sophisticated algorithms that monitor blockchain networks for pending transactions and exploit opportunities to extract additional value. By analyzing transaction data in real-time, MEV bots can execute trades such as arbitrage, front-running, and sandwich attacks, allowing them to profit from price discrepancies and transaction sequencing. The transparency of blockchain networks, while beneficial for trust and verification, makes it easier for these bots to operate, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining transaction confidentiality for all users, but asset managers who engage in high volume or high frequency trades on behalf of clients may be at higher risk. According to Flashbots, MEV bots <a href="https://www.tastycrypto.com/defi/mev-bots/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">extract around 500M USD off Ethereum</a> alone per year.&nbsp;</p> Options are limited <p>As of this writing, your options as an asset manager are limited if you wish to preserve your privacy and that of your clients. Many of today’s best-known privacy-enhancing technologies can create regulatory issues. For example, the virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash was infamously sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury and faced investigations and actions from other regulators around the world, due to its involvement in illicit activities. Regulators <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">recognize</a> that there is an opportunity for privacy-enhancement for DeFi trading, and are calling for <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">innovations that can simultaneously preserve the privacy of users while also enabling AML/CFT obligations</a>. It is worth noting that Panther Protocol is being built to address this challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol <p>Panther’s cutting-edge decentralized privacy protocol will empower enterprises with customizable, private operating environments to manage portfolios and assets. Leveraging Zero-Knowledge proofs and a proprietary Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) design, Panther Protocol will deliver a suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p> Benefits For Asset Managers (In development)   Private Portfolio Management Supports confidential client portfolio management, ensuring transaction details and holdings remain private, maintaining investor confidentiality.  Custom Investment Strategies Tailored investment access with specific DeFi applications and asset lists, optimizing returns while adhering to client risk profiles.  Compliance and Reporting Encrypted data storage for transactional details, simplifying compliance and reporting processes with secure transaction detail exports.   Conclusion <p>The transparency of blockchain technology presents both opportunities and challenges for asset managers and financial institutions. While it promotes trust and accountability, it also exposes proprietary strategies to potential competitors and malicious actors. This exposure necessitates that asset managers take steps to enhance their privacy measures and stay vigilant against threats like front-running. Navigating this landscape requires balancing the benefits of blockchain transparency with the need to protect confidential trading strategies.</p>

        <p><a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42406-draft-technical-roadmap-for-the-migration-of-zen-and-eon/648/18">On June 6th, the official ZenIP for the technical roadmap of the migration of $ZEN and EON went live on Discourse</a>, there’s a lot to cover on it, so we wanted to provide a high level overview of the proposal and what it means for the Horizen Ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a high level, Horizen ($ZEN) and EON are currently built on older technology stacks. The Horizen Mainchain is a fork of the Bitcoin C++ codebase with a block time of 2.5 minutes, while EON is written in Scala based on the Scorex SDK with an 18-second block time. To address the limitations of these legacy systems and align with the vision of Horizen as a home for ZK and an enduring utility for $ZEN, Horizen Labs is proposing to migrate to EON 2.0.</p>
 Key Points 
 
 EON 2.0 will be a fully-compatible EVM. This includes backward compatibility to provide a smooth transition for existing $ZEN holders and EON developers, including incentives, emissions, staking, partner integrations, exchange continuity, and EVM compatibility. This means that existing smart contracts on EON will be transitioned over, including $ZEN in current liquidity pools. 
 This is a technical ZenIP, laying out the technical roadmap for the migration mechanics for $ZEN and EON. Tokenomics are not in scope for this ZenIP. Topics such as allocations and emissions are explicitly excluded since they will be covered in greater detail in a separate proposal. 
 It will be a snapshot-based migration, where comprehensive state snapshots of both EON 1.0 and Horizen will be taken to ensure a seamless transition to EON 2.0. We will provide the ability for anyone to independently verify the integrity of both snapshots. 
 For Mainchain $ZEN, there will be a claim process overtime, where eligible users can claim their old Mainchain $ZEN by proving the ownership of their address. As for $ZEN on EON, it will not require any claim, since balances will be migrated with the state snapshot. 
 EON 2.0 will be built using the Substrate framework (written in Rust) with tight integration with the zkVerify protocol (which is also built on Substrate) for fast and cost-efficient verification of zk proofs. Specifically, EON 2.0 will be a parachain connected to the zkVerify Relay Chain. It is not associated with the Polkadot ecosystem. 
 
 Visual Representation of the Migration Proposal 
<p></p>
 Voting Timeline 
<p>Voting for ZenIP 42406 will start on Tuesday, June 18th, 2024 at 12pm EST and end on Friday, June 21st, 2024 at 12pm EST. The snapshot will be taken as soon as the vote goes live. In order to prepare for the vote, please be sure to follow our instructions here: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-vote-on-zenips-using-your-staked-zen/">https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-vote-on-zenips-using-your-staked-zen/</a></p>
 Frequently Asked Questions 
 
 What will be the consensus of the new EON chain?
 
 Delegated Proof of Stake 
 Same as the previous EON chain 
 
 
 Is $ZEN going to be the block reward on the new chain?
 
 Yes, but allocations, emissions, and tokenomics are not covered in this technical ZenIP, but in a separate and dedicated proposal.&nbsp; 
 
 
 If there are no forger nodes, will there be some other type of staking?
 
 Yes there will be staking on EON collators.&nbsp; 
 
 
 What will be EON’s connection to zkVerify?
 
 EON 2.0 will integrate tightly with the zkVerify protocol, ensuring fast and cost-efficient verification of zk proofs.&nbsp; 
 zkVerify will operate as its own relay chain. EON 2.0 will also utilize the substrate framework as a parachain to zkVerify.&nbsp; 
 
 
 What will happen to the Horizen mainchain?
 
 It will be deprecated. 
 
 
 What will happen to my mainchain $ZEN?
 
 $ZEN will be the native token for EON 2.0 
 A comprehensive snapshot will be taken.&nbsp; 
 Eligible users can claim their $ZEN through a claiming mechanism over time.&nbsp; 
 
 
 How will exchanges support this deprecation and migration?
 
 We will work closely with exchanges to coordinate a seamless upgrade.&nbsp; 
 
 
 How will forger nodes migrate?
 
 They will migrate to EON collators, migration steps will be provided. 
 
 
 What will happen to Super Nodes?
 
 They will migrate to EON collators 
 Will be rewarded based on the blocks that they are chosen to forge.&nbsp; 
 
 
 What wallet will I have to hold ZEN in? What will happen to Sphere?

<p>Leo—Brave’s in-browser AI assistant—is now even more useful, thanks to its integration with Brave Search. With today’s release, Leo can incorporate search-augmented responses into its answers, powered by the <a>Brave Search API</a>. This new integration allows Leo to provide more accurate and up-to-date answers, especially for queries related to current events or topics where the initial language model training may be outdated or lack full context.</p>
<p>Brave Leo with Brave Search results is now available to desktop users with today’s 1.67 browser update, and will be coming to mobile platforms very soon.&nbsp;</p>

 The benefits of real-time Web data in your AI assistant, and how to get started 
<p>There are countless instances where you might need real-time information incorporated into your conversation with Leo. For example, if you ask Leo about upcoming events like concerts or sporting events, it can now reference Brave Search results to supplement its response with the timeliest news and information. Or, if you’re researching a complex topic like financial markets, Leo can weave in current data and insights from credible sources to give you a well-rounded perspective.</p>
<p>Importantly, any Leo response that incorporates search results includes links to Brave Search to explore more results, and in an upcoming release will also include links to the sources used to inform the answer. This helps you understand the source of the answers you receive, and fact check before you proceed.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Asking Leo “What are the latest reviews for Inside Out 2?”</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Asking Leo “When is Game 4 of the NBA Finals?”</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Asking Leo “What’s happening with the stock market today?”</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on-page chat experience, desktop users can click  in the sidebar, while mobile users can tap “…” (iOS) or “⋮” (Android) and then tap Leo to get started.</p>
<p>While Leo’s search integration provides valuable context, it’s still important to verify information from third-party sources, especially for critical topics. Brave encourages users to think critically and fact-check key claims against authoritative sources. For this reason, answers that incorporate information from Brave Search are clearly labeled, and include a link to a search results page (SERP) where you can investigate further.</p>

 AI assistance that’s both smart and privacy-protecting 
<p>By seamlessly blending contextual search results into natural conversations, Leo offers a uniquely powerful yet privacy-preserving AI experience. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo never uses your chats for model training and no account or login is required to use Leo. Additionally, Leo includes some specific privacy protections, including:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as IP address). Responses generated with Brave-hosted models are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training; no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 
<p>For an added layer of privacy, you can clear all local Leo data stored on your device through the Settings menu.</p>
<p><a>Learn more about Leo and data privacy in our Privacy Policy.</a></p>

 Using Brave Search to build your own AI applications 
<p>Want to connect your AI to the Web? The Brave Search API allows any developer to integrate Brave Search results into their applications. The Brave Search API provides access to an index of billions of pages via Brave’s privacy-preserving Web index, for building everything from search engines to AI apps. <a>Learn more</a>.</p>

   Over the past decade, usage-based pricing has soared in popularity. Why? Because it aligns cost with value, letting customers pay only for what they use. But, that flexibility is not without issues - especially when it comes to predicting revenue. Fortunately, with the right process and infrastructure, your usage-based revenue can become more predictable than the traditional seat-based SaaS model.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>First and foremost, thank you to the community of over 3000 testnet users who have been testing and sharing valuable feedback. Your continued support and patience are critically important to our mission.</p><p>Testnet Stage 5 is now complete, and it provided us with valuable insights, resulting in several updates to our codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 6 of our testnet is live. Stage 6 includes simulated fee management, AMM refilling mechanisms, simulated limited subsidy rewards, onboarding enhancements using a bundler service, and several technical improvements to our testing environment.</p><p>Note: Panther’s test network is now live on Amoy, Polygon’s test network, and can be accessed <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>. Due to this network change, users will need to complete the onboarding process again and activate their test zAccount. Users who are using their old accounts, however, will not have to go through PureFi credential process again and will be moved directly to the account activation. This is a one-time activity required to access Panther.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Getting started with Stage 6 <p>To start testing Stage 6, visit <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> for the updated dApp test link and follow the steps. Here are some of the features you can look forward to testing in Stage 6:</p><p>Fees<br>This release introduces the mechanism for charging different types of fees within the simulated testnet, including Protocol Fees, Network Gas Fees, KYT fees and KYC Fees. All simulated fees are paid from the Panther Gas account in tZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>AMM Refilling with Protocol Fees<br>Simulated protocol fees collected during the testing will be deposited into the AMM’s pool of tZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>Limited Subsidy Rewards<br>The production (mainnet) version of Panther Protocol will include a feature that will allow to introduce additional rewards to partially or fully compensate costs like Network Gas Cost, KYC, KYT and Miner fees, in service of encouraging use of the platform. Stage 6 of our testnet simulates this feature for testing purposes. </p><p>Note: This feature is designed to cover only tZKP-nominated fees, and will not involved test MATIC or other native test network tokens unless using the relayer service.</p><p>Note: As the protocol developer, Panther Ventures Limited is resuming the testnet after re-deployment on Amoy. Panther Protocol Foundation is finalizing the details of the reward mechanism and will ensure that testers are rewarded proportionally to their efforts and we expect all incentives will be distributed via airdrop. This blog will be updated with more specifics in the coming days.</p> <p>Disclaimer</p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, tZKP, tzZKP, tPRP, test MATIC, and any other tokens mentioned in this announcement or within the product are for testing purposes only and have no economic value, nor can they be exchanged for value.&nbsp;</p><p>Participation on our incentivized Testnet versions may result in you earning rewards, but such credits are not represented on any blockchain as tokens.</p>

         Overview 
<p>This document will outline the various changes that were introduced with the 1.4 update. It will provide a list of areas you should be aware of and also instructions on how to update your forger with new capabilities.</p>
<p>In version 1.4, we’ve improved the usability of the staking system at the protocol level by automating the reward distribution among the forger hosting provider and the ZEN holders who stake their ZEN to the forger node. Forgers are now able to designate a smart contract that will allow delegators to claim rewards. The percentage of the forger’s incomes redirected to the smart contract will be declared by each forger when first registering.</p>
<p>Horizen will provide a factory contract that can be used to distribute rewards to forgers, although any contract can be used. The smart contract provided will distribute rewards proportionally to delegators according to the amount they stake. </p>
<p>Version 1.4 also introduces a minimum staking requirement (10 ZEN)&nbsp; to forgers for security best practices.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that no changes need to be made by existing forger nodes, 100% of the forger incomes will continue being sent to the reward address specified by the forger as it does currently. Otherwise, you can designate a smart contract for reward distribution (instructions provided within this document).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EON 1.4 hardfork will happen on Thursday, June 27th at Epoch 1593 (16:55pm UTC)</p>

 Changes in Stakes Management 
<p>Please review the following information to understand the changes that occurred with this update. This is important for those of you running forger nodes as some functionality has changed.</p>
<p>A new native smart contract will be available to manage stake-related operations. It will be available at the address 0x0000000000000000000022222222222222222333. Full documentation <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/nativesc/contracts/ForgerStakesV2.md">of its interface can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The old smart contract exposed at address 0x0000000000000000000022222222222222222222 will be deprecated and all its methods will error if called after the 1.4 hardfork.</p>

 Deploying the Factory Contract to EON for Distribution 
<p>Horizen provides a default implementation of a smart contract handling the redistribution of rewards between forger’s delegators.</p>
<p>If you want to deploy one for your forger:</p>
 
 
 
 Go to the factory contract available on the explorer: <a href="https://eon-explorer.horizenlabs.io/address/0x8604Bb903B7D54F666bA1e75f98045345C63132a">https://eon-explorer.horizenlabs.io/address/0x8604Bb903B7D54F666bA1e75f98045345C63132a</a> 
 Select the Contract tab. 
 Select the Write Contract tab. 
 Connect your wallet. 
 Use the method deployDelegatedStakingReferenceImplementation of the factory:
 
 The required parameters that identify your forger are:
 
 signPubKey 
 vrfKey 
 
 Note that this is split in between two parameters: one for the first 32 bytes and another for the last btye. This is because the vrfkey is 33 bytes of data.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Once the parameters are entered click the Write button. The method execution will trigger the deployment of the smart contract instance.&nbsp; 
 Take note of its address: you will need it in the forger registration step. 
 
 
 
 
 &nbsp; 
 
<p>For further info, you can read the full tutorial on how to setup a forger node here: <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/tutorials/forger_node_setup_guide">https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/tutorials/forger_node_setup_guide</a></p>
<p>If you want to look at the code of the delegated staking contract, it is available at this address: <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon-delegated-staking">https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon-delegated-staking<br></a></p>
<p>This factory contract was audited by Halborn for security best practices. </p>
 Forger Registration and Setting Smart Contract for Distribution of Rewards 
<p>The instructions below are all steps required when setting up a new forger node. If you already have a node, you only need to (optionally) follow Step 2 to assign an EON smart contract for reward distribution.</p>
 Step 1: Registration of&nbsp; Forgers 
<p>Each forger must now register before being able to participate in the lottery and receive stake delegations. This is an additional step compared to the actual flow (so far, was enough to create an initial stake).</p>
<p>The registration can be performed by calling&nbsp; a new http endpoint on the forger node:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/api/transaction/registerForger.md">/transaction/registerForger</a></p>
<p>The method will accept the following parameters:</p>
 
 signPubKey 
 vrfPubKey 
 rewardShare 
 smartContractAddress 
 stakedAmount 
 
<p>(see above link for further info)</p>
<p>Please note that rewardShare and smartContractAddress once set are considered immutable and can’t be changed later&nbsp; (to use different values a forger would have to register new keys, and ask the delegators to unstake+stake to the new key).</p>
 Step 2: Update of a Forger Already Present Before EON 1.4 
<p>Forgers already present before EON 1.4 will not require an explicit registration described in Step 1: they will be automatically migrated and registered.</p>
<p>But please note that if they own a total stake (own + delegated)&nbsp; &lt; 10 ZEN&nbsp; they will no longer be able to forge any block after the 1.4 hardfork activation, and you will need to increase the stake to 10 ZEN or more.</p>
<p>All migrated forgers will have the fields rewardShare = 0 and smartContractAddress&nbsp; = none, meaning they will not redirect any percentage of the reward to an additional smart contract (the same behavior happens in old EON versions).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A method to update these fields is available in the http endpoints:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/api/transaction/updateForger.md">/transaction/updateForger</a></p>
<p>The method will accept the following parameters:</p>
 
 signPubKey 
 vrfPubKey 
 rewardShare 
 rewardAddress 
 
<p>(see above link for further info)</p>
<p>Please note this method can be called only once and only if their value is equal to: (rewardShare=0, smartContractAddress=null). In other words,&nbsp; rewardShare and smartContractAddress once set are considered immutable and&nbsp; can’t be changed (to use different values a forger would have to register new keys, and ask the delegators to unstake+stake to the new key).</p>
<p>Important: for security reasons the updateForger operation will be doable only starting from two consensus epochs after the hard fork activation (25 hours).</p>
 Step 3: Collect Stakes 
<p>Similar to the actual smart contract, the new native smart contract will expose methods to delegate stake to a forger and withdraw them.</p>
<p>delegate(bytes32 signPubKey, bytes32 vrf1, bytes1 vrf2)</p>
<p>The method will fail if the forger was not previously registered (remember forgers existing before the hard fork activation will be considered registered by default).</p>
<p>withdraw(bytes32 signPubKey, bytes32 vrf1, bytes1 vrf2, uint256 amount)</p>
<p>The owner of the stake must be the one sending the tx.</p>
<p>Enough stake must exist, but now will be possible also to partially withdraw the stake.</p>
<p>Amount unstaked will be sent back to the sender balance.</p>
<p>Please note that with the new system the stake handling is simplified, since:</p>
 
 There is no more the concept of “stakeId”. A stake is now just an amount associated with a specific forger and delegator address, that can be incremented or decremented over-time with multiple delegate and withdrawal operations.&nbsp; 
 No additional signatures other than the standard Ethereum-like transaction signature will be required to call delegate and withdraw methods: this allows them to be called easily also from hardware wallets like Ledger. 
 
 Step 4: Reward Calculation&nbsp; 
<p>The same algorithm&nbsp; will be applied at the end of each withdrawal epoch to reward forgers, but the amount previously sent to the forger address will be split in two parts if the rewardShare specified by the forger is &gt; 0.</p>
<p>An additional change has been also implemented in the:</p>
 
 Endpoints /block/getFeePayments&nbsp; 
 RPC endpoint zen_getFeePayments 
 
<p>Their result will keep the same format as now, but will also include the reward paid to the address of the smart contracts (if defined).</p>
<p>We will also detail the amount coming from the mainchain redistribution: to be retrocompatible they will be into additional fields valueFromMainchain and valueFromFees:</p>
<p></p>
 Step 5: Claim of Delegators Rewards 
<p>The amounts directed to the smart contract will have to be redistributed among delegators through the contract. Distribution is the responsibility of the contract implementation. Horizen’s contract provides a fair distribution based on the amount staked and epoch of staking. The default smart contract implementation provided by Horizen exposes a claim method to do it:&nbsp;</p>
<p>claimReward(address owner)</p>
<p>Note that anyone could call the claim method on behalf of the owner (no restrictions on the sender of the transaction).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Documentation on the factory contract is located here: <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0/doc/howto/delegatedstakingcontract.md">https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/development/doc/howto/delegatedstakingcontract.md</a></p>
<p>Any forger is free to deploy its own smart contract. Please read the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/nativesc/contracts/ForgerStakesV2.md">native smart contract documentation</a> for useful methods that could be used inside the smart contract logic.</p>
 Reward from Mainchain – New Rules 
<p>The maximum ZEN amount redistributed to forgers from the special address 0x000000000000000000003333333333333333333 in a single withdrawal epoch is now limited to a maximum value expressed by the following formula:</p>
 
 
<p>MAX_VALUE_REDISTRIBUTED = sum [10% of Mainchain’s block-reward Coinbase of each mainchain block reference included in the withdrawal epoch]</p>
 
 
<p>Funds over the limit will stay in the address balance and will be redistributed in the following epochs.</p>
 
 
<p>For example:<br>Current Mainchain block reward: 6.25 ZEN<br>Number of mainchain block-reference in a withdrawal epoch: 100<br>MAX_VALUE_REDISTRIBUTED = 10%(6.25) * 100 = 62.5 ZEN</p>

<p>Greetings community,</p><p>In this blog post, we’re excited to present a comprehensive list of updates made in May that didn’t make it into the Alexandria update. While these changes may seem minor, we believe in transparency and the importance of highlighting even the smallest tweaks to our application to enhance user experience.</p><p>First on the list is a fix to the bridge button, addressing instances where it would mysteriously “gray out” without warning. Additionally, we’ve streamlined the process by adding sSCRT support on the Shade Bridge page, simplifying the management of SCRT and sSCRT balances. Another significant change includes filtering the swap dropdown by user balances, eliminating the need for manual scrolling.</p><p>Furthermore, we’ve introduced toast notifications on the Shade bridge page to alert users when they lack sufficient gas for bridging operations. Excitingly, we’ve updated the SILK/SHD circulating supply in anticipation of the June 18th upgrade, alongside migrating the Shade API infrastructure to the latest version of Secret Network post successful mainnet&nbsp;upgrade!</p><p>Other improvements include fixing bugs on the portfolio page and updating data feeds for Quicksilver, Stride, and Persistence oracles in light of the Secret Network&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>While this technical rundown may seem brief, we aim to foster trust within the community by providing insight into the ongoing enhancements of the Syracuse upgrade (v0.1) on its journey towards the Shade Protocol private DeFi&nbsp;suite.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/alexandria-unveiled-shade-v2-1-607297bac97b">Alexandria Unveiled — Shade v2.1</a></p> Conclusion <p>In conclusion, the Syracuse v0.1 gets us one step closer to the launch of Alexandria — a significant milestones in Shade Protocol’s journey towards revolutionizing decentralized finance. Inspired by the legacy of ancient Alexandria and the valor of the Spartans, Shade Protocol stands as a beacon of innovation and financial autonomy in the decentralized landscape.</p><p>With its commitment to privacy, ease of use, and continuous improvement through Syracuse upgrades, Shade Protocol is not only shaping the future of DeFi but also empowering individuals to reclaim control over their finances and data. As the community eagerly anticipates the release of Alexandria and beyond, Shade Protocol remains dedicated to its mission of building an unstoppable, decentralized financial ecosystem for&nbsp;all.</p><p>Website: <a href="http://app.shadeprotocol.io/">app.shadeprotocol.io</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p>

<p>Featured image: <a href="https://r2-collectibles.com/">R2-Rewards.com</a></p>



<p>So you’ve got a nice collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). After a few months, you have managed to amass a respectable amount of those little digital wonders. You might have been able to sell one or two, earning you enough for a couple of cups of coffee in your nearest franchised outlet. But as you take sips off that hard-earned coffee and browse through your NFT portfolio, you can’t help but wonder about the value hidden there, just waiting to be uncovered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question is, how to unlock the value in those NFTs?&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 NFT staking: definition 



<p>When they hear the word staking, most people think back to the old Hammer films, when the nefarious Dracula would meet his demise with a wooden stake through the heart. And yes, that is one traditional understanding of the word staking.&nbsp;But it’s 2022 now, and though Count Dracula still roams somewhere down the darkest halls of our dreams, staking now means something altogether more profitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today’s digital context of NFTs, staking is sort of a game of investment/rewards. You commit (‘lock’) your NFTs into a platform or protocol for a set period, and you receive rewards (or other benefits) in exchange for such a commitment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Staking addresses one NFT’s inherent issue: liquidity. Remember, NFTs are tokenized assets that you can sell, trade, or, as we see in this article, stake for a yield. Staking enables earning passive income off your NFT portfolio while retaining ownership.</p>



<p></p>



 Fungible vs non-fungible: an explanation 



<p>For a long time, the concepts of fungibility and non-fungibility had been well outside the layman’s lexicon. But once NFTs entered public discourse, people began to learn more about what these concepts mean.</p>



<p>In short, fungibility means the possibility of using goods, items, or commodities interchangeably because they have the same value. Banknotes or coins, pieces of the same fruit, or a liter of petrol are good examples of fungibility.</p>



<p>Non-fungibility denotes uniqueness. Collectible items, including original oil paintings, baseball cards, art pieces, diamonds, and vintage cars can be considered non-fungible.</p>



<p>It is the latter concept that emerges as most interesting, as non-fungibility carries value, and it is a value that NFT staking unlocks.</p>



Image: <a href="https://r2-collectibles.com/">R2-</a><a href="https://r2-rewards.com/">rewards.com</a>



 NFT staking: how it works 



<p>Unlocking the value of your NFTs through staking is easier than you think. All you need is a crypto wallet and, well, NFTs. The more the better. Then, choose a protocol or a platform to stake your NFTs in, and wait for the rewards, which might be distributed daily, weekly, or in any other fashion. It really is that simple.</p>



<p>NFT staking is akin to yield farming, insofar as you lock a certain amount of wealth (NFTs in this case) and receive a certain percentage of rewards based on the amount staked, the period of time that the NFTS will be locked, and other parameters.</p>



<p></p>



 All about staking rewards 



<p>When you invest in traditional financial products (bonds, stocks, mutual funds, etc.), you expect your investment to produce a certain yield. Equally, the ultimate purpose of staking your NFTs is to get a return – a reward.</p>



<p>But this raises several questions: what kind of rewards do you get? And who issues those rewards?</p>



<p>If you purchase an investment bond, your reward at the end of the investment term will usually be money, a certain percentage based on the bond’s performance, length of investment, etc. The staking rewards system works similarly. You lock your stake in for a certain amount of time and you get rewards. Some platforms might offer a fixed amount, while others might give users different amounts, depending on how many people are participating, and the total size of the rewards pool.</p>



<p>And who pays these rewards? Well, the platform or protocol where you stake your NFTs. Normally, an algorithm would calculate the due rewards based on specified parameters, and the rewards would be deposited into your account at the agreed intervals. Now, what these rewards are, depends on the protocol or platform. Sometimes, you get the platform’s native tokens, other times you get tokens that you can exchange for fiat, and certain protocols issue tokens that can only be used within their own environment (a gaming platform, for example). Always check the terms and conditions when you sign up so you know exactly what rewards you will get, and how often.</p>



<p></p>



 Risk versus Reward 



<p>As with most financial endeavors, returns are never guaranteed and are not entirely without risk. If you put up collateral it means you risk losing that. In the case of a staking system, there are often 2 things to keep in mind. First of all, in most staking systems you will need to purchase a staking key to get started. Buying the key can be seen as an entrance fee to the platform and there are often a variety of keys, ranging from cheap and small ones to big and expensive keys. Of course, you hope to earn your investment into the key back but this is never guaranteed.</p>



<p>Another risk is that the staking platform can be hacked and you may lose your NFTs since they’re not in your custody anymore. While the right permissions setup (along with responsible project owners) can drastically reduce this risk, hacks are and will always be a risk for platforms holding considerable amounts of value.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>NFT staking is a subset of the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It is a relatively new practice in the space, but there already are several NFT management companies that offer staking services, including Zaisan, which launched a <a href="https://r2-rewards.com/">staking platform in collaboration with R2</a>. While there is an inherent risk to using and creating a staking platform, this risk can be minimised by choosing the right partners and using secure setups.</p>



<p>All in all, staking is just another cool utility of NFTs, which are proving to be rather versatile assets that break new ground almost every day.</p>

One of the greatest hurdles in modern science is access to research funding, and DeSci aims to provide a solution through decentralised crowdfunding. In addition, IP rights are incontestably attributed with the help of blockchain technology, as they cannot be altered at a later date.

<p>After <a>nearly 18 months</a> of testing and feedback from initial partners, Brave Search Ads have exited their beta phase and are now available in major markets as part of Brave’s innovative privacy-preserving ad platform. Leading brands such as Amazon Ads Sponsored Products, <a href="https://www.dell.com/">Dell</a>, <a href="https://www.fubo.tv/welcome">Fubo</a>, <a href="https://insurify.com/">Insurify</a>, <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/">Shutterstock</a>, and <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/">Thumbtack</a> are using Brave Search Ads as part of their performance marketing strategies.</p>
<p>As of April 2024, a third of the top search advertisers in the US by media spend are either currently testing or have moved to paid Brave Search Ads campaigns. Since the beginning of the year, 89% of customers who started Brave Search Ads campaigns have continued to advertise in consecutive months.</p>
<p><a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a> is available globally to all desktop and mobile users at <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a>, and is also the default search engine in the Brave browser, which has over 65 million monthly active users. It’s the fastest growing search engine since Bing, with over 10 billion annual queries. For advertisers, Brave Search Ads are a vital new channel to augment their existing strategy, helping them reach highly qualified—but otherwise unreachable—audiences.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
An example of an ad on Brave Search</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m grateful to our partners for their contributions to the development of Brave Search Ads. With their insight, we’ve built a highly effective ad platform that, with time and continued support from global advertisers, has the power to challenge Google’s monopoly on search advertising. We’re excited to be expanding our offering to even more of the world’s leading brands, and encourage industry leaders to try Brave Search Ads for free before committing any paid spend.</p>
<p>— Jean-Paul Schmetz, Head of Search Ads, Brave</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building a better user-first search experience</p>
<p>Brave Search is attracting users who have become dissatisfied with the quality of search results from Google and Bing, as well as those concerned with the invasive collection and use of data by Big Tech. Brave Search offers an alternative to Google’s <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">share of the global search market</a>, which has led them to prioritize revenue generation at the expense of user experience and privacy.</p>
<p>Brave offers a fresh perspective by putting users first and maintaining an independent search index—the only one in the Western Hemisphere apart from Google and Bing. In addition to leading privacy and a streamlined user interface, Brave Search offers powerful features to enhance and customize productivity. These features include <a>Code LLM,</a> for code-related queries; <a>Goggles</a>, which allows users to create their own result filters; and, most recently, an <a>AI-powered integrated answer engine</a> that generates detailed and near instant results with cited sources.</p>
<p>Search Ads are available risk-free for brands in major western markets</p>
<p>Brave Search Ads are now available to brands in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany on a managed service basis. To qualify for advertising, prospective customers must meet a minimum threshold of eligible ad impressions in their desired region. Typically, brands that satisfy this requirement possess robust paid search (SEM/PPC) operations and view Brave Search Ads as a vital component of their continuous performance marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Brave offers up to 14 days of complimentary advertising on Brave Search for eligible brands, enabling them to properly evaluate the Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) before initiating paid campaigns. Ads are sold on a cost-per-click basis, with the rate negotiated on a fixed basis prior to the launch of paid campaigns. Brands can verify their eligibility at <a href="https://ads.brave.com/register/search">https://ads.brave.com/register/search</a> or contact <a href="mailto:adsales@brave.com">adsales@brave.com</a> to discuss search ads.</p>

<p>Today, in Part I of a two-episode conversation, Matt Prewitt is joined by civic entrepreneur and Founder of Project Liberty, Frank McCourt, who is on a mission to reclaim the internet and prioritize human rights in our digital landscape. Drawing parallels between the early public oversight of television and the current state of the internet, Frank highlights the commodification of our data and identities online. He advocates for new protocols and a movement inspired by historical fights against oppression to secure genuine data rights and agency online. As we look to the future, Project Liberty's endeavors may play a crucial role. This interview is a fantastic opportunity to hear more about Frank's thinking.</p><p>Links &amp; References:&nbsp;</p><p>References:</p>  <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/743398/our-biggest-fight-by-frank-h-mccourt-jr-with-michael-j-casey/">Our Biggest Fight: Reclaiming Liberty, Humanity, and Dignity in the Digital Age by Frank H.

<p>NFT Community management can help ensure the smooth operation of non-fungible token (NFT) communities and their future development in <a href="https://zaisan.io/web3-explained/">Web3</a>. The idea is to keep track of community events and developments while keeping the community organised and cohesive toward the project goal. Community management can help to resolve disputes and to show empathy to digital asset owners. Nevertheless, NFT holders are, in essence, shareholders of the project. NFT community management is becoming increasingly more important as Web3 communities grow, and with a strong community, anything is possible.</p>



<p></p>



 Quick refresh: what is an NFT (community)? 



<p>The management of NFT communities is a critical but often overlooked aspect of developing and deploying these digital assets. NFTs are unique tokens on a blockchain that can represent ownership of digital or physical assets. In contrast to fungible tokens, which are interchangeable and can be divided into smaller units, NFTs are non-divisible. Due to their rarity or uniqueness, they are ideal for representing items like art, collectibles, or in-game items with monetary value.</p>



<p>NFT communities are flourishing online spaces where people with a shared interest in NFTs can connect with one another. As the popularity of NFTs continue to grow, as does the number of people flocking to these communities in search of information, advice, and support.</p>







<p></p>



 Why NFT community management is essential 



<p>With a wide range of people with different levels of knowledge and expertise, NFT community management can be a challenge. It is important to strike a balance between providing content that is both informative and accessible to all while avoiding overwhelming newcomers with too much information.</p>



<p>While the technical aspects of creating and deploying NFTs are essential, it is equally important to have a well-managed community around the project. This is because NFTs are often bought and sold in online communities. The success of an NFT project depends on the strength of these communities. For example, an NFT gaming organisation needs players to enjoy the game enough<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/"> to transact in-game assets</a> with one another.</p>



<p>A good NFT community will contain a variety of content that covers the basics of what NFTs are and how they work. Additionally, it includes more in-depth articles and discussions for those with a more advanced understanding. It is also essential to have a protocol for moderating content and managing users to keep the community respectful and welcoming to all. One way is by establishing rules and best practices written on communication channels or creating a tutorial page for newcomers.</p>



<p>With the right mix of content and community management, NFT communities can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in this exciting technology. It can be a fun entry point to the Web3 world!</p>



<p></p>



 3 Tips to create a strong foundation for your NFT Community 



<p>There are a few things that project owners should keep in mind when managing their NFT communities.</p>



 1. Constantly remind people of your vision 



<p>Have a clear vision and communicate constantly with your members. This way, you can keep everyone on the same page and working towards the same goals. Let’s take, for example, an NFT online chess game that allows users to interact with in-game assets and transact them. This creates a <a href="https://zaisan.io/play-to-earn-business-models-games/">Play-to-Earn (P2E) model</a>. The NFT game envisions creating a community where chess players can enjoy the game while earning rewards in the form of digital assets, NFTs and cryptocurrency. It is therefore necessary for a weekly content plan to include benefits and positive facts about NFT online chess, to create rapport and build trust in the project as more players join.</p>



 2. Active moderation is key 



<p>The project ambassadors should be active in the community and should engage with community members regularly. This is essentially getting more experienced people in the community to become a moderator. They should be the ones who are zealously advocating for the project. However, a community manager is needed to push content forward and stay attentive to the market needs.</p>



 3. Get people involved in decision-making 



<p>Finally, it is vital to have a community-centred approach to decision-making. This means that the community should be involved in decisions about the project, such as what features to add or what direction to take the project in. This will lead the project to a democratic system. The funds spent on NFTs are being directed to the project development from a shared decision-making perspective. In practice, this can be done through a voting system or members’ livestream meetings with the project owner.</p>

The Spartan&nbsp;Creed<blockquote>In the digital realm, where Spartans&nbsp;roam,</blockquote><blockquote>We rise, united, to defend our&nbsp;own.</blockquote><blockquote>With shields of privacy, and spears of autonomy,</blockquote><blockquote>We march forth, in steadfast sovereignty.</blockquote><blockquote>Guardians of data, warriors of&nbsp;finance,</blockquote><blockquote>In every byte, we take a&nbsp;stance.</blockquote><blockquote>Our information is not for&nbsp;sale,</blockquote><blockquote>Our sovereignty is not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our dignity is not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our autonomy is not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our property rights are not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our souls are not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>For we are Spartans, hearts&nbsp;aflame,</blockquote><blockquote>In the digital realm, we stake our&nbsp;claim.</blockquote><p>Greetings Spartans,</p><p>The origin of the Shade Spartans is a simple tale — to be a staunch advocate of privacy and freedom inevitably puts you in the crosshairs of those who see our claims to digital sovereignty as a threat to their power. There are those who believe people must be protected at every turn. That security should be prioritized above the human experiment of individualism and experimentation. The powers at be are leaving an entire generation chained to the burden of malicious (not all) regulation. Disdainful pen &amp; paper, stale and unromantic. Uninspired dead documents that stifle human ingenuity, and at worse, diminish&nbsp;it.</p><p>We Spartans.</p><p>We few, we chose&nbsp;few.</p><p>Pushed to the brink, night near&nbsp;extinct.</p><p>In the arena of the digital and physical world we lay it all on the line. We deeply value our dignity. We stake our future on the truth that there is no greater love than this: that a Shade Spartan would lay his security and freedom on the line to protect the future rights of his&nbsp;enemies.</p><p>You see, Spartans fight for the rights of those who oppress us. We fight to remove the chains from those that seek to place us in&nbsp;chains.</p><p>This is what it takes to be a city on a hill — a light in the darkness.</p><p>This is what it takes to have the moral high&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Your rights are our responsibility, no matter who you&nbsp;are.</p><p>We reject the notion that security should come at the expense of freedom, and we pledge to uphold the rights of all, regardless of creed or circumstance.</p><p>The Shade Spartans are inspired by three different sets of cultural icons. The first is Master Chief from the Halo video game series. We are aligned with the never surrender attitude, and embrace the story parallels of humanity versus the dark unknown. We stand against the forces at large that wish to seize and destroy all that makes us&nbsp;human.</p><p>A scene that particular resonates with Shade Spartans:</p><p>In this scene, Master Chief is given the choice: abandon his mission of protecting humanity, or disobey a direct order. He responds with a simple line: “No,&nbsp;sir.”</p><p>Shade Spartans are polite, but firm. Spartans have a backbone, and refuse to give an inch when it comes to commands to surrender our morals and principles.</p><p>Another Master Chief line that resonates with Shade Spartans is: “…asking is not my strong suite…” We are unapologetic about our rights, and we believe that we do not need to ask permission to build technology that protects and empowers our freedoms that are not granted by governments, but rather are inalienable rights that exist within all of humanity.</p><p>The second piece of culture we are inspired by is the ancient Greek civilization Sparta. The ancient Spartans were renowned for their distinctive values and way of life, which were deeply ingrained in their society and culture. Here’s a rundown of some of their key&nbsp;values:</p>  Military Excellence: Spartans placed paramount importance on military prowess and discipline. From a young age, Spartan boys underwent rigorous training in combat skills, endurance, and discipline, preparing them for a life dedicated to military&nbsp;service.  Discipline and Self-Control: Discipline was instilled in every aspect of Spartan life. Spartans were expected to exercise self-control and endure hardships without complaint. This discipline extended beyond the battlefield to everyday life, fostering a sense of self-mastery and resilience.  Courage and Bravery: Spartans revered courage and bravery above all else. Fearlessness in the face of danger, whether in battle or in daily life, was highly valued. Spartans were taught to confront challenges head-on and never back down from a&nbsp;fight.  Equality (among citizens): While Spartan society was hierarchical, with a clear distinction between citizens (Spartiates) and non-citizens (helots and perioikoi), within the citizen class, there was a degree of equality. All Spartiates, regardless of wealth or status, were expected to contribute to the defence of the state and adhere to the same rigorous standards.  Spartan Unity: Solidarity and unity were central to Spartan society. Spartans were taught to prioritize the needs of the community over individual desires, fostering a strong sense of camaraderie and loyalty among citizens.  Simplicity and Frugality: Spartans valued simplicity and frugality in their way of life. Material wealth and luxury were viewed with suspicion, and excess was discouraged. Spartans lived austere lives focused on the essentials, believing that hardship bred strength.  Education and Intellectual Development: While Spartan education primarily focused on physical training and military skills, intellectual development was also valued. Spartan youths were taught to read, write, and engage in philosophical discourse, albeit to a lesser extent than in other Greek city-states.  <p>We believe real change comes from a commitment to individual excellence combined with teamwork around winning battles at large. Your voice matters. Your action matters. How you conduct yourself matters. In isolation, you can achieve a little. Combined in a phalanx of fellow privacy advocates, we become unstoppable. Shade Spartans believe that actions speak louder than words in an era where words are cheap, ideas are manufactured, and where discourse is often controlled.</p><p>The third piece of culture we are inspired by is the modern cypherpunk movement. The modern cypherpunk movement is a decentralized community of individuals who advocate for the use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies to promote individual freedoms and protect against surveillance and censorship. Emerging in the late 20th century, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, the cypherpunk movement was heavily influenced by the rapid advancement of digital technologies and the growing concerns over government surveillance and control in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>At its core, the cypherpunk movement emphasizes the importance of privacy, anonymity, and encryption as fundamental human rights in the digital era. Cypherpunks believe that individuals should have the ability to communicate, transact, and interact online without fear of eavesdropping, censorship, or manipulation by governments, corporations, or other third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Key principles of the modern cypherpunk movement&nbsp;include:</p>  Privacy: Cypherpunks assert that privacy is essential for maintaining personal autonomy and freedom of expression. They advocate for the widespread adoption of encryption tools and privacy-enhancing technologies to protect individuals’ digital privacy from intrusive surveillance.  Cryptography: Cryptography is seen as a powerful tool for securing communications, transactions, and digital identities. Cypherpunks promote the development and use of strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of online interactions.  Decentralization: Centralized systems are viewed as vulnerable to censorship, surveillance, and control. Cypherpunks advocate for decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, which distribute power and control among a network of participants, reducing the influence of centralized authorities.  Anonymity: Anonymity allows individuals to communicate and transact online without revealing their identities or personal information. Cypherpunks support the use of anonymous communication tools, such as Tor and anonymous cryptocurrencies, to protect against surveillance and maintain privacy&nbsp;online.  Freedom of Information: Cypherpunks believe in the free flow of information and oppose censorship and restrictions on access to knowledge and expression. They advocate for the use of encryption to bypass censorship and promote the dissemination of information without interference from authorities.  Open Source: Open-source software is considered essential for transparency, security, and trust in digital systems. Cypherpunks support the development and use of open-source encryption tools and privacy-enhancing technologies to empower individuals and communities to protect their digital&nbsp;rights.  <p>The modern cypherpunk movement continues to evolve and adapt to new technological challenges and societal issues. With the rise of surveillance capitalism, government surveillance programs, and online censorship, cypherpunks remain committed to defending individual privacy and promoting digital freedom in an increasingly interconnected world.</p> Mint Details — May 30th,&nbsp;2024 <p>The launch of the legendary 300 Spartans is set for May 30th, 2024 on Stashh in advance of the June 18th, Alexandria Shade Protocol&nbsp;upgrade.</p><blockquote>WL sale: 50 $SILK<br>Public sale: 65&nbsp;$SILK</blockquote><p>The proceeds will be&nbsp;split:</p><blockquote>50% buying back $SHD from the market<br>50% will be used to provide liquidity for the $SHD &lt;&gt; $SILK&nbsp;pool.</blockquote><p>These proceeds will increase trading liquidity and support $SHD token’s utility within the Cosmos ecosystem.</p><p>Curious on how to join the whitelist?

<p>The massive success of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETF showed tremendous interest from large institutional players. Even despite negative takes in public appearances, behind the curtain, more and more ‘smart money’ accumulate $BTC, either directly or through ETF shares. The same is to be expected for Ethereum, yet uncertainty still looms due to its proof-of-stake consensus model and, ultimately, staking yield. While crypto natives quickly embraced both ETH staking as well as liquid staking, institutions could not justify the higher risk profile and lack of regulatory compliance. Alluvial and Liquid Collective seek to change this and provide ultrasound infrastructure for enterprise-grade security in liquid staking.&nbsp;</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Mara’s background  ETH 2.0 and the current staking landscape  Liquid Collective  ETH ETF and staking concerns  The risks of adjusting staking emissions  Restaking and new opportunities  Institutional staking and risk optimization  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/maraschmiedt">Mara Schmiedt on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/alluvialfinance">Alluvial on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/liquid_col">Liquid Collective on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

And that's going to result, I think, in a renaissance of new kinds of chips that are capable of handling massive workloads of inference on device.</p><p>"We are yet to see those unlocked, but the good news is that open source models are phenomenal at unlocking efficiency. &nbsp;The open source language model ecosystem is just so ravenous."</p><p>More from Anjney:</p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/the-quest-for-agi-q-self-play-and-synthetic-data/">The Quest for AGI: Q*, Self-Play, and Synthetic Data</a></p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/making-the-most-of-open-source-ai/">Making the Most of Open Source AI</a></p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/safety-in-numbers-keeping-ai-open/">Safety in Numbers: Keeping AI Open</a></p><p><a href="https://ai-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/remaking-the-ui-for-ai">Investing in Luma AI</a></p><p>Follow everyone on X:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/AnjneyMidha">Anjney Midha</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/derrickharris">Derrick Harris</a></p><p>Check out everything a16z is doing with artificial intelligence <a href="https://a16z.com/ai/">here</a>, including articles, projects, and more podcasts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find a16z on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

But there’s a problem. One island has wood but little food. They can build rudimentary huts but can scarcely eat. Their closest island has plenty of food but no wood, so they lack shelter. A third island has wood and food but no hay for their animals. Another island is brimming with hay but little coal to light fires. However, the island with the wood does have coal reserves. Then, one day, someone has an idea. Why not build bridges connecting all the islands so all the islanders can share resources? Soon, wood, food, coal, and hay are moving across the islands, and islanders’ business grows tenfold.</p>



<p>Now, imagine each of those islands is a blockchain. Each blockchain hosts a set of tokenised assets, which had remained confined to their blockchain. Why not build bridges across the blockchains so that assets can be easily shared and traded, similar to what the islanders did?</p>



<p></p>



 Cross-chain bridges: a simple solution to a big problem 







<p>In computing environments, some terms can be obscure and non-descript. That is not the case here. A cross-chain bridge does exactly what it says. It is a mechanism that enables the transfer of assets back and forth between two or more chains. Those assets can be tokens, cryptocurrencies, or any other tokenised assets hosted on the chains.</p>



<p>You might be wondering what sort of wizardry this is. Furthermore, you might question how it is possible to move assets between two chains whose protocols, rules, etc. might be completely different. These are valid questions, and here’s the answer. The bridge acts as a neutral zone (a no man’s land of sorts) where the switch occurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An example: two blockchain games, one hosted on an Ethereum chain, the second hosted on WAX. Ethereum uses a proof-of-work consensus protocol, while WAX uses a proof-of-stake one, each with its own set of rules. And each of these games has some cool in-game assets, maps, etc. Each game world features a thriving game economy and has something that the other gaming environment lacks (remember the islanders?) Why not connect the two chains with a bridge and enable asset swapping, so that both gaming worlds (and their in-game economies) expand and grow?</p>



<p></p>



 Exponential growth for GameFi and DeFi environments 



<p>Blockchain has yielded much disruption and innovation throughout its relatively short lifespan, and the <a href="https://zaisan.io/alien-worlds-cross-chain-bridge/">future</a> looks just as innovative and bright.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For some time, this technology has been associated with decentralised finance (DeFi). That is the provision of financial instruments without reliance on centralised intermediaries, such as banks, credit unions, or brokerages. The marriage between blockchain and DeFi has been a successful one,  fostering a new era of financial inclusivity and autonomy.<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/"> </a><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/">According to Statista</a><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/">,</a> there are currently billions held in DeFi environments, showcasing its widespread acceptance and potential for further growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in more recent times, blockchain has spread its area of influence to gaming in the form of game finance (GameFi), combining cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other tokenised assets to create a gaming environment where players can play, trade, and earn.  This development provides players with true ownership of their in-game items and the ability to earn real-world value through gameplay.</p>



<p>The mechanics underlying GameFi are relatively simple. <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/">In-game assets are distributed in NFT form</a>, which guarantees ownership. This is key, as it enables the players to trade these assets as they see fit, sell them to other players, etc. And this is where cross-chain bridges come in. These two-way paths enable these assets to be moved from one chain to another, thus not only safeguarding the liquidity but also enhancing it by facilitating a wider marketplace. By doing this, the player pool grows exponentially, as players can participate in multiple gaming environments without being restricted by the boundaries of a single blockchain.</p>



<p>The same applies to DeFi environments, albeit without the gaming part. Users of different blockchains can have their assets exchanged on the bridge so they can be used on another blockchain. This is sometimes called ‘cross-chain swap.’ It is crucial for building a more interconnected and fluid blockchain ecosystem, where assets can freely move across different platforms, enhancing the user experience and broadening the scope of possibilities.</p>



<p></p>



 Cross-chain bridging with Zaisan 



<p>The benefits of multi-chain bridging are clear. The islanders knew it, and now you know too. Scalability, portability, and a massively expanded user or player pool are just the tip of the iceberg. These advancements signify a shift towards a more integrated, versatile, and user-centric blockchain ecosystem. </p>



<p>As blockchain technology continues to evolve, it promises to unlock even more innovative applications and opportunities, potentially transforming industries beyond finance and gaming, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and beyond. The journey of blockchain from a novel digital ledger to a bedrock of digital innovation illustrates its immense potential and the myriad of possibilities it holds for the future.</p>



<p>Zaisan is a multi-discipline blockchain services provider, including<a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/bridge"> cross-chain bridging hosting</a>. Among many other features, Zaisan offers the possibility of swapping tokens between Binance Smart Chain (BSC), WAX, and Ethereum.</p>

<p>This article explores the critical role of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and other advanced privacy tools in safeguarding user privacy within the burgeoning Web3 landscape, addressing the inherent transparency of blockchain technology and introducing next-generation solutions for scalable, privacy-focused blockchain applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Although blockchain’s benefits are undeniable, the decentralized and immutable nature of open blockchain’s record-keeping creates unique privacy challenges. Blockchain's transparency means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable by anyone. While this promotes trust and accountability, it also poses significant risks to personal privacy if identities can be linked to public addresses and can expose trading strategies for professional investors and other successful traders. Additionally, integrating decentralized applications (dApps) with these technologies further complicates the privacy landscape, as user interactions on one platform can be traced across multiple platforms and transactions.</p><p>To address these privacy challenges, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) emerge as a potent solution, allowing transaction validation without compromising private data. ZKPs, such as<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/"> zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs</a>, are cryptographic methods that allow the validation of transactions without revealing any underlying data, playing a crucial role in maintaining privacy on the blockchain.</p><p>Beyond enhancing privacy, ZKP technology can be instrumental in DeFi contexts, where it ensures that financial transactions remain confidential yet verifiable, believed to be the key to fostering trust and participation in open financial ecosystems. The technology can make transactions more private, ensuring that while the integrity and rules of the transaction are publicly verifiable, the specifics of the amounts and the parties involved in the transaction remain private.</p><p>Relative to non-succinct privacy-preserving proofs, zk-SNARKs can make for more scalable projects compared with, for example, non-succint alternatives such as zk-STARKs. By enabling transaction validation without disclosing or processing extensive data on the blockchain, zk-SNARK technology can be implemented in ways that lessen the network burden. Ultimately the result is a more efficient blockchain, potentially increasing transaction throughput and enhancing overall performance.</p> Other privacy-preserving technologies <p>While ZKPs are pivotal, a broad array of privacy-preserving technologies, including Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multi-Party Computation that are available for Web3 developers:</p>  ​​Homomorphic encryption: Enables computations on encrypted data, ensuring data privacy even during processing.  Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC): Allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function while keeping their inputs private.  Decentralized identifiers (DIDs): DIDs allow individuals to control and verify their identity independently of a central authority, enhancing privacy and control over personal identity data.  Blockchain sharding: Although its primary function is to help scale networks, by dividing the entire blockchain into smaller partitions known as shards, privacy is enhanced by limiting the data each node can access.  Differential privacy: Integrating differential privacy techniques into blockchain applications can add noise to aggregated data, making it difficult to identify individual users while maintaining the utility of the data.  Confidential smart contracts: Leveraging cryptographic techniques to execute smart contracts confidentially ensures that the data within these contracts is not exposed to other network participants.   Tools for enhancing privacy in Web3 <p>The development of these foundational technologies paves the way for practical, user-facing privacy tools in Web3, ranging from enhanced wallets to comprehensive on-chain and off-chain solutions. Some of these tools include:</p>  Privacy-enhancing wallets: These wallets integrate features like stealth addresses and ring signatures to conceal user identities.  On-chain privacy protocols: On-chain privacy protocols like the one Panther Protocol is developing will use zk-SNARK and other privacy technologies to conduct private transactions on public blockchains while preserving privacy.  Off-chain privacy solutions: Off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network for Bitcoin or Raiden Network for Ethereum help scale transactions off the main chain while improving privacy by reducing the on-chain footprint.  Data protection tools: Tools like NuCypher use proxy re-encryption and SMPC to secure shared data among multiple participants without exposing the raw data to external parties.   Conclusion <p>Web3 aims to revolutionize online interactions by emphasizing privacy and control over personal data, while still maintaining the inherent benefits that transparent blockchain technology brings. As this technology advances, it’s critical to develop tools that uphold privacy without compromising transparency. This balancing act involves both innovative technological solutions and stringent regulatory measures, ensuring Web3 can offer transparent yet secure digital environments.</p> For more information about privacy-preserving technologies <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-deep-dive-into-secure-multi-party-computation-mpc/">A Deep Dive Into Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">Threshold Cryptography, MPC, and MultiSigs: A Complete Overview</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bulletproofs-in-crypto-an-introduction-to-a-non-interactive-zk-proof/">Bulletproofs In Crypto – An introduction to a Non-Interactive ZKP</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/">zk-SNARKs vs zk-STARKs: Comparing Zero-knowledge Proofs</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-example-explaining-zkps/">What is a zero-knowledge proof?

<p>1-Please tell us a little bit about yourself.</p><p>Am not shy or modest, but honestly feel anything related to blockchain, decentralization and DAOs is not about an individual, least of all me. But can best be described as literally one of the dinosaurs of the ecosystem. Have an interest in almost anything I don’t understand which is probably how I got into blockchain! Apart from new technology I love (random order) travelling, company of friends and family, food, something to wash the food down with, art, politics, economy, society and sports. A moment of happiness is when coming home after a trip crashing on the couch with a cheese sandwich.</p><p>2- When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>This is a bit of a fluid answer I have noticed, and can change depending on setting. Guess we all like to think we were part of the “smart few” who joined early. Reminds me a bit of when people speak about epic events and stuff: 10 million people claim to have attended Woodstock, yet only 10,000 actually did…. So, there’s that! Anyway, my interested started when Bitcoin tipped $ 100 and thought, well there must be something in it. The actually journey of reading up on blockchain, decentralization and thinking of the wider implications started in 2015. Think the ICO boom of 2017 made me first question and challenge the crypto community and started to make me the decentralization and privacy advocate I am&nbsp;today.</p><p>3- Why the interest in&nbsp;DAOs?</p><p>For me blockchain has always been much, much more than a technology. I always see it as a social fabric, a new way on organizing and managing cooperation. That cooperation I see in a wide context: between organizations, people, computers and a mixture thereof. In a way you could say that after launching the blockchain, the chain will look after itself. People not so much as history shows us regularly. To me the DAO is the core of that cooperation, there where the social aspect of the project comes alive. Perhaps better said as there where community demand meets community supply. And that social aspect can be anything really: cooperation, participation, engagement, involvement in any shape or form YOU choose, be it active, passive, one-off, continuous. That this is possible I find extraordinary, and something that is really missed in today’s society. Say you are really passionate about a specific topic. To express that you need to get involved in an NGO, special interest group, political movement etc. That is a massive hurdle, and assuming you can take that hurdle it is questionable if you can actually voice your thoughts and provide input. And, literally, at what cost? That is where the DAO distinguishes itself, as it provides a vehicle that is permissionless in many, many ways. My passion is to ensure we keep this part of blockchain not only alive but also make sure we develop it into something that meets and suits demand of the ecosystem now and in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>4- Hans, could you share some insights into how PIVX has embraced the DAO model and how it has impacted the project’s governance and decision-making processes?</p><p>To me the crux of a project is how and when decentralization is embraced. Very important to me is that it is not an afterthought, but has been put centre stage from inception. That is something we see in Bitcoin — still a great standard — but luckily also in many other projects, PIVX included. Personally I also believe an important component of a true DAO is to not try to invent the wheel all over again, and to not make it depending on specific people. That is also something PIVX has embraced, and by doing so set a new standard in the ecosystem. An important part of a DAO is governance and specifically its decision making process. That is a bit of an Achilles heel for many projects. Who can vote, who can table an idea, where comes the funding from? In PIVX everyone can develop a proposal, and that is being voted on by the masternode holders. That is in my view still an issue, as I would love to lower that barrier and be able to include an even wider community to decision making. The “1 Coin 1 Vote” system which PIVX uses a variance of is flawed in that sense, but also seems to be what we have for the moment. To me the low key approach and the wide accessibility of the DAO is what keeps me involved.</p><p>5 — What are some notable features or characteristics of PIVX as a DAO that sets it apart from other cryptocurrency projects?</p><p>The route PIVX has chosen — community designed governance — is very close to my heart, and again industry leading. PIVX was very lucky to have really smart people making really smart decision when created. In case you are wondering, no, that wasn’t me: I wish! Community designed governance (CDG) is a decentralized form of governance, where decisions that affect the blockchain and the community are made in a decentralized way. That means anyone can make a proposal, express their thoughts, check the validity and necessity of a proposal making everyone a stakeholder if you choose to be one. But although we sometimes thing governance equals decision making, CDG is much more than decision making. It is a way in where values, beliefs and thoughts come together. Perhaps it can be described as that what gives a face to PIVX. In the simplest terms to me the most notable feature it is Proof of Community.</p><p>6- How has PIVX leveraged the DAO structure to foster community involvement and ownership?</p><p>The already mentioned community aspect of governance combined with the funding structure of PIVX creates an environment that allows wide participation. That is a crucial condition for any project I would say, and often overlooked. Compare this to the corporate world where a company says the customer is key but there is no way to contact them if I want. The infrastructure, the environment needs to be okay first and foremost. PIVX has done that from the onset. Another important component is collectivism: we are all in this because we value decentralization, privacy and feel an alternative tool is needed to facilitate transactions. That collectiveness is a strength for PIVX and is also reflected in the DAO. How else can you have a project operating so successfully by community that is geographically dispersed, often doesn’t each other’s real names, or has ever met each other in person for so many years? That is Proof of Community in&nbsp;actions.</p><p>7 -Given your respective interests and expertise in blockchain, decentralization, and governance, what initially sparked your interest in DAOs and why do you believe they hold significant importance in the evolution of the crypto industry and&nbsp;beyond?</p><p>The DAO isn’t only the face of the project it is also the heart and soul of it. And the DAO needs to be treated as your body: use it or lose it! That sounds like a cheap one-liner, but that is far from my intention. The Proof of Community aspect is something I value, cherish and want to protect and preserve. That combined with my strong personal belief that blockchain is much more than technology alone made me and keeps me involved. I believe that today’s world and society — perhaps better said our way of cooperation, including the current state of democracy — needs a new, fresh approach. Going back to basic way of cooperating, just you and I, peer to peer, making and living by decentralization, only organizing there where it makes sense, is probably something we could use. The good old coop for instance has addressed and successfully resolved many societal issues in the past like housing, financial inclusion and independence and labor issues. It is in that sense also good to realize decentralization isn’t a new and revolutionary movement but is a useful and proven concept combined with technology. That is exciting, and I want to be part of&nbsp;that.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-hans-koning-dao-specialist-and-pivx-advisor-aa1650ff170b">PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on Hans Koning, DAO Specialist and PIVX advisor.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Alexandria Unveiled — Shade&nbsp;v2.1 <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/</a><p>Greetings community,</p><p>At Shade Protocol we build Unstoppable Finance — a world of DeFi that is globally accessible, censorship resistant, privacy-preserving, and easy to use. We believe that privacy is the key to unlocking the full value of a decentralized future. Without privacy, we fail to achieve what DeFi is fully capable&nbsp;of.</p><blockquote>Your Money.</blockquote><blockquote>Your Data.</blockquote><blockquote>Your Decisions.</blockquote><p>Shade Protocol has existed for 2+ years — collectively achieving over $350M+ of trading volume on ShadeSwap, 40M+ TVL (at peak), with thousand of daily smart contract interactions.</p><p>As referenced in <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/the-preamble-road-to-easy-private-defi-b5852fd4e3a2">The Preamble — Road to Easy Private DeFi</a> we have set our eyes on making Shade Protocol the easiest to use private DeFi in all of Web3. Additionally, after much user feedback we have decided to begin bundling multiple features and utilities into single upgrades, empowering upgrade packages to be more meaningful and easier to explain to&nbsp;users.</p> The Upgrade <blockquote>ALEXANDRIA Upgrade will be released June 18th, 2024 at 8:00 pm. GMT&nbsp;+0</blockquote> 1. Analytics Tab - (TVL, Volume, # of trades, fees accrued, PoL, etc.)<br>2. Prices Tab - (historical candlestick charts / line charts / etc.)<br>3. dSHD - (private liquid staking for SHD)<br>4. Silk Analytics V2 - (SILK peg performance, basket performance, etc.)<br>5. New pools - (dSHD/USDC, dSHD/SHD, etc.)<br>6. New SILK collaterals <br>7. Shade Spartan NFTs <p>The next upgrade after Alexandria will be released September 18th, 2024. The name of the next upgrade bundle has yet to be revealed, nor has its features.</p> Analytics Overhaul Early stages of Silk Analytics V2<p>Across the Shade Protocol suite there are countless pieces of protocol data forming a story that has been previously untold. Information such as Silk collateral backing, peg performance data, protocol wide TVL, volume, # of trades, historical staking APY, etc. The Alexandria Upgrade represents a massive leap forward in visual storytelling — representing half a year of infrastructure overhaul empowering in app story telling that will provide the information and data users need to make informed decisions.</p><p>One of the key principles that drive Shade Protocol design decisions is a simple modicum: “…don’t make the user leave the&nbsp;app…”</p><p>As we investigated where users are spending their time to make decisions, we realized that block explorers and Coingecko are the two destinations where many users camp out. With the release of the Shade Protocol transaction history, one of these problem was solved (block explorer).</p><p>This left us with the need to create an in-app Coingecko esque experience:</p>Early stage implementation…imagine mainnet / June&nbsp;18th<p>You can expect with the release of Alexandria to have the ability to seamlessly scroll through price charts &amp; price tables similar to Coingecko — empowering you to make decisions on the fly without needing to open another&nbsp;tab.</p><p>One could even imagine what an overhauled ShadeSwap experience could like in the future with these new features intertwined.</p> dSHD — Private $SHD Liquid&nbsp;Staking <p>One of the key decisions users have had to choose while interacting with Shade Protocol is between the choice to stake or become a liquidity provider with their SHD tokens. With the launch of dSHD, users will be able to enjoy yield from both liquidity providing &amp; from staking — unlocking new DeFi strategies and flexibility previously impossible.</p><p>dSHD represents the first ever LST for a natively private token; yet another first for Shade Protocol. You can expect major pools to be spun up such&nbsp;as:</p>  dSHD /&nbsp;SHD  dSHD/ USDC.noble  <p>Additionally, Shade Protocol is looking to integrate dSHD into a variety of other DeFi protocols throughout the Cosmos — setting up SHD to become the apex private omnichain asset.</p> Ancient Greek&nbsp;Theme <p>The parallels between Greek society, the historical city of Alexandria, and the ethos of Shade Protocol are intriguing and rich with significance. Just as ancient Greece was a hub for innovation, philosophy, and intellectual exchange, Alexandria stood as a beacon of knowledge, blending cultures and fostering groundbreaking advancements in various fields. Similarly, Shade Protocol embodies a commitment to innovation and progress within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, mirroring the spirit of exploration and discovery that defined ancient Alexandria.</p><p>The city of Alexandria served as a melting pot for ideas and culture. Similarly, Shade Protocol embraces the free market of ideas — aiming to build a global ecosystem where financial autonomy is not just a possibility, but a reality for all. Through its upcoming Alexandria bundle release and beyond, Shade Protocol continues to forge a path towards a more equitable and decentralized future, echoing the legacy of the great civilizations that came before&nbsp;it.</p> Shade Spartan “300” NFT&nbsp;Launch Example NFT<p>The launch of the legendary 300 Spartans is set for May 2024 on Stashh — the whitelist (for a randomized chance to be part of the mint) has begun to be developed.</p><p>Curious on how to join the whitelist? Keep your eyes peeled for the following:</p>  Free badge&nbsp;mints  Social media&nbsp;tasks  Telegram &amp; discord active user account selection  <p>Are you an active community member? Your work shall be noticed,&nbsp;Spartan.</p><blockquote>We believe in protecting “Your Money. Your Data. Your Decisions.”</blockquote><blockquote>Those who hold Shade Spartans are participants in the fight against centralization, censorship, and digital encroachment.</blockquote><blockquote>We are the tip of the spear.<br>We are the protectors of privacy.<br>We are Spartans.</blockquote><blockquote>Don’t give them an&nbsp;inch.</blockquote><p><a href="https://stashh.io/collection/shade-spartans/badges?show_templates=true">Stashh - Where Creators and Collectors Connect</a></p> Syracuse 0.1 — “The Floating&nbsp;City” <p>In addition to regularly scheduled bundle upgrades, Shade Protocol will now be releasing monthly Syracuse upgrades starting with 0.1— these are quality of life changes to the Shade Protocol app, smart contracts, &amp; infrastructure that are outside of the scope of official upgrade&nbsp;bundles.</p><p>The first Syracuse release (0.1) is set for June 2nd,&nbsp;2024.</p> Conclusion <p>In conclusion, the unveiling of Alexandria and the upcoming launch of Shade Spartan NFTs mark significant milestones in Shade Protocol’s journey towards revolutionizing decentralized finance. Inspired by the legacy of ancient Alexandria and the valor of the Spartans, Shade Protocol stands as a beacon of innovation and financial autonomy in the decentralized landscape.</p><p>With its commitment to privacy, ease of use, and continuous improvement through Syracuse upgrades, Shade Protocol is not only shaping the future of DeFi but also empowering individuals to reclaim control over their finances and data. As the community eagerly anticipates the release of Alexandria and beyond, Shade Protocol remains dedicated to its mission of building an unstoppable, decentralized financial ecosystem for&nbsp;all.</p><p>Website: <a href="http://app.shadeprotocol.io">app.shadeprotocol.io</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p>

<p>In today’s episode, Matt Prewitt engages in a thought-provoking dialogue with Tahir Amin, the Co-Founder and CEO of the Initiative for Medicines, Access, and Knowledge (I-MAK). Together, they delve into the history of the patent and trademark systems – flaws and all, especially within the pharmaceutical realm. Tahir, drawing from his experience as a former intellectual property lawyer turned reform advocate, sheds light on how these systems have been manipulated by large corporations to prolong monopolies rather than foster invention. He proposes substantial reforms to address these systemic issues, advocating for a fundamental restructuring of the patent system. This insightful conversation highlights the complexities and challenges within the patent system and the quest for a more just and equitable approach to intellectual property.</p><p>Links &amp; References:&nbsp;</p><p>References:</p>  <a href="https://www.i-mak.org/">I-MAK</a>  <a href="https://www.wto.org/">World Trade Organization (WTO)</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests">"Battle of Seattle" | 1999 Seattle WTO protests</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_patent_law">History of patent law - Wikipedia</a>  <a href="https://lawliberty.org/forum/why-intellectual-property-rights-a-lockean-justification/">Why Intellectual Property Rights?

        <p>This quick guide is meant to help you go over the simple steps to vote on ZenIPs.</p> FAQ <p>1. How much voting power do I have?</p><p>Your voting power is a sum of the following criteria:</p>  $ZEN in your EON wallet.  $ZEN in your linked mainchain wallet.  The total amount of $ZEN that was delegated to forger nodes from your EON Wallet.  <p>Please note that Horizen uses Snapshot for voting. This means that your voting power will be a total of the items above at a specific block height on EON. If token values change after that specified block height it will not be included in your voting power.&nbsp;</p><p>2. How do I link my mainchain wallet to my EON address?&nbsp;</p><p>Being that many users prefer to keep their $ZEN on Horizen’s mainchain we’ve made it possible to vote on proposals while keeping $ZEN on the mainchain. Please use the following guide to link your mainchain and EON addresses: <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address">https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Do I have to do anything if I stake $ZEN to a forger node to vote on proposals?</p><p>No. As long as you are using the same wallet which was used to delegate stake, your voting power will include all $ZEN that is staked to forger nodes.</p> How do I vote on ZenIPs using my staked $ZEN? <p>Voting is done on Snapshot using Horizen EON.&nbsp;</p>    Go to the Horizen Foundation Snapshot page: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth</a>  Make sure to join the Horizen Foundation as a member on Snapshot.&nbsp;    Connect your wallet.  Choose a proposal you would like to vote on.  Read through the proposal and look at the possible voting options.&nbsp;  Select a choice, you will be asked to sign a message with your wallet to vote on the proposal (this does not incur any gas fees).    <p>We look forward to the continuous participation of our community and stay tuned as many exciting things are on the Horizen!</p>

<p>As businesses and organisations continue growing and expanding, prioritising environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly important. One way to do this is by implementing blockchain technology into your business. Let’s dive deeper!</p>



<p></p>



 Why Your Business Should Adopt Blockchain for Environmental Sustainability 



<p>Blockchain is a decentralised digital ledger. Blockchain technology allows for the secure recording and verification of transactions without a central authority. This technology can potentially revolutionise how businesses operate, namely by making them more environmentally friendly. By using blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your business can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future. Outside of the obvious benefits for the environment, it can also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/10/why-corporate-strategies-should-be-focused-on-sustainability/?sh=604551947e9f">help propel your business forward in different ways.</a></p>



<p></p>



 How Blockchain Can Help Your Business Go Green 



<p>Multiple ways exist in which blockchain technology can help your <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">business go green</a>. Summarised below are some of the main ways in which blockchain technology can make an impact:</p>



 
 Tracking and verifying environmentally responsible practices 



 Facilitating the exchange of renewable energy 



 Blockchain-powered waste management systems 



 Creating and managing carbon credits 
 



 Using Blockchain To Track and Verify Environmentally Responsible Practices 



<p>One way that blockchain can help is by enabling the tracking and verification of environmentally responsible practices. For example, by using blockchain technology, a supply chain can track the origin and journey of products, ensuring that they are produced using sustainable methods.</p>



<p>This level of transparency can help consumers make more informed choices about the products they purchase. Moreover, it encourages businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices to maintain their reputation. Additionally, the use of blockchain can help businesses detect and prevent fraud, such as the sale of counterfeit or environmentally damaging products.</p>



<p>In this way, blockchain can help promote environmental responsibility and sustainability within the business community. By enabling more transparent and accountable business practices, blockchain technology can support the development of a more sustainable and environmentally friendly economy.</p>



 Facilitating the Exchange of Renewable Energy Using Blockchain 



<p>Blockchain can also be used to facilitate the exchange of renewable energy. It ensures renewable energy can be tracked, traded, and sold securely and transparently. This can help create a more efficient and reliable renewable energy market, as well as enable individuals and businesses easy access and use renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the use of smart contracts on the blockchain can automate the process of buying and selling renewable energy. This makes it even more convenient and efficient. Overall, the use of blockchain in the renewable energy industry can greatly accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy system that is less reliant on fossil fuels.</p>



 Using Blockchain To Create and Manage Carbon Credits 



<p>Another way in which blockchain technology can help businesses become more environmentally friendly is by enabling the creation and management of carbon credits. Carbon credits are a way for businesses to offset their carbon emissions by supporting renewable energy projects or other initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



Source:<a href="https://www.shell.com/business-customers/trading-and-supply/trading/shell-energy-europe/clean-energy-solutions/voluntary-carbon-credits.html"> Shell </a>



<p>Through blockchain, businesses can create and trade carbon credits transparently and securely. This allows for the efficient and cost-effective management of carbon emissions. It provides businesses with a way to offset their environmental impact. Furthermore, blockchain can help ensure the integrity and verifiability of carbon credits, making it easier for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.</p>



<p>Overall, the use of blockchain for carbon credit management can support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Therefore, it can help businesses reduce/offset their environmental impact.</p>



 Blockchain-Powered Waste Management Systems 



<p>In addition to the previous benefits, blockchain technology can also help improve supply chain efficiency, reducing waste and enabling more transparent and accountable business practices through creating decentralised waste management systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a decentralised waste management system, blockchain can be implemented to track and verify the disposal of waste materials. This can help to ensure that waste is disposed of sustainably and responsibly, reducing the environmental impact of waste. Additionally, one can use blockchain technology to incentivise sustainable waste disposal practices, such as recycling and composting. For example, businesses and individuals could be rewarded with tokens or other digital assets for properly disposing of waste.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the use of blockchain can help to improve the efficiency of waste management systems. By securely and transparently tracking waste materials, blockchain can help to reduce waste and prevent fraud, such as the illegal dumping of waste materials. Thus, aiding in making waste management systems more cost-effective and sustainable.</p>







<p></p>



 Blockchains Do Not Have To Consume Tons of Energy 



<p>But what about the energy consumption of blockchains in general? It is true that many blockchain protocols, such as the one used by the Bitcoin network, rely on energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanisms. This means that validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain requires a large amount of computing power. However, it is important to note that not all blockchain protocols operate this way.</p>



<p>There are also blockchain protocols that use different kinds of consensus mechanisms, such as the delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is much more energy efficient. In a delegated proof-of-stake system, the token holders are constantly voting on “delegates”. The delegates who have the most votes at any certain point in time run the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>As a result, delegated proof-of-stake systems are much more energy-efficient and scalable than proof-of-work systems. They do not require a large amount of computing power to validate transactions. This makes them a more <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">environmentally friendly and viable option for businesses and organisations</a> that want to use public or private blockchains and require high scalability.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Implementing blockchain technology into your enterprise may require significant investment and resources. However, the long-term benefits of environmental sustainability and improved efficiency are well worth the effort. By utilising blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your enterprise can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>Long regarded as an impending black swan, Tether has successfully weathered out the contagion and bank runs caused by Luna’s collapse in the depths of the 2022-2023 bearmarket. Since then, a large portion of Tether’s reserves has been shifted to treasury bills, which are the closest dollar proxy, positioning Tether among the top 20 holders of T-bills, worldwide. However, navigating the Tether FUD was not the first rodeo for Paolo Ardoino, as he has also previously led Bitfinex, which successfully recovered after a $72M hack, back in 2016. The worldwide adoption of USDT, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, serves as a testament to Tether’s commitment to create a product with tangible real-life applications.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Paolo’s background  How Bitfinex succeeded  DEX vs. CEX UX  Entrepreneurship and company culture  Founding Tether and its use cases  Expanding Tether’s cross-chain support  Tether’s reserves and long-term vision  Stablecoin wars: BUSD &amp; USDC  Decentralized stablecoins and bank runs  The potential of diversifying physical backing  Holepunch &amp; Keet - the P2P renaissance  Incentivising P2P interactions  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino">Paolo Ardoino on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/tether_to">Tether on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/bitfinex">Bitfinex on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/holepunch_to">Holepunch on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/keet_io">Keet on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Please tell us a little bit about yourself.</p><p>I’m Cryptosi, from the UK, been in Crypto since 2012 mostly interested in DAOs, Privacy and NFTs. Away from Crypto I’m a huge Arsenal FC fan and enjoy spending endless hours playing video&nbsp;games.</p><p>When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>Got into crypto currency in 2012, came across it while delving into different apps on linux and the power of open source software I was looking into the most popular open source projects and I found Bitcoin as one of them, marrying the power of decentralisation with the importance of money was a no brainer and I was immediately hooked.</p><p>Why the interest in&nbsp;DAOs?</p><p>My interest in DAOs formed after the split of PIVX from Dash, I was sure Dash had come to the right decision by prioritising regulatory fears over privacy, but I was frustrated that none of the coin holders were polled infact there still is not any proper ways to poll stakeholders within a network, I’m fascinated by the concepts and opportunities around finding concensus in private and decentralised networks and applications.</p><p>CryptoSi could you share some insights into how PIVX has embraced the DAO model and how it has impacted the project’s governance and decision-making processes?</p><p>PIVX is unique in that its one of the few DAOs in the industry which is truly DAO led, especially now that there is not 1 recognized CORE team. The DAO is self sufficient and has been funding it’s own development for years. There have been some amazing progressions within the DAO itself such as the alliances protocol which remains the only Decentralised partnerships protocol in the world. There is still plenty of work to be done improving the voting model, factors such as one coin one vote and masternode only voting need to be addressed.</p><p>What are some notable features or characteristics of PIVX as a DAO that sets it apart from other cryptocurrency projects?</p><p>The main notable characteristic is the community, as the coin is so well aged the community all have plenty of experience working within a DAO, this means that drama around proposals is thinning out and people are finding ways to identify their common interests and overcome their differences, this is also allowing people who wouldnt usually be found in cutting edge tech startups to thrive, regardless of nationality, age or political leaning, everyone is seemingly gettin a fair crack of the whip within&nbsp;pivx.</p><p>How has PIVX leveraged the DAO structure to foster community involvement and ownership?</p><p>PIVX uses the DAO structure to incentivise engagement from various corners of the globe by funding marketing initiatives and tutorials by people from all over the world, in the past PIVX had a huge translations team and ambassador program which was very successful in fostering grass roots engagement and getting people to bring PIVX into their local communities, this is super evident within the Latam and portuguese communities.</p><p>Given your respective interests and expertise in blockchain, decentralization, and governance, what initially sparked your interest in DAOs and why do you believe they hold significant importance in the evolution of the crypto industry and&nbsp;beyond?</p><p>DAOs are the best way to harness the collective experience and intelligence of the community or the crowd, but also and possibly more importantly they allow a clean and open way to identify stars and mavericks and promote them to powerful positions within the organisation regardless of their so-called ‘experience’, ‘professionalism’ and sometimes purely on their&nbsp;merit.</p><p>Many thanks to Cryptosi for sitting down with leacymck for this interview.</p><p>To learn more about Cryptosi, an awesome former member of PIVX, founder of Bidify.org and co-founder of Smartreach1, please find him on Twitter at Crypto_SI</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-cryptosi-dao-specialist-da11bffa3188">PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on Cryptosi, DAO Specialist.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>Improvement proposals are made to enhance an existing process, address a challenge, or create a new product or service. Their only goal is improvement. At Horizen we call them ZenIPs or EONIPs, depending on the blockchain to which they pertain. Since September 2023, they are voted on by the community</p>



 From improvement proposals to DAOs 



<p>Improvement proposals can be submitted by anyone in the community: team members, users, or community participants.</p>



<p>Improvement proposals have been part of Horizen’s governance since the project’s inception, but with the launch of Horizen DAO in 2023, public voting on ZenIPs afforded greater community participation in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This ZenIP process embodies to the spirit of decentralized governance – anyone in the community can submit a proposal, and proposals require sufficient support from the community to be adopted.</p>



<p>However, it is incumbent upon community members to ensure that they have understand the improvement proposal process to wield this power responsibly. This article aims to help everyone understand that process.</p>



 Take part in Horizen 



<p>You have many ways to be included in the Horizen ecosystem. By deploying on <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/">EON</a>, deploying on <a href="https://www.horizen.io/zendoo/">Zendoo</a>, marking PRs on <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial">Github</a>, hosting a <a href="https://www.horizen.io/supernodes/">Super Node</a>, hosting or delegating a <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/staking/run_a_forger_node/">Forger Node</a>, etc.</p>



<p>You can also submit proposals, and vote on proposals already submitted. First, let’s see what you need to do to make a proposal.</p>



<p>The whole process is exhaustively published on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance">Horizen’s docs website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2 kinds of proposals can be made:</p>



 
 Technical ZenIP/EONIP 



 Non-techinal ZenIP/EONIP 
 



<p>Technical proposals cover changes involving core technology or the governance of the Horizen DAO, and as such have higher thresholds for submitting proposals and achieving a vote quorum. Non-technical proposals cover everything else, such as grants or making agreements with third-party service providers.</p>



<p>The Horizen Foundation and its partners, such as Horizen Labs, can help build and scope the proposals but don’t need to develop the ideas themselves. If you are proposing a technical ZenIP, make sure you can develop the idea or have it developed after scoping the work.<br>Since <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42401-updating-proposal-and-quorum-thresholds/440?u=manon">ZenIP 42401</a> passed in March 2024, the threshold and quorum are determined as the following:</p>



TypeThreshold (to post)Quorum (vote to pass)ExamplesTechnical100,000 ZEN&nbsp;<br>(previously 200,000)5%<br>(previously 10%)Removal of privacy, mainchain and sidechains improvementsNon-technical25,000 ZEN<br>(previously 100,000)3%<br>(previously 5%)Website branding, next meetups location, grant program



<p></p>



 What are the different phases from the idea to its implementation? 



<p></p>







<p>Phase 1: Proposal Idea and Research</p>



<p>Broadly speaking, the idea stage is intended to introduce an idea for a potential improvement proposal and gauge community sentiment. The idea stage is made of the first three phases of the ZenIP process.</p>



<p>In the first phase, a community member who has an idea for an improvement proposal should research it and verify whether the concept or similar proposals have previously been explored or suggested.</p>



<p>This phase places the onus entirely on the proposer(s). It is strongly advised to support the proposal with relevant sources whenever possible thoroughly.</p>



<p>Phase 2: Idea Modification</p>



<p>Once a proposer has confirmed that the idea has not been proposed and has completed sufficient research, they publish an idea on <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/c/governance/zenip-discussion/6">Discourse</a>. We recommend using the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_template.md">ZenIP/EONIP template</a> for this phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phase 3: Community Feedback</p>



<p>Once an idea is posted on Discourse, the community provides feedback.&nbsp; This phase lasts a minimum of 7 days to ensure sufficient input from other community members. It is important to note that a ZenIP idea is just that – an idea – until put forth as a formal ZenIP.</p>



<p>Phase 4: Proposal Draft Creation</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_template.md">template</a>, the idea must be posted on Github or under the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/c/governance/8">“governance” section on Discourse</a>. In this phase the use of the template is mandatory. The proposal is on the DRAFT status.</p>



<p>Phase 5: Draft Review and Moderator Feedback</p>



<p>The person or people making the proposal have 30 days to answer any moderator’s questions, if any. This delay can be shortened by the moderators.</p>



<p>Phase 6: Administrative Review</p>



<p>The <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-dao-voting-is-open-and-announces-inaugural-special-council-members/">Special Council</a> reviews the proposal, with a maximum of 3 revisions. The DAO Special Council can ask for more clarifications or additional information.</p>



<p>Phase 7: Voting</p>



<p>The vote takes place on <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a>, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting platform. You’ll need to follow up on the <a href="https://01470710.evm-documentation.pages.dev/governance/overview/constitution">threshold requirements</a> to post the proposal. The status is moved to PROPOSED.</p>



<p>Phase 8: Cooldown Period</p>



<p>A final 30 days phase commences. The proposal undergoes another review to confirm compliance with the Foundation’s Governing Documents and relevant laws.</p>



<p>Phase 9: Implementation</p>



<p>The idea becomes real. If the technical ZenIP/EONIP includes codes implemented on Github, the PR is merged. If the proposal is budget-related, the necessary funds are transferred. Status is either IMPLEMENTED or FINAL if the idea is also activated on the network.</p>



<p>Foundation moderators or DAO members must remain informed and involved throughout.</p>



<p>It’s possible to delegate voting power on Snapshot, when you publish the ZenIP IDEA or DRAFT, you can create a second topic to ask for delegated funds to post the proposal.</p>



 ZenIP naming convention 



<p>The revised ZenIP numbering conventions will use a format starting with “424” followed by two unique, sequential digits. Once the number 42499 is reached, the numbering will continue starting from 42500 onwards. This system ensures a cohesive and orderly sequence for all ZenIPs, maintaining a straightforward approach to their identification and categorization.</p>



<p>For the previous ZenIPs, editors used the following conventions when numbering ZenIPs:</p>



 
 All ZenIP numbers are prefixed with a 42 and followed by three digits. E.g. his very first ZenIP has the number 42000. 



 If a ZenIP directly corresponds to a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) or ZIP (Zcash Improvement Proposal), the same number is used, but without the prefix “42”. 



 Process and Informational ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42000 to 42199. 



 Consensus ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42200 to 42399. 



 Standard Track ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42400 to 42599. 



 ZenIPs that should or will be deployed together will be numbered consecutively (wherever possible), and in a coherent reading order. 
 



<p>These conventions are subject to change by a majority decision of the Editors.</p>



 Express yourself through the vote 



<p>Your vote will be weighted regarding the tokens you hold on the Horizen mainchain (the historic one) and/or the Horizen EON chain (the EVM chain).</p>



<p>The vote happens on Snapshot and is done through MetaMask and therefore via the Horizen EON network.</p>



<p>Before going through the tutorial, we assume that the Horizen EON network is well configured on your MetaMask wallet. If not, <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">please follow this guide</a>.</p>



<p>If you already linked your address for a previous vote, then it’s very simple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We still advise you to verify if your mainchain address is well-linked on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance app</a>.</p>



<p>If your address is not linked, <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-improvement-proposals-how-to-vote-tutorial/">follow the tutorial here</a>.</p>



<p>When linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>

The company’s first product is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) for the US Department of Defense. Traditional defense primes such as Lockheed &amp; Raytheon have failed to develop an HGV despite receiving billions of dollars per year in funding for the last 20 years. Meanwhile, China &amp; Russia have developed fully operational HGVs, emboldening them to expand their borders militarily.</p><blockquote>“To counter this growing threat, and to support democracy for generations to come, America’s defense industry needs new technologies, new manufacturing approaches, and new ideas to stay unequivocally ahead. That’s why we founded Castelion — a new kind of defense manufacturing company.”</blockquote><p>The Castelion team comes from SpaceX, where they made substantial contributions, including leading the development of Starlink &amp; Starshield, and billions of dollars in sales to governments.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Incumbent defense primes will be unable to attract the necessary talent to iterate fast enough to keep up with adversary nations on hypersonic glide vehicles. The SpaceX approach provides the best odds of liberal democracies catching up technologically while also providing venture-scale returns. If Castelion is successful at delivering a cost-effective HGV, they have the potential to apply its development methodology and team to more US Department of Defense capabilities and become a large standalone defense&nbsp;prime.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the Castelion team on their mission to build essential hypersonic deterrence systems to keep democracies safe.

Don’t worry, we have you covered. Read our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/alpha-protection-through-privacy-a-web3-privacy-primitive-for-defi/">latest blog</a> for a recap.&nbsp;</p> Panther’s CTO, Anish Mohammed, on Proof of Podcast <p>This week, our Co-Founder and CTO, Anish Mohammed, joined Hake from the <a href="https://twitter.com/ProofOf_Podcast/status/1780734964742390235?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Proof of Podcast </a>to discuss tokenomics design and cryptography.</p> Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, at ETH Dam <p>Our Co-Founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, was on the stage at Crypto Canal’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP6LxjQxdIo&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ETHDam</a> on April 13 to share his insights on alpha protection through privacy for DeFi users.</p> Product updates.  Testnet re-deployment on Ethereum Sepolia <p>As the Mumbai testnet has ceased operations, Panther will deploy the testnet to Ethereum Sepolia network next week. We will publish more details on how to test and receive test rewards on Sepolia in our docs next week.&nbsp;</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management and basic disclosures. Development for Stage 6 is complete and currently under testing. The team plans to release Stage 6 for community testing later this month.&nbsp;</p> Stage 7 development <p>Stage 7 of the testnet dApp includes DeFi swaps, advanced disclosures, other supported assets, and canary deployment (use of real tokens). The team is working on Stage 7 parallel to Stage 6 and Enhancement Stage 2.

<p>Did you miss Panther co-founder and CEO Oliver Gale’s presentation at last week’s ETHDam conference? Don’t worry, we have you covered.&nbsp;</p><p>The session, “Alpha Protection Through Privacy: A Web3 privacy primitive for DeFi,” explored the $2.6T problem of open blockchain privacy and Panther Protocol’s solution. A recap of the presentation follows.&nbsp;</p> Pseudonymity: A $2.6 trillion problem <p>Open ledgers are supposed to be a good thing. They help to ensure that users can’t commit fraud, prevent duplicate transactions, and more. All of these things are true and important, but until now, they have come at the expense of another basic human need: privacy. On pseudonymous blockchains, if a third party can link a wallet address to a user, they can follow, measure, and use the complete transaction history associated with that wallet address. Every transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>This is wrong. Although we recognize blockchain technology’s enormous benefits, financial privacy should be a fundamental human right.&nbsp;</p><p>And it’s a huge problem. Of the approximately $2.6 trillion invested in crypto, all but a relatively tiny amount is on public blockchains.&nbsp;</p> Your Data is YOUR Data <p>The problem with pseudonymous blockchains goes beyond third parties monitoring your spending habits: your data is valuable– and it should be YOUR data. Europe’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> reflects a broader shift in how we perceive ownership of information. Just as it set a benchmark for consumer privacy and control, DeFi users should have ownership of their data both as a personal matter and because there is value in your data.&nbsp;</p><p>This is especially true for high-volume traders and institutions, who risk having others copy their trades, their “alpha,” and their strategy.&nbsp;</p> The “solution” created a new problem. <p>The reaction to this problem to date has been the creation of privacy protocols, which sever the link between wallet and on-chain public ledger, using a variety of technologies. Unfortunately, this causes a new problem: compliance hurdles. Tornado Cash is a prototypical example of how severing the link between the public chain and wallet alone is not a viable solution to privacy. Tornado Cash has been accused of facilitating money laundering and sanctioned by the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">U.S. Treasury</a>, among actions from other regulators. If DeFi is going to welcome a new era of mainstream adoption, it is clear that privacy protocols also need to enable compliance. In fact, regulators, including the U.S. Treasury have specifically <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">called this out as a market need</a>.&nbsp;</p> Market requirements for any solution <p>Greenfield Capital’s <a href="https://greenfield.xyz/2023/11/22/reviving-transaction-privacy/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Report on Reviving Transaction Privacy: Approaches To Combat Compliance And Usage Challenges</a> covers this exact issue. In the report, they recognize the enormous potential of removing a major obstacle to mainstream DeFi adoption by enabling compliance and privacy simultaneously. They state that any such solution would need to keep bad actors from abusing the system, especially through KYC, and that it would need to navigate regulatory ambiguity, given that regulatory requirements may vary from one jurisdiction to another, giving the Travel Rule as an example. The Travel Rule is a regulatory mandate by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization formed by the G7 to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, which requires cryptocurrency exchanges and other virtual asset service providers to share specific transaction details of the parties involved in transfers​.</p><p>Greenfield also points out that success for any protocol hinges on:&nbsp;</p>  Providing sufficient value relative to any fees associated with its use (keeping gas relatively low).  Ensuring there is a large enough anonymity set to keep transactions private.  Integration with existing DeFi protocols: Users are unlikely to use protocols that don’t enable use across the most popular tokens and chains.&nbsp;   Enter Panther Protocol <p>Panther Protocol will add a privacy layer to blockchain transactions and DeFi applications. Using advanced cryptographic techniques, including zkSNARKs, the protocol will provide users with the ability to preserve their privacy while also enabling them to disclose data to whoever they choose. Flagship features include:&nbsp;</p>  Preservation of privacy: Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a> technology will help to preserve your privacy by separating your transactions from the public ledger, safeguarding your identity.&nbsp;  Control over your data: Enable KYC validations without exposing your personal details. Our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-example-explaining-zkps/">Zero-Knowledge proof</a>-based technology will let you choose exactly who can see your identity and transaction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Panther’s DeFi adapters will facilitate seamless integration with existing DeFi protocols, ensuring privacy without sacrificing functionality and allowing users to engage with DeFi platforms while keeping their transactions private.  Decentralized Identity: Your zAccount will act as a decentralized ID that helps safeguard your personal details, allowing you to make crypto transactions while protecting your identity.  Modular and expandable: Zones will offer customization for asset lists, user lists, transaction limits, and DeFi application access.  <p>For more detailed information about Panther Protocol, please click <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-panther-protocol-and-why-it-exists-a3fd4470de55/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Competitive Landscape <p>Greenfield identifies 11 elements that can enable the solution to the issue of privacy in blockchain. Panther’s model includes all of these, with the exception of compliance committees, which is by design and not necessary for Panther’s privacy preservation and compliance enablement.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther is also one of only two projects in Greenfield’s report that includes KYC in its model, which is a requirement in nearly every major jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p> How to get involved <p>If you are interested in helping Panther usher in a new era of DeFi adoption where your right to privacy is respected, we would love you to join us:&nbsp;</p>  Have coding skills?

Thematic Tease<p>Greetings community,</p><p>On May 1st, we will begin to reveal an internal initiative, story, and brand that outlines the future of Shade Protocol. The first two years of Shade Protocol was sharply focused on building the key building blocks for unstoppable finance — a world of decentralized money and products that help people reclaim their autonomy &amp; digital sovereignty.</p><p>The road has been&nbsp;arduous.</p><p>In early 2024 we collectively had a chance to take a deep breathe and reflect. We considered what has been built, how it was built, and why it was built. We’ve built the following primitives:</p>  SILK (unstoppable private stablecoin tracking a basket of currencies &amp; commodities)  ShadeSwap (DEX that protects your&nbsp;privacy)  ShadeLend (private collateralized positions)  Bridge (onboard &amp; wrap public assets into private&nbsp;assets)  Staking (passively earn real yield for securing Shade Protocol)  Bonds (protocol treasury management tool)  Transaction History (examine your private transactions)  <p>A deep analysis left us dissatisfied. This is an absurd amount of product; what is stopping growth? What is disabling our ability to onboard millions into true unstoppable finance?</p><a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-a-helmet-and-a-bulletriddled-plane-perfectly-demonstrates-survivor-bias-60930">https://www.iflscience.com/how-a-helmet-and-a-bulletriddled-plane-perfectly-demonstrates-survivor-bias-60930</a><p>Enter survivorship bias.</p><p>You see, we started noticing a trend — thousands of new users were interacting or checking on Shade Protocol for the first time that never came&nbsp;back.</p><p>It was troubling.</p><p>The brand penetration of Shade Protocol is consistently generating new users, which considering our size is somewhat remarkable. However, when users actually landed on the product suite and tried to start using it we began to uncover a common&nbsp;trend:</p><blockquote>Shade Protocol is too hard to&nbsp;use.</blockquote><p>The core contributors began to talk to users. Hop on calls. We gathered the harshest feedback from the fiercest critics. It gave us the realization that if we continue down the path of building more and more complexity into the product suite, it will go unused. The beautiful, innovative pieces of the DeFi puzzle that have set the stage so well would slowly be wiped off the table of the Free&nbsp;Market.</p><p>Utility without simplicity is unused&nbsp;utility.</p><p>At it’s worst, complex utility is a repellent.</p><p>Naturally, the current users are okay with the user experience. If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be here continuing to use the app. This consumer survivorship bias has perhaps blinded us to the truth of the quality of what we have&nbsp;built.</p><p>Await our next blog post on May 1st, where we reveal the next stage of Shade Protocol’s evolution — a quest for simplicity that will redefine unstoppable finance, expanding its reach in ways yet&nbsp;unseen.</p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">https://t.me/ShadeProtocol</a></p>

<p>Answer with AI is the only large real-time answer engine that puts privacy first and does not rely on Big Tech search engines</p>
<p>Today, Brave is announcing a major update to Brave Search and to how users find answers online. The new Brave Search answer engine synthesizes information from multiple sources into a single, intelligible answer to almost any query—a significant step forward from Brave’s <a>AI Summarizer released in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave Search Answer with AI is unique in several respects:</p>
 
 It is the first privacy-preserving answer engine available at scale, serving the almost 10 billion queries a year that Brave Search currently receives, making it, overnight, one of the largest AI solutions on the market.&nbsp; 
 It produces near instant answers (with sources cited) with sources alongside traditional search results. 
 The answers result from the only independent search index at scale outside of Big Tech, as the largest real-time answer engines rely on the Google or Bing search engines, directly or indirectly.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Brave Search’s Answer with AI feature is available for free to all users across platforms, on both desktop and mobile. No matter which browser users choose, it can be accessed on the Web at <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a>. The answer engine also supports multiple languages besides English. Brave Search’s 27 million queries a day makes it the fastest growing search engine since Bing.&nbsp;</p>

 The need for answer engines 
<p>Web-scale search engines have undergone many iterations: directory listings, ten blue links, query-dependent snippets, knowledge graphs and featured snippets. The Brave Search Answer with AI feature evolves this paradigm. An answer engine is a system that tries to answer a question, rather than point to websites about the question. Thanks to the proliferation and quality of <a>large language models</a> (LLMs), search-integrated answer engines are now a possibility at scale. In fact, several companies that operate search engines have released similar systems (including Bing Copilot and Google Gemini). Other answer engines rely on API access to existing search solutions to serve at least some portion of their real-time results.</p>
<p><a>Brave Search released an AI tool for synthesized results</a> known as the Summarizer in March 2023 to help users better navigate search results. With today’s release, we’re taking a big step forward in delivering a next-level search experience, whether an answer or links of page results.</p>
<p>“With the new Brave Search and its integration of Answer with AI, users get the best of both worlds: one place to get generative answers as well as up-to-date links, providing instant and highly relevant results,” said Josep M. Pujol, Chief of Search at Brave. “Brave Search is uniquely positioned in this landscape, with the only independent search index besides Bing and Google. Unlike many search companies that are forced to rely on results from third parties, or others that solely offer answer engines, Brave now combines its index with AI to redefine the search experience and raise the bar on immediate pertinence in results, while preserving users’ privacy.”</p>

                <p>[00:00:00] Luke: From privacy concerns to limitless potential, AI is rapidly impacting our evolving society. In this new season of the Brave Technologist podcast, we’re demystifying artificial intelligence, challenging the status quo, and empowering everyday people to embrace the digital revolution. I’m your host Luke Mulks, VP of Business Operations at Brave Software.</p>
<p>Makers of the privacy respecting Brave browser and search engine, now powering AI with the Brave Search API. You’re listening to a new episode of The Brave Technologist, and this one features two guests from the Brave team, Josep, our lead at Brave Search, and Remi, the principal engineer at Brave. They joined us on the podcast this week to discuss our Answer with AI launch, which shipped a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Today we dove into how Answer with AI is different from other chatbots, what this innovation means for traditional search, Our privacy policy with this engine, how we’re handling hallucinations. And what the main challenges have been in building this new system. These were the perfect guests to discuss this.</p>
<p>Joseph is the chief of search at Brave and has been working on an alternative search engine since 2014. Before being involved with search, he was a research scientist at multiple institutions, working on AI, distributed systems. And complex networks. He has authored over 30 papers and holds four patents.</p>
<p>He also holds a Ph. D. in A. I. from the Technical University of Catalonia. Remi has been working with A. I. since 2014 and currently as a Senior Software Engineer at BraveSearch, where he has been involved in scaling the ML infrastructure to serve continuously growing traffic and increasingly advanced needs, as well as in the development of BraveSearch’s latest feature, Answer with A.</p>
<p>I. We’re excited to share this update with you and why we’re so optimistic about it. Now for this week’s episode of the Brave Technologist. Remi and Joseph, welcome to the Brave Technologists podcast. How are you guys doing today? Good, good. Very well. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks for having us. Yeah, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Excited to have you back, Joseph and Remi. Excited to have you here for the first time. I think a lot of what we’re talking about today is around this kind of new answer with AI summarizer feature that we just recently released. Remi, how is different from the typical chatbot like chatGPT or, Cloud?</p>
<p>[00:02:11] Remi: Yeah, great question. I think people sometimes kind of oppose them. I think, I mean, my opinion, our opinion is more complimentary. So if you take, you know, chat GPT or cloud, their goal is to build the best model for open ended conversation, you know, like, you know, having multiple rounds with a user on any, topic really.</p>
<p>One issue is that is often the lack of context, right? So like the only context they get is what the user gives them. And then they use the knowledge they have acquired during training to come up with answers, right? I like to think of them sometimes how they are called as foundational models. And I like this term because This is what we are doing.</p>
<p>We are building on top of this model. So they are kind of complimentary to what we do. And with answer with AI, basically what we do is like, we give access to this model, an entire independent search index, which is the brave search index, right? So they have quote unquote, perfect context in a way, right?</p>
<p>So for any user query, they are going to have access to the best information we can find on the web out of billions of pages. And we are going to synthesize this into, you know, the best answer we can, right? Okay. One, maybe like drawback with this approach is it’s off by design, a bit less interactive. So once you have your answer, you are a bit less free in the way that you can follow up.</p>
<p>You know, you cannot just start a conversation and it’s why, I mean, we’re going to talk, I think a bit later about that, but that’s why we’re working on integrating Leo so that we can offer, you know, both experiences, both like best answers, based on the web web, and then also following up in arbitrary ways and, you know, back and forth conversation ways of chatbots.</p>
<p>[00:03:45] Luke: No, it’s great. That’s awesome. And I think Joseph, when we had you here last, I think the summarizer, the first iteration of it had been out for a little bit. We’ve kind of addressed this question too, but I’m just kind of curious, like, as this new update rolls out and continue to see progress on the summarizer stuff, like, how’s your position changed?</p>
<p>Like, you think that, you know, answer engines are going to end up replacing traditional search or, Augmented or end of an era kind of thing, or what was your take on this?</p>
<p>[00:04:09] Josep: I get this question quite a lot. Well, I mean, first disclaimer, I mean, I’m better at predicting the past than the future.</p>
<p>It depends what you mean by replacement, right? Certainly answer engines are here to stay. They will constitute an evolution to search engines. That’s the fact. Are they going to replace them entirely? No, I don’t think so, right? For, like, for many reasons. some, right? First of all, I mean, not all the queries are amenable.</p>
<p>to be answered by an article type answer. We actually know from experience because of Summarizer v1, which was the toned down version of what we just released, the answers with AI, that was released more than a year ago. So we got a lot of data. And we estimate the queries that are amenable to be answered by answers with AI to be between a fourth and a third of the total queries.</p>
<p>So that means that you still have two thirds that are not, what are those two thirds, right? I mean, I don’t know, Bank of America login, NumPy download, Hotmail, the phone of a restaurant. I mean, can they be answered by an answer? Yes, but it’s not the most convenient way. To do it right, in a way, that’s why I don’t believe that answer engines are replacement and your answer engines are just like one extra thing that certain engines will have, right?</p>
<p>The same as feature the snippets or the same as knowledge graphs, right? I mean, and answer engines actually totally subsumed those two, right? But it will not subsume the 10 links and actually it shouldn’t, hopefully, right, because answers are very good, are very convenient, convenience have, have drawbacks, right?</p>
<p>Less choice, less sources of truth. So you don’t, you don’t want an article type answer. At least, that’s what I believe. And in any case, that’s what we experienced and, and that’s, I think that’s gonna be like this for a long time. Also in, and if you actually go more into the technical details, right? I mean, an answer engine needs a search engine nevertheless, right?</p>
<p>Because why are you going to pull the data from my knowledge on the LLMs? I mean, only has training data. So you need a lot of like context. To the rack generation, right? Who is the best search engine to get that context in, but you need to do things like grounding, provide citations. So you need to search engine, right?</p>
<p>Even if if everything was answers, you will just need a search engine. Or an a p to a search engine, right? Which is like the typical, the typical case. And then just lemme elaborate a little bit on, on those two. Yeah, please do. I mean, more like on the, on the strategy of what we want to do at Brave, right?</p>
<p>Just to have answers would not be actually on the best internet of the user in our opinion. Right? Because what we want to do is like an alternative to the big tech, right? So we need to do like a, to provide the same technology and the same specify the same user needs. It wouldn’t be optimal for the user to have, like, this dichotomy where they have to do certain type of queries.</p>
<p>It’s better one system, certain type of queries is better another system, right? People love convenience. When people search, they are not something that they do it for fun. Usually search is because you are doing a task. So you don’t want to do crazy experiments. Your need satisfied as soon as possible, right?</p>
<p>Regardless of the delivery methods, right? So we need to be like, we need to be one stop shop. Unless we are one stop shop, well, we cannot be the default, right? And we all know that the defaults are very important, right? I mean, there is a reason why Google pays 20 billion to Apple every year, just to be the default on Apple devices, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it’s like, so No, I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p>[00:08:04] Luke: It is kind of a silly question too, right? Because I think one of the strengths of, of what we’ve been doing at Brave, that you guys have put a lot of care into, even with the first version of Summarizer, like making sure that things were, the citations were there and linkable and that, you know, and even with this new version, the blue links are there, right underneath, you guys are giving them for the full, like corpus of information they need.</p>
<p>From that summary. And I think that it’s really kind of a cool way that you guys are doing it, where you’ve mixed these two things together, where, when they serve, but I think even to unpack that a little bit, the fact that you all put so much care into just knowing what’s addressable by an answer versus what’s just a great thing to put us a search engine result page in front of, right?</p>
<p>Like, I think that’s even something that, you know, a level of thought that’s going into this that I think a lot of other companies probably wouldn’t apply because we’re thinking about the user like that.</p>
<p>[00:08:52] Josep: That’s a good point. I mean, we, one of the most challenging tasks is like the triggering, right? Like one, two, one, two, like do normal search and one to do like a answer type search, right?</p>
<p>And tell you, of course the user still is on control, but it’s always like a button. And then next to the query box where you can invoke the summarizer. But we try like to, you know, I try to double guess, well, to guess what is their real intent as much as possible again, like, because when I stop shop, satisfy, maximize this satisfaction, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So that’s kind of like, that’s one of the things and something I forgot to mention, which is like, it’s not only that, but for me, it would be better to talk about this, but I’ll do it anyway. I think the normal results on the bottom. We actually put a lot of emphasis on expanding beyond the wall of text.</p>
<p>People have noticed that we actually named entities and we add the structure of information into the generated answer just to understand. You know, like to be more like a friendly to the, not an eye candy, but actually like more like an informational value, right? I mean, that’s kind of like a important thing.</p>
<p>Like take for instance, like a phone number, right? When you don’t want to fish for a phone number on a wall of text, you want to know where it is. And just like, look there.</p>
<p>[00:10:10] Luke: I’ve got a great anecdote on that one too. I, it’s my go to in, business calls. I do now where, I have a feeling the person on the other end is a golfer because actually it was, look, I have these old golf clubs from like 2007.</p>
<p>And if anybody golfs, like when you’re putting a set together, you end up diving into these older sites where you’re like, I hope somebody put it in a HTML table of all of these, like, you know, different lofts and clubs. I actually like. Put it into the answer engine and just put everything in a beautiful table right there.</p>
<p>I knew all the lock degrees, all the club links, everything like that. So now it’s been kind of my go to because not only does it give me what I want, it cut probably three or four steps out of my journey of like digging up these specs and, and, and looking at it again. And I can just easily kind of share it with people.</p>
<p>So it’s super useful, like</p>
<p>[00:10:52] Josep: it’s very useful. And that’s why, like, it would be pretty short sighted not to provide answers. Right. Even with some of the drawbacks that they, they can cost, right? Like, minimize choice, narrow down, narrow down the ability for people to see other sites than, than the one that you’re providing.</p>
<p>I mean, those like things are, are important, but convenience. It’s like, you cannot fight the times.</p>
<p>[00:11:16] Remi: I love what you say about like, picking the right format of answer for any query, because in a way, like, if you forget about answer with AI, it’s what we’ve done since the beginning. You know, like, for some queries, you want a sport widget, sometimes you want a weather widget, sometimes you want, you know, something else, and answer with AI is just a continuation of that on more types of queries, where we can say, okay, for that particular query, it’s the best way to answer the user, right?</p>
<p>[00:11:41] Luke: It sounds like there’s probably opportunities too for, for some of these areas of concerns to kind of evolve and kind of upgrade with some of these things too, right? I mean, I’m sure that like people are concerned about, Oh, well, you know, it seems like nobody’s really monetizing the AI side other than doing premium and other things either, but it seems like a pretty greenfield there.</p>
<p>And when I see these things, I’m like, wow, there’s just like, this is a whole new level of interesting, useful things that users can benefit from that, you know, it’s just opening the doors to, which I think is super cool. Yeah. Joseph, you’re combining this AIML kind of SERP approach. You kind of touched on it, how giving the answer can be beneficial for users, but is there any other elaboration you want to break down on how like unique this is compared to what other competitors are doing, especially when it comes to like benefiting user?</p>
<p>[00:12:24] Josep: The main benefit is that, well, it’s like the one of Topshop, right? The ability that the user get the best answer or results, they get the best satisfaction of their query intent. If you want to go technical, you know, in a single place, right? That’s kind of like the main benefit, the integration. However, we must say that anyone can build an answering engine, right?</p>
<p>Actually, there’s plenty of YouTube videos that use Brave Search API, OpenAI. They combine quickly and they create like a complexity clone kind of thing. in, in a matter of a few hours, those things actually work fairly well. So that’s not the, there’s like the meat of the problem is not the, for me, we’ll talk more about that.</p>
<p>Right. But like the complicated thing of an answer engine is not the application in a way it’s like how you scale it and how you do the context creation and how you put the prompt and how you do the grounding, et cetera, et cetera. Right. And all those things. Basically, yeah, we have the same ingredients, right?</p>
<p>Because we do use Brave Search API. One of the things that we are important for people to remember is that Brave Search uses Brave Search API. So we, we, we try to do our own dog food so that we have the best API there is. Well, at least,</p>
<p>[00:13:43] Luke: It’s really interesting too. I mean, I think how does it feel for you guys when you see other people? I guess AI is one of these fields where it’s almost like if somebody can think it, they’re going to make a proof of concept for it, right? Like when you start seeing other people using, whether it’s the API, I saw somebody tweeting about this the other day where they were, you know, kind of leveraging the API, when you start to see people, experimenting with this.</p>
<p>Tech that you guys have built, how is that seeing that in the wild? Is it exciting? Is it something kind of like you hope to see, do you hope to see more people doing that type of thing? No, no, we, we hope to see it. I</p>
<p>[00:14:13] Josep: mean, look at the end of the day, innovation can happen anywhere, right?</p>
<p>There is no prototype that doesn’t have some value, right? And there is no company that doesn’t provide some value. The other thing. Which could be discussed is like why are those things are fundamental and can really affect the ecosystem on the long run to for the benefit of the users, which is one of the brave missions.</p>
<p>Or they’re just like, like, lemme quote, application layer things, right? , well, that can gather a lot of attention, can gather a lot of press, but at the end of the day, they are not, they’re not fundamental, but still, they provide value. We look, we copy, they copy from us. it is like cost evolution at the end on the benefit of the user.</p>
<p>[00:15:00] Luke: And digging into the fundamentals a bit too, Brave’s always big on privacy, right? What’s the privacy approach with the answer engine? How does that kind of compare to what’s out there? Should users be worried of, okay, I start to treat this more like a AI bot, right? Like, and I’m worried about what I’m inputting, you know, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>how, how’s Brave approaching this?</p>
<p>[00:15:18] Josep: For answer with AI, we treat it exactly as a query, which basically means that we do not keep a user history of the queries that the user does to break. So we have actually no technical ability to do a profile of someone. Even the data that we, that we get. We don’t have personal identifiable information, but even the IP gets dropped before it reaches to us, right?</p>
<p>Oh, wow. For, for privacy. So long story short, we have no concept of sessions, history, or anything like this. That’s actually a big departure, right? Because, having user sessions can be beneficial, especially for like, AI tasks, right? Because it’s good to have some context of prior answers, but we, we prefer not to do it because first, You can get almost the same value, if not the same, without the risk that that entails. User profiles are very dangerous, right? I mean, imagine, and companies may have the highest moral standards, no question, right? But if the government were to ask the data, you would be obliged to give it to them, like with a judge involved, right?</p>
<p>But anyway, that data, uh, it’s not to have it, right? So we do not have it. So we actually sleep very well at night, knowing that. If someone gained access to all our data, they would not be able to learn who are the queries of loop. Oh, like what? I love it. You have to, like, yeah. Yeah, I’m too late,</p>
<p>[00:16:52] Luke: asking too many weird things.</p>
<p>No, I think I, you know, but such a cool thing hearing you say that. I mean, you know, like had a search in, in what we’re doing here, because it’s literally the same thing that Brendan said too, from the beginning of the company, right? Like where it’s just, you know, they can’t take what they don’t have.</p>
<p>I think, you know, even more now than ever, people are seeing how their data is being impacted. Just, you know, even by good actors that are not even doing anything necessarily bad, but just the fact that, you know, software things happen and, and, people reach systems, right?</p>
<p>[00:17:20] Josep: Accidents can happen. And also like a good actor today can become a bad actor tomorrow.</p>
<p>this premise on privacy on why privacy is not something that needs to be sacrificed to build good tech. That’s like the DNA of Brave. And that’s actually one of the reasons why Remi and I joined Brave two years ago.</p>
<p>[00:17:38] Luke: Right. I mean, what a journey too. It’s been, I think, you know, just seeing like, I mean, in the past, you know, six months, it’s just been awesome from when we had you here, last time to now.</p>
<p>And, and, you know, hearing Remi talk about this stuff too, it’s, it’s been really cool to like, see just how fast the iterations have been and, how you guys are keeping that ethos alive with what you’re doing. I’m going to ask you guys now too, cause, we talk about this sometimes with, prospects and partners and things like that around how, you know, Brave’s really like the only other, you Independent option out there.</p>
<p>Like, and especially, I mean, for me, it was surprising coming from, you know, the advertising and monetization world before it came to brave, like, I thought that was a small circle of people, but then you start to look at the search world and it’s even smaller, right. We’re talking about using like the in house AML, AI ML and fine tuned LLMs and.</p>
<p>Open source LLMs, like how important is it that Brave is independent when looking at the landscape? And maybe, you guys can give the audience a sense because I have a feeling it’s really not well known just how small of a circle it is out there with indexes and a search out there.</p>
<p>[00:18:38]  Josep: Yeah.</p>
<p>Independence is like a very odd quality, right? Everybody knows what it is, but it’s difficult to actually define. Brave’s mission is to, again, like build, Equal or better technology than big tech without compromising the privacy, right? And you cannot do that without building it period Because like if we’re if brave was using i don’t know google or being api There would be a dependency there where we could be a stronghold If only because companies can can go rogue, but also like terms of service can change So there’s like no real there is no real alternative, right?</p>
<p>So we need to build that is something that not everyone wants to do There are like many people who are, again, like working at the application layer, right? They want to actually build some cool feature or cool product that satisfy the user needs. And that’s totally legit, right? My only wish would be that they would be a little bit more transparent about it, right?</p>
<p>Right. But because in a way, why do you have to be transparent about it? Because basically, like, because users make a choice, right? And when people make a choice, they are giving with their boat, they are giving some value to the choices they make, right? I do believe that people would be actually, would do different choices if they actually knew the whole implications of the things they are doing, right?</p>
<p>Right. They always like, I use this analogy, which is kind of like the, the person like who drives An electric car, but doesn’t care where the electricity comes from. Sure. Yeah. You can drive a lot like your car because it’s nice looking. That’s awesome acceleration, but then don’t claim it’s beer. I mean, but don’t claim it.</p>
<p>That is good for the environment. If you do not care about where the electricity comes from. Right. So do you want choice? Then support brave. If you just want answers. Well, but it has answers too, but other people have answers. No, it’s not, they couldn’t be better or worse. We do believe it’s better. One important thing to build our own is that technology and our own search is that basically we changing the problem.</p>
<p>We can actually change the underlying architecture and the underlying system to provide different types of data that are more relevant to a new feature, right? So if you use an API at the end of the day, you know, like the set of ingredients is fixed. Right. We can make our own ingredients as we move along.</p>
<p>And that’s a fundamental reason why, you know, we can be one step ahead and of course be more sustainable, which is like what matters to us.</p>
<p>[00:21:20] Luke: Yeah. That’s awesome. That was a great way of putting it with the ingredients too. We’ve seen too, I mean, one of those interesting things that think people aren’t really aware of either is just, we have this whole verified creator system with Brave and we even introduced a premium right before we even had monetization on search.</p>
<p>But there’s a real, it seems like there’s a real appetite from people that do know to support solutions that are different and are breaking free. I mean, even the secondary effects of these things, when. Geopolitical things happen and then something, it might impact how results are presented, right?</p>
<p>Because, and it might not even be the impact of directly of the partner, but it’s just some, it’s how something’s working underneath. And we saw some of this too, like with Russia and Ukraine and Dukkako, for example, right? Where it was kind of controversial and they’re kind of, I mean, when you’re married to a partner, you’re married to a partner, so I think it’s a, it’s a really good point, right?</p>
<p>[00:22:07] Josep: It’s not only the, Potential censorship, so things like the terms of service might might change. I mean, the service does not allow to do AI integrations, perhaps some search engines that seem to be lacking on AI features is because of the terms of service. But nobody knows for a fact, right? Because it’s not being publicized in any case, like, but, but bottom line, what is important is like everyone provides some value, right?</p>
<p>Brief. It’s not just to build a product. It’s a product that doesn’t sacrifice privacy and that is from the, that is from the fundamental, right? That is provides an alternative. And right now, if you are in the US, most of the people listening probably are in the US. There’s only three search engines that have their own index, is Google, Microsoft, and Brave.</p>
<p>And the sizes of those three companies are pretty different, right?</p>
<p>[00:23:04] Luke: I mean, that’s something that people don’t realize, I don’t think, is that even when you’re going to other search engines, most of the time they’re just powered by, you know, one of these big companies, right? I think it’s, awesome that you’re putting light to that too.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>[00:23:16] Josep: some of them now, because we have a search API and some of the. Those search engines that they provide some value again. I mean, it’s not, I’m not trying to like talk them down or like think that we are better. No, no. It’s just like, we have a different value of position.</p>
<p>[00:23:30] Luke: Right. Totally. We came into market at a different time too, right.</p>
<p>Where we could, that’s one of the things that I see with ad tech too, where even if people aren’t necessarily malicious, right, like their intentions weren’t bad. It’s just that when tech exponentially. Scales and adoption, right? Sometimes important ethical questions get ignored, but we’ve had this great positions coming in later to where we can kind of, from first principles, really tackle these things that need tackling, which I think is fantastic that you guys are doing, but speaking of which, Remi, like how much traffic is a new answer with the AI system handling?</p>
<p>Are you guys seeing like a lot of use?</p>
<p>[00:24:05] Remi: I mean, what we’ve seen so far is that, you know, we are handling around a hundred requests per second. On this new system, right out of like more than 300 requests per second. So as Joseph said, it’s like around a third of the queries, you know, depending on the language and countries and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But then this hundred requests per second translates into more than 500 concurrent generation sessions because, you know, we get a hundred new requests every second, each of these requests takes a few seconds to generate the answer. Right. So overall the load on the system is much higher. Okay. And if I can maybe just like elaborate on how this is broken down is like, you know, if a user can trigger answer with AI by a press of a button, basically, right?</p>
<p>So like, you could, as a user have answered with AI on any query you make, right? But then what we’ve seen drives the load is basically this automatic triggering mechanism that Josette talked about. Describe where we actually decide we try to find the best, you know, queries for which answer with AI makes sense.</p>
<p>And then we’ve seen that tweaking these heuristics and this decision can increase or decrease the load. And as a matter of fact, because we are now extending this, this triggering mechanism to more queries, it’s increasing over time and we expect it to keep increasing in the coming weeks as we handle more types of queries automatically.</p>
<p>[00:25:22] Luke: And just for folks that are unaware, that might not know what we’re talking about when you’re talking about forcing it to answer with AI, there’s this like a little four diamond icon that’s next to where kind of the magnifying glasses. If you click on that, it’ll force it to answer with AI, right? Like, I’m just curious on that front.</p>
<p>Like, are you seeing people, like, are we measuring that? Are you able to see like how often that gets invoked or is it, are people like, Using it often or people kind of, I mean, I know with defaults, we tend to see people just kind of let the thing do what it’s supposed to do, but are you seeing users like invoking that a lot?</p>
<p>[00:25:55] Remi: Yeah, I think it’s, it’s fairly small, but as you said, defaults as are what matters in the end. Right. So like, even though. I mean, there needs to be a bit of time for people to kind of learn about the future. So we’ve tried to do some in, you know, in page education where we have this little purpose and you can click on this button, right?</p>
<p>When it makes sense. So we’ve seen that in the past with code LLM, so this like code assistant that we’ve built and integrated last year. And over time, the clicks rate increased as people realize, okay, I can do it. Right. And then in the future queries, they start doing it more and more. And I guess there is a bit of that, but</p>
<p>[00:26:33] Josep: it’s very low, as you said, but that’s in a way, that’s like the point, right?</p>
<p>Because that’s why we put so much emphasis on the automatic triggering. Right. I mean, if too much, but of course there’s a confounder there, right? I mean, we do not know if, but in principle, I think it’s like less, a little bit less than 1%. I’m pretty happy about it.</p>
<p>[00:26:54] Luke: And that’s one of those things, I think, too, that’s kind of not necessarily unique to us, but the fact that we have so many early adopters, you know, that try out brave stuff, the people that are more likely to kind of push all the knobs around, you know, like, in a lot of cases, at least from what I see, because it’s been interesting for my position, you know, being out there with the community a lot is that, you know, I see what I see often where it’s, anecdotally, some people want AI to answer everything, but then some people are really repulsed by the idea of AI answering everything.</p>
<p>Right. And when I see that, it usually means we’re doing something right. If I see things skewing too much one way or the other, when we release these things, it’s, but, but yeah, I think that you nailed it. Like the user shouldn’t need to know whether to answer it with AI or not. It should just give them a good answer, right?</p>
<p>Like whether it’s a search result query or,</p>
<p>[00:27:35] Josep: That’s our bet in a way, right? I mean that we don’t want to go either one way or the other. We believe that both options have values, have intrinsic values, and also like to always like have the choice of the user, right? Because at the day, the query intents are very complex.</p>
<p>Same query can have different intents depending on a context that we do not have. Perhaps you are like in the mood of reading a lot of text, or perhaps you just want to know like, what is the last album of Lady Gaga, right? I mean, the same, the same query last album of Lady Gaga can be anything. It could be like the actual answer.</p>
<p>you actually want to buy it or like, you want to know the ups and downs of the story behind it. Right. It’s not, it’s a no.</p>
<p>[00:28:24] Luke: Well, and it’s one of those things I really love about this too, is that it’s kind of like when I’m using it, it feels like a, for a lot of the zeitgeist is kind of looking at, at AI and thinking, okay, it’s a little staple, like a, what’s his name from Microsoft days.</p>
<p>I don’t know that that Clippy, yeah, yeah. Where, okay. It’s constrained into this little sidecar of a prompt. Right. But when I’m using this feature, it’s actually like, okay, wait a minute. Like, here’s something that. I don’t need to need some early adopter to use it. Everybody’s using search, right?</p>
<p>It’s one of those things where it’s actually useful AI application in something that you can get in front of millions of people and actually have them use it right away, which kind of rare, right? One thing I want to kind of ask about that though, is, you know, when you look at like these prompts, there’s a lot of concern around like hallucinations with results.</p>
<p>Like how are we handling that at Brave when we do things like this answer engine, where it’s kind of almost like a hybrid of, The serpent and what you see, like with these AI prompts.</p>
<p>[00:29:19] Remi: That’s a good point. I mean, it’s hallucinations are most likely the biggest issue with LLMs as we’ve seen, you know, in chat GPT and like the answer confidently and you’re like, is it true or not?</p>
<p>Right. So one thing to remember, I think is the answer with AI is like by design. grounded in the search result, right? So like, this means that for any user query, we already providing relevant information to the model. So already it’s kind of constrained to a scope, which is much more limited compared to like chat GPT, where it’s like, you know, you ask a question and then the model can pick up any knowledge it might have from its pre training, right?</p>
<p>So like the context matters. One caveat on that is that. Grounded doesn’t mean truth, right? Because what the answer reflects is the quality of the search results. And you might have multiple perspectives in there, and we try to make sure that the final answer reflects all of them if possible, right? So we try to make sure you get the best overview possible of the search results.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t mean, you know, This is truthful and you still need to check, you know, critical, critical facts, right? But at least you minimize the likelihood of the model just going completely astray and, you know, like inventing,</p>
<p>[00:30:33] Josep: making up something. I would like to like to congratulate the team, but especially Rene, because like those things are really like an art, right?</p>
<p>Like on how you actually like, because like all these LLMs. And systems that are actually fairly new, might sound stupid like what they’re going to say, but nobody actually understands fully how they actually work. So it’s kind of like, you know, like what happens with MLM is that you actually put them in an input, the output amazes you.</p>
<p>But then if you want to make them do something specific, it usually refuses to, right? And there is a lot of like, back and forth and trial and error and educated guesses that the team has been, that’s put on it just to make this kind of like thing that, well, I mean, the, the output of the answer should be based on the.</p>
<p>Content of the web and on the knowledge of the content of the web, rather than the knowledge of the model itself, all the things, I mean, congratulations to Remi and Tim, because it’s a</p>
<p>[00:31:36] Luke: good point. I was going to sing your praises a little more. I mean, it’s one of those things where when I was seeing, you know, having been at Brave for a long time, when we brought you guys on with the search engine, the comparisons we always used to hear from people were like, okay, how does this compare to DuckDuckGo?</p>
<p>But like, when I see what you guys are doing now. The comparisons I’m seeing from people are like, I can use this instead of Google, right? Like it’s getting to the point where I can like, it doesn’t happen unless you have a good product that you’re putting out there, which, I mean, all this thought and care and consideration, when, especially when you compare it to how, like I used to looking at a windows 11 install and seeing that I’ve got this.</p>
<p>Co-piloting everywhere that I didn’t ask for, right? Like and, and, and trying to force these things on me all over the place. Like it’s a balance, right? Like, and, and, I think that you guys are doing a, a lot of great work on focusing on where these things could be most useful and then really kind of attacking that and trying to give quality, you know, with that, that’s useful.</p>
<p>Which is not an easy thing to balance, right? I mean, like, you know, we’re still finding our. Product market fit as a, as a whole company and how you guys are in here kind of like with the scalpel, trying to kind of take on some giants, which is awesome, I think, how do you guys measure quality when you’re looking at these things?</p>
<p>I mean, cause it is, it’s almost like a higher bar that you guys have to aim for because it’s married with the search result page and people are using that for research and thing like, how do you guys measure quality when you’re looking at these AI answers?</p>
<p>[00:32:56] Remi: Yeah. Yeah. All right. So it’s a great question.</p>
<p>And quality in search is already hard. I think if you put LLMs in the mix, it becomes even harder because the output of this. Models are non deterministic by nature, right? So you have like a search index which is constantly being updated, refreshed, new pages, pages updated, new events. Then you have a model which whose output is non deterministic, you mix the two, then the output is Kind of hard to reason about in an automated way, right?</p>
<p>So what we’ve done is like, we have multiple, let’s say, layers of testing. the first one is automated testing. So we do manage to kind of, you know, replay hundreds of queries, real queries that we’ve seen for which we know what kind of things to expect in the answer, right? If you take, let’s say, height of Everest, well, no matter it’s phrased, you want to see 8, 800 meters somewhere.</p>
<p>Right. Like you can do it a bit fuzzy, of course, but like you kind of have this expectation. We can do some checks on the, you know, the entities that you expect in the answer on the format. So it’s not perfect, but it gives you kind of a good approximation of you didn’t break something fundamentally if you make a change, right?</p>
<p>So it’s like very helpful to iterate. You make a change, you run it again. It takes maybe a couple of minutes or three minutes. So it’s like very nice. And then in the end, you still need human assessment, kind of validate any meaningful change. So we do have a quality team whose job is to actually evaluate the search results, but now also sensor with AI.</p>
<p>And we’ve built like custom tooling for that. So the, I mean, one of the tools we’ve built is like some kind of chatbot arena internally, where you have a blind testing tool, you get a random query, you get a screenshot of two versions of the system. Randomized. And you need to say which one is better.</p>
<p>Right. And it’s used by the quality team. It’s used by, you know, anyone internally in the team. So we get like multiple opinions because as we’ve seen, you know, different people might prefer slightly different things. People prefer more verbose, less verbose, more concise, etc. Right. So it’s important to have a bit of a panel of different people assessing to get kind of a balanced view in the end.</p>
<p>Right. And then of course the last part is dog fooding. I mean, everyone that you know in the team uses Brave Search, every day at work, outside of work, and we get like great feedback from that. So it’s like super valuable.</p>
<p>[00:35:21] Luke: How’s the user feedback been so far? Are you seeing anything that’s kind of surprising?</p>
<p>I always see this when we throw stuff in market, you know, you see we few things or you’re like, whoa, I didn’t anticipate that. You know?</p>
<p>[00:35:30] Remi: Yeah. You have no idea what , what are people gonna do . I, I think one data point is, it ties back to what you said. A bit earlier, but some people saying, you know, there is AI.</p>
<p>How do I disable this thing? Right. And we’ve seen, you know, on communities like Reddit and Hacker News, people write, Oh, I didn’t like it, or I didn’t know I needed it, but now that I. See it in action. I cannot do without it. I think that’s the best feedback because people realize that this is valuable. It helps them, you know, find answers faster, or maybe it helps them do what they could not do at all without rates.</p>
<p>So that’s like pretty amazing to, to see this kind of feedback.</p>
<p>[00:36:08] Luke: What about you, Joseph? Anything surprising coming in?</p>
<p>[00:36:12] Josep: No, no, we have a lot of very good testimonials. We, of course, have a couple of testimonials that like this is factually incorrect. And then we actually checked and the web is wrong. Some other things are opinions.</p>
<p>There is a lot of like controversial topics where no good answer exists that doesn’t offend someone and answers just make that thing worse because someone is going to get offended in a way or another, but in general, the feedback is very good. And like Remi said, like the biggest positive feedback is that we have shown these answers to a lot of people, but like not everyone is like, on Hacker News all day long, but I know all the startups or they, or they did have, YouTube tutorials that they do X, Y, Z, right?</p>
<p>And we do serve about like 27 million queries per day. One third of those trigger the answers, right? So that’s almost like a, let’s say rounded up 10 million answers per day. That’s a lot of eyeballs, right? And it has raised awareness that that thing exists. For</p>
<p>[00:37:22] Luke: me too, looking at this space broadly, it’s like, you see when all the hype cycles happening and people are starting to use their buzzword bingo about stuff and you know, Oh, AI is ubiquitous.</p>
<p>It’s everywhere. What this has done for me is it’s kind of actually brought it home in a way where it’s like, look, like, sure, these things will be ubiquitous, but really like it. Putting this stuff in search, search is ubiquitous. Everyone’s using it, right? Like, like this, this is one of the best use cases for AI.</p>
<p>I think I’ve, I’ve, I’ve seen to date that as far as like utility and mass and, and actually like getting something that people could have help from right away that they’re not going to forget about, which is also something that I’m getting users to change their habits is really hard. And I think that, you know, by approaching this with this way and search, it’s really, really clever.</p>
<p>And. And with those ethos that you guys kind of were covering earlier aligned so well with what we’re doing here. I think it’s, it’s really kind of an under, underrated, undervalued thing in market right now, when you look at all of the kind of stuff that’s driving the hype out there. So I, I, my hat, tip my hat to you guys for cooking all this up.</p>
<p>This is amazing. and, I think this is really going to be impactful. I think one kind of out there question, like, you know, looking at the horizon for things, right. And I know Brendan talks about. There’s a lot in, in our ad platform too, kind of leverages some of the local data. Like when you guys look at things like answer engine long term, right?</p>
<p>Like beyond, I’m talking, you know, future, future, like do you see a a, a potential here for having it answers enhanced about, based on what’s locally in my browser by where I am in the world. Like all of these types of like, you know, next level types of results you could get. Do you see us going in that direction eventually?</p>
<p>[00:38:57] Josep: Yes, I mean, where you are in the world, I mean, already being used, but in any case, like, you mean, like, more like a personalized context? Yes, but that doesn’t have to be done in the context of, of Leo, right? Like the in browser. AI, right? That’s why Leo is like the in browser AI of, of reform and your audience shouldn’t be familiar with it right now.</p>
<p>There is no integration per se, but we are working heavily on, on how to integrate, right? Because like, you know, where they are complimentary, right? Like a search is more like a, a one off for a task. Of course it can be iterative, but that’s not meant to be where Leo is more like the user agent, where you can.</p>
<p>Like, you can expand and you can, like, really dig down into a particular topic. And of course, because it’s local, it could have like local information that is private to you, user sessions, and all the things that we do not want to keep. Again, for privacy considerations, they could be kept in the browser in a much safer way.</p>
<p>So we are like working on that. That’s kind of the big step forward. We haven’t done it so far. It’s mostly because the, you know, I just want to stop shop. I keep referring to right now because right now it’s actually difficult to transition from one system to another without the user, without the user.</p>
<p>Getting lost in the, in the way. Right. So there has to be like, once we have the integration worked out where like people understand clearly, like what’s going on, what’s going to get happened when you do something. Right. When we work out on this details, which hopefully is going to be very soon, then we will have like a clear winner, right?</p>
<p>Where like, you know, you start on search, then you transition to Leo and then you do like the, the heavy lifting. Or the other way around you’re liking or leo can actually have access to real time information using research</p>
<p>[00:40:47] Luke: Yeah, it’s really interesting because it’s kind of almost like we’re catering to two sides of a coin where you’ve got real like power AI users that might be using something like Leo and early adopters or people that are using it as part of their, you know, even a work function.</p>
<p>Right? And then you’ve got also like everybody else is doing like a search. Eventually these things kind of like a purging effort for both sides is really interesting and it’ll be cool to see them come together. I know we’re way over time. I really appreciate you guys making the time to come here and talk through this.</p>
<p>Is there anything we didn’t cover that you all want the audience to know about that they might find interesting whether it’s about the AI engine or about any of the broader stuff you guys are working on?</p>
<p>[00:41:29] Remi: And maybe we can touch briefly on some of the challenges that we faced while building it. Yeah, please do.</p>
<p>[00:41:34] Josep: I mean, to me, because that’s what I love, you know, building and solving problems, that’s one of the most interesting aspect of it. and we faced like quite a bunch of them.</p>
<p>I mean, there are two kind of categories of challenges. One is like performance because, you know, with the traffic that we mentioned, it’s actually not a trivial thing to serve, you know, these big LLMs at scale, although we did have a. Lot of experience because we’ve been, you know, using transformers for years now, but on, you know, smaller models, a stricter latency budget and everything, right?</p>
<p>[00:42:06] Remi: So like this new feature requires like a different kind of way of, of, of deploying this model. It is like streaming continuous matching all of these things. So we have had to do a lot of work to make sure we find the sweet spot in terms of costs, because we don’t want to, you know, spend mindlessly all the money on the GPUs and performance.</p>
<p>So that the users, you know, get a great, great experience that is fast and snappy, and they get the answer they need quickly. Right. Second aspect is quality. Of course, we’ve touched on it. Just want to maybe add like a few, few more elements on that, like to take a step back, like, you know, when you have a traditional search engine, like What you do is you take any user query with any intent, and you’re going to try to find the top 10 pages out of billions that you have in your index, right?</p>
<p>And that’s already extremely hard, as we know, because we built it, right? Built it. At this point, you kind of expect the user to go open a few pages and find the answer wherever it is. Maybe it’s in a paragraph, maybe it’s Whatever, right? But you know, like from the perspective of answer with AI, it’s not because the first page on the result set is there, but the whole content of the page is relevant, right?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a subset of it, right? So with answer with AI, you kind of take on this job for the user and you need to go look. in a much more granular way to pick up the right information, right? And the right information might be, as I said, like paragraph, maybe it’s a single sentence, maybe it’s a table, maybe it’s a row in a table, maybe it’s like some structured data, you know, like JSON schemas, these kinds of things.</p>
<p>So we’ve had to kind of, Leverage a lot of technology we had, you know, like embeddings, models, Q, Q and A, question answering models, semantic understanding, which we already had built in house for like all the other search features we built over the years. But now we’re able to leverage that to go, you know, much finer grained.</p>
<p>And go pick up the right context and then have the model work on that and produce the final answer. So I think that’s kind of this mindset change is pretty interesting and also where the challenge lies, right? When you, when you build such feature. Maybe one last thing is on this, like, you know, entities we’ve mentioned before, I think Joseph touched on that earlier.</p>
<p>Some answers are texts, some answers are not text, right? You have like cards, maybe like a thumbnail. It’s kind of interesting because What we are doing here is you take a stream of tokens from a model and then on the fly, you’re transforming the stream of token into a different representation, right? So you’re like detecting, oh, this is about entities of type, let’s say albums, right?</p>
<p>And then you kind of fetch more information on the fly and then present it in the end with like all the metadata that makes sense, like some label. And title and stuff like that. And we’re going to expand on that in the future. So it’s going to be hopefully more and more useful for the user. But it’s kind of an interesting challenge to, to build this system.</p>
<p>[00:45:14] Luke: Yeah. I mean, I just remember even before any of this AI stuff or summarizer got worked in, like being on a call with a colleague, Jan and Aldo, and he’s pulling up, we were talking about a partner. He’s pulling them up and comparing them just on the basic search results and making sure that they’re fast enough.</p>
<p>And one thing that’s kind of stood out here is that, yeah, there is kind of a little bit of time, but if I compare that against answer outputs on like, you know, chat GPT or other things, it’s, it’s much faster than what I would typically get in a bot, right, or prompt. Whatever you guys are doing there, it sounds like you guys are having a chisel at some pretty interesting, you know, automation, custom stuff to make that performance side of it works, but it’s cool.</p>
<p>I mean, like, yeah, it is neat to see this kind of richer experience when it, when it’s necessary. But I really also kind of like what, what Joseph’s talking about too, where like, I think part of the wrench is that we don’t have to show you something every time, getting that part right is, is much harder than people think, I think, or appreciate, but there’s value in that too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just so people know, I mean, like some of this is, is probably obvious, but, but like, you know, if people see a result that they think is an accurate, or if they see something that could be improved, like I know there’s feed, there’s always in feedback loops and in search, like what’s the best way for people to get you actionable information?</p>
<p>Is it to use those feedback loops and like thumbs up, thumbs down, things are in the product or what would you guys recommend like specifically on quality?</p>
<p>[00:46:35] Josep: There is like a feedback button on every result on the page. A fair amount of people submit feedback, probably only a fraction of the feedback.</p>
<p>Sometimes actually like I’m surprised to see like how often the feedback is positive, which means that we have very nice users who actually report positive feedback, which is rare. But that’s one way. Then for things that are like really offensive or really like dangerous, Like community forums on the web or Twitter is also acceptable for like things are dangerous.</p>
<p>Last on the list, I mean, if we actually have some, because like the web could contain like personal information, you know, like a phone number, like names, things like we do respect the right to be forgotten that is mandatory in the U S on the EU, but we expand it also to the whole world. So if there is like some data that shouldn’t be indexed, There is like, an email where, like, privacy at brave.</p>
<p>com, where like, you can submit and actually it’s not privacy, don’t check the email later, but basically like people can submit like, read to be forgotten, which is also important. An important thing, right? Because the web, as Remi said, the web has everything for the good and for the bad.</p>
<p>[00:47:53] Remi: Everything and more.</p>
<p>[00:47:56] Luke: Great point too. I mean, about, about people, you find information in there too. And we just actually interviewed Pat Walsh recently too. And</p>
<p>[00:48:02] Josep: yeah, Pat is the one who’s reviewing those cases because those cases is not that you can send URLs, like, okay, I want those removed. No, no, I mean, that has to be, you have to prove that you actually are the person behind that, that thing.</p>
<p>And that’s like. Damaging for you, you have to demonstrate, certain aspects, but then we, we got, we get those as any search engine there is that has its own index. Those are problems that others do not have, but we do have that because, we need to clean up our own index.</p>
<p>[00:48:30] Luke: Joseph, Remi, I really appreciate you guys, coming on the show today.</p>
<p>I’d love to have you all back too, when we’ve got more new things to roll out. Thanks so much. Until next time, have a good one, you guys.</p>
<p>[00:48:43] Josep: Thank you for having us.</p>
<p>[00:48:47] Luke: Thanks for listening to the Brave Technologist podcast. To never miss an episode, make sure you hit follow in your podcast app. If you haven’t already made the switch to the Brave browser, you can download it for free today at brave.com and start using Brave Search, which enables you to search the web privately. Brave also shields you from the ads, trackers, and other creepy stuff following you across the web.</p>

             
         
     
 


 What the Brave Search answer engine can do&nbsp; 
<p>The secret ingredient of an answer engine is not the LLM that powers it, but the combination of a model with up-to-date, reliable data. Such data can help supply the context from which the model derives the answers it presents to the user. Or, to put it another way: an effective answer engine requires both a model and access to a search engine. With API access to a search engine, even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43ZCeBTcsS8">individual contributors</a> can generate a reasonable answer engine.</p>
<p>This is why Brave Search—with its index of 20 billion pages, curated and cleansed of the SEO spam and junk content that plagues other indexes—is uniquely positioned to provide such a powerful answer engine. It has the data needed to generate an accurate and timely answer, and the context.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Answers enriched with text and other media</p>
<p>With the new answer engine, Brave Search aims to provide not just answers, but an integrated system to satisfy the multiple intents a user might have, and to do so at scale (currently Brave Search serves more than 27 million queries per day). Loosely speaking, these intents fall into one of a handful of categories:</p>
 
 Navigational: Queries for specific sites, such as “Facebook” or “Twitter.” 
 Informational: Question-based queries, or those seeking information, which generally fall into two subcategories:
 
 Specific lookups: These are often served by rich user interfaces built around structured realtime information (e.g. currency conversion rates, weather, or sports results) or custom widgets with non-real time based, deterministic data (e.g. unit conversion or time and timezone conversions). 
 Question-like queries: Queries such as “How do I find north when hiking?” 
 
 
 Commercial: Queries with the intent of finding or researching products and services. 
 Transactional: Queries with the intent of completing an action (e.g. buying a product). 
 
<p>Given relevant context, most existing answer engines do well at informational, question-like queries. However, they tend not to perform as well on other kinds of queries. With this latest release, Brave Search will default to an answer engine experience for likely informational, question-like queries.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Answers for informational queries</p>
<p>For all other categories, users can trigger the answer engine on demand by simply clicking Answer with AI. This offers a best-in-class experience of both options: an answer engine that’s both predictive and optional.</p>
<p>Brave Search’s generative answers are not just text. The deep integration between the index and model makes it possible for us to combine online, contextual, named entities enrichments (a process that adds more context to a person, place, or thing) as the answer is generated. This means that answers combine generative text with other media types, including informational cards and images.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Answer with AI results</p>
<p>The Brave Search answer engine can even combine data from the index and geo local results to provide rich information on points of interest. To date, the Brave Search index has more than 1 billion location-based schemas, from which we can extract more than 100 million businesses and other points of interest. These listings—larger than any public dataset—mean the answer engine can provide rich, instant results for points of interest all over the world.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Result for point of interest</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Summary of top stories related to a current event</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Summary showing cited sources</p>

 How to try Brave Search’s Answer with AI feature 
<p>Brave Search can be accessed by anyone on the Web at <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a>, and is also the default search engine in the Brave browser for multiple countries. Answer with AI is available for all Brave Search users for searches in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish (the answer engine functionality is available in other languages as well, but some answers may appear in English). It’s available on all platforms, on desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>If Brave Search is already your default search engine, simply start a search in the address bar of your browser. For question-like queries, the answer engine should produce an answer by default, which will appear at the top of the search results page. Users also have the option to request answers on-demand by clicking / tapping the Answer with AI icon that appears beside the search bar on any search results page.</p>


    
    

    


    



<p>The Brave Search answer engine is free to all users, and we hope to keep it this way, as we believe this is a natural evolution of search engines. In the future, we may also add a paid option, with premium experiences such as the ability to have an open ended chat, possibly in conjunction with <a>the premium options offered by Brave Leo</a>, the AI assistant in the Brave browser.</p>

 The impact of answer engines on the Web 
<p>There is a clear demand from users for convenient methods of consuming content, and AI-augmented answers are a key example. On the other hand, delivering on this demand can contribute to the erosion of the incentives for publishers to put out content on the Web, ultimately changing its very nature.</p>
<p>This challenge is not unique to Brave Search, but present across most AI-powered answer engines and chatbots, premium or open. Brave, as both a browser and search engine, is aware of these challenges. Consequently, we will be monitoring and quantifying the impact of AI-generated content on site visits, and eventually will address the disruptions that could be caused by the drop in traffic. We hope others are working on this as well.</p>

The difference between public and private blockchains can be confusing, leaving many people wondering which of the two is most suitable for their situation.&nbsp;In this article, we will explain the main differences between public and private blockchains, and when you should use which one.</p>



<p></p>



 What is a public blockchain? 



<p>Let’s start with the definition of a public blockchain. A public blockchain is a <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">permissionless blockchain</a> that allows anyone to join and participate in blockchain activities. This means anyone can contribute to the blockchain and can access the data on it.</p>



<p>In addition, public blockchains are decentralised, ensuring no single entity has control over the blockchain. This decentralisation also ensures that transactions on the (public) blockchain are verified by all nodes and are immutable once they’re on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Differences between public and private blockchains 







<p></p>



<p>While the above features sound nice, private blockchains might seem very similar at first glance. What are the differences and benefits of both types of blockchains?</p>



<p>The main difference between public and private blockchains lies in who can write and read data from that blockchain. On public blockchains, everyone can write data to and read data from the blockchain. On private blockchains though, a permissions system is in place, which determines who can perform certain actions, including reading and writing data.</p>



<p>Another important difference is the ownership of the blockchain. Generally speaking, public blockchains are decentralised and do not have an owner. Private blockchains, however, are generally owned by a single entity. This makes public blockchains more resistant to censorship than private blockchains.</p>



<p>Anonymity is another key difference between the two. Due to the permissionless nature of public blockchains, participating entities are anonymous. This can be both a benefit and a downside, depending on the use case.</p>



<p>Other differences are speed and scalability. Public blockchains tend to be slower and less scalable, due to their decentralised nature, while private blockchains are generally much faster and more scalable, as they don’t have to worry about decentralisation.</p>



<p></p>



 Picking the right blockchain 



<p>Now that you understand the differences between public blockchains and private blockchains, you should consider <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy">which blockchain is most suitable for your solution</a>.</p>



<p>If your solution requires censorship resistance and the added security of decentralisation, a public blockchain is the best fit. However, if the need for high scalability, fast transactions, and a permission system take priority, a private blockchain is likely more suited.</p>



 Which public blockchain should I use? 



<p>While picking the right kind of blockchain to suit your situation best can be quite challenging, picking the right public blockchain can be even more challenging. There’s a wide variety of available public blockchains, each of them designed to serve a specific use case and/or industry. So, which one should you use?</p>



<p>A lot of people assume Bitcoin or Ethereum are the best public blockchains, and in a sense, they are. They are the first of their kind and are very resistant to censorship due to the high number of participants. However, these blockchains have relatively low transaction speeds and suffer from scalability issues, due to outdated consensus mechanisms used.</p>



<p>Modern-day, public blockchains use newer, faster, and more scalable consensus mechanisms that safeguard the benefits of public blockchains while tackling the transaction speed and scalability issues generally associated with public blockchains.</p>



<p>One of these public blockchains is the <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">Europechain by Zaisan, an enterprise blockchain</a> created by a group of system integrators and technology providers from around the European Union. This public blockchain uses the latest software to ensure fast transaction speeds and enterprise-level scalability. In addition, the blockchain offers solutions that ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), making blockchain legal issues a problem of the past.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 A public blockchain is a permissionless blockchain that allows anyone to join and participate in blockchain activities. 



 Public blockchains are decentralised, which means that no single entity has control over the blockchain. 



 Private blockchains feature a permissions system that determines who can perform certain actions, including reading and writing data. 



 Private blockchains tend to be owned by a single entity, which makes public blockchains more censorship-resistant. 



 Public blockchains are better suited for solutions that require censorship resistance, added security, and decentralisation 



 Private blockchains are better suited for solutions that require high scalability, fast transactions, and a permission system. 



 Zaisan offers a <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">public, GDPR-compliant blockchain</a> built with the latest technology to offer fast transaction speeds and enterprise-level scalability.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>As this week wraps up, we’re excited to share our latest news with you. This week’s update covers the latest updates regarding our ecosystem and testnet development.</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 5 is now live with enhanced gas management and improved transaction processing <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-5-is-now-live-with-enhanced-gas-management-and-improved-transaction-processing/">Stage 5</a> of our testnet is live. Stage 5 includes using a third party Relayer service (a.k.a Bundler) and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.&nbsp;</p> Panther’s CTO, Anish Mohammed, on Proof of Podcast <p>Last week, our Co-Founder Anish Mohammed joined Hake from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUoziPJ55j8&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Proof of Podcast </a>to discuss tokenomics design and cryptography.</p> Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, at ETH Dam <p>Our Co-Founder and CTO, Oliver Gale, will take the stage at Crypto Canal’s ETHDam on April 13 to share his insights on alpha protection through privacy for DeFi users.</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update <p>Current testnet users: 3000+</p><p>Total rewards distributed: 700,000+ $ZKP</p><p>Our testnet rewards pot is 2 million $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link from Panther’s docs</a> to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates.  Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management and basic disclosures. Development for Stage 6 is complete and currently under testing. The team plans to release Stage 6 later this month.&nbsp;</p> Completion of the first round of audit&nbsp; <p>Panther recently completed Veridise’s first round of audits for circuits and smart contracts. The team is working on Enhancement Stage 2 to incorporate feedback from Veridise’s recent audits and other dApp improvements. We expect to release updates made to the dApp together with Stage 6 for community testing. </p> Mumbai Network Shutdown <p>As Polygon transitions to a new test network in response to the deprecation of the Ethereum Goerli test network (the underlying L1 for Mumbai), Mumbai has ceased operations. This development was somewhat unexpected, as we anticipated that Mumbai would remain operational until full network support for Amoy was established.</p><p>In the interim, we want our testers to know that their $ZKP rewards are SAFE and that the $ZKP rewards accumulated from Stage 1 testing up to the present are secure. You will receive these rewards as planned.</p><p>Next Steps: The Panther team is actively exploring alternatives to continue our testing processes effectively. Stay tuned for further updates on our<a href="https://discord.com/channels/801604563115180063/801637790290804766?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Discord</a> and<a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Telegram</a> groups, and thank you for your continued support and understanding.</p> Stage 7 development <p>Stage 7 of the testnet dApp includes DeFi swaps, advanced disclosures, other supported assets, and canary deployment (use of real tokens). The team is working on Stage 7 in parallel with Stage 6 and Enhancement Stage 2. We are currently working on UI/UX development and expect to release Stage 7 for community testing in the first week of May.</p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs.

  Brave has integrated its AI assistant Leo with Brave Talk, its video conferencing tool, to provide real-time meeting summaries, task lists, and more for a more efficient and productive meeting experience, while maintaining privacy.

<p>Today, Brave is announcing the latest integration of Leo, our privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser. Brave Talk Premium users can now find Leo within <a>Brave Talk</a>—our privacy-preserving video calling tool—on both desktop and Android. With this integration, Leo can take Brave Talk transcriptions and summarize them, create clean meeting notes and task lists, answer follow up questions, and more.</p>
<p>Leo for Brave Talk allows call participants to fully participate in meetings and stay focused on discussions, and let Leo handle the logistics. As with all Brave products, this is done with our full privacy protections by default.</p>

 What are Brave Talk and Brave Leo? 
<p>Brave Talk—first launched in May 2020, and built on 8x8’s Jitsi Open Source video conferencing software—is our privacy-focused video conferencing feature built directly into the Brave browser. With Brave Talk, any Brave user can start a virtual meeting, livestream, hangout, or any other collaborative session. And anyone—even if they’re not using Brave—can join a Talk call.</p>
<p>Brave Talk offers video/audio conferencing, screen sharing, chat, and more, with no extra apps or extensions required—it’s built right into the Brave browser, and offers Brave-level privacy. With Brave Talk, what you say or type in the service is not logged or saved (except to enable call recordings and transcriptions); who you talk to, when, and how, stays private to you. Talk is free for up to 4 participants, with no limit on the number or length of calls. It’s also available as a Premium offering for larger groups, with call recordings and expanded moderation tools.</p>
<p>Leo is Brave’s private AI assistant available right in the browser. Leo can create real-time summaries of webpages or videos; answer questions about content, or generate new content; translate pages, analyze them, rewrite them, and more.</p>
<p>Leo combines this easy access to AI with the privacy focus of Brave. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. With cutting-edge technology and privacy, Brave Leo pushes the boundaries of AI chatbot services. Leo is free for all Brave users, and also includes a Premium offering with higher rate limits.</p>
<p>The Leo integration is available for all Brave Talk Premium users and their meeting attendees on the Brave browser.</p>

 What does Brave Talk with Leo do? 
<p>Brave Talk can already provide call transcripts to moderators of Premium calls. With Leo integrated into Brave Talk, those transcripts suddenly become dynamic.</p>
<p>Whether you’re discussing project updates, brainstorming ideas, or conducting interviews, Leo can follow along with the conversation and make it easier for you to reference important points. Leo can use Brave Talk call transcripts to:</p>
 
 Summarize them into useful meeting notes 
 Highlight key topics, decisions, and action items 
 Find quotes, and consider follow-up questions 
 Quickly catch up if you’re late or step away 
 
<p>With these logistical tasks handled, participants can stay focused, productive, and fully present during meetings. No more scrambling to capture details or struggling to recall important points with real-time note-taking, and no more disagreement about the content of a meeting.</p>
<p>“With Leo, meetings are now much more efficient. Teams can focus on the conversations instead of getting bogged down in note taking,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave. “Brave is committed to pairing AI with user privacy, and this applies to AI assistance in video conferencing as well. We’re excited to bring frictionless AI productivity to Brave Talk, and thrilled to continue our work with 8x8 to bring an exceptional conferencing experience to the millions of Brave users worldwide.”</p>
<p>“As technology providers, we are constantly looking for ways to innovate and provide our users with the tools and solutions they need to be more productive and efficient in their roles”, said&nbsp; Emil Ivov, VP of Product for Video Platform and Services at 8x8.&nbsp; “We’re excited to continue our partnership with Brave to couple industry-leading private video conferencing technology with a first-of-its-kind integration of private AI into calls, creating an enhanced employee and customer experience.”</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Privacy and security 
<p>Unlike other AI meeting assistants, Brave Talk with Leo doesn’t share your data with anyone. Brave and 8x8 will store call recordings and transcripts for up to 24 hours to allow time for call moderators to download them. What you say or type in the service is otherwise never logged or saved. Who you talk to, when, and how, is private to you. Furthermore, when call recordings are initiated, users are made aware of this by a voice announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave Talk users can enable multiple layers of encryption on calls, which can prevent eavesdroppers from listening in. Brave Talk is powered by the <a href="https://jaas.8x8.vc/#/">Jitsi as a Service</a> open-source video meeting platform from 8x8, a leading integrated cloud contact center and unified communications platform provider (NASDAQ: EGHT). 8x8 uses WebRTC open-source technology, enabling developers to embed HD video directly into the browser.</p>
<p>As for Leo’s privacy protections, Leo hides IP addresses using a reverse proxy, so requests cannot be linked to a user. Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers or used for model training. No personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models (though if you select the Anthropic model, Leo queries will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted). No login or account is required for access, and Leo Premium subscriptions are unlinkable to the user.</p>

 Get started with Brave Talk + Leo 
<p>The Leo integration is available for all Brave Talk Premium users and their meeting attendees on the Brave browser.</p>
<p>To start a Brave Talk call, Brave browser users can open a new tab and click the  icon, or visit talk.brave.com. Once the call link is created, it can be shared with anyone, even if they’re not using Brave.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Brave Talk with Leo is available to Premium subscribers. To get a Premium subscription ($7/month), users can visit account.brave.com to get started. Once a Premium call is started, the meeting creator with the Premium subscription can visit Settings and turn on Record transcription (A red icon will appear at the top of the screen for all participants, indicating the call is being recorded.)</p>
<p>The call moderator will have access to the audio or video recording, or the transcription, for 24 hours after the call ends. The moderator can share the transcription with the meeting attendees. Those attending a Premium call from the Brave browser can click  in the Brave Sidebar to ask Leo to summarize key points both during and after the meeting. Don’t see the sidebar? Visit Settings » Appearance, and toggle on Show Sidebar button. Afterwards, click the icon that appears in the address bar to use Leo in the Sidebar.</p>
<p>Note that Leo in Brave Talk calls are subject to Leo’s standard rate limits.</p>

The development for Stage 5 is complete and will be announced separately.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management and basic disclosures. The team has made significant progress on Stage 6 development and is looking forward to releasing it for community testing by mid-April.&nbsp;</p> Stage 7 developments <p>Stage 7 of the testnet will allow testers to swap zAssets on top 3 Swap protocols on Polygon, including Uniswap V3 while keeping and tracking your operation history in the dApp. The team plans to work on the Stage 7 development in April. </p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

  Brave is excited to announce the release of Leo on iOS, completing the roll-out of our new privacy-preserving AI assistant.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Recently, Brave announced the first step of our goal to bring Leo—our privacy-preserving AI assistant in the browser—to Brave mobile with our <a>Android release</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Brave is happy to announce the completion of this goal, with the release of Leo for iOS. iPhone and iPad users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages and PDFs, translate pages, create content, and more from the browser address bar.</p>
<p>Leo enables natural conversations on a wide range of topics. With AI built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way.</p>
<p>For the second half of our mobile launch, we’ve added in a special feature available only on iOS. With voice-to-text capability, iOS users can speak their input and have it converted to text without needing to type. This streamlines the interaction and makes conveying information to the AI assistant even easier. Couple this with document integrations and <a>new models like Mixtral</a>, and Leo for iOS becomes a powerful, mobile AI assistant you can take with you wherever you go.</p>

 What can Leo do? 
<p>Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages you’re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:</p>
 
 Create real-time summaries of webpages and PDFs 
 Answer questions about content 
 Get instant answers for queries 
 Generate new long-form written content such as reports, articles, or social media 
 Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them 
 Write and suggest software code for multiple languages&nbsp; 
 
<p>In addition to these great core use cases, we integrated Leo in the Brave browser app especially with mobile users in mind, including:</p>
 
 Voice-to-text: Use your iOS device’s voice-to-text functionality to speak prompts directly to Leo, converting your spoken words into written text without typing. 
 Docs and PDF summaries: Leo can summarize different types of content files—including PDFs—making it much easier to consume dense content on a small screen. 
 Google Docs integration: You can use Leo to power your mobile productivity with the Google Docs and Google Sheets integration. Brainstorm and assist on writing, create quick summaries, translate, and more. 
 
<p>With Leo on iOS, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, there’s no login or signup required—you just open your browser and chat.</p>

 Mixtral as the default LLM brings higher quality answers 
<p>Brave Leo gives access to several high-quality large-language models (LLMs), ensuring better, more relevant answers to even niche questions, and fewer of the hallucinations that plague other AI experiences.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Leo includes access to Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B. Mixtral—the default LLM—can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, <a>we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM</a> for Leo on desktop, and we’ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for iOS as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.</p>

 Leo Premium&nbsp; 
<p>The Brave Leo experience is free to all users. For those who’d like access to higher rate limits, however, Leo is also available as a Premium experience. Users can subscribe to Leo Premium for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$14.99/month</a>, and one subscription covers up to 5 different devices across iOS, Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.</p>

 Smart AI, still private by default 
<p>As with all of Brave’s other features, privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. These specific privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address. 
 Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as <a>IP address</a>), and no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models. If you select a model from Anthropic and submit Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted. See more in our <a>Privacy Policy</a>. 
 No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo. 
 Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience. 
 

 What’s next for Leo, and how to get started 
<p>Brave Leo for iOS is now available to all Brave iOS users who’ve updated to version 1.63. Note that it will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today.</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on page chat experience, iOS users can tap “…” and then tap Leo to get started.</p>
<p>Leo is an opt-in feature and can be disabled at any time. Users can easily disable auto suggestions by going to Settings, tapping Leo and disabling Show autocomplete suggestions in the address bar.</p>

<p>Anish Mohammed, Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist at Panther Protocol, recently joined Meher Roy on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwhBWdn3R5M&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Epicenter Podcast</a>. They discussed Anish’s journey into crypto, the genesis of Panther Protocol, how Panther will preserve the privacy of its users, what’s coming in its Mainnet launch, and its mission to enable privacy and compliance in the DeFi space.&nbsp;</p> Who is Anish Mohammed? <p>Anish Mohammed’s foray into the tech world began at Ericsson, where he developed payment systems and became familiar with cryptography. His two decade-long career in security and cryptography has seen him design and audit several blockchain protocols and advise leading Web3 projects. His previous roles include being the lead security architect at HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group, and he’s held strategic positions at Accenture and Capgemini. Four years ago, Anish and Oliver Gale embarked on a journey to found Panther Protocol, a Zero-Knowledge, cross-protocol layer to safeguard user data and facilitate compliant DeFi access.</p> The need to preserve privacy and enable compliance <p>Panther Protocol addresses a critical gap in current blockchain technologies, where public ledgers like Bitcoin and Ethereum expose all transactions and smart contract interactions. This lack of privacy can disadvantage high-performing investors and significantly impact high-volume traders and corporations, who may want to protect the insights and advantages (or alpha) gleaned from their trading strategies. Unlike many 'dark’ pools and privacy chains, which lack transparency and complicate regulatory compliance, Panther provides DeFi users with access to its privacy-preserving protocol but also enables their transaction history to be disclosed to anyone of their choosing, in part or as a whole, at will, enabling compliance. For example, a user might disclose certain information to a tax authority or a regulator, as required in their jurisdiction. Panther uses Zero-Knowledge proof-enabled KYC checks to ensure malicious actors do not use the protocol.</p> Preserving privacy amid disclosure <p>While Panther Protocol allows users to disclose transactions as needed, Panther takes steps to ensure there is always sufficient overall volume to mask non-disclosed transactions effectively.</p><p>One key component of how this gets done is via network participants who are rewarded for staking their assets to generate additional transactions and increase liquidity pools. In the process, the privacy of non-disclosed transactions is preserved.&nbsp;</p> The importance of Shielded Pools for DeFi's future <p>Shielded Pools are at the heart of Panther Protocol, offering a privacy-centric solution for DeFi transactions. These pools, supported by advanced cryptographic methods like zk-SNARKs, allow users to transact while retaining the option to disclose information for compliance. The Shielded Pool is pivotal for the Protocol, enabling users to interact with DeFi applications privately and securely.</p><p>For a deeper dive into Shielded Pools, including the intricacies of Zones and Zone Managers, visit<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-shielded-pools-the-cornerstone-of-panther-protocol/"> Panther’s blog on </a>Shielded Pools.</p> What’s coming in Panther’s Mainnet beta launch? <p>Anish presented some of the features that Protocol participants can expect to see in the upcoming&nbsp; Mainnet beta product:&nbsp;</p>  zAccount registration. A zAccount is your private identity and entry point to Panther, aligning with KYC protocols and using Zero-Knowledge proofs.  Privacy-staking reward mechanism: Panther incentivizes network participants to enhance the pool’s transaction set and liquidity by staking assets.  Transactions and communication between Zones: exchange of assets and information across different Zones in Panther.  Withdrawals: The action of converting and transferring zAssets back to standard tokens.  Basic disclosures: The user can reveal details about transactions conducted within Panther, allowing for compliance and verification.  Advanced disclosures: Offers users the capability to selectively disclose specific aspects of their transactions, providing flexibility in privacy and compliance.  zAccount renewals: Regular verification and update of a user’s KYC information to ensure ongoing compliance and integrity of their zAccount.  DeFi Swap adapter: A tool that integrates Panther with external DeFi platforms, facilitating private and compliant swaps and other transactions.  zTrade: Zero-Knowledge trades with others in the same Zone.   Conclusion <p>As DeFi continues to evolve, the need for on-chain privacy solutions that accommodate regulatory compliance becomes increasingly critical. Panther Protocol, under the guidance of Co-Founder Anish Mohammed, is at the forefront of addressing this challenge. By pioneering Shielded Pools and facilitating the role of Zone Managers, Panther is setting a new standard for privacy preservation and compliance in DeFi. Panther Protocol’s innovative approach protects users’ data and paves the way for institutional participation in the DeFi ecosystem. As Panther progresses toward its next development phases, the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">call for testers</a> lets you, the community contribute to a more private and compliant DeFi future.&nbsp;</p><p>Join Panther’s journey in shaping a balanced world where privacy meets compliance, empowering users and institutions to navigate the DeFi landscape securely and transparently.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

         TL;DR&nbsp; 
 
 Horizen’s proof verification chain is live on testnet!&nbsp; 
 Aims to redefine blockchain efficiency with ZK proof verification and settlement layers 
 Marks a significant milestone for web3 as the first instance of a modular proof verification network 
 Future plans include enhancing zkStack compatibility and opening up testnet access to the public 
 
<p>We are excited to announce that Horizen has achieved a major milestone: the deployment of our proof verification chain to testnet.&nbsp; This leap forward signals a new era for the Horizen ecosystem, where we aim to redefine blockchain efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
 Backstory: 
<p>Horizen is pioneering a new layer in the modular blockchain stack focusing on ZK proofs verification and settlement. This focus dramatically reduces costs and improves efficiency for zk rollups and appchains. Following the passing of <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP 42400</a>, we have been heads down building and leveraging dev tools like Substrate, Polkascan, and other open-source resources to bring our vision to life rapidly. Check out this 10-minute demo to see Horizen’s proof verification chain live in action!</p>     
 

 
                     
             
                                    
                                 
            
         
        
             

 
         
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why This Matters? 
<p>The launch of this testnet marks a significant point for the broader web3 space as the first instance of a modular proof verification network. The New Horizen network is composed of the following key components:</p>
 
 A Revamped Mainchain: Powered by Substrate, the Horizen mainchain is the foundation for our modular proof verification network. This network allows for the exchange of $ZEN (Horizen’s native token) and verification of FFLONK Proofs produced by Polygon zkEVM instances. 
 Proof Submission Interface: A user-friendly interface that enables zk-rollups to submit proofs seamlessly to the Horizen network for verification. 
 Attestation Mechanism: A protocol published on date to Ethereum and validates proofs (providing additional transparency). 
 New Horizen Smart Contract: The storage and validation mechanism on Ethereum that allows Horizen users to verify that their proof was included in an attestation. 
 Polygon zk-EVM Rollup: A rollup built with Polygon’s CDK that generates and submits proofs to Horizen’s proof verification chain. 
 
 Looking Ahead: 
<p>Celebrating this milestone is just the beginning. Horizen is committed to pioneering advancements in the modular blockchain space, focusing on dramatically reducing costs and improving efficiency for rollups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are already setting our sights on the next development phase, with lots of exciting developments on the horizon!</p>
<p>Here’s what you can expect from us in the coming months:</p>
 
 Enhanced Compatibility with zkStack: We aim to expand the compatibility of New Horizen with zkStack, and further broaden its interoperability and market reach. 
 Opening Up Access to the Public: In the spirit of bringing our community along for feedback, we will open up access for the Horizen community to run testnet nodes and become validators.

 Introducing Switch — The Gateway Currency to Switch Between Stablecoins on&nbsp;Verus  Switch is a decentralized currency fully backed by VRSC, DAI, USDC &amp; EURC. Use it to switch between Verus and the different stablecoins. Or hold it while it accrues value from conversion fees.  ⏱️ Switch is launched on block: 2,984,851 (Saturday 30 March,&nbsp;2024).  🔁 Convert VRSC, DAI, USDC or EURC to Switch, or vice versa. Or use Switch as an AMM and convert the reserves with each&nbsp;other.  ❓ <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">USDC</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/eurc">EURC</a> are stablecoins issued by <a href="http://www.circle.com">Circle</a>. DAI is a USD stablecoin issued by&nbsp;<a href="https://makerdao.com/en/">Maker</a>.  💸 Low-cost, MEV-resistant DeFi conversions with max. fees of&nbsp;0.05%.  ⌨️ See the Switch statistics (protocol prices, amount in reserves) at <a href="https://cryptodashboard.faldt.net">Cryptodashboard</a> or <a href="https://raw.verus.trading">verus.trading</a>. Or type in /switch in the #trading channel in the <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">community Discord</a>.  📚 Learn in this article how to convert the stables with each other, and how to convert to and from Switch. Also you learn how to bridge EURC or USDC to the Verus&nbsp;network.  What is&nbsp;Switch? <p>Switch is a decentralized currency on the Verus blockchain. It is fully (100%) backed by its reserves. Its initial supply is 20,000&nbsp;Switch.</p>  Its reserves are weighted as follows: VRSC (16%), DAI DAI.vETH (21%), USDC vUSDC.vETH (21%) &amp; EURC EURC.vETH (42%). What does this mean? E.g. when you put EURC in the reserves you get more Switch after preconversion than when you put VRSC&nbsp;in.  Use Switch to convert between any of the reserves for a max. fee of 0.05%. Switch is a MEV-resistant AMM. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Learn more about Verus&nbsp;DeFi.</a>  Switch accrues 50% of the conversion fees — the conversion fees stay in the reserves, increasing the value of&nbsp;Switch.  The other 50% of the conversion fees go to the miners and stakers of&nbsp;Verus.  There is a risk to holding Switch — USDC &amp; EURC are distributed by the centralized company&nbsp;Circle.  The supply of Switch is dynamic. Switch gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETHor EURC.vETH, and get burned when people convert back to the reserves.    Register subIDs— *.Switch@ for a 10 EURC (in Switch) fee. Those fees get burned. <a href="http://docs.verus.io/verusid">Learn more about subIDs (VerusIDs).</a>  Switch is perfect to use with <a href="https://docs.verus.io/veruspay/">VerusPay</a> — Get your local businesses to take DAI, USDC &amp; EURC on Verus. If you hold VRSC, DAI, or USDC and need to buy coffee in EURC, just scan a QR code! Verus scales to everyone worldwide and auto-converts payments from your favorite currency for always low transaction fees &amp; a 0.05% conversion fee.   There was a preconversion period for&nbsp;Switch <p>There was a 7-day preconversion period where the reserves of Switch were filled with VRSC, DAI DAI.vETH, USDC vUSDC.vETH &amp; EURC EURC.vETH. Depending on how much people added they got their fair share of the 20,000 Switch after the 7 day&nbsp;period.</p><p>After the 7-day period Switch became a MEV-resistant AMM. All reserves can now be converted between each&nbsp;other.</p> How to bridge USDC &amp; EURC over to&nbsp;Verus <p>USDC and EURC are ERC-20 token stablecoins issued by Circle. Get them on <a href="http://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> or other exchanges. On the Verus blockchain they are called vUSDC.vETH &amp; EURC.vETH.</p><p>DAI DAI.vETH is readily available on the Verus network. Below are the ERC-20 token contracts for the&nbsp;tokens:</p>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48">USDC token&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x1aBaEA1f7C830bD89Acc67eC4af516284b1bC33c">EURC token&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f">DAI token&nbsp;contract</a>  <p>To be able to use those ERC-20 tokens to preconvert into Switch they need to be bridged to the Verus blockchain. The bridging is done through the non-custodial and trustless Verus-Ethereum Bridge. Bridging and preconverting can be done with <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/mobile">Verus Mobile</a>, <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Verus Desktop</a> (full node) &amp; MetaMask with <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">the bridge&nbsp;website</a>.</p> Verus Mobile&nbsp;bridging <p>Let’s start by bridging with Verus Mobile. First thing to do is to add the ERC-20s in Verus Mobile. This is how to do&nbsp;it:</p>Adding ERC-20s to Verus&nbsp;Mobile.  Press the plus-button bottom-right corner  Press “Add ERC-20&nbsp;Token”  Select checkmark to “Find using mapped PBaaS currency”, and fill in eurc.veth, vusdc.veth or dai.veth. Then press Continue.  Press OK when a warning screen pops&nbsp;up.  <p>Now you are ready to receive USDC, EURC or DAI (as ERC-20s) on Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p><p>Before bridging the tokens over to Verus let’s add the currencies on the Verus blockchain to the&nbsp;wallet:</p>Adding the currencies on the Verus blockchain on Verus&nbsp;Mobile.  Press the plus-button bottom-right corner.  Press “Add PBaaS currency”.  Fill in eurc.veth, vusdc.veth or dai.veth and press continue.  Press “ADD”.  <p>Now we are ready to bridge the ERC-20s over to the Verus blockchain.</p>Bridging EURC to Verus. It will come out as EURC.vETH.  Select the ERC-20 you want to bridge. (In the example we use&nbsp;EURC).  Press “Send” and then “Convert or cross-chain”.  Press “Send off-chain”.  As the recipient address fill in a Verus address you own (R- or i-address, or VerusID).  Fill in the amount you want to bridge&nbsp;over.  Then as “Select network to send to” choose&nbsp;Verus  Then as “Select currency to receive as” choose EURC.vETH  <p>That’s it. It can take up to 90 minutes before the ERC-20 arrives as a currency on&nbsp;Verus.</p> Bridging with&nbsp;MetaMask <p>Let’s bridge with MetaMask and the <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">Verus-Ethereum Bridge&nbsp;website</a>:</p>Bridging with MetaMask to a Verus-address, EURC used as&nbsp;example.  Connect MetaMask with this website: <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">https://eth.verusbridge.io/</a>  Address: where you want the DAI, USDC or EURC to end up on the Verus blockchain (as DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH or EURC.vETH)  Select token: [Euro Coin] as EURC.vETH, [0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48] as vUSDC.vETH or&nbsp;DAI.vETH  Destination: select the same&nbsp;… on&nbsp;VRSC  Choose the amount you want to bridge&nbsp;over  It may take up to 90 minutes before the funds arrive on&nbsp;Verus   Convert DAI, USDC, EURC &amp; VRSC with each&nbsp;other <p>Now that Switch is fully launched you can convert between VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH and EURC.vETH. It’s now an AMM. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Learn more on Verus DeFi&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Convert with Verus Desktop or Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p> Convert with Verus&nbsp;Desktop <p>On Verus Desktop click the “Convert Currencies”-button and then go to the “Advanced”-tab.</p>Convert all Switch reserves with each other on Verus&nbsp;Desktop.  Choose amount to&nbsp;send  “From Currency”: fill in DAI.vETH&nbsp;, vUSDC.vETH, EURC.vETH, VRSC  “To Currency”: fill in DAI.vETH&nbsp;, vUSDC.vETH, EURC.vETH, VRSC  “Via Currency”: fill in&nbsp;Switch  “Destination Address”: fill in a R-/i-address or VerusID where you want to receive the currency.  Now click “Convert Currencies”, and that’s it! Wait between 1 and 5 blocks and you will receive the&nbsp;amount.  <p>If you want to convert to&nbsp;Switch:</p>  “To Currency”: to&nbsp;Switch  Leave out “Via Currency”   Convert with Verus&nbsp;Mobile Convert all Switch reserves with each other on Verus&nbsp;Mobile.  Press DAI.vETH&nbsp;, vUSDC.vETH, EURC.vETH, VRSC  Press “Send” and then “Convert or cross-chain”  Press “Convert currency”  As the recipient address fill in a Verus address you own (R- or i-address, or VerusID) or self to receive it on the same address where you send it&nbsp;from.  Fill in the amount you want to&nbsp;convert  Then as “Select currency to convert to” choose what you want to convert it&nbsp;to.  The network to send to is “current network” =&nbsp;Verus  Now press “Send” and confirm, and that’s it! You now have to wait between 1 and 5 blocks and you will see the currency in your&nbsp;wallet.

 Introducing Pure — The Currency 100% Backed by Verus &amp;&nbsp;Bitcoin  Pure is a decentralized currency fully backed by Verus (VRSC) &amp; Bitcoin (tBTC). Hold Pure to be exposed to both Verus and Bitcoin while accruing fees from conversions. Or use it to convert from tBTC to VRSC and vice&nbsp;versa.  ⏱️ Pure is launched on block: 2,975,703 (Sunday 24 March,&nbsp;2024).  🔁 Convert tBTC &amp; VRSC to Pure, or vice versa. Or use Pure as an AMM and convert tBTC &amp; VRSC with each&nbsp;other.  ❓ tBTC is BTC on the Ethereum network. <a href="http://threshold.network/">Threshold.network</a> supplies a decentralized bridge for users to bridge BTC to Ethereum. tBTC is also bridged to Verus (as tBTC.vETH).  ⌨️ See the Pure statistics (protocol prices, amount in reserves) at <a href="https://cryptodashboard.faldt.net">Cryptodashboard</a> or <a href="https://raw.verus.trading">verus.trading</a>. Or type in /pure in the #trading channel in the <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">community Discord</a>.  📚 Learn in this article how to convert tBTC &amp; VRSC with each other, and how to convert to and from Pure. Also you learn how to bridge tBTC to the Verus&nbsp;network.  What is&nbsp;Pure? <p>Pure is a decentralized currency launched on the Verus blockchain. It is fully backed by its reserves: Verus (VRSC) and Bitcoin (tBTC), with a reserve ratio of&nbsp;50/50%.</p><p>The currency is called Pure because it aligns with the true ideals of decentralization and transparency:</p>  Bitcoin and Verus are fully decentralized and controlled by its nodes and block producers. No single entity or company controls them. They are not a business — they are rent-free protocols.  Bitcoin and Verus had fair launches. No ICO, no premine and no developer fees or&nbsp;taxes.  Bitcoin and Verus have a limited&nbsp;supply.  Bitcoin and Verus are censorship-resistant.  <p>Hold Pure to be exposed to two decentralized cryptocurrencies upholding true cypherpunk values.</p> Pure is an&nbsp;AMM <p>Another benefit of holding Pure is that the currency accrues conversion fees. When users convert from Pure to VRSC or tBTC (or vice versa) they pay a conversion fee of 0.025%. When users convert between VRSC and tBTC they pay a conversion fee of&nbsp;0.05%.</p><p>Half of those conversion fees (50%) stay in the Pure reserves, increasing the value of Pure since no new Pure is minted. The conversions are MEV-resistant and verified by the miners and stakers of the protocol. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Learn more about Verus&nbsp;DeFi</a>.</p><p>Conversions between VRSC and tBTC are only possible after the preconversion period has ended on Sunday 24 March,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Users can also create subIDs which cost 0.00021 tBTC.vETH (in Pure). These costs are burned reducing Pure in circulation. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Learn more about VerusID and what you can do with it here</a>. If users create an identity with your subID as referral, they pay 2/3 less — you get 1/3 and 1/3 is discounted.</p> Preconversion period before the launch of&nbsp;Pure <p>Before Pure was fully launched, there was an 8-day preconversion period. In that period users could fund the reserves of Pure with VRSC and tBTC. During this period no conversions could be done. Depending on how much they added they got their fair share of 20,000 Pure after the 8 day&nbsp;period.</p><p>The initial supply of Pure was 20,000. After the initial supply has been distributed by the protocol, the supply became dynamic. When users convert from VRSC or tBTC into Pure, Pure is minted. When people convert from Pure back to VRSC or tBTC, the Pure is&nbsp;burned.</p><p>Learn below how Pure was launched without any coding needed. Just a simple API&nbsp;call:</p> What is tBTC, how do I get it &amp; bridge it to&nbsp;Verus? <p>tBTC is BTC on the Ethereum network. The decentralized bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum is supplied by the <a href="http://www.threshold.network/">Threshold Network</a>.</p><blockquote>Existing solutions that bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum require users to send their Bitcoin to an intermediary, in exchange for an ERC-20 token that represents the original asset. This centralized model requires you to trust a third party and is susceptible to censorship, threatening the premise of Bitcoin as sovereign, secure, permissionless digital&nbsp;asset.</blockquote><blockquote>The second generation of tBTC is a truly decentralized (and scalable) bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It provides Bitcoin holders secure and open access to the broader DeFi ecosystem. tBTC v2 allows you to unlock your Bitcoin’s value to borrow and lend, mint stablecoins, provide liquidity, and much&nbsp;more.</blockquote><p>Get tBTC on Kraken, Uniswap, Curve &amp; others. <a href="https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint">Or mint it&nbsp;yourself</a></p><p>tBTC token address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88">https://etherscan.io/token/0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88</a></p><p>You can send tBTC to your MetaMask wallet or Verus Mobile first, and later you have to bridge it to the Verus blockchain.

<p>We’ve gathered insights from our team of web3 experts who are eager to share their most valuable tips with you. Whether you’re just considering using blockchain or already knee-deep in the technology, our experts have got you covered. With our wealth of experience and learnings along the way, our web3 experts are here to offer you valuable insights and guidance.</p>



<p>Top web3 expert tips for web3 projects:</p>



 
 Decrease time to market 



 Ask the community to avoid mistakes 



 Address compliance at an early stage 



 Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 
 



<p></p>



 Expert Tip #1: Decrease time to market 



<p>In the fast-paced web3 world, time is everything. New applications pop up daily, not to mention the numerous new players that enter the space.</p>



<p>By decreasing the time to market, you can launch your product before your competitors. Additionally, it allows you to receive feedback from the (web3) community early on, which can help you refine your product. But remember, this whole web3 space is also new to them. Innovation takes time to sink in. Finally, a faster time-to-market can help you avoid running out of resources before your product even gets to market.</p>



<p>Simplicity is key. By prioritising a smooth and seamless process, and abstracting away as much technical complexity as possible, you create better experiences for your customers and increase your chances of success.</p>







<p></p>



 Expert Tip #2: Ask the community to avoid mistakes 



<p>For a novel and complex technology, it is essential to have a second pair of eyes on all your software. By involving the community and asking for help, you can ensure that your project is built on a solid foundation and has the best chance of success.</p>



<p>Many projects fail because people rush into building something without asking around. Newcomers to the field may not realise the potential challenges they could encounter, many of which may have already been resolved by others. There are public forums for developers and all types of project participants, including technology-focused and business-focused groups.</p>



<p>However, in the web3 space, there remain many solutions that are new and lack proper documentation, making it even more critical to consider what works and what doesn’t work. So, how do you ensure you get the best advice?</p>



<p>Firstly, ensure that you talk to a diverse group of industry players from different budgets and backgrounds. Secondly, clearly understand your project requirements and what you need help with. Clear communication will help your community understand what it is you are trying to achieve and where you might need improvements. Finally, always be respectful and appreciative of people’s time and efforts.</p>



<p></p>



 Expert Tip #3: Address compliance at an early stage 



<p>Before spending a considerable amount on building a minimum viable product (MVP), it is crucial to at least have a quick chat with a seasoned lawyer, to explore potential legal issues. A relatively small investment will help to identify any legal challenges related to your plans. For example, regulatory issues for custodial wallets, property law for tokenisation, intellectual property for NFTs, and GDPR compliance for web3 wallets and public chains. <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy/">Inserting legal know-how at an early stage</a> might save tons of costs and a lot of time. It might prevent you from completely re-developing or spending precious resources on a project doomed from a regulatory perspective. Professional legal involvement will sit well with investors too.</p>



<p>At Zaisan, we understand that the law might look like a scary beast, but that compliance is essential for the success of your blockchain project. It’s too often that this initial, relatively small spending saves the day.</p>



   



 Expert Tip #4: Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 



<p>One common challenge faced by many blockchain projects is the lack of users, particularly those projects that rely on transactional volumes such as wallets, exchanges, and marketplaces. Furthermore, when a project has a tradable token, there is a high chance that it can become volatile, which can make the project unusable. To mitigate these risks, we suggest that you ensure your project is sustainable through budget planning and mitigating volatility risks by hedging.</p>



<p>It’s important to avoid basing your business model solely on the token on which it is running. Instead, use business logic and design the project in a way that it doesn’t have overdependence on the system token. You could mitigate the risk by using stablecoins and a variable pricing model.</p>



<p>Introducing crypto or tokens to a project has its pros and cons. On the one hand, leveraging cryptocurrency or tokens can provide a new level of flexibility and accessibility, enabling streamlined transactions and potentially unlocking new revenue streams. Additionally, it can foster community engagement and loyalty through token incentives and reward systems. However, this approach also comes with its challenges, including regulatory compliance complexities, volatility in token values, and the need for robust security measures to safeguard against cyber threats and fraud. Therefore, careful consideration and strategic planning are essential to navigate the intricacies of integrating crypto or tokens effectively into a project. </p>

The podcast focused on discussing on-chain privacy, the vision and progress of Panther Protocol, and our milestones ahead.</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update <p>We’re glad to share that we’ve debuted on<a href="https://airdrops.io/panther-protocol/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Airdrops.io</a> to promote Panther testnet rewards and welcome more participants to Panther community. The testnet currently has over 1500 participants, and we’ve distributed over 500,000 $ZKP as rewards.</p><p>The team is planning to launch a Zealy-based incentivized ambassador program next week to further improve community participation and promote Panther.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our testnet rewards pot is 2 million $ZKP — have you signed up for our test dApp yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testing group and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a third party Relayer service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract. The team is currently performing integration testing with the second Relayer. Overall, the team is pleased with how well the end-to-end Relayer integration process is working. The team is still working on Stage 5 in parallel with other stages and expects to release it next week for community testing.</p><p>As you might be aware, Oshiya (previously known as Miner) optimizes gas usage by processing batches of newly created UTXOs and updating a Zero-Knowledge proof in a Merkle tree, which introduces a slight delay in batch creation. This process takes place in what’s called the Bus Tree, likened to the communal efficiency of a bus ride.</p><p>For users seeking immediate UTXO updates in the Merkle tree, we offer the Taxi Tree option, which promises faster processing, similar to taking a taxi. Last week, our team successfully deployed the Taxi Tree contract on the Mumbai testnet. The user interface has been updated to allow users to choose between Regular Processing (using the Bus) and Fast Processing (using a Taxi). In Stage 6, users will also be able to compare the network costs associated with these two processing options.</p><p>In addition, we have developed an exchange contract to facilitate the payment of Relayers in native tokens. This contract enables the conversion of $ZKP to $Matic via UniswapV3 on the Polygon network, streamlining transactions and enhancing our ecosystem’s functionality.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. The FeeMaster contract has been upgraded and is currently being reviewed. We anticipate that the Fee Master review will be complete this week and ready for deployment.&nbsp;</p><p>Smart Contracts for Stage 6 is completed with final rounds of internal testing ongoing. The next two weeks will be utilized to get the dApp development close to completion and launch stage 6 for community testing by the end of the month however, we will know precise dates after a week.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>As technology progresses, infrastructure should be commoditised, especially in Web3, in order to avoid the creation of bottlenecks and gatekeepers. Blockchains are naturally oblivious to off-chain data, so they need oracles to fetch data. However, given their past technical limitations, oracles have failed to provide a decentralised and permissionless framework for data query.

        <p>This ZenIP proposes lowering the thresholds required for:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) formally submitting both technical and non-technical improvement proposals; and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) achieving a quorum of votes for both technical and non-technical improvement proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes would increase accessibility for community members to put forth proposals and would bring quorum requirements in line with the broader web3 industry standards. Please note that these proposed changes apply to both Zen improvement proposals (ZenIPs) and EON improvement proposals (EONIPs).</p>
<p>ZenIP 42401 aims to make it easier for community members to participate in governance by lowering the $ZEN threshold required for posting a non-technical ZenIP/ EONIP for community vote, as well as lowering the quorum threshold for a vote to be considered valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current thresholds for both ZenIPs and EONIPs are as follows:</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 200,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 10% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 
<p>This ZenIP proposes the following changes to the thresholds:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 200,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating (vs. 10% currently) 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 25,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 100,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 3% of circulating supply participating (vs. 5% currently) 
 
 
 
<p>Again, if ZenIP 42401 passes, these changes will apply to both ZenIPs and EONIPs. There are also no changes proposed to the majority requirements for either proposal type (i.e., 67% of votes in favor for technical proposals, simple majority in favor for non-technical proposals).</p>
 ZenIP Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are public proposals for the Horizen community to approve or decline. We encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> on ZenIP 42401 and share your thoughts on the proposal. We also encourage you to read the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42401-updating-proposal-and-quorum-thresholds/440">ZenIP 42401: Updating Proposal and Quorum Thresholds</a> post on Discourse to get a complete understanding of this proposal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42401 will start on Tuesday, March 12th, 2024 at 12pm EST and end on Friday, March 15th, 2024 at 12pm EST.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen DAO voting is done on the Horizen EON chain, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. The snapshot is taken once voting begins.</p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see the vote instructions detailed tutorial, please have a look to the dedicated blogpost. Below we cover an overview of how to vote.&nbsp;</p>
 How to vote – Instructions 
<p>Your vote will be weighted regarding the tokens you hold, either on the Horizen mainchain (the historic one) or Horizen EON (the EVM chain).</p>
<p>If you already linked your mainchain address for a previous vote, you won’t have to connect it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Connect your wallet and verify if it’s properly linked here.</a></p>
<p>The vote happens on Snapshot and is done through MetaMask and therefore via the Horizen EON network.</p>
<p>Before going through the tutorial, we assume that the Horizen EON network is properly configured on your MetaMask wallet. If not, <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">please follow this guide</a>.</p>
 A/ You already voted and linked you mainchain address 
<p>Then it’s very simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still encourage you to verify if your mainchain address is properly linked on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance app</a>.</p>
<p>If it’s not linked, follow the tutorial just below.</p>
<p>If it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
 B/ You have to link your mainchain address 
<p>1/ First, make sure to have some ZEN on Horizen EON, you will need some gas tokens in order to interact with the EVM chain, link your address, and vote.</p>
<p>2/ Now it’s time to link your mainchain address(es). Any ZEN on Arizen, Sphere By Horizen, ZEN wallet, Swing wallet, or multi-sig wallets, Ledger, ZEN on exchanges are usable. Here, we will focus on Sphere By Horizen. If you need assistance for non Sphere By Horizen wallets linking, please have a look to this <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/how-to-link-the-mainchain-address-to-the-horizen-eon-address/174">post on the Horizen forum</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get a more <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">detailed tutorial with a screenshot in the Governance doc</a>, but here are the steps:</p>
 
 Make sure Horizen EON is configured on MetaMask and to have some ZEN on there thanks to the steps stated above. 
 Open the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance</a> page. 
 Click Connect Wallet. The EON wallet (MetaMask) appears in the top-right corner. Once connected, the EON address field is automatically filled with the connected EON address.
 
 Note: If the EON wallet (MetaMask) was previously connected to the Horizen Governance app, then it is automatically connected. 
 
 
 Open Sphere By Horizen and navigate to the mainchain wallet address you want to link to the EON address. Click the Information icon to view your address. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, click Link Mainchain Address.&nbsp; 
 The Link Address pop-up appears. Paste the Sphere wallet address in the Mainchain Address field. 
 Copy your EON address. 
 In Sphere, go to the Addresses pane. Click the compose icon (hand holding pencil). 
 The Sign message with address pop-up appears. Paste the EON address in the message field and click on Create signature. The mainchain signature appears below the message field. Then click on COPY TO CLIPBOARD. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, paste the signature in the Mainchain Signature field. 
 Click Link. The Pending pop-up appears stating that the transaction is being submitted. 
 The MetaMask Notification appears. Read the information details. Click Confirm. 
 The Linked Address appears showing that the EON Address and Mainchain Address are linked 
 You can repeat the process for other addresses. 
 
<p>Now that it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We also have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>If you are a ZEN holder, you have the possibility to vote on the Horizen improvement proposals: the ZenIPs and EONIPs. Your vote will be weighted regarding the tokens you hold, either on the Horizen mainchain (the historic one) or Horizen EON (the EVM chain).</p>
<p>If you already linked your mainchain address for a previous vote, you won’t have to connect it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Connect your wallet and verify if it’s properly linked here</a></p>
<p>The vote happens on Snapshot and is done through MetaMask and therefore via the Horizen EON network.</p>
<p>Before going through the tutorial, we assume that the Horizen EON network is well configured on your MetaMask wallet. If not, <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">please follow this guide</a>.</p>
 A/ You already voted and linked your mainchain address 
<p>Then it’s very simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still encourage you to verify if your mainchain address is properly linked on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance app</a>.</p>
<p>If it’s not linked, follow the tutorial just below.</p>
<p>If it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
 B/ You have to link your mainchain address 
<p>1/ First, make sure to have some ZEN on Horizen EON, you will need some gas tokens in order to interact with the EVM chain, link your address, and vote.</p>
<p>To do that:</p>
 
 Download and create an address on Sphere By Horizen if you don’t have any. You will also have to send some ZEN to this address; 
 Open the address you want to use, select the option to send ZEN; 
 Check the “Sidechain transaction” button to make appear the list of Horizen sidechains 
 Select “Horizen EON”; 
 Enter YOUR MetaMask address in the “Send to” field; 
 Enter the amount you want to send, knowing that 0.1ZEN will be largely enough; 
 Then click on “confirm”; 
 Some minutes after, you should see the ZEN on your MetaMask wallet, so let’s go for the next step; 
 
<p></p>
<p>2/ Now it’s time to link your mainchain addresses. Any ZEN on Arizen, Sphere By Horizen, ZEN wallet, Swing wallet, or multi-sig wallets, Ledger, ZEN on exchanges are usable. Here, we will focus on Sphere By Horizen. If you need assistance for non Sphere By Horizen wallets linking, please have a look to this <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/how-to-link-the-mainchain-address-to-the-horizen-eon-address/174">post on the Horizen forum</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get a more <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">detailed tutorial with a screenshot in the Governance doc</a>, but here are the steps:</p>
 
 Make sure Horizen EON is configured on MetaMask and to have some ZEN on there thanks to the steps stated above. 
 Open the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance</a> page. 
 Click Connect Wallet. The EON wallet (MetaMask) appears in the top-right corner. Once connected, the EON address field is automatically filled with the connected EON address.
 
 Note: If the EON wallet (MetaMask) was previously connected to the Horizen Governance app, then it is automatically connected. 
 
 
 Open Sphere By Horizen and navigate to the mainchain wallet address you want to link to the EON address. Click the Information icon to view your address, then Copy it. 
 
<p></p>
 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, click Link Mainchain Address. 
 The Link Address pop-up appears. Paste the Sphere wallet address in the Mainchain Address field. 
 Copy the EON address from the connected wallet to the Horizen Governance app. 
 In Sphere, go to the Addresses pane. Click the compose icon (hand holding pencil). 
 
<p></p>
 
 The Sign message with address pop-up appears. Paste the EON address in the message field and click on Create signature. The mainchain signature appears below the message field. Then click on COPY TO CLIPBOARD. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Click COPY TO CLIPBOARD. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, paste the signature in the Mainchain Signature field. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Click Link. The Pending pop-up appears stating that the transaction is being submitted. 
 The MetaMask Notification appears. Read the information details. Click Confirm. 
 The Linked Address appears showing that the EON Address and Mainchain Address are linked 
 You can repeat the process for other addresses. 
 
<p>Now that it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the adoption of blockchain-based payment surges, the need for on-chain privacy is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-files-for-privacy-etf-with-sec-zcash-part-of-offering.htm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=Crypto-focused%20asset%20manager%20Grayscale,be%20an%20industry-first%20fund">capturing the spotlight</a>. Privacy is particularly important for institutional users and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs). And, the problem is that any public, pseudonymous blockchain reveals transaction details.&nbsp;</p><p>From wallet addresses, to gas fees, to transaction value, and the tokens traded; transaction data is public. This enables transaction linkage, which exposes a huge data exhaust that may ultimately result in wallet:identity mapping. Simply attempting to make a trade can trigger MEV front-running; even price discovery can be followed. Neither privacy nor confidentiality are a feature of public ledgers.</p><p>Let’s examine how Panther’s multi-chain privacy-preserving protocol intends to offer users access to public ledger liquidity while providing transactional anonymity.&nbsp;</p> A vision for regulatory-compliant, on-chain privacy <p>Panther Protocol breaks the links between the wallet initiating the trade and the trade itself, i.e. it enhances transaction privacy: specifically, it preserves identity, the assets traded, and value transferred. This privacy is granted by Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pools</a>. Shielded Pools, known in TradFi as dark pools, obscure the trade initiator whose privacy must be preserved from peer traders and external liquidity sources.&nbsp;</p><p>The Shielded Pool acts like a walled garden: only invited users and assets may enter. Assets are deposited in the Panther Vault, part of the Panther Smart Contract, in exchange for a zAsset, or Zero-Knowledge Asset. It’s the zAsset that masks the detail of the user’s trades from observation.</p> What is a zAsset? <p>A zAsset represents a digital asset that users may trade with anonymity within a Panther Shielded Pool. The technology underpinning the zAsset enables trades to be settled privately on a public ledger.</p><p>In essence, the zAsset, is a "mirror" asset that is printed when a digital asset is <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/depositing-transferring-and-withdrawing?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">deposited </a>in the Panther contract. It’s subsequently spent when that asset is withdrawn. Therefore, the zAsset:asset always exists in a strict 1:1 ratio. Users can send, swap, receive, and pay with zAssets within a Shielded Pool.&nbsp;</p> How does a zAsset enhance trading privacy? <p>A zAsset utilizes Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. ZK proofs are cryptographic protocols that enable the prover to demonstrate to the verifier that something is true without revealing the underlying data required to form that proof. For example, you could prove that you are over 18 without providing the birth certificate or ID used to generate that proof, nor indeed your actual age.&nbsp;</p><p>zAssets represent their underlying asset in the form of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). It’s these UTXOs that users trade within a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a>. To store UTXO data on-chain, the Protocol uses ZK-SNARK (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) proofs. This allows a user’s on-chain state to be stored privately and to ensure private state changes, i.e. the UTXO data that represents the asset on-chain is condensed and encrypted. This means that asset balances and balance changes are not publicly available should a Panther account address become known to an observer.&nbsp;</p><p>To the observing world, the only available data that results from a trade is that a UTXO was committed to the smart contract. Only the owner of the UTXO can decrypt the proof and ascertain the value and token that the UTXO represents.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that UTXOs are not all created equal adds further support to the privacy set. The number of UTXOs created as a result of trades does not map to the number of tokens that UTXO represents. Some UTXOs may not even represent an asset, they may prove a zero balance, or null data, allowing the activity level of the protocol itself to also be shielded.&nbsp;</p> Deepening privacy <p>Panther Protocol offers two privacy layers; one is optional, and the other is a feature of the protocol. The zAsset is the protocol’s core feature, and the Panther Relayer is a protocol service provider that adds an additional privacy-enhancing mechanism.</p><p>Panther Relayers provide an additional privacy layer by breaking the link between the initiator of the transaction and the transaction itself. These ecosystem operators charge a fee for:</p>  signing the transactions with their public key  paying the gas fees  relaying bundles of transactions to the Shielded Pool contract&nbsp;  <p>Relayers, therefore, enhance privacy, since observers are unable to pinpoint the actual address that initiated the transaction because the Relayer signs the blockchain transaction with their key.</p> A brighter, more private, public-ledger future <p>Relaying alone goes a long way to confounding transaction linking by disbursing the data exhaust when compared to a peer-to-peer or peer-to-AMM transaction. Combined with zAsset trading, we believe this suite of solutions offers the most robust, and yet compliant, trading privacy mechanism created to date.&nbsp;</p><p>As the global economy migrates to a digital native medium that operates on public ledgers, the utility of on-chain protocols will largely hinge on how effectively they implement features that confer privacy where and when it is needed. We believe that Panther Protocol’s privacy-enhancing technology solves the public ledger privacy problem. Panther Protocol has developed a mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol provides dedicated, customizable space, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a Panther Zone</a>, to empower institutions to trade in Shielded Pools with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the needs of compliant privacy-enabled DeFi in mind, Panther Zones deliver a chain-agnostic, fully decentralized, suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone for privacy-enhanced trading?

Then join our community testers and try out the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">testnet dApp</a>.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

<p>Today, Brave is excited to announce the release of Leo—Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser—on all Android devices. Android users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages, translate pages, create content, and more from both the browser address bar and within the webpage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since launching on desktop three months ago, Brave Leo has seen significant global adoption. With the chat interface built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way. Leo can help users answer questions, navigate different tasks, and accomplish more each day. And the experience has only gotten better—and the answers more accurate and timely—with the addition of new integrations and <a>new models like Mixtral</a>.</p>
<p>Now, that same great Leo experience is available for users with Android phones and tablets. Brave Android users can seamlessly interact with AI without leaving the security of the browser, and maximize productivity no matter where they are.</p>

 What can Leo do? 
<p>Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages you’re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:</p>
 
 Create real-time summaries of webpages or videos 
 Answer questions about content 
 Generate new long form written content 
 Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them 
 Create transcriptions of video or audio content 
 Write code 
 
<p>So what can you do with Leo on mobile? Summarize that long webpage you meant to read at the office, but never got around to. Get help hunting for a product mentioned on that page and compare it to others. Plan a recipe for tonight’s dinner. And get smart travel tips to escape the daily grind.</p>
<p>With Leo on Android, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, there’s no login or signup required—you just open your browser and chat. Privately.</p>

 Mixtral as the default LLM brings higher quality answers 
<p>Brave Leo gives access to several high-quality large-language models (LLMs), ensuring better, more relevant answers to even niche questions, and fewer of the hallucinations that plague other AI experiences.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Leo includes access to Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B. Mixtral—the default LLM—can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. It can even generate code.</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, <a>we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM</a> for Leo on desktop, and we’ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for Android as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.</p>

 Leo Premium&nbsp; 
<p>The Brave Leo experience is free to all users. For those who’d like access to higher rate limits, however, Leo is also available as a Premium experience. Users can subscribe to Leo Premium for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$14.99/month</a>, and one subscription covers up to 5 different devices across Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows. Users log into their Brave account from their other devices with that subscription.</p>

 Smart AI, still private by default 
<p>As with all of Brave’s other features, privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. These specific privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as <a>IP address</a>), and no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models. If you select a model from Anthropic and submit Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo (they access their Premium account if they wish to use Leo across multiple devices however).&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 What’s next for Leo, and how to get started 
<p>Brave Leo for Android is now available to all Brave Android users who’ve updated to version 1.63. Note that it will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today.  Brave Leo for iOS devices will be available in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on page chat experience, Android users can tap “⋮” and then tap Leo to get started.</p>
<p>To learn more about Brave Leo, check out our main product <a>main product page</a>, or see Leo’s product <a>roadmap</a>.</p>

As the leading crypto asset trading service in Japan2, Coincheck aims to leverage its design philosophy as well as its user-friendly UI and UX to foster adoption of USDC in Japan.<br><br>This collaboration represents a significant stride in Coincheck’s efforts to enhance its product offerings, and maintain high standards in UI and UX design.&nbsp;<br><br>“Our collaboration with Coincheck is foundational in bringing the stability and reliability of USDC to the Japanese market,” said Jeremy Allaire, CEO and co-founder of Circle. “We are excited to work with Coincheck to pave the way for a new era in digital finance in Japan.”<br><br>“We are very excited to bring USDC, the global standard of stable tokens, to Japan and work together with Jeremy and the Circle team to develop further the Japanese crypto markets as well as the blockchain ecosystem.” said Oki Matsumoto, Managing Director &amp; Chairman of Coincheck, Inc. / Representative Executive Officer &amp; Chairman of Monex Group, Inc. <br><br>“We are excited to announce the collaboration with Circle to expand the usage of USDC in Japan,” said Satoshi Hasuo, Representative Director and President at Coincheck, Inc. “Stablecoins are becoming increasingly popular among domestic crypto asset users and are expected to be used as a means of payment for transactions involving buying and selling crypto assets and NFTs. Taking a step towards handling USDC, which is a stablecoin backed by high-quality US dollar-denominated reserve assets and compliant with regulations in various countries, holds significant meaning for our company as well as our users.”<br><br><br>1 Certain stablecoins are qualified as electronic payment instruments in Japan and are allowed to be issued and circulated following the revised Payment Services Act that came into effect on June 1, 2023. Once an electronic payment instrument service provider is authorized to handle USDC in Japan under the Payment Services Act, USDC will be qualified as an electronic payment instrument.<br><br>2 Coincheck has been #1 in Japan for the number of crypto asset trading app downloads for five consecutive years (Period: January 2019 to December 2023, Data support: <a href="https://www.apptweak.com/">App Tweak</a>).</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>Another week has flown by in the dynamic world of Panther – now it’s time to share our latest updates and progress with the Panther community! This week’s rundown highlights several key developments and testing from the past week.</p> Ecosystem updates  Blog  - let’s end the taboo of on-chain privacy <p>Our<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lets-end-the-taboo-of-on-chain-privacy/"> latest blog </a>covers why Web3 needs to engage in a more nuanced conversation about the integral roles privacy and transparency play in financial exchange, maintaining fair and free markets, and enabling institutions to conduct daily operations.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Current testnet users: 900+  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 2 million $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Enhancement Stage-1 <p>As we continue to strive for parallel development efforts, a 2-week technical enhancement stage is in progress to implement various fixes from previous stages. This week, we made several enhancements across different components of the protocol, including the Wallet Engine, to boost productivity. This included optimizing its cold start, resolving issues with data passing to the dApp, enabling silent initialization post zAccount activation, and addressing a set of Stage 4 issues. One of the key features to be released as a part of this enhancement stage is the transfer of zZKP from Panther Gas account to regular zAsset and vice-versa.</p><p>The team has further implemented error code mappings focused on enhancing user experience by providing detailed explanations for transaction failures. We are expecting to release stage 1 of enhancements for public testing in the week of February 26.</p> Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a third party Relayer service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract. The team is currently performing integration testing with the second Relayer. Overall, the end-to-end Relayer integration process is working. The team is working on Stage 5 parallel with other stages and is pending the implementation on the dApp side.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of testnet is a complex stage and includes fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal.&nbsp;</p><p>Changes to the smart contract are under development and expected to be completed by next week. The changes for displaying and charging fees from the dApp will require an additional two weeks. We expect to release Stage 6 for public testing in mid-March.&nbsp;</p><p>You can read <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/weekly-update-panther-protocol-feb-16/">last week’s update</a> to learn more about Stage 6 functionalities.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>The monolithic blockchain era appears to be sunsetting. Among the first to contribute to this paradigm shift was Cosmos, which introduced the idea of specialized sovereign blockchains (appchains), made possible by the Cosmos SDK. Nowadays, the modular thesis employs external data availability and even execution solutions, which enables the creation of countless new chains. Each new blockchains comes with its own ‘specs’, and centralised RPC and node providers have to adapt to each chain’s setting. However, the saying ‘Jack of all trades, master of none’ applies in this scenario too - we have often witnessed RPC failures during high demand periods. Lava Network aims to provide a competitive marketplace for RPC and node providers, which would compete based on their performance and user feedback.</p><p>We were joined by Gil and Yair to discuss Lava Network’s RPC decentralisation in the modular, multi-chain landscape.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  High-level overview of Lava Network  What problem Lava Network solves  Decentralised marketplace for RPC providers  Quality of centralised vs. decentralised RPC providers  Gateways  Lava Network participants  Specs &amp; APIs  Quality of service &amp; provider optimizer  How services are priced  Relayers  Modularity &amp; chain abstraction  Magma &amp; Lava mainnet  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/yaircleper">Yair Cleper on LinkedIn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/xgilxgil">Gil Binder on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/lavanetxyz">Lava Network on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>As transparent Central Bank Digital Currency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/euro-backed-stablecoin-eurm-trials-spain?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">(CBDC) pilots</a> continue to gain traction, on-chain privacy has exploded into one of the polarizing issues in the Web3 industry. However, as is the nature of polarizing extremes, neither absolute transparency nor absolute privacy will serve users' real-world needs.</p><p>In fact, the privacy vs. compliance issue has existed and has already largely been solved for, across states and time. Existing systems based in the physical domain tend to operate on the principle of default privacy. As such, state-approved mechanisms are implemented to mitigate against fraud and other dishonest practices. These introduce and enforce transparency, such as mandatory financial reporting and audit requirements. Furthermore, additional privacy protections are extended to individuals and private enterprises such that their financial reporting isn’t exposed.</p><p>In contrast, those blockchain-based, public-ledger systems that underpin DeFi operate on default transparency. This means public ledgers require additional mechanisms that preserve privacy. Then, as per their physical domain equivalents, discoverability features must be implemented to prevent money laundering, tax evasion, and other forms of malicious activity from eluding the state.</p><p>The issue, therefore, is really about Web3 accepting that while DeFi does “solve money”, it must also solve for a balance between privacy and compliance, because money will always be in the domain of the state’s law enforcement (even when the state no longer prints it).</p> Going beyond early teething pains <p>Most Web3 advocates believe that blockchain ecosystems have the potential to provide the best conditions to operate an integrated global economy that is prosperous, liquid, resilient, and fair. However, institutions are never going to agree to operate in a fully transparent environment. Compliant on-chain privacy is the catalyst required to push decentralized financial players to penetrate the mass market.</p><p>To achieve this, the Web3 community must shake off the tendency to polarize DeFi privacy projects as teetering between terrorist financier and a tyrannical surveillance facilitator. While the nascent public ledger privacy sector has been met with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-strong-defense-trial?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">litigation</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/monero-drops-multi-month-lows-binance-delisting?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">critical delistings</a> — it becomes clear that now is the time for a mature solution set that respects the financial privacy rights of institutions and individual users, while providing the compliance features of its physical-domain cousins.</p><p>Now is the time to get serious about adoption. And, to achieve widespread adoption, Web3 needs to engage in a more nuanced conversation about the integral roles privacy and transparency play in facilitating the fundamental process of exchange, maintaining fair and free markets, and enabling institutions to conduct daily operations. In short, these issues are a matter of existential importance to the future of decentralized systems.</p> On-chain privacy, a problem solved <p>Panther Protocol has developed the mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>With Panther, institutional players have access to a suite of DeFi tools to manage dedicated trading spaces, called Zones, to trade digital assets in Shielded Pools — revolutionizing private trades with public, on-chain settlement.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Zones</a> are highly customizable, as are their disclosure mechanisms. The Panther suite empowers institutions to leverage privacy-protocol trades with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the operational efficiencies of institutions in mind, Panther simplifies portfolio and asset management with a suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol recognizes that the path to adoption isn’t about the mechanics of privacy, transparency, or discoverability, per se; it’s about providing meaningful abstraction to the end user. Panther’s Privacy Protocol is doing for the on-chain domain what the Microsoft Office suite did for the personal computer — delivering abstractions that make it usable. However, unlike Microsoft, Panther presents a Web3-native protocol based on chain-agnostic, decentralized principles.</p><p>Here at Panther, we believe that those who understand institutional operations and pain points intimately and who apply the technical know-how to develop versatile on-chain systems with refined privacy functions will be the major winners in Web3’s next major wave: the institutional onboarding process. We intend to spearhead that revolution.</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone? Reach out to us at contact@pantherprotocol.io.</p>

This is because despite vesting progression &amp; completion for various categories (private raise, grants, dev fund, etc.) many entities have chosen to not claim their earned SHD — thus not directly impacting circulating supply (yet). Another key disclaimer is that of the 1.8M SHD dev fund, none of the dev fund SHD is staked / nor active in any capacity so as to not impact staking yield or governance proposals.</p> Protocol Liquidity Matching <p>Another distribution component to note is Protocol Liquidity Match (PLM) — a novel mechanism whereby Shade Protocol loans out tokens in collaboration with other protocols to bootstrap liquidity. This model is favorable as it does not involve an OTC and does not involve any emissions. However, this deal structure was invented prior to full blown decentralized governance; the core contributors are not comfortable categorizing PLM as “LP” without a community vote. As of right now PLM is handled and accounted for from the dev fund until a formal ratification of categorization via the community pool.

<p>As the global need for environmentally conscious energy intensifies, tokenisation emerges as a groundbreaking strategy to democratise energy ownership. Amidst the growing consensus on the need for a shift to renewable resources, the challenge of accessibility and affordability persists. By leveraging blockchain technology to fractionalise ownership of renewable energy assets, tokenisation offers an inclusive pathway for individuals and communities to invest in and benefit from sustainable energy sources. This innovative approach not only aims to lower the barriers to entry in the renewable energy market but also foster a more distributed and participatory energy landscape.</p>



<p></p>



 Democratising energy: The role of tokenisation in ownership 



<p>The shift towards sustainable energy is a global priority, underscored by initiatives like the Paris Agreement, especially within Europe. This movement faces the challenge of perceived high costs and barriers to entry in the renewable energy sector. However, recent commercialisation of energy storage technologies shows significant <a href="https://www.irena.org/Energy-Transition/Technology/Energy-storage-costs">cost reductions</a> in wind, solar power, and grid stability over the past few years. This cost reduction has widened access to renewable energy, allowing a broader spectrum of individuals to benefit from these technologies.</p>



<p></p>



 How tokenisation democratises energy ownership&nbsp; 



<p>Tokenisation plays a pivotal role in further democratising energy ownership. For individuals without direct access to physical assets, such as a roof for solar panels, tokenisation offers a novel solution. Through crypto anchors and property rights encapsulated within tokens, individuals can own a share of an energy asset. This approach not only allows for the ownership of the physical asset but also enables individuals to own carbon credits, kilowatt hours, and even data rights associated with the energy asset.</p>



<p>One such initiative is <a href="https://www.sunified.com/">Sunified</a> –&nbsp; a solar technology company creating critical infrastructure to facilitate yield farming on solar infrastructure. Yield farming is the process of staking or lending cryptocurrency assets within a DeFi protocol’s liquidity pool to receive rewards, often in the form of the protocol’s governance tokens. Liquidity providers are then compensated with an annual percentage yield (APY) in real-time for their contributions as a result. The purpose behind yield farming is to promote the platform’s utilisation and compensate the community for adding liquidity, crucial for the ecosystem’s vitality and growth. Sunified’s initiative also includes storage infrastructure integration into electric vehicles (EVs) and other parts of the energy ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As energy grids undergo a gradual transformation over the next decade, tokenisation offers immense opportunities to introduce new business and ownership models through blockchain and sound crypto infrastructure architectures. This transition presents a unique chance to reconstruct the energy ecosystem, making sustainable energy ownership more accessible and flexible for a wider audience.</p>



<p></p>



 Fractional ownership of solar power&nbsp; 



<p>Fractional ownership in the context of solar power introduces an innovative approach to investing in renewable energy. This concept allows individuals to collectively invest in solar projects, such as solar parks or community solar gardens, through a blend of equity and debt financing. The essence of fractional ownership lies in the tokenisation of solar infrastructure, breaking down the investment into manageable units—whether in the form of €100 blocks or based on the capacity, such as 100 Watt blocks of a solar panel.</p>



<p>A group of experts would initially determine how to capitalise on a solar project, deciding on the mix of equity and debt to make the project investment-ready. This capital structure can then be tokenised, offering participation rights to investors. Tokenisation carves up the asset into fractional pieces, making it possible for a wider audience to invest in solar energy projects.</p>



<p>It is crucial to differentiate between owning a part of the solar park itself and having rights to the energy produced by it. While you might not fractionalise the energy output directly, fractionalising the means of production — i.e., the solar panels and infrastructure — offers a tangible way to invest in solar energy. Fractional ownership and tokenisation democratises access to renewable energy investments, enabling more people to contribute to and benefit from sustainable energy solutions.</p>



<p></p>



 How should a real-world asset, such as energy, be put on the blockchain?&nbsp; 



<p>Placing a real-world asset like energy onto a blockchain involves a multifaceted approach that bridges the physical and digital worlds. With a particular focus on renewable energy sources like solar power, the process starts by establishing a tangible connection or “hook” between the physical asset and its digital representation on the blockchain. This involves integrating a sensor directly into the asset during the manufacturing process, such as embedding it within a solar panel at the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) factory. This sensor plays a crucial role in anchoring the asset across three realms: the physical world, the digital world, and the crypto realm.</p>



<p>The sensor enables tracking of the solar panel’s lifecycle from its inception, including its initial performance and the carbon footprint incurred throughout its supply chain journey. By activating the panel in the field, it is possible to account for its entire lifecycle, including production, deployment, and operational carbon emissions. This comprehensive approach ensures that the asset is not only represented accurately on the blockchain but also that its environmental impact is meticulously accounted for.</p>



<p>This method transcends traditional reliance on third-party verification or trust anchors, reducing the need for intermediaries. Instead, it offers a direct and trustworthy linkage between the real-world asset and its blockchain counterpart. This direct connection is essential for leveraging blockchain’s capabilities to support decentralised and distributed energy systems, which are increasingly becoming bidirectional.&nbsp; Unlike the traditional centralised energy distribution model, where power flows from a central hub to consumers, modern energy grids are evolving to support energy flow in both directions. This shift necessitates new measurement infrastructure to accommodate and accurately represent these changes on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Navigating challenges in energy tokenisation 



<p>The journey of tokenising energy assets is fraught with multifaceted challenges, significantly influenced by regulatory uncertainties, security concerns, data privacy issues, market volatility, and a general lack of understanding and readiness within the industry. A pivotal aspect of navigating these waters involves identifying the nature of energy tokens for regulators—be it as utility, payment, or governance tokens—or even advocating for a multi-use token that transcends traditional categorisations.</p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Hurdles 



<p>Discourse within the digital asset community highlights a need for regulatory frameworks around energy tokens that must be clearly defined. This confusion necessitates a rigorous educational effort towards regulators, to clarify the distinctions and functionalities of various token types, including utility, energy, asset, and governance tokens. Without clear regulatory guidance, projects are compelled to seek jurisdictions with more favourable legal frameworks. The UK is a regulatory example of a more defined ecosystem for property rights, energy governance, and tokenisation of real-world assets. The only other option would be to work within regulatory sandboxes and project-specific frameworks to advance tokenisation initiatives without overstepping uncertain legal boundaries.</p>



<p>Moreover, the push towards standardising practices across different regulatory environments presents another layer of complexity. The UK has made significant strides in establishing clear guidelines through bodies like The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Other jurisdictions are still in the budding stages of adapting their regulations to accommodate the novel demands of tokenised energy systems. In addition to regulatory hurdles, the practicalities of offering energy tokens without categorising them as equity to facilitate easier trading, and the fundraising challenges for scaling projects across multiple locations, are critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Communication 



<p>The ability to articulate the concept and clear implications of tokenising energy resources, such as solar panels, is crucial for market acceptance and regulatory compliance. This task extends beyond mere product explanation; it encompasses clear dialogue with lawmakers, consumer protection bodies, and entities concerned with data privacy. Simplifying complex technological underpinnings for a diverse audience, from regulators to the layperson at the bus stop, is essential. Failure to do so risks future operational nightmares, underscoring the importance of both education and transparency in the tokenisation ecosystem. Simplification without sacrificing essential information ensures that investors, users, and stakeholders, who will journey with the initiative for years to come, fully comprehend its value and operation, making the technology’s intricate background less daunting and more accessible.</p>



<p></p>



 Where to begin: energy tokenisation 



<p>Embarking on the journey of energy tokenisation requires a foundational understanding of the token’s purpose, its intended holders, and the value it offers. Before diving into the legal and technical specifics of token types, it is essential to address these fundamental questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach does not necessitate a one-size-fits-all solution. For instance, investors interested in direct engagement with energy projects can opt for utility tokens, whereas those looking for a more traditional investment route might consider security tokens tied to assets like solar parks. This flexibility allows projects to cater to diverse investor preferences, enhancing accessibility and interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlighting the significance of inclusivity and accountability in energy trading, an initiative such as the <a href="https://www.amelandenergie.nl/">Amelander Energy Cooperative</a> demonstrates the potential for democratising energy markets. Such a project demonstrates the possibility for transparent, traceable systems that ensure accountability across all levels of interaction—from investors to consumers, and from producers to the overarching financial ecosystem. Achieving this level of integration and transparency is a meticulous process to harmonise understanding and communication across various stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Tokenisation within the energy sector signifies a significant stride toward democratising access to renewable resources and fostering sustainable practices. By bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms, tokenisation introduces a new paradigm where renewable energy assets, like solar power, become attainable and manageable for a wider audience. This process not only democratises access to sustainable energy solutions but also addresses the pressing need for energy independence, resilience, and environmental preservation. As we navigate the complexities of regulatory landscapes and technological challenges, the ultimate goal remains clear: to create an energy ecosystem that is inclusive, transparent, and aligned with the principles of environmental sustainability. Through collaborative efforts, innovative approaches, and community engagement, tokenisation has the potential to reshape our energy future, making sustainable living a reality for all.</p>

<p>Note that ZenIP 42400 focuses on the modular proof verification layer. If this proposal passes, Horizen Labs will roll out subsequent phases to the Horizen community for discussion and debate as the “New Horizen” initiative progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenIP 42400 is focused solely on the establishment of a Modular Proof Verification Layer, i.e., a blockchain dedicated to verifying proofs with the ability to support any settlement layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we dive into what this means for the Horizen Ecosystem, let’s review a few points that have been raised by the Community regarding this proposal:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Name of the Initiative: The term “New Horizen” is currently a placeholder for the system and its individual component blockchains. The designation is being used to conceptually describe the initiative until an official name is determined. 
 EON Integration: A key aspect of the development strategy is the integration of EON into the new Proof Verification Chain. The Horizen Labs teams are actively involved in exploring viable pathways for this migration, ensuring that EON remains an integral part of the Horizen ecosystem after the implementation of the blockchains that comprise the “New Horizen” initiative. 
 $ZEN Tokenomics: Currently, there are no plans to modify $ZEN’s tokenomics, and any such change would be subject to community discussion and DAO approval.&nbsp; 
 Market and User Research: The Horizen Labs team used comprehensive market and user research, aiming to design a user-friendly system capable of widespread adoption.&nbsp; 
 
 Why should the community be excited about this “New Horizen” proposal? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative will modernize the Horizen tech stack to better align with the broader web3 industry while building on the legacy of the Horizen Mainchain and Zendoo. This will “future-proof” the Horizen network and unlock market value to the Horizen ecosystem. New Horizen is based on current web3 market needs and addresses a problem that affects most modular web3 protocols: volatile and expensive proof verification costs for L2s (ZK-Rollups in particular).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs’ proposed “Proof Verification Chain” aims to substantially reduce rising security costs for L2s.</p>
<p>A dedicated Proof Verification Chain would not only make running a ZK-Rollup more economical, but also align with the anticipated shift towards these technologies becoming the dominant scaling solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, collaboration in the Web3 space is becoming increasingly important, New Horizen aims to foster this collaboration across ecosystems and expand the reach of the Horizen ecosystem. The Horizen Labs team is working to ensure that the Proof Verification Chain described above is being designed to accommodate a variety of proof types and settlement layers. By developing a solution that is versatile enough to be compatible with multiple development frameworks, proving systems, and settlement layers, this positions Horizen as a hub of collaborative innovation. Potentially reaching new audiences beyond our current community, embracing and leading the change towards a more interconnected and cooperative blockchain environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How Will this Work? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative is set to deliver multiple components that address the market’s current and future needs across several phases. The Proof Verification Chain (Phase 1) will focus on verifying proofs originating from other blockchains, such as rollups / appchains or applications. Initially, the focus will be on ZK-SNARK proofs, in particular zk-snarks produced by ZK-Rollups, but the plan is to expand its capabilities to accommodate a wide range of proof types in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof verification layer aims to improve the existing process of proving state validity for ZK-Rollups and other proof-generating applications, offering a more efficient, scalable solution to handle these operations, which will reduce the costs of blockchain networks.</p>

 Scalability, Decentralization &amp; Security — What Trilemma?  The blockchain trilemma is a classic idea that truly decentralized blockchains need to choose between security or scalability. Verus offers a different perspective and a new approach. Together we will come to the conclusion that the Verus Protocol solves scalability by neither sacrificing decentralization or security, effectively solving the trilemma.  A Closer Look at the&nbsp;Trilemma <p>Before we dive in, let’s examine the current perceived definition of the crypto trilemma: “You can’t have a scalable blockchain that is truly decentralized and thus secure” — it is said to achieve worldwide scalability a blockchain needs to be fast so it can process all the transactions for a large population (btw, this is a false premise, you can read about that later.) And to get a fast, high tps (transactions per second) blockchain it must compromise on decentralization and thus security.</p><p>Decentralization and security go hand-in-hand. A truly decentralized protocol (open to all, many validators) is secure because it is difficult to 51% attack such a protocol. If a blockchain is less decentralized (low number of validators, permissioned access) it could be 51% attacked (by external attackers or colluding validators), and transactions can be altered or reversed, completely undermining one of the goals of blockchain — censorship-resistance.</p><blockquote>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the&nbsp;world.</blockquote><p>There is truth to the fact that it is very difficult to have a decentralized single blockchain that also has a high tps. The larger the number of validators the harder it is to find consensus among them all, which makes them slower, and makes it more difficult to get them to process large numbers of transactions. To get a high tps blockchain you would need to lower the number of validators so they can find consensus more easily, and raise the hardware requirements for running a node so they can process those transactions quicker too. Yet doing so compromises true decentralization. The lower the number of validators, the less decentralized, the less robust. And the higher the hardware requirements, the less accessible it is for people around the world, the less decentralized.</p><p>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the world. We will show you how Verus offers a new and better approach.</p> Scalability Does NOT Mean High&nbsp;Tps <blockquote>Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator — like GHz for computers.</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency protocols often boast about how fast their blockchains are (transactions per second) as an indicator of their scalability. Contrary to popular belief this is a false premise. Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator. Like how we use GHz (CPU clock speed) to indicate how fast a computer is, or an even better example — how fast servers&nbsp;are.</p><p>To bring the promise of crypto to billions of people around the globe let’s make a comparison with the Internet. The Internet does not run on one single server. All websites and applications that we use daily are not connected to one single server. The Internet has not been scaled to the world by constantly upgrading the one server to a faster one. It’s millions of servers that are servicing billions of people around the world. These millions of servers are perfectly connected, and completely interoperable so that using the Internet today is a seamless experience.</p><p>Now, with this perspective in mind, let’s get back to the current situation in crypto land. Most, if not all, crypto protocols are trying to service the world with their one single, monolithic blockchain. The monolithic blockchain becomes a central hub where all smart contracts and applications revolve around. When they notice that it doesn’t scale (the transaction fees start ramping up) the industry comes up with solutions that heavily compromise on decentralization and security (e.g. L2s, semi-centralized protocols, master nodes). This is not the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>Instead of acknowledging that the Internet today is a giant, interconnected multi-server world where all applications and websites are seamlessly connected, most of the crypto industry thinks we live in a single server (single blockchain) world.</p><p>Verus acknowledged that to realize the promise of cryptocurrency and blockchain, it needed to scale for billions of people around the globe and thus it needed to embrace a multi-server, multi-chain world. And that is exactly what the Verus Protocol does today. Without sacrificing decentralization and security.</p> Unlimited in&nbsp;Scale <p>Before we start explaining how Verus is truly decentralized and secure, let’s start with how Verus embraces the multi-chain world and delivers unlimited scalability.</p><p>Most, if not all, current blockchain protocols argue that to have low transaction fees they must achieve higher transactions per second. They try to scale up — increasing the performance of their monolithic blockchains. This only gets them so far. At some point, they will bottleneck again, and in the process, they compromise on decentralization and security.</p><p>Verus offers a new approach, one in which each organization or business can launch its own highly capable, rent-free, no-coding-required blockchain. It’s called Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service). These PBaaS-chains are fully independent, can be customized to the organization’s need, inherit all the same features as the Verus blockchain, and most importantly are fully interconnected and interoperable with the complete network and other bridged protocols (e.g. Ethereum). A single PBaaS-chain can do between 75 and 800 tps depending on the options&nbsp;chosen.</p><p>There is no upper limit to deploying PBaaS-chains. Just like there is no upper limit to servers being deployed. When we reach a bandwidth limit we don’t go out upgrading our single server, we put another server next to it to spread out the usage. The same thing is here, reaching unlimited scalability.</p><p>Of course, this only works when those PBaaS-chains are fully interoperable and interconnected, which they are — in a provable, trustless and decentralized way. There is no centralized entity sitting in between the PBaaS-chains regulating everything.</p><p>Cross-chain transactions and conversions, cross-chain bridging of identities (VerusID), tokens and basket currencies, even Ethereum (&amp; ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155) — it’s all built into the consensus mechanism, trustlessly bridged over by the decentralized network of miners and stakers only. This is all on mainnet now, for everyone to&nbsp;use.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is scalable to billions of people around the world with the unlimited deployment of PBaaS-chains. But does it compromise on decentralization and thus security? Let’s dive into&nbsp;it.</p> Built to be Decentralized <p>There are a few things at play here that work in harmony to achieve decentralization and security — Verus Proof of Power (the hybrid 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus mechanism), merge-mining and the Fee&nbsp;Pool.</p><blockquote>Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or&nbsp;tax.</blockquote><p>Before we jump into the above let’s acknowledge some facts that are pivotal to being a true decentralized protocol, to being credibly neutral. Just like Bitcoin before, Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or tax. Verus is not a company or a business. Verus is rent-free and all protocol fees go to the block producers. These facts are super important to incentivize decentralization and to be a credibly neutral protocol in the eyes of the&nbsp;world.</p> A Hybrid Consensus Mechanism <p>Now let’s unpack Verus Proof of Power, the consensus mechanism of the Verus blockchain, and all PBaaS-chains. It’s a hybrid of 50% proof-of-work and 50% proof-of-stake, and it’s <a href="https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf">a provable solution to 51% hash attacks</a>. Out of the 1440 daily blocks (on Verus, and when a PBaaS-chain opts for 1-minute block times), half is solved by mining and half by&nbsp;staking.</p><p>VerusHash, the proof-of-work mechanism which disincentivizes ASIC &amp; FPGA development, and favors CPUs, mobile phones and ARM-devices for mining. Mining with mobile phones and for example, Orange Pi 5’s are the most cost-efficient way to do it. This proves a significant leap towards a more inclusive mining environment. It’s accessible to everyone and thus creates a naturally decentralized protocol.</p>An Orange Pi 5 mining farm by community member&nbsp;DCAL4.<p>Additionally, to give even more power to miners, they can merge-mine up to 22 PBaaS-chains simultaneously without sacrificing their original hashing power. This dramatically increases efficiency and network security. So, when considering an unlimited number of PBaaS-chains on the network, each miner can choose up to 22 to mine. They can choose for profitability, or choose the ones they want to&nbsp;support.</p><p>This approach to mining is environmentally conscious. The protocol’s design allows for low-power devices to mine extremely efficiently. It lowers the entry barrier for participation in blockchain validation, especially in low-income countries, yet can also give life to phones that are old or with broken screens. Thus significantly reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW&nbsp;mining.</p><p>Then we have the proof-of-stake part of the consensus mechanism. This one is really simple and powerful. Anyone can run a node and start staking. There is no minimum amount of VRSC needed (pretty unique in the world of PoS). Verus <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-verus-solved-nothing-at-stake-and-weak-subjectivity-proof-of-stake-problems-b4dd6a85086e">solved the “nothing-at-stake”-problem</a> therefore there is no slashing of funds. Funds staking are never locked and running a node can be done with something as cheap as a Raspberry Pi 4. All-in-all proving yet again that Verus is accessible to everyone, creating a naturally decentralized protocol.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is truly a decentralized protocol, naturally emerging from its extremely low-barrier mining and staking. So what does that mean for security?</p> Protocol Security at Another&nbsp;Level <p>Seeing as the Verus Protocol is naturally decentralized and provable 51% hash attack resistant, it’s extremely secure. PBaaS-chains take these properties with them as they have the same consensus mechanism, and the Verus miners can choose up to 21 of them to merge-mine. It’s fair to say that there is no compromise on security given the scalability of the protocol.</p> Verus Introduces the Fee&nbsp;Pool <p>Let’s first explain the fees the protocol generates for the miners and&nbsp;stakers:</p>  PBaaS-chain launches: 10,000 VRSC (5,000 for the block producers of Verus, 5,000 for the block producers of the newly launched&nbsp;chain)  Currency launches (tokens, basket currencies, liquidity pools, ERC-20 mapped currencies): 200&nbsp;VRSC  VerusID registrations: 100, 80, 60, 40 or 20&nbsp;VRSC  subID registrations: 0.02&nbsp;VRSC  DeFi conversion fees: min. 0.0125%, max.&nbsp;0.025%  Transaction fees: 0.0001&nbsp;VRSC  <p>Builders and users pay these protocol fees for their operations and the fees are directed into the Fee Pool. Then, for each new block, 1% of the Fee Pool is added on top of the regular coinbase reward (currently 6&nbsp;VRSC).</p><p>The Fee Pool is introduced as a security measure to keep the protocol stable. We have seen in other blockchain protocols that when a block has large fees, block producers try to “snipe” the block (putting lots of hash onto the network, then pulling it out of the network, or even trying to reorder the blocks for their own gain). In doing so they destabilize the protocol. Verus mitigates this behavior by spreading the extra fees over many&nbsp;blocks.</p> Smart Contracts Are Not&nbsp;Secure <p>Most blockchain protocols use the VM-based application model — smart contracts written with Solidity. It’s full of smart contract hacks and bugs and has insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms. On top of that MEV (maximum extractable value) is rampant, due to the serial processing of transactions on the VM-model (it’s easy for a block producer to reorder transactions inside a block for their own gain). We can honestly say that the VM-model is not&nbsp;secure.</p><p>The Verus approach is different as it follows the fundamental systems design principle — the most important security layers should be located in the protocol itself, and not coded on top via L2 (smart contracts). All operations on Verus and PBaaS-chains are directly connected to consensus, secured by the miners and stakers of the protocol.</p><p>Now you might ask yourself “But can we build dApps that are as capable as building them with the VM-model?”. The answer is yes. Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions.</p> Does Verus Solve the Blockchain Trilemma? <p>A fair question. And hopefully we answered with enough detail. The answer is&nbsp;“yes!”.</p><p>Let’s summarize. Verus does not compromise on decentralization and security to reach unlimited scalability. Unlimited scalability is reached by scaling out, not scaling up. It is the equivalent not of upgrading your server but of putting an extra server next to it to spread the bandwidth around.</p><p>Decentralization is achieved by making mining and staking accessible for everyone through extremely low hardware requirements. This naturally creates a large number of miners and nodes (stakers), making the network robust against attacks of all&nbsp;sorts.</p><p>High security is not only reached through the decentralized nature of the network but also because of the Fee Pool and the fact that all operations are directly connected to consensus and thus the miners and&nbsp;stakers.</p> Now is the Time to Build with&nbsp;Verus <p>Without having to rely on smart contracts, builders can develop dApps that are even more powerful, secure and scalable. Builders can use the no-coding-required API commands, together with VerusID and its VDXF (Verus Data Exchange Format) as a controlled public storage system with multiple levels of nesting to create dApps of any&nbsp;kind.</p><p>The foundation has been laid for a true Internet of Value.

        <p><a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a> was originally designed and built by the Horizen Ecosystem team as a POC (proof-of-concept) sidechain, called Tokenchain, to test the scalability and durability of the Horizen network. TokenMint was a live proof of concept that permitted the team to build Horizen EON, and now that Horizen EON is successfully running, the time to deprecate TokenMint is now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the deprecation, all TokenMint users will need to remove their $ZEN from the sidechain before the deprecation date to avoid loss of funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
 
 Wednesday, February 21st, 2024 – TokenMint Testnet will be Deprecated 
 Wednesday, March 6th, 2024 – TokenMint Mainnet will be Deprecated 
 
<p>To move $ZEN off of TokenMint, users can simply send their ZEN from their Cobalt Wallet to a Horizen mainchain address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning: ZEN can only be sent to Horizen Mainchain Sphere addresses from Cobalt. Sending ZEN to another Horizen Mainnet address outside of Sphere could lead to a loss of funds.</p>
<p>Please open a ticket on our <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Discord server</a> with any questions or concerns during the deprecation period and please be sure to REMOVE your ZEN from TokenMint BEFORE March 6th, 2024, as the funds will be permanently lost after that date.</p>
<p>How to Send ZEN to the Horizen Mainchain from Cobalt Wallet</p>
 
 Open your Cobalt Wallet and make sure you are connected to the TokenMint chain.&nbsp; 
 In the Assets and Activity page, click the ZEN row. The page now allows you to send ZEN. It displays the current amount available. 
 Click the up arrow to send a transaction. 
 In the Send to field, enter the desired address you want to send the ZEN to. This field will display an error, if you enter an invalid address. 
 In the Amount field, enter the amount of the ZEN you want to send. 
 In the password field, enter your password to complete the transaction. 
 Click Submit. The Sent flag appears indicating that the transaction is successful. 
 Click Back to display the transaction activity. The Send page appears. If the transaction is pending, a notification will appear stating that the last pending transaction for this address has not been confirmed. Note that it can take up to 72 hours for the transaction to show on the destination wallet, even if the transaction is confirmed on the TokenMint explorer.

        <p>On February 7th, 2024, at approximately 12:00pm UTC, ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via hard fork at block #1502800. As previous communications have stated, after this hard fork it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then.&nbsp;</p><p>Failure to remove shielded ZEN from shielded addresses prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your shielded ZEN. It’s important to note that transparent ZEN is not affected by the hard fork, just shielded ZEN.&nbsp;</p><p>This move came with the successfully passed <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">ZenIP 42207</a> earlier this year, which enabled the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain. This change built upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">ZenIP 42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features. As a result, it will no longer be possible to conduct a private transaction on Horizen or access private addresses as of February 7, 2024.</p><p>This is a complete removal of all private payment features from Horizen, effective Feb 7, 2024. There will be no private payment capabilities in Horizen as of this change. Regular public payments, just like Bitcoin, will continue to be supported by Horizen. Horizen will not be a privacy cryptocurrency anymore when this takes effect on Feb 7, 2024.</p><p>Again, we strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses transfer their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 7th, 2024. After February 7th, 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p><p>There is a guide on the Horizen Blog on how to De-Shield ZEN on Sphere Wallet, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool. Please reference the guide here: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/">https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/</a></p><p>The Horizen Ecosystem Team remains readily available to answer any questions around this, please open up a ticket, or reach out to us on our Discord: <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">https://horizen.io/invite/discord</a></p>

 Consensus 2024 — Verus Showcases Fully Completed PBaaS Blockchain Technology  Verus showcases its fully completed Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) technology at Consensus 2024, May 29–31, Austin, USA (booth 1245). The global event for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations this year. Here, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts gather to explore the newest advancements in the industry.  The L0/1 Verus Protocol Solves Major Issues with Ethereum and Other VM-centric Networks <p>Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions. The Verus Protocol solves issues with gas fees, enables unlimited scale, is not vulnerable to smart contract hacks and bugs, addresses MEV at the protocol level, provides an identity model (<a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">VerusID</a>) that applications can leverage and profit from, includes provable cross-chain and multichain support, does away with insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms, and does not require expensive Solidity developers for applications, unless they must also have an Ethereum component to&nbsp;them.</p><p>All these issues are solved with the L0/1 Verus Protocol. Verus does not use smart contracts — it uses smart transactions. Verus smart transactions [<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0">read more</a>] are much easier to use (no programming needed) in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, compared to VM-protocols that use smart contracts. Yet Verus is still fully interoperable with Ethereum through the non-custodial, trustless and decentralized Verus-Ethereum Bridge with liquidity pool currency [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/eth-bridge/">more on the&nbsp;Bridge</a>].</p> Showcasing Verus App-Development Opportunities at Consensus 2024 <p>Get ready for a new era of decentralized application development. Unlike today’s complex smart contract applications, requiring VM-based smart contracts that talk to user facing applications through server-side APIs and phishing-prone web-interfaces using public key hashes or rented names as identity, the Verus network is a Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol with composable and powerful multi-chain core primitives, including identities, currencies, MEV-resistant liquidity baskets, updateable, even transferable ID-bound databases that can comprise NFTs and real world assets, all on a 100% fully decentralized, unlimited scale backbone, secured by the 50% proof-of-stake / 50% proof-of-work, 51% hash attack resistant Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus and accessible securely from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications.</p><p>Build applications in your favorite framework for clients and access the Verus network either through QR-codes and deep-links to a client-side wallet under user control or talk directly to data-indexed, blockchain nodes, capable of providing fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database providing provable, optionally private, worldwide resolvable data at unlimited scale over an unlimited number of blockchains. All of this power, including inherent eCommerce and markets of all types are usable by applications, and unlike yesterday’s Internet, application-owned data stays under application control, while user-owned data remains under user control and subject to voluntary, provable disclosure, protected by zero knowledge privacy, as it should always have&nbsp;been.</p><p>Write applications your way, your client frameworks, your languages, with links and RPC calls to the decentralized Internet of Value. Connect through one or more blockchains. Use, create, sell, and provision your application’s permanent IDs for secure login, KYC, commerce, and provable data at scale, all on the rent-free, credibly neutral and fully decentralized Internet of&nbsp;Value.</p><p>Builders of applications, organizations, and businesses can use the Verus Protocol to provision IDs, manage and interact with users and user state at any scale, launch currencies (e.g. tokens, liquidity baskets [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">see docs</a>]), even fully interoperable, independent, customizable worldwide blockchains with their own economics and fee structure, while sharing mining and economic power across the entire Verus Protocol network of unlimited PBaaS chains. All currencies, whether native currencies of a new blockchain, easily created and minted tokens, or MEV-resistant liquidity baskets are easy to launch and access with the protocol on Verus or any connected PBaaS chain. All of them, from the moment they are launched can be exported to Ethereum as ERC20s [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/export-to-eth.html">see docs</a>] or ERC721 currencies or any chain across the Verus ecosystem. All currencies on the network, including tokens, cross-chain currencies, and even liquidity baskets and their supplies are secured by miners and stakers according to protocol rules. On other blockchain networks, this level of security is applied to single native currencies, on Verus, all currencies on a chain are primitives known to and accounted for by the protocol, eliminating entire classes of smart contract risks that result when every contract reinvents a new way to account for its currency but has no systemic&nbsp;control.</p><p>With Verus, currencies are compatible with ERC20s. Verus applications can leverage, but do not require Solidity developers or VM-based programming. Additionally all ERC-20s can be permissionlessly bridged over from Ethereum to Verus [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html">see docs</a>], giving users and application builders the freedom to switch seamlessly between the Verus and Ethereum networks.</p><p>All currencies on the Verus network (also the ones bridged over from Ethereum) can be used with Verus DeFi, another primitive inherent to the protocol. Verus DeFi enables liquidity baskets of up to 10 underlying reserve currencies and can serve as a unique, self-balancing, MEV-resistant portfolio, a permissionless or permissioned ID registrar where fees go to the LPs of the basket, or an easy way to send from any reserve currency or the basket currency itself to any other without worrying about block builder reordering or MEV, as all conversions of a liquidity basket in any direction that are processed within one or more blocks are always solved simultaneously, no front and not back. Every conversion gets the same price in each direction with no spread and an ultra low fee (max. 0.05%), again, all part of the L1 consensus.</p><p>Whether you plan to build eCommerce enabled supply chains, massively scalable ownership-based games, real world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership or just about any application for a better Web3 on the Internet of Value, you’ll be left behind if you don’t deep dive on Verus&nbsp;first.</p><p>Join us in the next crypto revolution. Verus, with truth and privacy for&nbsp;all!</p><p>Come to the Verus booth on May 29–31 at Consensus 2024. The worldwide community is happy to get you started with a free VerusID, the easy to use Verus Mobile or any of the wide range of protocol features.</p> Amazing Verus Community <p>The Verus community united to facilitate participation at Consensus 2024 by generously contributing VRSC, ETH, DAI, MKR, Bridge.vETH and BTC. A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors! ❤️</p><p>The Verus community used the funds to secure a two-block booth at Consensus, along with other facilities that we can not disclose&nbsp;yet.</p><p>Numerous members of the Verus community are participating in Consensus 2024, and we invite you to be a part of it too! Let’s create a significant presence and showcase to the world the wide range of capabilities of Verus.

<p>Backing open-ended breakthrough research is at the core of BlueYard’s investing philosophy, whether it’s nuclear fusion, programmable stem cells or novel crypto-compute infrastructure. Hackers and researchers remain the essential backbone of the crypto industry. We are proud to have supported the work of research-focused companies like <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>, <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a>, <a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a>, <a href="https://www.tromero.ai/">Tromero</a> and more in solving critical crypto compute and infrastructure challenges, including those that could be key to unlocking adoption and enabling groundbreaking novel use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>This brings us to our core thesis underpinning our crypto investing strategy:</p><blockquote>In the history of technology, economics and organizations — never has there been a technology and incentive system that can autonomously coordinate machines (compute, storage, etc), algorithms, data and capital at such an incredible scale, so quickly — all while providing independent, robust and trustless infrastructure for economic activity and data. Although still early in its development, crypto might be the ultimate solution to the collective action problem. Also, if one believes in a future where the autonomous coordination between compute, data and capital will play an increasing role, crypto networks could be the “under the hood” operating system for large economic networks.</blockquote><p>Due to crypto’s inherent properties (ability to cut out gatekeepers, separation of state and money, internet native assets with open access) — crypto’s potential will unfold both through novel applications and decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Within this context, it is essential that individual researchers and hackers continue to explore open-ended research, despite the current funding and regulatory headwinds in the industry. Individual research is often the nucleus of a future key component of the crypto industry. ​​In that spirit, we are announcing BlueYard DYOR (Do Your Own Research, and pronounced like <a href="https://youtu.be/HPsgY7zCtck?feature=shared&amp;t=41">this</a>) funding program.

Please, update to ZEN 5.0.0 before February 6th, 2024.  ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via Hard Fork at block #1502800, on February 7th, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP-42207</a> to fully remove the shielded pool from Horizen will be implemented with this release:  All transactions involving shielded addresses will no longer be accepted at the consensus level once the hard fork activates  RPC calls z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress have been partially disabled so that it will no longer be possible to submit transactions involving shielded addresses (transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded, and shielded-to-transparent) once the hard fork activates. Transparent-to-transparent transactions will still be accepted and submitted to the network.  Only nodes running on Mainnet have to be updated.      <p>IMPORTANT: 5.0.0.<br>After the previously mentioned Hard Fork, it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then. Directly depositing funds from shielded addresses to exchange wallets is strongly discouraged.<br><br></p><p>See release notes <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/blob/release/5.0.0/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.0.0.md">Here.</a></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a> is developing hardware to speed up zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic scheme that secures much of web3 and is a critical component for scaling Ethereum.</p><p>ZK proofs allow verification that a transaction or smart contract was executed without revealing any of the details. This was first used to support private transactions in protocols like ZCash. The even more promising application is to increase the scalability of protocols such as Ethereum. Layer 2 solutions such as StarkWare execute transactions and smart contracts for users and then post a ZK proof to Ethereum. This significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored on Ethereum and enables transaction volumes similar to traditional payment networks such as&nbsp;Visa.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Inside of every CPU are specialized circuits for speeding up the cryptography used to secure the internet today. At first, Ingonyama might look like a niche business designing specialized hardware for scaling crypto protocols. As the internet becomes more decentralized, the same hardware could secure every internet-connected device.

   Crypto token staking is a rapidly growing multi-billion market, set for further rapid expansion as more Proof of Stake (PoS) becomes the de facto standard model for consensus among crypto networks. This also opens more opportunities for capital vs machine deployment within crypto networks.

<p>Crypto token staking is a rapidly growing multi-billion market, set for further rapid expansion as more Proof of Stake (PoS) becomes the de facto standard model for consensus among crypto networks. This also opens more opportunities for capital vs machine deployment within crypto networks. However, running staking nodes is a difficult task, akin to the challenges and expenses of running a production data center coupled with the complexity of orchestrating bleeding edge software from multiple blockchains in an environment in which security is paramount. These challenges aren’t just faced by institutional capital, but also by retail or exchanges &amp; custodians seeking to provide staking services to their customers.</p><p>That is why <a href="https://www.kiln.fi/">Kiln</a> has built a full-stack “staking as a service” platform, allowing pools of capital to participate in PoS, through a platform that enables investors and builders to manage validators and read-write nodes on multi-cloud infrastructure in a simple, fast and secure way. Kiln allows customers to securely deploy, manage and monitor blockchain validators across several networks in a single space — while users continue to control their private keys. The company runs a SaaS model for its services, dashboard and APIs. Kiln has partnered with Ledger Live, Crypto.com and Coinbase to provide pooled staking services, allowing every ETH holder to access staking with any amount of ETH access to value creation in the digital assets ecosystem. Further, Coinbase Cloud has integrated Kiln’s On-Chain platform into its product offering allowing Coinbase Cloud to bring on-chain partial ETH staking capabilities to their clients, with limited engineering effort needed to integrate. Kiln runs validators on all major PoS blockchains, with over $3.6b of stake under management (up 4.4x y-o-y), running on a multi-cloud, multi-region infrastructure. Kiln also provides a validator-agnostic suite of products for fully automated deployment of validators, reporting and commission management, enabling custodians, wallets and exchanges to streamline staking operations across providers.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>As increasingly large pools of capital are deployed to crypto to meet PoS demand of chains, a company that facilitates and manages capital flows should be able to become a key fabric for the&nbsp;space.</p><p>We are excited to be investing in Kiln for the third time now, most recently joining its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221128005157/en/Kiln-Announces-%E2%82%AC17-Million-in-Funding-to-Expand-Staking-Offering">$17 million funding&nbsp;round</a>.</p>

<p>Today, Aztec Labs is excited to share the winning proposal from the <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-decentralized-prover-coordination/2397">prover coordination protocol request for proposals</a> (RFPs) — “Sidecar”. Additionally, we are announcing a formal request for comments period covering Aztec’s Sequencer Selection and Prover Coordination Protocols, key components of Aztec’s block production.</p><p>At the heart of Sidecar’s design is the decision to facilitate proving outside of the scope of the protocol, enabling integrations with various solutions, such as decentralized zero-knowledge proving marketplaces. Read the latest documentation on Aztec’s block production.</p><p>👉 <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aztec-sequencer-selection-and-prover-coordination-protocols/3038">https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aztec-sequencer-selection-and-prover-coordination-protocols/3038</a></p> Why Sidecar? <p>The Aztec Labs team, with input from various industry-leading experts, chose Sidecar over the various other proposals submitted (<a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-cooperative-bft-proving-using-striped-redundant-binary-trees/2515">1</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-decentralized-prover-network-staking-reputations-and-proof-races/2489">2</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-when-the-levee-breaks/2457">3</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-cooperative-proving-network-for-fernet/2400">4</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-provers-bonded-prover-auction/2401">5</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-staking-proving-network-for-fernet/2439">6</a>) due to its simplicity and ease of integration — very similar to the reasons<a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/announcing-fernet-aztecs-decentralized-sequencer-selection-protocol-dd06194d572f"> the Fernet Sequencer Selection protocol was chosen during a previous RFP&nbsp;process</a>.</p><p>Further, the decision to not enshrine a particular prover coordination protocol enables Aztec Labs to continue iterating on proving networks or marketplaces outside of the scope of the Aztec network’s traditional upgrade mechanisms — similar in spirit to Vitalik’s notion of “<a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/09/30/enshrinement.html">minimum viable enshrinement</a>”.</p><p>Additionally, not enshrining a particular protocol in this way allows the network to be fully compatible with a broad spectrum of options to prove a given block, including:</p>  vertical Sequencer-Prover integration, or  third party zero-knowledge (zk) proving providers, or  fully decentralized zk proving marketplaces  <p>Through these various options, Aztec’s proving is fully permissionless and allows anyone to participate in a competitive marketplace for zero-knowledge proof production.</p><blockquote>“We are excited to collaborate with other projects that share our vision for decentralized zero-knowledge proving.
