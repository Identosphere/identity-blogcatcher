 This article gives instructions on how to use the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website and Verus Desktop to preconvert ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH. <p>First I recommend to read: <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/bridging-done-right-verus-ethereum-bridge-launches-now-1b2ca42939b2">Bridging Done Right — Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launches&nbsp;Now!</a></p>  Download the lastest Verus Desktop here: <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">https://verus.io/wallet/desktop</a>  Make sure you are on native mode and fully synced. (And remember to always backup your wallet.dat file!)  Visit the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website here: <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">https://eth.verusbridge.io/</a>   Bridging ETH, DAI &amp; MKR over to&nbsp;Verus <p>First thing we need to do, before we can preconvert, is to bridge over. To bridge ETH, DAI or MKR over you need to visit the <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">bridge website&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Then connect your Metamask wallet. Follow the steps Metamask gives&nbsp;you.</p><p>Then fill in the address (R- or i-address) you want the bridged ETH, DAI or MKR to end up. (you can also use your Verus Mobile&nbsp;address)</p><p>Then choose what you want to bridge over. And then the destination. After that choose the amount and click&nbsp;send.</p><p>Metamask will guide you through the next steps. ⚠️ It can take up to 45 minutes before your bridged ETH, DAI or MKR arrives on the Verus blockchain and in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>⛽ Also, the gas fee calculation is quite high, it could be that you pay a lot less, but this is never a guarantee.</p> Getting Verus Desktop to show vETH, DAI.vETH &amp;&nbsp;MKR.vETH <p>Now that you have sent over ETH, DAI or MKR to your R- or i-address, we need to make sure you can actually see them in Verus&nbsp;Desktop.</p><p>Go to the “Multiverse”-tab, click on Verus on the left. You can see that Bridge.vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH &amp; vETH or not “added” yet. Click on one of the currencies.</p><p>When clicking on one of the currencies you can see a button “Add Currency”. Click on it, and do it for all if you&nbsp;want.</p><p>You can now go back to the “Wallet”-tab.</p><p>You can now see the added currencies in the dropdown in your Wallet-tab (when Verus is selected).</p> Preconverting to Bridge.vETH <p>To actually start preconverting currencies to Bridge.vETH click on “Convert Currencies”.</p><p>Now go to “Advanced”.</p><p>You only need to fill in the highlighted parts of the form. See&nbsp;below:</p>  Amount: how much of vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH you want to convert to Bridge.vETH  From Currency: Fill in vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH (not case sensitive)  To Currency: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)  Destination Address: Fill in where you want to receive the Bridge.vETH (on Fri 20 Oct). Can be a R-address, i-address or&nbsp;VerusID.  Send as pre-convert: Check&nbsp;this  Refund Address: Sometimes a currency has a minimum or maximum amount to preconvert before it launches. For example, when the minimum preconversion amount is not met, and thus the currency not launched, you will receive your funds back. In this case there isn’t a minimum or maximum but you still need to fill it in. Can be the same as your Destination Address.  <p>Now click on “Convert Currencies” and confirm the transaction. You have now preconverted funds into Bridge.vETH!</p><p>On Friday 20 Oct you will receive an amount of the 100,000 initial supply of Bridge.vETH in your destination address.</p><p>You can always check <a href="http://www.verus.io/eth-bridge">verus.io/eth-bridge</a> for statistics on Bridge.vETH</p> Join the community.

 Bridging Done Right — Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launches&nbsp;Now!  The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is the only non-custodial and trustless bridge in the industry, and where the accounting of funds is proven and verified by consensus. And you can participate in its launch right&nbsp;now!  ⏱️ Verus-Ethereum Bridge launch: block height 2,758,800 (Fri 20 Oct,&nbsp;2023).  ✅ Start preconverting to the bridge currency Bridge.vETH (with an initial supply of 100,000) NOW for a 10 day period. 👉 <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io">Connect to the&nbsp;bridge</a>  👀 The first ever truly non-custodial, trustless and consensus proven cryptocurrency bridge.  How it&nbsp;Works <p>You can already start to preconvert VRSC, ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH.</p>  Bridge ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus network. 👉 <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">[Bridge website]</a> <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-to-participate-in-the-verus-ethereum-bridge-launch-73aeeae1c76a">[How-to guide for bridging &amp; preconversion]</a>  Preconvert vETH (ETH), DAI.vETH (DAI), MKR.vETH (MKR) or VRSC into Bridge.vETH.  See Bridge.vETH statistics on <a href="http://www.verus.io/eth-bridge">verus.io/eth-bridge</a> [online&nbsp;soon]  <p>When the bridge currency launches (10 days from when the article is published) the initial supply of 100,000 will be distributed by the protocol among all preconverters.</p><p>If you move ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is launched your cross-chain fees are subsidized. Around 5000 VRSC is used to subsidize the fees on the Verus side. When the bridge currency gets launched, the VRSC that is left will be put into the reserves.</p> Dynamic Supply <p>The Bridge.vETH supply is dynamic (after the preconversion has finished and the bridge currency is launched). The currency gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, vETH, DAI.vETH and MKR.vETH, or gets burned when people convert out of&nbsp;it.</p>After the bridge currency is launched you can convert into any direction.<blockquote>Worth noting: Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant. There is no front/back-running since all conversions are simultaneously solved within a block. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">More details on docs.verus.io</a></blockquote><p>The Bridge.vETH currency function is to make the bridging of assets simple. From wherever you send it converts the fees that you need seamlessly.</p> The Bridge Accrues&nbsp;Fees <p>The bridge currency accrues fees with the cross-chain functions, conversions and&nbsp;.vETH VerusID registrations, making it more valuable the more it’s&nbsp;used.</p><p>Dai holders get 5% interest (at the time of writing, the rate is subject to change by MakerDAO) automatically when holding in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. DAI in Bridge.vETH and in the complete Verus ecosystem get this savings rate. The DSR is being passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.</p> Use the&nbsp;Bridge <p>After Bridge.vETH is launched and the initial supply is distributed you can now use the bridge as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Convert into any direction after the currency is launched and out of preconversion mode.  Export launched currencies on Verus as an ERC-20. 👉 <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/export-to-eth.html">Learn&nbsp;how</a>  Launch currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20. 👉 <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Learn&nbsp;how</a>  Send currencies, tokens and liquidity pools cross-chain.  Send <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/">ERC-721</a> &amp; <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/">ERC-1155</a> NFTs to Verus, and export tokenized ID currencies from Verus to Ethereum as ERC-721 &amp; ERC-1155.   Present Issues with Existing Cryptocurrency Bridges <p>Let’s first delve into the challenges associated with the prevailing cryptocurrency bridges in the industry.</p>  The custody of bridged assets is typically maintained by a single or a small number of addresses, effectively creating a central authority for holding the funds, which contradicts the decentralized nature of blockchain.  The smart contracts that secure these bridged assets can be readily modified by a singular or limited number of authorities, thus presenting potential security&nbsp;issues.  Smart contracts might contain bugs or malicious codes, making them susceptible to exploitation and undermining the safety of the bridged assets, especially if those assets are not accounted for by the block producers.  <p>These problems have been demonstrated by numerous bridge hacks that have occurred and are likely to continue in the future. Verus does things, yet again, very different.</p> Why the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is Different <p>The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is different because the assets are never in anyone’s custody. This is done through the seamless cooperation between the block producers, community notaries, the Bridgekeeper software and the Ethereum smart contract. At each step during cross-chain transactions the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent&nbsp;hacks.</p><p>There are community notaries who, every 10 blocks, create a kind of digital receipt. They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called “notarizations’’, contain, among other things: the “stateroot” (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a> for Verus, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">Merkle Patricia Trie</a> for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.</p><blockquote>👉 <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5">Read more here</a> on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable&nbsp;way.</blockquote> Safeguards Against Bridge&nbsp;Hacks <p>Threats caused by malicious community notaries, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of community notaries were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to&nbsp;happen:</p>  Colluding, malicious community notaries.  Fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain.  Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow&nbsp;chain.  <p>These requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.</p><p>The community notaries are also monitoring their notarizations and if they were to sign for something they do not agree with they can auto-revoke their identities. This way prevents stolen key attacks from being anything more than an inconvenience.</p> Bridgekeeper <p>The two blockchains, Verus and Ethereum, are fundamentally different from each other, but still need to be able to communicate. A translator is needed. This translator is a program called Bridgekeeper. Community notaries have to run the program. Miners and stakers are also encouraged to run it, and for doing so they receive&nbsp;fees.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verusbridgekeeper">Bridgekeeper for&nbsp;CLI</a></p> Verus ➡️&nbsp;Ethereum <p>Let’s consider a scenario where a user wants to move or convert assets from Verus to Ethereum. This transaction gets recorded on the Verus blockchain. When there are enough, or a certain time period has passed, these cross-chain transactions are rolled up into something called a ‘CCE’ (cross-chain export). This CCE is then added to a block by a miner or staker and they are rewarded a fee for doing so. The CCE is now officially part of the blockchain, and is linked to the “stateroot” (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a>, which is an unchangeable overall summary of the blockchain at that block, and anything preceding it).</p><p>Meanwhile, as the transactions (CCE) are being mined (or staked) in, the notarizations are also being signed by the community notaries and confirmed by miners and stakers. The notarizations occur every 10 blocks. Before a notarization is used as proof, it has to be on the blockchain for 10 blocks and be confirmed by another notarization.</p><p>Then when the notarization is confirmed on Verus, it’s sent over to Ethereum and becomes pending on Ethereum. Once confirmed on Ethereum by receiving another notarization, the transactions (CCE) in that block are sent over to the Ethereum smart contract, along with the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a> proof. If valid the assets are sent to the users Ethereum&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Anyone can roll up the transactions into a CCE and mine it in to get a reward, but also the community notaries paying the ETH fees to send it to Ethereum get a share of the fees to subsidize their transaction costs.</p><p>If there is no traffic from Verus to Ethereum, the notarizations are continued to be mined in on Verus but do not need to be sent to Ethereum, so when the traffic is light, there is no&nbsp;cost.</p> Ethereum ➡️&nbsp;Verus <p>The above part explains going from Verus to Ethereum, but the other way around is actually a little bit different. It is not the community notaries that send the group of transactions over, but any miner and staker can, and thus also get part of the&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Notarizations made on Verus always contain a stateroot from Ethereum that is a minimum of 30 blocks old (blocks on Ethereum take ~15 seconds) to make sure it is stable (no risk of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/chain-reorganization">chain reorganizations</a>). Then after Verus has confirmed the notarization with a new one, Verus can accept transactions (CCE) from Ethereum, along with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie</a> proof that relates to the new confirmed data.</p> A Giant Leap&nbsp;Forward <p>The delayed sending of transactions is an important security mechanism that is not present in any other cross-chain bridge. To recap: before any real transactions happen, the Verus network sends proofs to the Ethereum network and vice versa. These proofs are checked and agreed upon by everyone in the network. Only then the actual moving of assets happens. Because of this delayed system, no single entity ever gets control over the assets. Also there are safeguards in place for the community notaries that protect users from&nbsp;hacks.</p><p>This system is decentralized, which means it’s controlled by everyone participating in the network, rather than a single central authority. It’s a giant leap forward for the entire cryptocurrency industry, and everyone can be a part of&nbsp;it!</p> Join the community. Learn about the protocol.

These missions have become a vital part of our journey to building a secure, resilient network, and we couldn’t have achieved it without our incredible community of users, which has grown to over 30,000 user accounts on the Verida Acacia&nbsp;Testnet.</p><p>Through active participation in Verida Missions, such as using the <a href="https://news.verida.io/new-on-verida-missions-explore-the-markdown-editor-and-boost-your-verida-xp-e1e8114eacf0">Markdown editor demo app</a> and <a href="https://news.verida.io/new-on-verida-missions-earn-xp-by-inviting-friends-gatekeeper-credentials-update-acd8891f274c">referring friends to join the Verida Network</a>, our community has assisted us in thoroughly stress-testing the capabilities of both the Verida Wallet and Verida&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Our partnership with GateKeeper saw over 6,600 claims of the <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-missions-introducing-the-gatekeeper-adopter-credential-mission-with-polygon-id-9e1217b18bf">GateKeeper Adopter Credential</a>, proving your early involvement with GateKeeper — a leading solution for identity verification and access control. In our most recent Verida Mission collaboration with Gamer31, we demonstrate a new use case for zero-knowledge credentials in the gaming&nbsp;space.</p><p>More partnerships and activities on Verida Missions will be released throughout the rest of the year rewarding users with XP, which can be converted into valuable VDA storage credits on Verida Myrtle&nbsp;Mainnet.</p> Veridians rock <p>We have seen immense growth in the Verida community across all our social channels. We saw overwhelming enthusiasm from our community in our Galxe campaign to commemorate the first 10K accounts on the Verida Network, with all <a href="https://twitter.com/Verida_io/status/1685843907446525952">10,000 Galxe OATs</a> minted in the first 3&nbsp;days.</p><p>With that growth, our moderators have been hard at work making sure our community is safe, and your questions are answered. For the safety of our community, we’ve implemented auto-moderation bots, limiting links, spam words, and additional rules to prevent phishing and scam attempts.</p><p>We appreciate everyone’s patience while we adapt to our growing community.

We’ve significantly reduced loading times since v0.4.0 and will continue to improve where possible.</p><p>We know many of you have had some issues claiming Gatekeeper / Polygon ID credentials. We have invested a lot of time in identifying the underlying problems, which are rather complex as mobile devices haven’t run this type of zero-knowledge code before. We have identified some common causes; devices running out of memory, loss of internet, apps entering background mode. We are in regular contact with Polygon ID to help them improve their libraries and will continue to improve the wallet experience as best we can. We are hopeful a future upgrade of their library will significantly improve reliability</p> Pathway to Verida&nbsp;Mainnet <p>With our ongoing success in the Verida Missions incentivized testnet and the soaring demand for participation, our journey to Mainnet is getting&nbsp;closer.</p><p>As we look ahead, we can’t wait to showcase even more diverse use cases, further illustrating the potential of Verida’s self-sovereign infrastructure, mobile wallet and the power of zero-knowledge technology.</p><p>Stay tuned for updates on Verida Missions, partnerships and more, as we move towards the exciting Verida Myrtle Mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p> Acacia Testnet Resources <p>For those looking for extra guidance and resources on participating in the Verida Missions incentivized testnet, we’ve got you&nbsp;covered:</p>  User Guides: Dive deep into the comprehensive <a href="https://community.verida.io/user-guides">user guides</a> available on the Verida community Notion.

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>It’s the end of the month again! Here’s a round-up of everything that went down this September.</p> Tech Updates  v1 Testnet update <p>Stage 2 of our v1 Testnet is still in the making. This Stage is predominantly about converting Panther Reward Points to $zZKP. The introduction of an additional feature ("vouchers") will enable users to test this conversion while remaining in a testnet environment, an addition that slightly differs from this Stage's original design. The function is still undergoing internal testing.</p><p>Concurrently, Stage 3 work has already started and is in progress. This Stage will be centered around depositing assets into Shielded Pools.</p><p>We're excited to get Panther v1 in your hands. Look out for more updates on the Testnet launch in the coming weeks!</p> Update to the Stage 1 Testnet’s url <p>As we progress on the above, we have updated the link for Stage 1 on our Testnet information repository. The new version contains a few tweaks and upgrades.</p><p>To access it, go to: <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages</a></p> Comparing Panther’s approach to ‘Privacy Pools’ <p>The recent <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Privacy Pools paper</a> struck a chord with the Web3 community. It's clear that preserving users' privacy in a compliant way is crucial for the mass adoption of decentralized technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>After carefully reviewing the paper by <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Vitalik Buterin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ameen Soleimani</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mat_nadler?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Mat Nadler</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Chainalysis</a>' J. Illum, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fschaer?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Fabien Schär</a>, we wrote an article comparing Panther's solutions to ‘Privacy Pools’.&nbsp;</p><p>Both protocols attempt to exclude bad actors from a privacy-preserving system based on disclosures that can be legally adopted. However, although there are clear similarities, there are also key differences in how we tackle this challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>Read our in-depth analysis:</p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-privacy-pools-approaches-compared/">https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-privacy-pools-approaches-compared/</a></p>We analyze Panther's solutions against ‘Privacy Pools’, both aiming to exclude malicious actors from privacy-preserving systems. Integrating PureFi as Panther’s first accredited compliance integration <p>Although PureFi’s integration into v1 had already been approved by the Panther DAO, this month we formalized it with an announcement. With this, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-joins-forces-with-purefi-to-enable-compliance-in-prifi/">PureFi joins Panther in enabling compliant DeFi privacy</a>.</p><p>Privacy integrations enable Panther to:</p>  Improve its decentralization  Apply compliance at a protocol level  Provide on-chain support for ZK-compatible attestations &amp; signatures  <p>These&nbsp; integrations also prioritize neutrality. Through our team’s collaboration with compliance providers like PureFi Protocol, they will be able to issue zero-knowledge proofs for Panther users that submit their data and achieve passing AML scores, ensuring Panther remains uninformed of user data.</p><p>Integrating third-party compliance tools like PureFi underscores Panther's dedication to shaping a DeFi ecosystem where privacy tools are normalized and malicious actors are diligently screened out.</p>PureFi &amp; Panther’s integration illustrated. Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi <p>We hosted a meeting with PureFi Protocol to discuss our upcoming v1 integration.</p><p>Panther’s CEO Oliver Gale, CTO Anish Mohammed, and Head of Product Saif Akhtar joined PureFi’s CEO Slava Demchuk, CTO Mykhailo Tiutin, and COO Vasily Vidmanov to break down the complexities of the integration and answer all your questions.&nbsp;</p><p>This was a great opportunity to showcase how Panther and PureFi are working together to make privacy-preserving DeFi a no-brainer.</p><p>You can listen back to this Twitter Spaces at:</p> <blockquote><p>We'll be hosting a panel with <a href="https://twitter.com/PureFi_Protocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@PureFi_Protocol</a> to discuss our v1 integration!<br><br>We'll have Panther CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginalOlii?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@OriginalOlii</a>, CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@anishmohammed</a>, Product Head <a href="https://twitter.com/saifonblock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@saifonblock</a> with CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/demchukvm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@demchukvm</a> , CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/mtiutin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@mtiutin</a> and COO Vasily Vidmanov from PureFi.<br><br>Set a reminder: <a href="https://t.co/HXZ3933KX8?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://t.co/HXZ3933KX8</a></p>— Panther Protocol (@ZKPanther) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1708924109906727164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">October 2, 2023</a></blockquote>

From the beginning, the internet was designed as a public network, and a wise assumption is that all communications are not private by default. This is the problem that Nym aims to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>It’s true that platforms like Discord do not preserve privacy. It is helpful to think of them as a digital equivalent to a mall — a commercial space where everything you do is visible, but where you can also meet all kinds of&nbsp;people.</p><p>Enabling privacy for everyone starts with making education accessible for everyone. Shipyard will be hosted in such malls and public plazas precisely to make the event as accessible as possible.</p><p>Just as a festival or a marketplace would be held in a large, public, outdoor venue — so are the events of Shipyard, where newcomers can meet and learn all about the new privacy primitives shaping the internet. In the real world too, you also trade the privacy of your home for public&nbsp;events.</p><p>However, anyone seeking more intimate conversations can always step in to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat">Nym’s privacy-preserving Matrix server and Element channels</a> — like moving from the public plaza into the Nym social&nbsp;club.</p><p>While much of Shipyard will be out in the open, attendees can always step inside to the quieter, more private space where you’re able to engage more deeply with other community members and the core&nbsp;team.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">So visit Discord</a> for the ‘public plaza’, to meet people from around the world! But beware, there are no privacy protections.</p><p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat">And hop into Matrix/ Element</a> for the ‘social club’ — step inside for more intimate conversations with the Nym core community and&nbsp;team.</p><p>Head to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/BftsP0JrkWc?feature=shared"> Youtube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nymtech">Twitch</a> to watch the live lectures.</p><p>And visit the <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/">Nym Shipyard website</a> for learning material, which will also be shared on Discord and Element prior to the&nbsp;exams.</p> How to maximise your privacy during&nbsp;Shipyard <p>That said, Nym is a privacy-first organisation, and it’s completely understandable if Shipyard attendees would like to join in the most private way possible.</p><p><a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x8ebA38B680ab24276138173e42469348b941E87a/QorAan7iKvyh9f3PnbEyAocdcIainlAaJYNxT8W_6j4">Here’s how to privacy enhance your Shipyard experience</a> (and thanks to<a href="https://officercia.mirror.xyz/"> officercia.eth</a> for the detailed Telegram privacy steps — check out his page for more hands-on opsec&nbsp;advice.)</p><p>To complete Shipyard with maximum privacy, follow these&nbsp;guides:</p><p>Resources</p>  <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x8ebA38B680ab24276138173e42469348b941E87a/QorAan7iKvyh9f3PnbEyAocdcIainlAaJYNxT8W_6j4">How to maximise your privacy during&nbsp;Shipyard</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/element-matrix-over-the-nym-mixnet-private-decentralised-and-secure-messaging-ac7f47bc47af">Matrix/ Element chat over&nbsp;Nym</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/configuring-nymconnect-with-telegram-9ca6425d95b6">Telegram over&nbsp;Nym</a>  <a href="https://blog.notrustverify.ch/pastenym-a-privacy-friendly-sharing-service-ac3d5f337bde">PasteNym for sharing texts and links during&nbsp;Shipyard</a>  <p>Welcome to Nym Shipyard Level&nbsp;1!</p><p>See you at the opening ceremony, and don’t forget to join the Nym community on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat">Element</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a>.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-a-privacy-academy-in-the-public-squares-328cdacab037">Nym Shipyard: a privacy academy in the public squares</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Danny Ryan is a coordinator at the Ethereum Foundation. He’s been on Bankless many times before. Usually, we’re talking about the Ethereum roadmap and what’s coming next. This time we’re talking about something different…a risk to Ethereum that Danny sees. A little over a year ago, Danny wrote a blog post titled “The Risk of LSDs”... discussing the various risk vectors that a dominant LSD presents to Ethereum…even naming Lido specifically in the process.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ ✨ DEBRIEF | Ryan &amp; David unpacking the episode: <a href="https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan">https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ A lot of people have decided that liquid staking with Lido is the place to do it. At the time of recording Lido has over 30% of all staked Ether. Does this present a systemic risk to Ethereum?</p> <p>We did an episode called, “In Defense of Lido” with researcher Hasu who argued that Lido does not pose a systemic risk to Ethereum. In fact, Lido’s dominance is better than many other alternatives. We left that conversation half-finished when we published it in August 2023.&nbsp;</p> <p>In today’s episode, we cover part two of that debate with Ethereum researcher and guest Danny Ryan who argues the opposite. Lido is a systemic risk to Ethereum and what to do about it.</p> <p>We believe our role as podcasters for issues like this is to voice both sides of the argument in long-form conversations and healthy debate. It is exactly the kind of thing you don’t get on Twitter. That’s why we’ve given voice to both sides of this issue.&nbsp;</p> <p>We think there are good actors who care about this ecosystem at Lido and in the broader Ethereum community and we’re sure this episode won’t be the last word on this subject.</p> <p>----- 🏹 Airdrop Hunter is HERE, join your first HUNT today <a href="https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT">https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 a16z Startup School | Apply Before Oct. 20th <a href="https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school">https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE ⁠<a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2%C2%A0%20%E2%81%A0">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2&nbsp; ⁠</a></p> <p>🦊METAMASK PORTFOLIO | MANAGE YOUR WEB3 EVERYTHING <a>⁠https://bankless.cc/MetaMask&nbsp;</a></p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a></p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/Toku">https://bankless.cc/Toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄UNISWAP | ON-CHAIN MARKETPLACE ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap&nbsp;</a></p> <p>🔗 CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 7:41 Is Lido a Threat to Ethereum 8:57 &nbsp;Blog Post Thinking Change? 19:30 Uniswap 21:20 Theoretical Main Risks 25:45 God Mode&nbsp; 27:20 Practical Main Risks 34:00 Hasu Counter-Arguments&nbsp; 38:25 Permissionless Validator Set Mitigation 42:30 Veto Power Mitigation Argument 46:55 How Likely is the Lido Risk? 51:26 Client Team Positioning&nbsp; 55:00 How Special is the Lido Case?&nbsp; 57:45 One LST Inevitability &nbsp; 1:02:30 Solutions&nbsp; 1:06:55 Profit Maximization&nbsp; 1:09:00 Action Steps For Ethereum Decentralization&nbsp; 1:11:53 Can Ethereum Devs Do Something?&nbsp; 1:20:10 Hasu Questions Answered by Danny&nbsp; 1:22:45 Magnitude of the Lido Threat 1:24:20 How Can Lido Fix This?&nbsp; 1:25:59 Stick &amp; Carrot for Lido 1:26:27 Silverlining of Lido Threat 1:29:05 Next Conversations&nbsp; 1:32:16 Closing &amp; Disclaimers &nbsp;</p> <p>----- RESOURCES</p> <p>Danny Ryan <a href="https://twitter.com/dannyryan">https://twitter.com/dannyryan</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Danny Ryan Blog Post <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd">https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Hasu’s Bankless Interview <a href="https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY">https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Back in 2017, there was no DeFi as we know it today, yet MakerDAO were already envisioning and building towards what they thought to be a certainty. The backbone of DeFi is represented by stable coins, and MakerDAO quickly understood this: they set out to build a decentralised stable coin, $DAI (and its precursor $SAI). Being collateral-backed, the smart contract needs to know the value of that collateral, but any off-chain price data is not readily available on-chain. This is where oracles come in and provide data feeds on-chain. MakerDAO’s internal oracle has been active since 2017 on Ethereum and has recently branched out, forming Chronicle. By using aggregated Schnorr signatures, Chronicle solves the problem of oracle cost-efficient scaling.</p><p>We were joined by Niklas Kunkel, founder of Chronicle, to discuss the challenges and tradeoffs that oracles regularly face, and how Chronicle is solving them, continuing the ethos of early MakerDAO.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Niklas’ background and the early days of MakerDAO  How MakerDAO evolved over time and the adoption of DAI  MakerDAO’s core principles  Why Chronicle branched out from MakerDAO  Oracle challenges &amp; tradeoffs  Oracle validators  Business model for oracles  Providing oracle services to different blockchains  Schnorr signatures  Chronicle’s supported chains and oracle offerings  Real-world assets (RWA) and credit delegation  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nomos_paradox">Niklas Kunkel on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChronicleLabs">Chronicle on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerDAO">Maker DAO on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture &amp; Felix Lutsch.

Scroll on to learn all about the Nym Wallet, why it matters, and how to use&nbsp;it.</p> WTF is Nym&nbsp;Wallet? <p>The <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/wallet">Nym Wallet</a> is an application that allows users to buy and hold NYM tokens but also to ‘delegate stake’ and ‘bond’ them. These are crucial components of the carefully crafted token economics that power the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Not only does the Nym Wallet help reward operators to run and maintain the private internet but it also rewards token holders&nbsp;too.</p><p>If you already know about delegating and bonding, skip the next section and head straight to the Using Nym Wallet tutorial at the bottom of this blog&nbsp;post.</p><p>For everyone else, let’s take a look at how delegating and bonding in Nym Wallet contributes to the private internet.</p> Delegating and bonding in Nym&nbsp;Wallet  For token&nbsp;holders <p>Anyone holding tokens can ‘delegate stake’ to mix nodes of their choice, using the wallet. This signals the node’s reputation in the community. In return, delegators receive a share of mix nodes’ rewards for running a good operation, incentivising them to stake on well-performing nodes.</p><p>With this one small step of delegating stake, token holders are contributing to the health of the Nym ecosystem, and helping to build an anti-surveillance business model on the internet.</p> For node operators <p>Node operators ‘bond’ to their own mix nodes. This is an initial investment that shows their commitment to the community, and allows them to enter the Nym mixnet. It also lets the mixnet know that you are a node operator.</p><p>Together, the amount of delegated stake and bonded stake determines the mix node’s overall reputation — and its chance of being picked for the ‘active set’ that mixes traffic in the ‘epoch’, i.e. the hour-long configuration of the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Good mixing performance, such as consistent uptime and data transfer, increases the rewards that mix nodes receive and therefore the rewards token holders receive for delegating too.</p><p>This is the underlying Nym token economics in action <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">as set out in the original whitepaper</a>.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">For a deeper dive on the Nym token economics click&nbsp;here</a></p><p>There’s plenty of ongoing work in the Nym Wallet <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/token-swaps-on-nym-wallet-coming-soon-25144cbfbcae">including in-app token swaps</a> and the development of a web app to make delegating easy on mobile&nbsp;devices.</p><p>You’ll be using Nym Wallet a little differently depending on if you’re a token holder or a node operator. Let’s take a&nbsp;look:</p> Using Nym Wallet to delegate and bond&nbsp;stake <p>1. <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/wallet">Download and install Nym Wallet for your chosen operating system: Linux, Mac, or&nbsp;Windows</a>.</p><p>2.

Use security best practice, such as a trusted open source password manager like <a href="https://keepass.info/">Keepass</a>. Keep your password safe, and don’t share it with&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>You will be asked to verify your mnemonic:</p><p>Now you can sign in with your password or your mnemonic.</p><p>When you’re signed in, the dashboard looks like&nbsp;this:</p><p>3. Now you’ve signed in to Nym Wallet, navigate to the Buy button on the left of the dashboard and follow the instructions to buy the native NYM token with&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Congratulations, now you’re holding&nbsp;NYM!</p><p>Note: NYM is a utility token for using and participating in the Nym privacy infrastructure. NYM should not be purchased for speculation, it is not a general purpose payment mechanism nor cryptocurrency like&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Alternatively, if you already own NYM or someone is sending you NYM, click on Receive. A QR code and wallet address will appear on your&nbsp;screen.</p><p>You can also buy native NYM on some exchanges. (Alternatively, you can get ERC-20 version of NYM on most major exchanges. However, it is currently impossible to delegate or bond with ERC20 tokens. You’ll <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/bridging-staking-and-earning-nym-tokens-8f19f42f171e">need to ‘bridge’ these tokens over to the native NYM token — see here for a&nbsp;guide</a>).</p><p>The native NYM token is available on <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, while the ERC-20 token is available on <a href="https://www.okx.com/">OKX</a>, <a href="https://www.huobi.com/">Huobi</a>, <a href="https://www.gate.io/">Gate</a>, and <a href="https://www.bybit.com/">Bybit</a>. View all exchanges on the NYM page for <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nym/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/token-swaps-on-nym-wallet-coming-soon-25144cbfbcae">an upcoming release of Nym Wallet, holders will be able to swap tokens directly in Nym Wallet, making engagement with the Nym ecosystem much simpler for ERC-20 token&nbsp;holders</a>.</p><p>If you’re a token holder read up to step 5 to learn how to Delegate and start earning rewards with Nym&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>If you’re an operator, skip to step 7 and learn how to Bond your node on Nym&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>4. To delegate, select the Delegation button on the left side of the dashboard. Next, select the list of mixnodes from the prompt to decide where to delegate your&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>5. The Mainnet Explorer shows all mix nodes in the Nym mixnet. The list can be sorted by active, standby, or inactive nodes. Clicking any of the nodes will bring up important information including total data packets sent and received, the location of the node, profit margin, and stake saturation.</p><p>Stake saturation is a particularly important point. You do not want to delegate to a node that has already reached 100% stake saturation. This is the maximum stake that any node can reach, and any added delegation beyond 100% saturation will not yield more rewards to you or anyone&nbsp;else.</p><p>So delegate your stake to nodes which are not fully saturated, or even better, spread your stake across multiple nodes. <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">A deeper dive on node selection is available here</a>.</p><p>6. Once you’ve decided on a node, copy the Identity Key and head back to Nym Wallet. Click the Delegate button. Paste the Identity Key into the corresponding field, and then enter the amount of NYM you would like to stake. A summary will pop up including the small delegation fee. If you’re happy, hit&nbsp;Confirm.</p><p>That’s it! With this delegation, you’re building the future private internet. You can Undelegate your stake at any time. Rewards earned will then be reflected in your Nym Wallet balance when the stake is removed from the node. You can view how your delegated stake is performing in Nym&nbsp;Wallet:</p><p>7. Operators might primarily use the Nym Wallet to bond tokens so they can join the mixnet. Of course, they can delegate stake too. Everything up to step 3 is the same, but bonding works a little differently to delegating.</p><p>To run a mix node and start a privacy business with Nym, you’ll need to go over these <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/preliminary-steps.html">preliminary steps</a> and then <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/nodes/mix-node-setup.html">set up a mix&nbsp;node</a>.</p><p>When you have your NYM tokens and you’re ready to bond, select the Bonding option on the dashboard.</p><p>You’ll be prompted to enter your mix node details. Enter these, and hit&nbsp;next.</p><p>You’ll then be prompted to enter the amount of NYM tokens you’d like to bond, the operating cost of your mix node, and the profit margin of your mix node. Enter these and hit&nbsp;next.</p><p>You’ll be asked to run a sign command with your gateway. Copy and paste the below long signature into your command line interface:</p> ./nym-mixnode sign - id &lt;YOUR_ID&gt; - contract-msg &lt;PAYLOAD_GENERATED_BY_THE_WALLET&gt; <p>Copy the resulting signature. It will look something like&nbsp;this:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; The base58-encoded signature is:<br>2GbKcZVKFdpi3sR9xoJWzwPuGdj3bvd7yDtDYVoKfbTWdpjqAeU8KS5bSftD5giVLJC3gZiCg2kmEjNG5jkdjKUt <p>Paste this into Nym Wallet and you’re&nbsp;done.</p><p>Congratulations — you’ve bonded your mix&nbsp;node!</p><p>The Nym Wallet is your interface to contribute to the Nym privacy ecosystem.

<p><code>zcashd</code> 5.7.0 deprecates <code>fetch-params.sh</code> and <code>zcash-fetch-params</code> and bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly so they do not need to be downloaded or stored separately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless you need to generate transactions using the deprecated Sprout shielded pool, you can delete the parameter files stored in these directories to save space, as they are no longer read or used by <code>zcashd</code>: </p>



 
 <code>~/.zcash-params</code>&nbsp;(on Linux); or 



 <code>~/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Mac); or 



 <code>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Windows) 
 



<p>If you do wish to use the Sprout pool, you will need the <code>sprout-groth16.params</code> currently available for download <a href="https://download.z.cash/downloads/sprout-groth16.params">here</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, 5.7.0 reports new mempool metrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All node operators, which include our mining and other ecosystem partners, should upgrade to this latest version as soon as possible. Please note that version 5.6.1 will expire on or around Wednesday, October 11.</p>



<p>Additional changes have been included in this release. For technical details, please read the full release notes available at <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0">https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0</a>.</p>

							<p>Over the past few months, members of the Zcash community have begun discussing what should happen after the current Dev Fund sunsets in late 2024. The Zcash Foundation (ZF) looks forward to supporting the Zcash community in debating and deciding whether or not to institute a new ecosystem funding mechanism.&nbsp;</p><p>As a party to the Zcash <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zcash_Trademark_Donation_and_License_Agreement_20191106.pdf">Trademark Donation and License Agreement</a>, ZF is committed to enacting the clear consensus of the Zcash community when it comes to approving and implementing proposed changes to the Zcash protocol (aka network upgrades). The introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace (or extend) the current Dev Fund falls within this remit, as it would involve a change to the Zcash protocol.</p><p>Therefore, ZF proposes that we follow a similar approach to the tried and tested process that resulted in the creation and adoption of ZIP 1014.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 History Lesson: How the first Dev Fund was created 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>During 2019, the Zcash community began discussions about what should happen after the end of the Founders Reward in late 2020. In August 2019, the Zcash Foundation set forth a <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcash-foundation-guidance-on-dev-fund-proposals/">process and timeline</a>, and described how it would assess community sentiment towards proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community members drafted <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/future-of-zcash-dev-funding-megathread-everything-in-one-place/34063">twenty proposals</a>. Following extensive community debate, these twenty were whittled down to thirteen (preserved in the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/">Zcash ZIPs repository</a>, as ZIPs 1001 thru 1013), which were presented to the community in November 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community sentiment was gathered using three mechanisms:&nbsp;</p>
 
 a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/68dcd8ba-08b5-11ea-95c2-1a34a475f69c/view">poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (previously known as the Community Governance Panel or CGP), in which 48 people voted, 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/community-sentiment-collection-poll-on-nu4-dev-fund-zips/35439/">forum poll</a>, in which people who had joined the forum before March 2019 were eligible to vote, and in which 71 people voted, and 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/7">staked poll</a> of coinholders (in which <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHq-KoiE0mKmllcr_LTwS5tNacf5HHt_VFKPL_tYlHU/edit#gid=0">over 105,000 ZEC was staked for polling purposes by 17 distinct Zcash addresses</a>).&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; 
<p>ZF also <a href="https://zfnd.org/restarting-community-sentiment-collection-for-dev-fund-proposals/#on-miner-signaling">invited miners to signal their sentiment</a> but no miners did so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the ZCAP (CGP), forum (F), and staked poll (CH) can be found <a href="https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dev-Fund-Results.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;(with credit to ECC for creating the graphic).&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZF and ECC worked together to draft a new, mutually-agreeable proposal based on the proposals that had received the most support from the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result was a draft of <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">ZIP 1014</a>, which proposed instituting a Dev Fund, consisting of 20% of newly minted coins and lasting until the next halving event (projected for late 2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2020, two mechanisms were used to assess community sentiment regarding ZIP 1014, and to decide on some final details, including how the Dev Fund should be divided among its recipients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zcash Foundation conducted a <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">combined poll</a> of users who participated in the forum poll during the first round of community sentiment gathering, alongside the pre-existing Zcash Community Advisory Panel. This combined group numbered 119, and <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/43b9bec8-39a1-11ea-914c-b6e34ffa859a/view">88 voted in the poll</a>, which approved ZIP 1014 by 77 votes to 11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/111">staked poll</a> of coinholders was coordinated by Zooko and Andrew Miller, in which 24 distinct Zcash addresses staked over 119,000 ZEC for the purposes of the poll. All but one of the participants in this poll (representing 99.9% of the staked coins) voted to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSlHXhA_NoJy0RW3Gc6YY3bmYcKT_YF8oS_BrSkBnvEGGaJ56WYo7iL_9shuoh-z_DZMYojA6FpLoJv/pubhtml">approve ZIP 1014</a>.</p>
<p>ZF and ECC subsequently agreed that ZIP 1014 should be implemented in the Zcash protocol, and it duly activated in November 2020.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			  Process and Timeline for Submitting Proposals 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Both ZF and ECC agree that it is desirable to gain clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem sooner, rather than later. Therefore, we aim to conduct a first round of community sentiment gathering by polling ZCAP in December (alongside the Zcash Community Grants election).&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, teams and organisations that are interested in receiving protocol funding should publicly announce their interest as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>As with the process that led to ZIP 1014, we invite community members to post proposals to the Zcash community forums, in the form of a draft ZIP for review and discussion by the community.</p><p>We will consult with the ZIP editors on whether they are willing to provide editorial feedback on the draft ZIPs (something that Daira and str4d did last time, and which was very useful in clarifying the proposals), and, if so, what deadline would be appropriate for submitting pull requests to the ZIPs Github repo in time for a December round of community sentiment gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>We will host community calls where specific proposals can be discussed, and the community can ask questions of those who are putting forward proposals.&nbsp;</p><p>After the first round of voting, we will assess the results and, if necessary, do further rounds of proposal revision and sentiment-gathering, in order to zero in on a proposal that we are confident represents the clear consensus of the Zcash community</p><p>While we don’t currently intend to formally analyze sentiment beyond the ZCAP poll, we are interested to hear suggestions and ideas&nbsp; for other means of assessing community sentiment, and we will consider other forms of community feedback collected by other parties if it is valuable and informative, and was collected in good faith.</p><p>If you have suggestions or ideas, please post them to the Zcash Community Forum, in the Governance category.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 A Note on Impartiality 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>We at the Zcash Foundation believe that the work we have carried out over the past few years has been of benefit to Zcash and the Zcash community. We hope that the Zcash community agrees, and is willing to continue funding the work of the Foundation.</p><p>However, for the avoidance of any doubt, if the Zcash community decides that the Dev Fund should end and not be replaced (or that it should be replaced but that ZF should not receive any funding), ZF will support that decision, and do what is necessary to enact it (including implementing the new consensus rules in Zebra).&nbsp;</p><p>If the Zcash community does decide to create a new Dev Fund, ZF recommends furthering the decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem by increasing the number of Dev Fund recipients, with at least one recipient in a jurisdiction outside the United States. We also recommend that any new recipients should be nonprofit entities with tax-exempt status, that are subject to legally-enforceable governance requirements similar to those required of&nbsp; 501(c)(3) organizations (e.g. prohibition of private inurement, restrictions on excessive executive compensation, financial disclosure requirements to ensure transparency and accountability).&nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to helping the Zcash community reach consensus on this important decision, which will have a far-reaching impact on the future of Zcash!</p>

 Nym roadmap update — 2023-24 <p>A look at the upcoming consumer Nym VPN, zk-nyms on Nyx chain, censorship resistance, and more&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The Nym VPN is on the horizon, bringing the strong privacy of the Nym mixnet to the masses and closing the loop of the Nym token economics.</p><p>The app will combine the powerful mixnet and a multi-hop VPN into a single consumer application, paid for in a privacy-preserving manner via NYM tokens using zk-nym credentials.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/update-tentang-roadmap-nym-di-tahun-2023-2024-cffce0af5211">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/nym%E8%B7%AF%E7%BA%BF%E5%9B%BE%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0-2023-2024-43ed8584d4fa">中文</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/n27763a9ed984">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/mise-%C3%A0-jour-de-la-roadmap-de-nym-2023-24-293d4e22f795">Française</a></p><p>The Nym VPN is a key upcoming milestone. The year so far has been all about readying the mixnet for scaling adoption through this app. From initial NymConnect integrations with Telegram, Blockstream, Monero and more to speedy-mode tests and zk-nyms — each of these are an essential piece for enabling holistic, user-friendly privacy.</p><p>Read on to find out what’s on the roadmap for 2023 and the upcoming&nbsp;year.</p> 2023 — Scaling&nbsp;Nym <p>The final few months of 2023 are dedicated to scaling Nym for end users. This entails enabling NymConnect for full system protection via a new Nym VPN and ensuring it can be paid for without compromising privacy.</p> Nym VPN: the decentralised, private internet — early bird&nbsp;access <p>Before the end of this year, early adopters in the core community will be able to test and use the Nym VPN ahead of the mass consumer market launch in early 2024 — the first step towards protecting the patterns of communication for the entire internet.</p><p>Everything about the Nym VPN will put privacy at its very&nbsp;core.</p><p>From the completely decentralised infrastructure that powers the mixnet through to payments, users will be able to send all their traffic via the mixnet or multi-hop VPN as easily as pushing a&nbsp;button.</p><p>The Nym vision is to protect patterns of communication across the entire internet. This entails scaling to millions upon millions of people’s everyday communications. But thousands come before millions, and the first step in achieving this is launching the Nym mixnet and VPN as a paid-for app before reaching enterprise and institutional adoption and standardisation.</p><p>A beta Nym VPN is on track for release by the end of 2023, offered to the Nym core community first, who are well versed in the importance of&nbsp;privacy.</p> Zero-knowledge access with zk-nym credentials: totally private&nbsp;payments <p>Payments for using the NymVPN will also be completely private. The Nym VPN will accept payments in everything from credit cards to Bitcoin, and convert these via NYM tokens to anonymous credentials for the mixnet — meaning a steady stream of NYM tokens circulating through the ecosystem.</p><p>To enable this, the next months will also see major progress on zk-nyms, the technology enabling privacy-preserving payments.</p><p>One of the major problems with paying for VPNs is traceability back to the user. The last thing privacy-conscious customers want is for a (d)VPN service or node deanonymising them via a financial paper&nbsp;trail.</p><p>To fix this problem Nym has developed a zero-knowledge solution called zk-nyms. Essentially, zk-nyms are an anonymous credential system that can be used to prove various things, including that a user has paid for a service — in this case, the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>By tapping into zero-knowledge principles, access is unlinkable to payment details, including any wallet address, card details, name, etc. Think of it as a ‘proof of payment’ that retains absolutely nothing about the&nbsp;user.</p><p>A sandbox for zk-nyms is being set up and will be usable by the end of the year. This technology is enabled via the native <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-is-not-a-blockchain-but-it-is-powered-by-one-4bb16ef16587">Nyx blockchain</a>. Nyx validators will become issuers of zk-nyms, a general-purpose credential system, with bandwidth credentials for the mixnet as a first real-world use case. All this will take place seamlessly in the background, allowing you to simply use the Nym VPN without the additional faff and data leaks associated with digital payments.</p> Project Smoosh: versatility, scalability, and redundancy <p>Project Smoosh has <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/faster-better-stronger-smooshier-improving-mixnet-coverage-with-project-smoosh-eaf4b215507f">already commenced</a> and will be completed in early 2024. To improve redundancy in the mixnet, the core team has begun ‘smooshing’ the different node types in the mixnet (gateways, network requesters, mix nodes and VPN nodes). The same operator will thereby alternately serve as a mix node, a gateway, or a VPN node. This will radically improve redundancy, responding dynamically to the needs of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Gateways and network requesters have ‘smooshed’ already. The next steps are for these to smoosh with mix nodes and for the token economics to be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>With project Smoosh, the Nym token economics will be expanded to determine not just the directory of active mixnodes, but also of gateways. Nodes with the highest reputation will be selected to run gateways and have the chance to receive a reward premium for doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>Project Smoosh will expand rewards to a broader range of Nym infrastructure functions and bake in better failsafes and redundancies to the mixnet, improving speed and availability as demand scales. The final stages of Smoosh are set to complete in the first quarter of&nbsp;2024.</p> 2024 — Nym for end&nbsp;users <p>The focus next year will be on completing major background work that will ensure the Nym VPN can provide holistic, user-friendly privacy to end&nbsp;users.</p><p>This involves improving and building infrastructural capacity completing not just Smoosh, but also increasing capacity and functionality of the Nyx blockchain.</p> Rewards for validators! <p>A new initiative to reward Nyx blockchain validators is currently in development that has all the potential to prove lucrative. As it stands right now, only mix nodes are rewarded for their work via the NYM token. This isn’t fair: validators are incredibly important to the Nym ecosystem because they run the backbone of the mixnet, the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-is-not-a-blockchain-but-it-is-powered-by-one-4bb16ef16587">Nyx blockchain</a>, where the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-breakdown-of-the-smart-contracts-that-run-the-nym-token-economics-3a61b4139f95">Nym smart contracts</a> live. They keep the mixnet secure, keep track of node participation and reputation, and will be issuing Nym VPN access credentials.</p><p>To simplify the token dynamics and prevent two competing tokens from the same Nym ecosystem, a decision was made not to launch a free-floating NYX token for the time&nbsp;being.</p><p>Instead, starting in early 2024, validators who run the Nyx blockchain will receive inflation rewards with a NYX token that they can redeem for NYM allocated from the Nym mix-mining pool. The token economics have been developed and reviewed and the scheme is currently being scoped for technical implementation.</p><p>The mix-mining pool will thereby bootstrap the Nym mixnet as well as Nyx blockchain until we begin to see mass adoption and rewards coming in for Nym VPN usage. This will prepare the Nyx chain for the launch of zk-nyms, after which validators will become increasingly active, eventually running a fully fledged zk-app&nbsp;chain.</p> Nym API for validators: issue and verify Nym credentials online and&nbsp;offline! <p>With Nyx validators fairly rewarded and zk-nyms ready for deployment, a Nym API will allow validators to begin issuing and verifying Nym credentials. These credentials will be based on zk-nym technology, and will be redeemable both offline and&nbsp;online.</p><p>The online mode will be released first to check for double spending as soon as zk-nyms are received.</p><p>The Nym R&amp;D team has made major progress on a decentralised <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08221">offline scheme</a>, which is even suitable as a general purpose anonymous offline e-cash&nbsp;scheme!</p><p>In the second half of 2024, zk-nym transactions will therefore shift to offline, allowing for peer-to-peer, zero-knowledge payments for both the VPN and the mixnet without having to check the blockchain.</p><p>This should boost efficiency but also improve scalability into the millions and hundreds of millions.</p> Censorship resistance: secure, private internet for everyone, everywhere <p>In some geographies VPNs simply do not work very well. In China, for example, they are often blocked completely.</p><p>Right now, the Nym community is <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/help-build-censorship-resistance-with-the-nym-censorship-test-4984160996ad">running censorship tests</a> to understand the current state of play, if the mixnet is being blocked and, if so, how to resist this censorship.</p><p>The Nym R&amp;D team will be working on developing mixnet censorship resistance towards the second half of 2024. The aim is to build censorship-resistant technologies directly into the Nym VPN so that people can cloak and mix their traffic with the Nym mixnet — and access whatever they like, even in countries where VPNs are blocked. In short: an open-access but private and secure internet for anyone, anywhere.</p> 2024 and beyond: Institutional adoption <p>Institutional and enterprise adoption will become the focus towards the end of the year. The data protection market is expected to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230127005388/en/Global-Data-Protection-Solutions-Strategic-Market-Report-2023-Market-to-Reach-116.6-Bn-by-2030-from-64.5-Bn-in-2022---Rising-Number-of-Data-Breaches-Worldwide-Creates-Fertile-Environment-for-Growth---ResearchAndMarkets.com">reach US$116.6 billion worldwide by 2030</a>. With the amount of sensitive information swirling non-stop around the internet at record rates, there is an enormous opportunity to tap into institutional support for the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Whether in finance, medtech, or the personal data sectors, people understand that holding sensitive data is a risk. And that means minimising the amount of data recorded and stored through zk-schemes as well as securing metadata from prying eyes. The Nym mixnet and Nyx blockchain are uniquely positioned to achieve exactly&nbsp;this.</p><p>While scaling to millions of users with the B2C product, the hope is also to strategically partner with organisations in the finance, medical, and personal data industries.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-roadmap-update-2023-24-2466711e1fad">Nym roadmap update — 2023-24</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In this episode of RadicalxChange(s), host Matt Prewitt engages in a deep and thoughtful conversation with Barry Threw, Executive &amp; Artistic Director of Gray Area. They explore Barry's diverse career integrating art, technology, and humanities for economic, social, and ecological regeneration, and examine the cultural shifts in the San Francisco Bay Area. Barry and Matt saunter through anecdotes from Burning Man to Joan Didion to the technocratic molding of the Silicon Valley phenomenon — an exciting pathway of cultural importance to walk along.<br><br>References:</p>  <a href="https://rushkoff.com/books/throwing-rocks-at-the-google-bus/">Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus by Douglas Rushkoff</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slouching_Towards_Bethlehem">Slouching Towards Bethlehem by Joan Didion - Wikipedia</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Man">Burning Man - Wikipedia</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">Effective altruism - Wikipedia</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/2019/11/30/silicon-valley-philanthropy-charitable-giving">Silicon Valley's brand of philanthropy</a>  <p>Bios:</p><p>Barry Threw is the Executive and Artistic Director of <a href="https://grayarea.org/">Gray Area</a>, a San Francisco nonprofit cultural incubator applying art and technology toward social good.

His previous leadership positions have generated innovative &amp; influential platforms, products, teams, and businesses spanning art, music, internet, built environment, and experiential &amp; immersive media: as Software Director with Keith McMillen Instruments, developing advanced technology to bridge traditional string instruments with computers to spark a Western new classical music movement based on the technologies and aesthetics of the 21st century; as Technical Director with Recombinant Media Labs, presenting surround cinema at installations and festivals around the world; as a founding Partner at Fabricatorz, a distributed technology studio for cultural projects with nodes in Hong Kong, St. Louis, San Francisco, and Lisbon; and as Director of Software with Obscura Digital, a San Francisco-based creative technology studio specializing in the design and execution of immersive and interactive experiences worldwide, and the first company to do architectural projection mapping. He organizes the #NEWPALMYRA project, an online community platform focused on the virtual reconstruction and creative reuse of cultural heritage. He played a key role in developing and operating the Vatican Arts and Technology Council, a nondenominational external advisory body for the Vatican, which advanced goals of environmental stewardship, humanitarian compassion, and spreading experiences of spirituality worldwide through an experimental art and technology lab.</p><p>Barry’s Social Links:</p>  <a href="https://barrythrew.com/">Barry Threw | Website</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/barrythrew">@barrythrew | X</a>  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/barrythrew/">Barry Threw | Instagram</a>  <p>Connect with Gray Area:</p>  <a href="https://grayarea.org/">Gray Area | Website</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/GrayAreaorg">@GrayAreaorg | X</a>  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grayareaorg/">Gray Area | Instagram</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GAFFTA">Gray Area | YouTube</a>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GrayArea/">Gray Area | Facebook</a>  <p><br>Matt Prewitt (he/him) is a lawyer, technologist, and writer.

 MixFetch — like the Fetch API, but via the&nbsp;mixnet <p>Web app builders can privacy enhance their apps easily with this simple drop-in replacement for&nbsp;Fetch</p><p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch API</a> is the standard, easy-to-use JavaScript interface for builders to pull information from the web. But like almost all interactions online, using this API leaks metadata, meaning traffic to and from the API is traceable, and therefore vulnerable to pattern analysis. To solve this, developers can now run the Fetch API through the Nym mixnet with mixFetch, giving cover to network traffic when retrieving resources from websites or online services.</p> WTF is mixFetch? <p>Think of <a href="https://sdk.nymtech.net/guides/mix-fetch">mixFetch</a> as a drop-in replacement to the Fetch API, but with one difference: traffic patterns that would ordinarily be exposed are now protected by the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/mixfetch-comme-lapi-fetch-mais-via-le-mixnet-5c14c2d68887">Française</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/mixfetch-es-c%C3%B3mo-la-api-fetch-pero-a-trav%C3%A9s-de-la-mixnet-a23bfb5267f7">Español</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/mixfetch-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA-fetch-api-%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7-%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82-95a3efeb41a4">Русский</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/mixfetch-seperti-fetch-api-tetapi-melalui-mixnet-0918ecad8915">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/mixfetch-fetch-apisi-gibi-ancak-mixnet-arac%C4%B1l%C4%B1%C4%9F%C4%B1yla-918c9fd9f5ef">Türkçe</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/n7c12f186deb8">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymportugues/o-mixfetch-assim-como-o-fetch-api-mas-atrav%C3%A9s-da-mixnet-6341fd8f0021">Português</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/mixfetch-%E4%B8%8E-fetch-api-%E7%9B%B8%E4%BC%BC-%E4%BD%86%E9%80%9A%E8%BF%87-mixnet-aaca224d4000">中文</a></p><p>With mixFetch, developers can create privacy-enhanced apps that retrieve resources from the web, leaving no trace whatsoever. For example, mixFetch could be used to create a simple JavaScript chat application with guaranteed anonymity via the&nbsp;mixnet.</p> What does it mean to ‘fetch’ via the&nbsp;mixnet? <p>Here’s what happens when any kind of message, transaction or request is sent via the Nym mixnet: first, it is wrapped into identically looking encrypted ‘packets’ and shuffles these in with dummy packets. These are then sent through three ‘hops’ to mix nodes all over the world, effectively making it impossible to trace patterns of communication.</p><p>These packets are then decrypted and reassembled at the receiving end, protecting IP addresses, metadata and thereby any patterns of communication that can be used to deanonymise people or learn about services.</p><p>When a packet emerges on the other side, it is routed via a Nym ‘Network Requester’ that engages with services on the user’s behalf, a little like a&nbsp;proxy.</p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">Read more: Tech deep-dive: Nym Network Requesters</a></p><p>With mixFetch, developers can plug and play this infrastructure into web apps, ensuring there is no direct link between the mixnet user and the web service they are&nbsp;using.</p> How to privacy-enhance web apps with&nbsp;mixFetch <p>Writing code with mixFetch is&nbsp;simple.</p><p>Start by installing mixFetch:</p> npm install @nymproject/mix-fetch <p>Next, paste the following into your code, swapping out the examples for the API you&nbsp;need.</p> import { mixFetch } from '@nymproject/mix-fetch';<br>…<br>// HTTP GET<br>const response = await mixFetch('https://nymtech.net');<br>const html = await response.text();<br>…<br>// HTTP POST<br>const apiResponse = await mixFetch('https://api.example.com', {<br>method: 'POST',<br>body: JSON.stringify({ foo: 'bar' }),<br>headers: { [`Content-Type`]: 'application/json', Authorization: `Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}` }<br>}); <p>That’s it! Now you’ve privacy-enhanced Fetch with mixFetch.</p> Wow, that’s pretty easy. What’s the&nbsp;catch? <p>There are currently some limitations. At present, only a handful of <a href="https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/standard-allowed-list.txt">web services are enabled for Nym mixnet Network Requesters</a>. Until these have been opened up, mixFetch will only work with services on this list. Hop into the dev chat on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/824256813200834580/907388467380633670">Discord</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">Matrix</a> to request a service to be added to the&nbsp;list!</p><p>One possible solution to expand the use of mixFetch is for Network Requesters to run via open proxy, which would enable contacting more services without their permission.

We’re going to explore that vision today on Bankless.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ ✨ DEBRIEF | Ryan &amp; David unpacking the episode: <a href="https://www.bankless.com/debrief-sergey-nazarov-chainlink">https://www.bankless.com/debrief-sergey-nazarov-chainlink</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- 🏹 Airdrop Hunter is HERE, join your first HUNT today <a href="https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT">https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 LayerZero | Accelerating Web3 Interoperability via GoogleCloud <a href="https://bankless.cc/layer-zero">https://bankless.cc/layer-zero</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE <a>⁠https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2</a>&nbsp; ⁠</p> <p>🦊METAMASK PORTFOLIO | MANAGE YOUR WEB3 EVERYTHING ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/MetaMask">https://bankless.cc/MetaMask&nbsp;</a></p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum%C2%A0%20%E2%81%A0">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a></p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/Toku">https://bankless.cc/Toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄UNISWAP | ON-CHAIN MARKETPLACE ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🔗 CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 7:30 The Chainlink Vision&nbsp; 13:59 Offchain Computation&nbsp; 20:35 Why Chainlink Is Here 28:20 Offchain Trust Maximization Technicalities&nbsp; 31:31 &nbsp;Oracle Networks&nbsp; 38:53 Dynamic Automated Inception Marketplaces 45:45 CCIP&nbsp; 1:08:20 Why Swift Is Important 1:14:45 Banks to Blockchains&nbsp; 1:25:18 DTCC Explained&nbsp; 1:31:58 &nbsp;5 Levels of Crosschain Security&nbsp; 1:38:40 Crypto in 2030&nbsp; 1:44:40 Closing &amp; Disclaimers&nbsp;</p> <p>----- RESOURCES</p> <p>Chainlink <a href="https://chain.link">https://chain.link</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>CCIP&nbsp; <a href="https://chain.link/cross-chain">https://chain.link/cross-chain</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Five Layers of Cross-Chain Security <a href="https://blog.chain.link/five-levels-cross-chain-security/">https://blog.chain.link/five-levels-cross-chain-security/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>SmartCon Virtual Signup&nbsp; <a href="https://smartcon.chain.link/virtual">https://smartcon.chain.link/virtual</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

 Why release a transparency report? 



<p>Electric Coin Co. is committed to openness and transparency — as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital currency, and in support of our mission to empower people with economic freedom. This transparency report details company income, expenses, and use of funds during Q1 2023.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Key takeaways</p>



 
 Bootstrap received coins at a value below the ECC operating expense level for Q1 2023. During this time, Bootstrap received coins at an average of $345,000 a month (at the Q1 average ZEC price, $45, for each of the three months’ distribution dates), and Bootstrap and ECC incurred average monthly expenses of approximately $677,000. 



 At the end of Q1 2023, Bootstrap and ECC collectively held approximately $1.4M in USD and approximately 107.8K ZEC. As of September 27, 2023, the company held approximately $676K in USD and approximately 89K ZEC.

<p>Since Circle’s founding a decade ago, we have always aspired to a regulation-first approach based on trust, transparency, accountability and financial integrity. We believe it is essential to comply and communicate with governments and regulators on matters that impact our business and customers. To that end, Circle filed a friend-of-the-court, or amicus, legal brief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Sept. 28 outlining why USDC and other U.S. dollar-backed payment stablecoins are not securities. The brief also explains that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not have jurisdiction over payment stablecoins, because USDC is a form of money and lacks the essential features of an investment contract.</p>

<p>When we compute a ZK circuit we are not just executing some code, but proving that we have executed the code correctly.</p><p>Take a program that computes x + y = z. It's not enough for a ZK program to simply output z, the program also needs to prove that x + y was executed correctly to arrive at the value&nbsp;z.</p><p>Producing the proof requires establishing constraints.</p><p>In other words, circuits are comprised of constrained functions -meaning ZK programs that generate proofs based on a set of constraints.</p><p>So why then, would you need a function with no constraints — an unconstrained function? You might think unconstrained functions would be unsafe, given their name — like taking the guardrails off of a ZK circuit. And you’d be&nbsp;right!</p><p>Circuit code without constraints can be “proven” to create any outcome! Rather than creating a proof that deterministically proves the validity of a piece of code, unconstrained functions allow you to execute code that would otherwise be very expensive or difficult to compute inside the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>But being able to execute logic outside of a circuit is critical for both circuit performance and constructing proofs on information that is external to a&nbsp;circuit.</p> When to&nbsp;use <p>Generally, we want to use unconstrained functions whenever there’s something that’s easy to verify but hard to compute within the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>An unconstrained function simply executes code as you would expect in a normal programming execution environment.</p><p>In this post we want to make sure that developers who are tapping into the performance benefits of unconstrained functions aren’t incorrectly implementing unconstrained functions in a way that leads to worse security for their programs. Incorrect usage of unconstrained functions could lead to bugs, and zk development overall is a newer, scarier paradigm. We want to make it easy for developers to use <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a> to write performant and secure ZK programs, and unconstrained functions can help them optimize their circuits when implemented correctly.</p> Simple division <p>Assuming proving divisions in ZK is costly while proving multiplications is easy, and we want to prove the computation of 100 /&nbsp;5.</p><p>Proving 100 / 5 = x directly in ZK would be inefficient:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;6<p>Instead, we might use unconstrained functions to optimize our circuits. A more optimized approach would&nbsp;involve:</p><p>1. Computing 100 / 5 = x in an unconstrained manner</p><p>2. Proving x * 5 = 100 in&nbsp;ZK</p><p>Here’s a way to optimize the same division operation:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;7<p>Cautious readers however might notice both the code excerpts above yield approximately the same number of constraints in Noir’s abstract circuit intermediate representation (ACIR) given the optimization is simple enough to implement in Noir’s compiler.</p><p>The key intuition here is that in a ZK execution environment, proving multiplications is cheaper than proving divisions.</p><p>Given all Noir programs compile to an intermediate representation called the Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation (ACIR), we can judge circuit optimization on both ACIR opcodes and the ultimate number of backend circuit&nbsp;gates.</p><p>This simple division case has 2 ACIR opcodes and 7 final backend circuit gates. The unoptimized version where we check assert(x == 20) has 3 ACIR opcodes and 8 final backend circuit sizes. Our optimization reduced the final backend size by one gate. Given this is a super simple example, let's dive into a more complex case where the optimizations are more meaningful.</p> A more complex&nbsp;example <p>Colin Nielsen, developer in the Noir community wrote the following code for converting unsigned integers (uints) to u8 arrays, without the use of unconstrained functions.</p><blockquote>👀 See Colin’s <a href="https://twitter.com/colinrives">Twitter</a> +&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/colinnielsen">Github</a></blockquote><p>Here’s the unoptimized code:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;8<p>This code has 91 total ACIR opcodes and a circuit size of 3,619. A lot of the operations in this function are already optimized away by the compiler (e.g., all the bitshifts turn into divisions by constants).</p><p>However, we can save a bunch of gates by casting to u8 a bit earlier. This automatically truncates the bitshifted value to fit in a u8, which allows us to remove the XOR against&nbsp;0xff.</p><p>This is what the slightly-optimized code looks&nbsp;like:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;9<p>ACIR opcodes generated: 75</p><p>Backend circuit size:&nbsp;3,143</p><p>Already, this saves us ~480 gates in total, but we can do&nbsp;better.</p><p>This code is all constrained, so we’re proving every step of the calculation using num. But in fact, we don't actually care about how we make the calculation, just that the computation is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>This is where unconstrained functions come&nbsp;in.</p> Optimizing with unconstrained functions <p>It turns out that truncating a u72 into a u8 is hard to do inside of a SNARK. Each time we do this operation to truncate down into u8, we lay down 4 ACIR opcodes, which get converted into multiple&nbsp;gates.</p><p>It’s actually much easier to calculate num from out, rather than the other way around. All we need to do is multiply each element of out by a constant and add them all together, both of which are relatively easy operations to do inside of a&nbsp;SNARK.</p><p>So, instead of truncating u72 into u8, we can run u72_to_u8 as unconstrained function code in order to calculate out. Then, we can use that result in our constrained function and assert that if we were to do the reverse calculation, we'd get back&nbsp;num.</p><p>An example of what this looks like is&nbsp;below:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;10<p>Total ACIR opcodes generated: 78</p><p>Backend circuit size:&nbsp;2,902</p><p>This usage of unconstrained functions ends up optimizing our circuit even further and taking off another ~250 gates from our&nbsp;circuit!</p><p>We’ve ended up with more ACIR opcodes than before, but these are easier for the backend to prove (resulting in fewer gates overall). This is the beauty of using unconstrained functions — optimizing code that’s easy to verify but hard to compute within the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>Put differently, unconstrained functions allow you to reformulate certain pieces of code that are easier to check than to execute directly in a ZK&nbsp;circuit.</p> Resources <p>For more on unconstrained functions, see this post by Tom French in the official Noir docs: <a href="https://noir-lang.org/language_concepts/unconstrained/">https://noir-lang.org/language_concepts/unconstrained/</a></p><p>Are you a developer interested in getting started with&nbsp;Noir?</p><p>Jump into the <a href="https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter">noir-starter Github repo</a> and when you’re ready <a href="https://aztec.network/grants/">apply for a Grant</a> — we’re currently supporting Noir use-cases through the end of&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/unconstrained-functions-in-noir/">https://aztec.network</a> on September 26,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/unconstrained-functions-in-noir-b6884d697679">Unconstrained Functions In Noir</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>Horizen EON Forger Nodes will soon be available to the public for anyone who wishes to participate in the EON network.</p>



<p>Available on the Proof-Of-Stake Horizen EON chain, these nodes are different from the Proof-Of-Work Horizen mainchain nodes. How do these two types of nodes differ, and how do they each play a critical role in securing the network?</p>



<p>Before understanding the importance of these forger nodes, it’s important to first remember or learn some blockchain terms.</p>



 What is the Horizen mainchain and the Horizen EON sidechain? 







<p>The Horizen mainchain is a <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/layer-0/">layer 0</a> chain whose native cryptocurrency is ZEN. It doesn’t natively support smart contracts but natively supports the creation of sidechains.</p>



<p>A sidechain is an independent blockchain that runs parallel to the Horizen mainchain and inherits its security. Sidechains can be used to extend the capabilities of the mainchain, for example by enabling smart contracts, token minting, voting, etc. In addition, ZEN can be transferred back and forth between the mainchain and sidechains (as a gas token) using the forward and backward transfer mechanism.</p>



<p>The Horizen sidechains and the mainchain are independent of each other. A sidechain can have its own consensus and does not rely on the mainchain to grow and add more blocks.</p>



<p>Horizen EON is a dedicated sidechain that implements an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This brings smart contract capabilities to the Horizen ecosystem.</p>



<p>Thanks to the forward and backward transfer mechanism, it’s possible to mint ZEN on Horizen EON by locking an equal amount of ZEN on the mainchain and vice versa. This is important for two reasons:</p>



 
 ZEN are required to pay gas fees on Horizen EON. 



 Horizen EON brings programmability to ZEN. Once ZEN are transferred to Horizen EON, it’s possible to operate on them with all the flexibility enabled by smart contracts.&nbsp; 
 



 Why does the Horizen EON sidechain need forger nodes? 







<p>Horizen’s mainchain operates on a proof-of-work consensus, meaning that it is the miners (in this case, ASICs) who compete to add new blocks to the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>Currently, The Horizen blockchain has a block reward system where the miner who completes the block receives 60% of the reward for this work. Then 10% goes to the Secure Nodes operators, 10% to the Super Nodes operators, and 20% to the ecosystem Treasury.</p>



<p>Secure Nodes and Super Nodes may sound like a hybrid POS/POW system, but they’re not. On Horizen, Secure Nodes and Super Nodes were created to add an extra layer of security to the network by allowing the community to keep a copy of the blockchain and be compensated for verifying transactions validated by miners.</p>



<p>This multi-layer node system has been in place since 2018. In the meantime, the needs of the network have evolved, particularly with the release of Zendoo and Horizen EON, Horizen’s EVM-compatible sidechain. As a result, the current Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen network. Furthermore, with <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/upcoming-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">the removal of the shielded pools on mainchain</a>, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, there is a strong need for forger nodes in the EON chain. The Horizen EON chain is consensus and scalability-independent. To achieve consensus independence, it is necessary for the chain to have its own nodes to validate the transactions taking place on its chain.</p>



 Forger nodes permit to secure the network 



<p>In a Proof-of-Stake chain, the nodes are called forger nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes play a critical role in PoS consensus by creating blocks, validating transactions, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes are critical to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus for several reasons:</p>



 
 Block production: They create new blocks in the blockchain, with their chance of being selected often based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold as collateral. 



 Transaction validation: Forger nodes validate and add transactions to the blockchain, ensuring that only valid transactions are recorded. 



 Security: They’re financially motivated to act honestly because they’ve staked their own tokens as collateral, risking loss if they behave maliciously. 



 Energy efficiency: PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW because it doesn’t require the same amount of computing power. 



 Sybil attack resistance: PoS networks are less vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where an attacker creates many fake nodes to gain control. 



 Decentralization: Forging nodes contribute to network decentralization, allowing a wider range of participants to be involved. 
 



<p>There is an open Zen Improvement Proposal (ZenIP) for redirecting Secure Node block rewards to EON forger node. The purpose of this proposal is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization through forger nodes. The current Secure Node operators are well-equipped to provide this type of support. For more information about this ZenIP, please visit “ <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">ZenIP 42206 Explained: Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards Into Horizen EON</a>”.</p>

Read on to learn&nbsp;how:</p> What is the Alephium&nbsp;project? <p>The <a href="https://alephium.org/">Alephium</a> project is a developer-friendly network that’s optimised for DeFi and smart contract applications. The project aims to combine the decentralisation, self-sovereignty and security of Bitcoin with high-performance, accessibility and energy efficiency. To achieve this, it employs a ‘Proof of Less Work’ algorithm to save on energy and improve on the UTXO model of BTC to make it scalable and programmable.</p><p>In short: Alephium is programmable and designed with security in mind, offering the programmability of ETH but with an Asset Permission System to securely manage decentralised applications. It is designed to keep transactions running as the project scales, even under heavy traffic — promising to allow up to 10,000 transactions per&nbsp;second.</p><p>Its ‘Proof of Less Work’ algorithm dynamically adjusts the work required to mine new blocks, reducing energy consumption. The chain structure benefits from custom VM <a href="https://medium.com/@alephium/meet-alphred-a-virtual-machine-like-no-others-85ce86540025">Alphred</a>, which introduces trustless, peer to peer smart contract transactions. Alephium’s own programming language, <a href="https://docs.alephium.org/ralph/getting-started/">Ralph</a>, promises to allow builders to create efficient and secure smart contracts, easily.</p><p>Check <a href="https://docs.alephium.org/">out the docs on the Alephium website</a> to learn how Alephium scales through their novel ‘sharding’ technology, as well as more on its energy-saving ‘Proof of Less Work’ algorithm, and the ‘stateful UTXO’ model that offers programmability and scalability. <a href="https://medium.com/notrustverify/alephium-x-nym-1-buying-alph-tokens-through-nyms-mixnet-298c3891efad">A deeper dive is available on the No Trust Verify Medium page&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Here’s how to use the Alephium wallet through NymConnect, securing traffic patterns against observers!</p> Using Alephium’s wallet through NymConnect <p>Step 1: First, you need to download and install the Alephium&nbsp;wallet:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/alephium/desktop-wallet/releases/tag/v2.1.0">https://github.com/alephium/desktop-wallet/releases/tag/v2.1.0</a></p><p>Step 2: Next, download NymConnect at the following link:</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/</a></p><p>Step 3: Open NymConnect, and click on the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen.

 The launch of the Horizen DAO marks the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community. 



<p><a href="http://horizen.io">Horizen</a> is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>



 About Horizen DAO 



<p>DAO stands for “Decentralized Autonomous Organization,” which has emerged as the standard for decentralized governance in the blockchain space and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horizen has always been a community-driven project and has long recognized that a strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is directed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on<a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about"> the Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 Proposal Phases and Voting Process 



<p>The Horizen DAO further decentralizes decision-making for technical, non-technical, and other substantive improvements to the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Protocol Improvement Proposals (IPs) are an established mechanism used to select and implement new features and core protocol changes in many blockchain projects. In Horizen’s case, this IP process is the key tool for the Horizen DAO’s community-led governance. With Horizen’s native token, $ZEN, serving as the governance token for both the Horizen mainchain and the EON sidechain, IPs for each are called, respectively, ZenIPs and EONIPs.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>


 
 


<p>$ZEN holders are the ultimate decision-makers for the future of Horizen and exercise governance over the network’s evolution through participating in the Horizen DAO. Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community. To facilitate effective community governance, users will also be able to delegate voting power to individuals they view as effective stewards of the Horizen ecosystem guiding values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!</p>

This affects both Secure and Super Nodes’ ability to continue to perform challenges, and the ability to set up new nodes which currently requires a balance in a shielded address.

<p>With the <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">hard fork that was activated at block 1426200</a> (September 26th 2023), private addresses can no longer receive ZEN from transparent addresses. This affects both Secure and Super Nodes’ ability to continue to perform challenges, and the ability to set up new nodes which currently requires a balance in a shielded address.</p>



<p>Starting September 26, 2023, challenges in both systems are suspended indefinitely. The increased requirements of successfully validating certificates introduced with the registration of EON will serve as a substitute for challenges in the interim.</p>



 Steps for Node Operators 



<p>Existing Nodes<br>There should be no effect on any existing nodes unless the node’s wallet is replaced. See New Nodes below.</p>



<p>Any API calls from a node operator requesting a manual challenge should be stopped.</p>



<p>New Nodes<br>If a new node is created (or a new wallet is created) it will need to follow the current guide. One private address will still need to be created and a very small amount of ZEN sent to it to give the private address a balance. The ZEN will need to be sent from another private address. This is a workaround until a new version of the Nodetracker is published.</p>



 System Changes 



 
 An updated version of the Nodetracker software that removes the check for private addresses will be available for new nodes once testing is complete. 



 An updated version of the tracking server software that disables challenges (instead of just suspending) will be rolled out once testing is complete. 
 



<p>After the system changes have been implemented, Node Operators are free to start withdrawing funds previously required for challenges from their shielded addresses to transparent addresses.</p>

  Partnering with PartyKit: Everything is Better with Friends  <p>Sunil and his team are turning lonely online tasks into collaborative multiplayer experiences.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky	 



Published September 26, 2023
  



Team PartyKit: CXO Sylwia Vargas, Founder Sunil Pai and CTO Jani Eväkallio.



 
<p>I am a student of antiquity. At age 10, while many of my peers in the tech industry were learning how to code, I was buried somewhere between the sixth and fifth centuries BC, learning Latin and ancient Greek. (To this day I have some highly marketable skills—like reciting Virgil in the original.) One lesson that stuck with me from those studies is something Aristotle said many centuries ago: that we humans are “social animals.” As markets and technologies have come and gone, this part of our nature has been slow to change; <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/this-study-of-300000-people-reveals-1-secret-to-living-a-longer-healthier-life.html">dozens of studies</a> on health and longevity show that no matter what we do in life, it is better with friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By that measure, the Internet is not an ideal environment for us—because our digital experiences are so often lonely. We spend 8-10 hrs a day in front of our screens largely alone. Collaborative editing in Google Docs, collaborative design in Figma, and multiplayer video games are the rare exceptions that give us a taste of what the good life on the internet could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The view that all business apps require multiplayer collaboration is not necessarily universally held. The skeptic might ask how many Google Docs and Figmas there can be, i.e., how many apps truly require real-time, multiplayer collaboration?</p>



<p>Such skepticism is a failure of imagination, anchored in how things have been rather than how things can be. The fact is very few business processes are truly single-player; even something as mundane as expense reports requires collaboration, as does every other workflow that involves approvals. But these naturally multiplayer experiences have been artificially constrained into sequential, asynchronous workflows that can take weeks to complete.</p>



<p>Imagine instead you could just tag your manager or colleague in finance—or your friendly AI-driven finance copilot—to review your expense report, and they could flag anything that needs fixing on the spot. Historically, creating that kind of collaborative experience required a lot of hard work and technical sophistication. The likes of Google could do it, but your average SaaS startup could not. And while some new technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> libraries have been inching us closer to multiplayer experiences, they still require a lot of technology integration and many hours of engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.partykit.io/">PartyKit</a>, a developer-friendly platform for real-time human-to-human and human-to-AI collaboration. PartyKit does the heavy lifting for you, enabling multiplayer experiences with a few lines of Javascript code. It is easy to customize; it includes all the analytics, and other tools you need to build production apps; and because it is open source, it can run on your organization’s own infrastructure—or even your own laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first met PartyKit founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunil-pai-a47732253/">Sunil Pai</a> earlier this year, we fell in love with his velocity and can-do attitude. Case in point is the way he got hired at Cloudflare: after he complained on X (formerly known as Twitter) about certain aspects of the developer experience, they invited him to join the team and fix it—which he did. During <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sequoia-arc/">Sequoia Arc</a>, we got to know Sunil very well, and were impressed with his contagious enthusiasm for his creation; he was quick to show anyone who was interested a demo on his phone. As they say, ABC—always be closing!</p>



<p>During the beta period, we were also impressed with the diversity of applications users found for PartyKit, from a <a href="https://www.tldraw.com/">drawing app</a> to a <a href="http://v/">state machine</a> to an <a href="https://sitegpt.ai/">LLM-based customer service agent</a>. And those are just small hints of what’s to come; as we celebrate the general availability of the platform, we will no doubt be surprised in the weeks and months ahead by the multitude of use cases PartyKit enables! We are proud to support Sunil and his team as they continue to grow, and we look forward to the better, less lonely internet we’ll all enjoy as they work to make collaborative multiplayer experiences the norm.</p>

However, for the NymVPN to run smoothly, the mixnet needs to grow, especially gateways.</p><p>Enter project Smoosh — an initiative which will simplify components, boost redundancy, and significantly grow geographic coverage for users and rewards for operators.</p> WTF is Project&nbsp;Smoosh? <p>The clue’s in the name: Nym CTO Dave Hrycyszyn and Nym Chief Scientist Claudia Diaz have led this initiative to ‘smoosh’ Nym nodes together, so that the same operator can alternately serve as a mix node, a gateway, or a VPN&nbsp;node.</p><p>This is designed to simplify components with minimal changes to the underlying code, while also building in the redundancy and coverage required for the upcoming&nbsp;VPN.</p><p>The token economics will be modified to reflect these changes. The token economics for mix node reward, reputation and selection will remain the same. But nodes with a high reputation score that flag they are available to run gateways will have the chance to be selected as gateways to earn higher&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The global privacy bootcamp <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-privacy-academy-preview-91a545a2c31f">Nym Shipyard</a>, due to kick off this October, will also support project Smoosh by onboarding new operators, growing the Nym community, and offering guidelines on best practice for maximising node efficiency and&nbsp;rewards.</p> Three steps of project&nbsp;Smoosh <p>Project Smoosh will proceed in three&nbsp;stages:</p>  Combining the gateway and network requester. This stage is complete.  Combining all the nodes in the Nym mixnet into one binary — so the mix node, the entry and exit gateways, and network requester are all bundled into one. Operators will be able to select and flag which functions they wish to offer — for example, not everyone will be able to, or want to, run an exit gateway. This stage is in progress.  Updating the Nym smart contract with a new token economic mechanism for the directory authority. In simple language: the economics and reputation behind how nodes are selected in the network. This stage is in&nbsp;design.  <p>All three steps will be performed incrementally over the coming months, and with enough time to incorporate feedback from Nym node operators and debug if necessary.</p><p>Operator software will essentially remain unchanged except now, all binaries will be packaged into just the one Nym node binary rather than multiple binaries.</p><p>The mix node reputation and delegation will remain the same, but rewards will look a little different to ensure higher rewards for those carrying the additional weight of running gateways and the&nbsp;VPN.</p><p>The previous setup did not offer incentives for running gateways and network requesters. These are the hops to the external internet — a vital component of the mixnet that facilitates anonymised requests to public web services outside of the Nym network. Being the interface to the external world entails additional risks, which is why rewards for running these components will be&nbsp;higher.</p><p>On that risk — there is one very important change that Nym is seeking feedback&nbsp;on:</p> Exit gateways: from an ‘allow list’ to a ‘deny&nbsp;list’ <p>Operators running gateways will have to open their nodes to a wider range of online services, similarly to Tor exit&nbsp;relays.</p><p>Right now,<a href="https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/standard-allowed-list.txt"> the gateway allow list</a> is extremely contained and limited to a very small number of online services, where network requesters act as a proxy and can only connect to permitted domains like Telegram or Matrix and some crypto&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Nym is committed to ensuring privacy for all users for the broadest possible range of online services. To achieve this, the mixnet needs to switch from allowing connections to only a handful of services to instead allow any service with the exception of those on a ‘deny list’. By doing so, Nym is building on the best practices already established by the Tor community.</p><p>As a result, the envisioned gateway setup would be much more permissive, and enabling privacy as the default for the internet.</p><p>Gateways would act both as SOCKS5 Network Requesters and exit nodes for IP traffic from the mixnet clients and the Nym&nbsp;VPN.</p><p>Switching from the current, limited ‘allow’ list to a ‘deny’ list would enhance the usage and appeal of Nym products for end users, and this increased usage would also lead to higher revenues for operators.</p><p>This ‘deny’ list will include protections for operators, likely along the lines of <a href="https://tornull.org/">Tor Null</a>, or the<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/ReducedExitPolicy"> Tor Reduced Exit Policy</a>, other lists, or a combination of all of the&nbsp;above.</p><p>Operators are encouraged to join the<a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym"> Discord</a>, and<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23operators:nymtech.chat"> Element (Matrix)</a> channels to discuss with the Nym core&nbsp;team.</p><p>Nym core is currently consulting legal advisors and has run a survey with operators to determine feeling, best practice, legal implications, and the most appropriate way&nbsp;forward.</p><p>It isn’t possible for Nym to provide comprehensive legal advice across all jurisdictions, but a legal best practice document will soon be published on the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech">Nym GitHub</a> covering the United States and Switzerland, with advice for Germany, Ukraine, and Russia to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Operators!</p><p>Please join the Nym community channels on <a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">Telegram</a>,<a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym"> Discord</a>, and<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23operators:nymtech.chat"> Element (Matrix)</a>.

 📖 Deep dive: How Machiavellian principles could help fix decentralized governance <p>Miles Jennings</p><p>Whatever you make of Renaissance-era Italian philosopher and political operator Niccolo Machiavelli (who inspired the word “Machiavellian” for better or worse), many of the principles he explored in his writings remain relevant today. For instance, we can see echoes of such principles -- on leadership and the preservation of political liberty -- in both the Federalist Papers and design of the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>But several Machiavellian principles can also be applied to fix decentralized governance, particularly issues with DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) in web3. How? Because Machiavelli’s philosophy during that time was developed with a very pragmatic understanding of the struggle for social power, as well as the premise that no mechanism exists to guarantee virtuous actions.&nbsp;And while most DAOs have developed, as a first step, simplified models of governance based on direct democracy, indirect democracy, and corporate governance -- these approaches have failed to overcome the complex sociopolitical realities involved in decentralized governance. </p><p>So in this set of articles, Jennings examines issues facing DAOs today; and outlines current solutions such as subDAOs, delegate programs, governance minimization, and others, as well as their limitations. Jennings then shares how 4 Machiavellian principles can help design more effective DAOs and better decentralized governance, including minimizing governance and checking-and-balancing the leadership class.</p><p>read more on Machiavelli for DAOs:<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-principles-dao-decentralized-governance/">Principles for Fixing Decentralized Governance</a> (part 1)<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-daos-designing-effective-decentralized-governance/">Designing Effective Decentralized Governance</a> (part 2)</p><p>share on: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1705276359831060654?s=20">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x22ba35">Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7111042659175059456">LinkedIn</a><br><br>see also: </p>  <p>“a16z suggests Machiavelli to fix decentralized governance”, by Ana Paula Pereira in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/a16z-machiavelli-fix-decentralized-governance">Cointelegraph</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Lightspeed Democracy: What web3 organizations can learn from the history of governance”, by Andrew Hall and Porter Smith on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/lightspeed-democracy-what-web3-organizations-can-learn-from-the-history-of-governance/">a16zcrypto.com</a></p>   🇬🇧 Announcing: Crypto Startup School goes to London <p>Jason Rosenthal&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-startup-school/">Crypto Startup School</a> (CSS) is our popular accelerator program for early-stage companies, providing expert guidance, capital, and resources tailored for crypto founders.

<p>Protecting users from total transparency is crucial for addressing one of the main hurdles facing DeFi adoption: data privacy.</p><p>In a system where blockchain transparency can be maliciously exploited, alpha decay and surveillance are inevitable, making the current state of decentralized finance incompatible with traditional services. As such, addressing our networks’ inherent concerns can only be done with robust controls and proactive strategies in place to prevent the misuse of decentralized tools.</p><p>To this end, and in an ecosystem milestone, <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> and its DAO are debuting a suite of zero-knowledge compliance solutions. This initial release integrates <a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi</a>'s services to create a path to compliance and data privacy in DeFi. </p> Panther Protocol’s approach to compliance <p>Panther Protocol’s goal is to create a cross-chain architecture that enables seamless access to DeFi while preserving the privacy of users’ data and activity. The protocol leverages the security and liquidity of existing networks while integrating zero-knowledge technology for users to have full control over their data. The protocol’s v1 also integrates these features into a solution that DeFi enthusiasts can use to access their favorite protocols.</p><p>In a first-of-its-kind approach that complements its decentralized structure, Panther introduces an innovative method to manage compliance risks. Panther integrates third-party<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/"> compliance providers</a>, operating autonomously from the protocol, to authenticate users, offering them a unique set of credentials after users complete a series of verifications. These credentials then serve the dual purposes of:</p>  Crafting zero-knowledge proofs directly within their browsers.  Seamlessly integrating with blockchain-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIDs </a>and similar platforms.  <p>Due to the flexibility of this design, Panther users can access the protocol without being bound to a single compliance provider, being able to choose from a variety of them. Once verified, users can then present these credentials as an irrefutable attestation to their authenticity, granting them unhindered access to the protocol. As a result, Panther can retain its neutrality while giving users a path to complying with regulations.</p> Integrating PureFi<br> <p>In the process of selecting a compliance vendor suitable for Panther’s compliance flow and willing to support the proposed architecture, the Panther DAO elected PureFi.</p><p>PureFi has gained recognition in the Web3 space by pioneering the use of technologies such as decentralized verifiable credentials. The protocol’s goal is to become a one-stop decentralized compliance solution that onboards institutional money to DeFi. PureFi also actively participated in the Panther DAO’s discussions surrounding compliance integrations.</p><p>For Panther’s v1 release, the integration will fulfill the following functions (with all zero-knowledge capabilities built by the Panther team and PureFi in charge of compliance procedures):</p>  Capturing users’ data (email, name, birth date, and nationality) upon their first attempt to access the protocol.  Issuing a signed zk-friendly attestation of the user sharing their data, tied to the user’s wallet (which the user can use as a “Master” account to identify themselves).  Running KYT checks (aka “wallet screening”) to analyze AML/CTF risks of a deposit/withdrawal, both on the receiver’s and sender’s end, and issuing zk-friendly KYT attestations upon passing.  Maintaining an on-chain list of valid cryptographic keys (i.e., certificates) of compliance providers, including the EdDSA public key available on Polygon.  Escrowing the compliance provider’s backup keys with a reliable 3rd party, e.g., a law firm, to be used in case PureFi goes offline.  <p>Importantly, the integration is designed to be compatible with any compliance provider or multiple of them simultaneously.</p> In Summary <p>Zero-knowledge, decentralized compliance, and self-sovereign identity solutions create a technology stack that, for the first time ever, opens a seamless path to compliance while protecting users’ privacy. Panther and PureFi are proud to announce a collaboration that will set the foundation for greater adoption of these solutions and Decentralized Finance as a whole.</p><p>Panther’s <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">compliance integrations</a> can already be tested by ZK technology and DeFi enthusiasts at <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s Testnet Stage 1</a>, released earlier this month.

Testers can go through the verification flow, create Panther Accounts, and get an exclusive look at Panther's v1!</p> About PureFi Protocol <p>PureFi Protocol allows dApps to fully comply with local and global regulations while preserving decentralization and user anonymity.</p><p>Developed by AMLBot in partnership with Hacken Foundation to provide a full-cycle solution for crypto asset analytics and AML/KYC procedures for the Web3 infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> |<a href="https://dashboard.purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Dashboard</a> |<a href="https://wp.purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Whitepaper</a> |<a href="https://t.me/purefiprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> TG Chat</a> |<a href="https://t.me/purefipro?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> TG ANN</a> |<a href="https://medium.com/purefi?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Medium</a> |<a href="https://twitter.com/Purefi_Protocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Twitter</a></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>On stage at Messari Mainnet today in New York, Brave, Electric Coin Co. (ECC), and Filecoin Foundation announced that they are teaming up to bring innovative new privacy features to the Brave browser and its integrated Web3 wallet.</p>

 Private transactions for all&nbsp; 
<p>With support from ECC, Brave will integrate the Zcash protocol in the browser’s built-in crypto wallet so users can securely store, send, and receive ZEC alongside other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The integration underscores Brave’s commitment to blending privacy, transparency, and user choice. With private transactions possible alongside public ones, users will have greater control over their Web3 activity.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m excited about integrating Zcash into the Brave web browser because privacy should be normal. The Brave browser is a tool that tens of millions of people are using for everyday communication, web browsing, shopping, and other activities. This gives them access to money that respects their security and consent. I’m thrilled for this launch — and what’s to come — as a result of this partnership with Brave and Filecoin Foundation.”</p>
<p>— Zooko Wilcox, CEO, Electric Coin Co.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This partnership with like-minded organizations reinforces Brave’s mission for a more private and user-first Web. Not only do we hope to make it simple to use ZEC for private transactions, but we also aim to maximize privacy during key moments of purchase or exchange.”</p>
<p>— Yan Zhu, CISO, Brave</p>
</blockquote>

 A private and decentralized messaging feature 
<p>Brave, ECC, and Filecoin Foundation also teased plans on stage to develop a new, privacy-based feature in the Brave browser that will offer private messages and media transmission via the Zcash protocol. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) – the technology underlying the Filecoin protocol – will play a crucial role in providing secure storage for the encrypted content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re thrilled to be a part of this important project. We believe cryptocurrency can be the foundation for a better Internet — an alternative to big tech that puts people in control of their own data, protects user privacy and security, and permanently preserves humanity’s most important information.”</p>
<p>— Marta Belcher, President, Filecoin Foundation</p>
</blockquote>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Brave</p>
<p>Brave Software’s fast, privacy-oriented browser, combined with its blockchain-based digital advertising platform, is reinventing the Web for users, publishers, and advertisers. Users can opt into privacy-respecting ads that reward them with the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a frequent flyer-like token they can redeem or use to tip or contribute to publishers and other content creators.

 <blockquote>Different approaches to private asset velocity in light of the Privacy Pools paper.</blockquote> <br>Introduction <p>Public blockchains inherently champion transparency. The cornerstone of this architecture allows anyone to validate transactions without dependence on centralized intermediaries. This transparency, while advantageous in many respects, also accentuates the pressing need for privacy, especially given the escalating prominence of platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum, their DeFi applications, and adoption by institutions.<br></p><p>The industry has various challenges to solve to deliver a better product: transaction linkability, network privacy, and private key management are some. There have been commendable strides in these areas, such as the development of Layer-1 blockchains like <a href="https://z.cash/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zcash</a>, which offers private transactions, and smart contract solutions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Cash?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Tornado Cash</a>, which breaks the transaction link between deposit and withdrawal addresses on Ethereum. Due to their permissionless nature and approach, these systems are currently not designed for risk management. Notably, Tornado Cash “has also been used by various bad actors. Deposit data suggests that hacker groups have moved funds from illicit sources through the protocol.” (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Buterin et al.</a>, page 1). While Tornado Cash had its pitfalls, notably its usage by malicious actors (causing the protocol to get internationally sanctioned), the root cause of such vulnerabilities isn't necessarily technological but rather structural and was meant to be exploited.<br><br>At its core, the true sentiment we need to grapple with is this: compliance, while ensuring standardized behavior and safeguarding user interests, undeniably carries a cost – both financial and in terms of user accessibility. There's an exclusionary element to compliance, where stringent checks can sometimes inadvertently alienate non-malicious users. Furthermore, the absence of clear regulatory frameworks around decentralization and DAOs has ushered in shades of ambiguity. This uncertain environment is ripe for exploitation.</p><p>Historically, many actors in the space prioritized rapid growth over diligent compliance, often underestimating or even ignoring the long-term repercussions of such a strategy. Their motivations were straightforward – to reduce immediate costs and accelerate expansion. But such a strategy is inherently flawed. With today's well-informed user base demanding greater clarity and accountability, the repercussions of neglecting compliance have grown exponentially in magnitude. Simply put, compromising compliance for short-term gains threatens the longevity and credibility of any decentralized system.</p><p>It's essential to differentiate between ideologic and economic motives. While the decentralized movement was born from a <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">desire for autonomy and freedom from permissionless surveillance</a>, its sustained growth and mainstream adoption are undeniably tethered to economic incentives. In this case, ideology isn't the dominant force; it's the potential for economic upside. Similarly, while security concerns are paramount, they represent a distinct set of challenges, separate from those posed by compliance.</p><p>Thus, as we critique systems like Tornado Cash, it's imperative to understand that their vulnerabilities aren't just a result of technology but are deeply intertwined with larger strategic challenges and a blind eye toward solving compliant access.<br><br><a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a>, however, envisions a refined balance. Our goal is to augment data privacy on public blockchains while introducing a flexible approach to compliance, making it accessible to a diverse user base, from individuals to institutional giants.<br></p> Panther’s overall approach <p>Panther Protocol refines and extends the Shielded Pool concept and has developed advanced <a href="https://research.metastate.dev/multi-asset_shielded_pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Multi-Asset Shielded Pools</a> to include compliance features enabled by zero-knowledge proofs.</p>  Users can deposit into a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-shielded-pools-the-cornerstone-of-panther-protocol/">Multi-Asset Shielded Pool</a> (or simply Shielded Pool) only after <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">presenting a ZK proof of their verified status</a>, an action that's verifiable on-chain.  Transactional activities like deposits or withdrawals necessitate a ZK proof to vouch for the purity of the associated wallet address.  Upon providing the necessary proofs, users activate a zero-knowledge <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/panther-accounts?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Account</a> (or zAccount), which serves as a unique user identity record, tethering all their transactions.  Situations like regulatory scrutiny may necessitate users to reaffirm their credentials, leading to zAccount reactivation.  All interactions with the protocol are strictly based on zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring minimal data exposure on-chain.  With the zAccount system, all transactions from the same user are interconnected, and a ZK proof can be generated to showcase the volume or assets dealt with, offering a possible avenue for regulatory review.  <p>In a pioneering approach that seamlessly complements the decentralized structure we've discussed, Panther introduces an innovative method to manage compliance risks. At the heart of this strategy is the inclusion of a<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/"> compliance provider</a>, operating autonomously from the Protocol. This provider's principal role is to authenticate users, offering them a unique set of credentials after a series of verifications. These credentials then serve a dual purpose:</p><p>First, they enable users to craft zero-knowledge proofs directly within their browsers—a testament to the strategy's user-centric design. Second, in line with the modern digital identity landscape, these credentials can be seamlessly integrated with blockchain-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIDs </a>and similar platforms. Panther's vision extends even further. In a move that underscores flexibility and choice, users aren't bound to a single compliance provider. They can seek verification from any compliance provider of their choice. Once verified, users can then present these credentials as an irrefutable attestation to their authenticity, granting them unhindered access to the protocol. This strategic integration ensures multilevel compliance and amplifies user trust, forging a pathway to a more secure decentralized future.</p> <br>The responsibility of proof in a modern world <p>In a quest to strike the right balance between privacy and compliance in decentralized finance, Panther unveils a revolutionary approach that aspires to solve the same set of issues as presented in the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Privacy Pools paper</a> by thought leaders such as <a href="http://vitalik.ca/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Vitalik Buterin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ameen Soleimani</a>. As highlighted in their work, "Privacy Pools-like systems allow users to achieve more privacy around their financial transactions data while retaining the ability to prove their disassociation with known illicit activity. We expect that honest users will be incentivized to participate in such a scheme by a combination of two factors: (i) the desire for privacy, and (ii) the desire to avoid suspicion.” (p.8)</p><p>Central to the Privacy Pools model is a foundational idea: "Instead of merely zero-knowledge-proving that their withdrawal is linked to some previously-made deposit, a user proves membership in a more restrictive association set." (p.4) However, Panther diverges here, adopting a more tailored approach suited for real-world applicability. Panther operates on the positive constraint that all deposits emanate from verified users with authenticated wallets. This eradicates the need for additional proof during fund withdrawals.</p><p>Users can:</p>  Attest ownership of the originating Account for their deposits.  Showcase credentials affirming the withdrawal to an address in good standing, either owned by them or a validated Account holder within Panther.  When directing withdrawals <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">to other DeFi protocols</a> or centralized exchanges, they can offer proof of 'source of funds', which is verifiable by the receiving party.  <p>Another aspect highlighted in the Privacy Pools paper is the inventive adaptation of the Tornado cash UTXO model. However, one of the challenges presented is the maintenance of reliable and upright Associate Set Providers within a decentralised framework. These systems employ third-party entities known as ASPs to establish association sets. While the association data resides off-chain, its Merkle proof is recorded on-chain, ensuring ASPs maintain data integrity. ASPs might encompass compliance providers or even wallet screening oracle services.</p><p>The Privacy Pools paper underscores the necessity of expansive association sets to attain the desired privacy level and to lure good depositors, distancing them from malicious actors. Panther's answer to this is the creation of "<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zones</a>". Differently from the association sets of Privacy Pools, Zones are logical divisions within a Shielded Pool, each identified by a unique Zone-ID ingrained in every UTXO commitment. This allows for entities to create and tailor their own Zone, shaping membership criteria, selecting compliance providers, meeting regulatory demands, and even facilitating interactions with other Zone members. Notably, while these Zones provide tailored functionalities, they share the same anonymity set, as they all operate under the unified MASP architecture, reinforcing the strength and integrity of the system.</p><p>For instance, as a Zone Manager, an institution would have the capability to:</p>  Designate which Zones can transact their Zone and vice versa.  Choose a new compliance provider or integrate an existing one tailored for its Zone.  Define KYC renewal durations for Zone members.  Set transactional boundaries, including deposit, withdrawal, and internal transfer limits.  <p>The advent of "Zones" thus arms regulated entities and institutions with a formidable toolset, enabling them to seamlessly conduct privacy-preserving on-chain transactions and interact with protocols, welcoming a broader spectrum of participants into the world of DeFi. This agility comes out of Panther’s UTXO design and is instrumental in tapping into new opportunities and maximizing the potential of decentralized finance.<br></p> Panther Protocol &amp; the advanced UTXO model <p>Before the broader public became acquainted with the intricacies of the Privacy Pools paper, which mentions, "The simplified, privacy-preserving coin systems above only support coin transfers in the same denomination. Zcash supports arbitrary denominations through its use of a UTXO model," (p.6) Panther Protocol was already ahead of the curve. Panther crafted a pioneering system that not only facilitated transactions in diverse denominations, but also tackled real-world challenges to amplify on-chain transactional privacy. Additionally, Panther's advanced Shielded Pools are designed to support a wide range of assets, including:</p>  <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-20</a>: The standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum, allowing for a consistent interface across multiple token contracts.  <a href="https://ethereum.org/nl/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-721</a>: A standard for representing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be used to represent ownership over unique items or pieces of content.  <a href="https://ethereum.org/nl/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-1155</a>: A more generalized standard that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens, enabling the creation of multiple token types within a single contract.  <p>With these integrations, Panther Protocol not only serves as a privacy shield for traditional tokens, but also for the blossoming world of NFTs, showcasing its versatility and forward-thinking approach.</p><p>Let’s dig a little deeper into Panther User Accounts and how they enable Compliance:</p><p>1. User Account UTXOs ( or zAccounts): At the heart of Panther's approach lies the concept of the "User Account UTXO" — a distinctive type of UTXO nestled within the broader UTXO Merkle Tree. This can be imagined as a dynamic address book or user registry that can be activated based on several criteria, such as:</p>  Association with a social network account.  Linkage to an Ethereum address.  Ties to a user’s KYC records.  <p>2. Activation and Non-Interactive Transfers: Upon Account activation, the user account registry establishes a link between the public root spending key, public reading key, and a "public" Ethereum address associated with the user. This elegant arrangement enables non-interactive transfers within the Shielded Pool, eliminating the need for the sender to fetch the receiver’s pubkeys.</p><p>3. Accounts and their utility: The fields encapsulated within the zAccount UTXO pave the way for a myriad of functionalities. For instance:</p>  The "Nonce" serves as a transaction counter for user accounts, helping in linking and ordering transactions under the same Account.  Parameters such as "Order" and "Quantity" further enhance transactional clarity.  This feature might also be employed for disclosures to provide proof of completeness.  <p>4. Expiry Time &amp; Renewal Mechanisms: Recognizing the absence of a foolproof exclusion proof, Panther has instituted an "Expiry Time"mechanism, which mandates periodic renewals of user accounts. Potential renewal methodologies could range from:</p>  Aligning with KYC renewals.  Adopting a permissionless approach.  Re-verification of humanity.  Using a zk-proof to validate the total volume of transactions remaining under specified limits.  <p>Panther Protocol's nuanced use of the UTXO model paints a future where transactions are not only private but also flexibly aligned with the intricate demands of the world of DeFi.</p> <br>Navigating the DeFi space with Panther Protocol <p>Panther's architecture, with its foundational pillars of privacy, is crowned with a structure for on-chain compliance. Yet, one might wonder –what avenues are available to Panther users to leverage the augmented privacy derived from their Panther-based transactions?</p><p>This is precisely where Panther distinguishes itself from conventional privacy paradigms:</p><p>1. Seamless integration with premier DeFi protocols<br>Panther has engineered private adaptors in collaboration with eminent DeFi protocols such as <a href="https://uniswap.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap </a>and <a href="https://www.curve.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve</a>. This enables users to execute &nbsp;‘one-click’ swaps, instantly privatizing and verifying the transaction from a regulatory standpoint.</p><p>2. Diverse platform Adaptors<br>Our vision goes beyond mere swaps. We anticipate adaptors that <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zswap-and-defi-adaptors-unlocking-private-defi-usage/">bridge Panther with an eclectic range of platforms</a>, spanning from NFT marketplaces to lending hubs and beyond.</p><p>3. zTrade: Panther’s Dark Pool<br>Panther includes an innovative solution for confidential and compliant dark pool transactions. With <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ztrade-otc-trading?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zTrade</a>, users can preserve their trading strategies, mitigate counterparty risks, and effortlessly execute voluminous trades at pre-negotiated rates, all within the Shielded Pool.<br></p> Conclusion <p>In the ever-evolving world of decentralized technology, the quest for innovation remains perpetual. As the landscape gravitates towards establishing fully permissionless and decentralized privacy solutions, the challenge is ensuring these platforms don't inadvertently provide refuge to malicious actors. Panther recognizes this dilemma and has meticulously worked to strike a balance. By weaving in compliance features, we ensure a blend of unwavering privacy without compromising the ethos of decentralization.</p><p>An essential distinction to note is that while Panther's system might appear to have rules-based access on the surface, it operates within a decentralized framework. No centralized entity dictates or establishes the rules. Instead, the rules of compliance, tiers, and other requirements are orchestrated by the Panther DAO or by the institutional entities that will own and oversee the Zones. This approach signifies a pioneering stride in the blockchain world, merging decentralized ethos and structured compliance advantages.</p><p>Moreover, as government-issued identities gain traction in various developing nations and blockchain-based DIDs persist, the symbiosis with Panther becomes increasingly potent. We are confident that such integrations will pave the way for scalable, secure, and trustful access methods, aligning with the vision of a more inclusive and transparent decentralized world.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p><p><br><br></p>

      Generative AI’s Act Two         
	By Sonya Huang, Pat Grady, and GPT-4	 



Animation: James Buckhouse, Midjourney and Runway



Published September 20, 2023
        One year ago, we published a hypothesis that generative AI would become a profound platform shift in technology. Then came the firestorm.      



 
<p>Scientists, historians and economists have long studied the optimal conditions that create a Cambrian explosion of innovation. In generative AI, we have reached a modern marvel, our generation’s space race.</p>



<p>This moment has been decades in the making. Six decades of Moore’s Law have given us the compute horsepower to process exaflops of data. Four decades of the internet (accelerated by COVID) have given us trillions of tokens’ worth of training data. Two decades of mobile and cloud computing have given every human a supercomputer in the palm of our hands. In other words, decades of technological progress have accumulated to create the necessary conditions for generative AI to take flight.</p>



<p>ChatGPT’s rise was the spark that lit the fuse, unleashing a density and fervor of innovation that we have not seen in years—perhaps since the early days of the internet. The breathless excitement was especially visceral in “Cerebral Valley,” where AI researchers reached rockstar status and hacker houses were filled to the brim each weekend with new autonomous agents and companionship chatbots. AI researchers transformed from the proverbial “hacker in the garage” to special forces units commanding billions of dollars of compute. The arXiv printing press has become so prolific that researchers have jokingly called for a pause on new publications so they can catch up.</p>



<p>But quickly, AI excitement turned to borderline hysteria. Suddenly, every company was an “AI copilot.” Our inboxes got filled up with undifferentiated pitches for “AI Salesforce” and “AI Adobe” and “AI Instagram.” The $100M pre-product seed round returned. We found ourselves in an unsustainable feeding frenzy of fundraising, talent wars and GPU procurement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And sure enough, the cracks started to show. Artists and writers and singers challenged the legitimacy of machine-generated IP. Debates over ethics, regulation and looming superintelligence consumed Washington. And perhaps most worryingly, a whisper began to spread within Silicon Valley that generative AI was not actually useful. The products were falling far short of expectations, as evidenced by terrible user retention. End user demand began to plateau for many applications. Was this just another vaporware cycle?</p>



<p>The AI summer of discontent has sent critics gleefully grave dancing, reminiscent of the early days of the internet, where in 1998 one famous economist declared “By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”</p>



<p>Make no mistake—despite the noise and the hysteria and the air of uncertainty and discontent,&nbsp; generative AI has already had a more successful start than SaaS, with &gt;$1 billion in revenue from startups alone (it took the SaaS market years, not months, to reach the same scale). Some applications have become household names: ChatGPT became the fastest-growing application with particularly strong product-market fit among students and developers; Midjourney became our collective creative muse and was reported to have reached hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue with a team of just eleven; and Character popularized AI entertainment and companionship and created the consumer “social” application we craved the most—with users spending two hours on average in-app.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, these early signs of success don’t change the reality that a lot of AI companies simply do not have product-market fit or a sustainable competitive advantage, and that the overall ebullience of the AI ecosystem is unsustainable.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has settled for a bit, we thought it would be an opportune moment to zoom out and reflect on generative AI—where we find ourselves today, and where we’re possibly headed.&nbsp;</p>



 Towards Act Two 



<p>Generative AI’s first year out the gate—“Act 1”—came from the technology-out. We discovered a new “hammer”—foundation models—and unleashed a wave of novelty apps that were lightweight demonstrations of cool new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We now believe the market is entering “Act 2”—which will be from the customer-back. Act 2 will solve human problems end-to-end. These applications are different in nature than the first apps out of the gate. They tend to use foundation models as a piece of a more comprehensive solution rather than the entire solution. They introduce new editing interfaces, making the workflows stickier and the outputs better. They are often multi-modal.</p>



<p>The market is already beginning to transition from “Act 1” to “Act 2.” Examples of companies entering “Act 2” include <a href="http://harvey.ai">Harvey</a>, which is building custom LLMs for elite law firms; <a href="http://glean.com">Glean</a>, which is crawling and indexing our workspaces to make Generative AI more relevant at work; and <a href="http://character.ai">Character</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ava-your-digital-friend/id6446257579">Ava</a>, which are creating digital companions.&nbsp;</p>



 Market Map 



<p>Our updated generative AI market map is below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike last year’s map, we have chosen to organize this map by use case rather than by model modality. This reflects two important thrusts in the market: Generative AI’s evolution from technology hammer to actual use cases and value, and the increasingly multimodal nature of generative AI applications.</p>
 







 
<p>In addition, we have included a new LLM developer stack that reflects the compute and tooling vendors that companies are turning to as they build generative AI applications in production.</p>
 







 
 Revisiting Our Thesis 



<p>Our original <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">essay</a> laid out a thesis for the generative AI market opportunity and a hypothesis for how the market would unfold. How did we do?</p>



<p>Here’s what we got wrong:</p>



 
 Things happened quickly. Last year, we anticipated it would be nearly a decade before we had intern-level code generation, Hollywood-quality videos or human quality speech that didn’t sound mechanical. But a quick listen to Eleven Labs’ voices on TikTok or Runway’s AI film festival makes it clear that the future has arrived at warp speed. Even 3D models, gaming and music are becoming good, quickly.&nbsp; 



 The bottleneck is on the supply side. We did not anticipate the extent to which end user demand would outstrip GPU supply. The bottleneck to many companies’ growth quickly became not customer demand but access to the latest GPUs from Nvidia. Long wait times became the norm, and a simple business model emerged: pay a subscription fee to skip the line and access better models.&nbsp; 



 Vertical separation hasn’t happened yet. We still believe that there will be a separation between the “application layer” companies and foundation model providers, with model companies specializing in scale and research and application layer companies specializing in product and UI. In reality, that separation hasn’t cleanly happened yet. In fact, the most successful user-facing applications out of the gate have been vertically integrated. 



 Cutthroat competitive environment and swiftness of the incumbent response. Last year, there were a few overcrowded categories of the competitive landscape (notably image generation and copywriting), but by and large the market was whitespace. Today, many corners of the competitive landscape have more competition than opportunity. The swiftness of the incumbent response, from Google’s Duet and Bard to Adobe’s Firefly—and the willingness of incumbents to finally go “risk on”—has magnified the competitive heat. Even in the foundation model layer, we are seeing customers set up their infrastructure to be agnostic between different vendors.&nbsp; 



 The moats are in the customers, not the data. We predicted that the best generative AI companies could generate a sustainable competitive advantage through a data flywheel: more usage → more data → better model → more usage. While this is still somewhat true, especially in domains with very specialized and hard-to-get data, the “data moats” are on shaky ground: the data that application companies generate does not create an insurmountable moat, and the next generations of foundation models may very well obliterate any data moats that startups generate. Rather, workflows and user networks seem to be creating more durable sources of competitive advantage. 
 



<p>Here’s what we got right:</p>



 
 Generative AI is a thing. Suddenly, every developer was working on a generative AI application and every enterprise buyer was demanding it. The market even kept the “generative AI” moniker. Talent flowed into the market, as did venture capital dollars. Generative AI even became a pop culture phenomenon in viral videos like “Harry Potter Balenciaga” or the Drake imitation song “Heart on My Sleeve” by Ghostwriter which has become a chart-topping hit. 



 The first killer apps emerged. It’s been well documented that ChatGPT was the fastest application to reach 100M MAU—and it did so organically in just 6 weeks. By contrast, Instagram took 2.5 years, WhatsApp took 3.5 years, and YouTube and Facebook took 4 years to reach that level of user demand. But ChatGPT is not an isolated phenomenon. The depth of engagement of Character AI (2 hour average session time), the productivity benefits of Github Copilot (55% more efficient), and the monetization path of Midjourney (hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue) all suggest that the first cohort of killer apps has arrived. 



 Developers are the key. One of the core insights of developer-first companies like Stripe or Unity has been that developer access opens up use cases you could not even imagine. In the last several quarters, we have been pitched everything from music generation communities to AI matchmakers to AI customer support agents. 



 The form factor is evolving. The first versions of AI applications have largely been autocomplete and first drafts, but these form factors are now growing in complexity. Midjourney’s introduction of camera panning and infilling is a nice illustration of how the generative AI-first user experience has grown richer. Across the board, form factors are evolving from individual to system-level productivity and from human-in-the-loop to execution-oriented agentic systems. 



 Copyright and ethics and existential dread. The debate has roared on these hot-button topics. Artists and writers and musicians are split, with some creators rightfully outraged that others are profiting off derivative work, and some creators embracing the new AI reality (Grimes’ profit-sharing proposition and James Buckhouse’s optimism about becoming part of the <a href="https://buckhouse.medium.com/augmented-imagination-a3f4519f9784">creative genome</a> come to mind). No startup wants to be the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90942310/ai-napster-who-going-to-own-it-next">Napster or Limewire to the eventual Spotify</a> (h/t Jason Boehmig). The rules are opaque: Japan has declared that content used to train AI has no IP rights, while Europe has proposed heavy-handed regulation.&nbsp; 
 



 Where do we stand now? Generative AI’s Value Problem 



<p>Generative AI is not lacking in use cases or customer demand. Users crave AI that makes their jobs easier and their work products better, which is why they have flocked to applications in record-setting droves (in spite of a lack of natural distribution).&nbsp;</p>







<p>But do people stick around? Not really. The below chart compares the month 1 mobile app retention of AI-first applications to existing companies.&nbsp;</p>







<p>User engagement is also lackluster. Some of the best consumer companies have 60-65% DAU/MAU; WhatsApp’s is 85%. By contrast, generative AI apps have a median of 14% (with the notable exception of Character and the “AI companionship” category). This means that users are not finding enough value in Generative AI products to use them every day yet.</p>







<p>In short, generative AI’s biggest problem is not finding use cases or demand or distribution, it is proving value. As our colleague David Cahn writes, “the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/">$200B question</a> is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?” The path to building enduring businesses will require fixing the retention problem and generating deep enough value for customers that they stick and become daily active users.</p>



<p>Let’s not despair. Generative AI is still in its “awkward teenage years.” There are glimpses of brilliance, and when the products fall short of expectations the failures are often reliable, repeatable and fixable. Our work is cut out for us.&nbsp;</p>



 Act Two: A Shared Playbook 



<p>Founders are embarking on the hard work of prompt engineering, fine tuning and dataset curation to make their AI products *good*. Brick by brick, they are building flashy demos into whole product experiences. And meanwhile, the foundation model substrate continues to brim with research and innovation.</p>



<p>A shared playbook is developing as companies figure out the path to enduring value. We now have shared techniques to make models useful, as well as emerging UI paradigms that will shape generative AI’s second act.</p>



<p>The Model Development Stack</p>



 
 Emerging reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought and reflexion are improving models’ ability to perform richer, more complex reasoning tasks, closing the gap between customer expectations and model capabilities. Developers are using frameworks like <a href="http://langchain.com">Langchain</a> to invoke and debug more complex multi-chain sequences. 



 Transfer learning techniques like RLHF and fine-tuning are becoming more accessible, especially with the recent availability of fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 and Llama-2, which means that companies can adapt foundation models to their specific domains and improve from user feedback. Developers are downloading open-source models from <a href="http://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</a> and fine-tuning them to achieve <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/blog/fine-tuning-llms-lora-or-full-parameter-an-in-depth-analysis-with-llama-2">quality</a> performance. 



 Retrieval-augmented generation is bringing in context about the business or the user, reducing hallucinations and increasing truthfulness and usefulness. Vector databases from companies like <a href="http://pinecone.io">Pinecone</a> have become the infrastructure backbone for RAG. 



 New developer tools and application frameworks are giving companies reusable building blocks to create more advanced AI applications and helping developers evaluate, improve and monitor the performance of AI models in production, including LLMOps tools like <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">Langsmith</a> and <a href="http://wandb.ai">Weights &amp; Biases</a>&nbsp; 



 AI-first infrastructure companies like <a href="https://www.coreweave.com/">Coreweave</a>, <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/">Lambda Labs</a>, <a href="https://mlfoundry.com/">Foundry</a>, <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a> and <a href="https://modal.com/">Modal</a> are unbundling the public clouds and providing what AI companies need most: plentiful GPUs at a reasonable cost, available on-demand and highly scalable, with a nice PaaS developer experience. 
 



<p>Together, these techniques should close the expectations vs reality gap for models as the underlying foundation models simultaneously improve. But making the models great is only half the battle. The playbook for a generative AI-first user experience is evolving as well:</p>



<p>Emerging Product Blueprints</p>



 
 Generative interfaces. A text-based conversational user experience is the default interface on top of an LLM. Gradually, newer form factors are entering the arsenal, from Perplexity’s <a href="https://twitter.com/alexgraveley/status/1659276299091812353">generative user interfaces</a> to new modalities like human-sounding voices from Inflection AI.&nbsp; 



 New editing experiences: from Copilot to Director’s Mode. As we advance from zero-shot to <a href="https://thezbook.com/ask-adjust-the-future-of-productivity-interfaces">ask-and-adjust</a> (h/t Zach Lloyd), generative AI companies are inventing a new set of knobs and switches that look very different from traditional editing workflows. Midjourney’s new panning commands and Runway’s Director’s Mode create new camera-like editing experiences. Eleven Labs is making it possible to manipulate voices through prompting. 



 Increasingly sophisticated agentic systems. Generative AI applications are increasingly not just autocomplete or first drafts for human review; they now have the autonomy to problem-solve, access external tools and solve problems end-to-end on our behalf. We are steadily progressing from level 0 to level 5 autonomy.&nbsp; 



 System-wide optimization. Rather than embed in a single human user’s workflow and make that individual more efficient, some companies are directly tackling the system-wide optimization problem. Can you pick off a chunk of support tickets or pull requests and autonomously solve them, thereby making the whole system more effective? 
 



 Parting Thoughts 



<p>As we approach the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-paradox-perspective/">frontier paradox</a> and as the novelty of transformers and diffusion models dies down, the nature of the generative AI market is evolving. Hype and flash are giving way to real value and whole product experiences.</p>



<p>At Sequoia we remain steadfast believers in generative AI. The necessary conditions for this market to take flight have accumulated over the span of decades, and the market is finally here. The emergence of killer applications and the sheer magnitude of end user demand has deepened our conviction in the market.</p>



<p>However, Amara’s Law—the phenomenon that we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run—is running its course. We are applying patience and judgment in our investment decisions, with careful attention to how founders are solving the value problem. The shared playbook companies are using to push the boundaries on model performance and product experiences gives us optimism on generative AI’s second act.</p>



<p><br>If you are building in the AI market with an eye towards value and whole product experiences, we would love to hear from you.

  AI’s $200B Question  <p>GPU capacity is getting overbuilt. Long-term, this is good. Short-term, things could get messy.</p>   
	By David Cahn	 



Published September 20, 2023
  



 
<p>The Generative AI wave, which began last summer, has gone into hyperspeed. The catalyst for this double acceleration was Nvidia’s Q2 earnings guide and subsequent beat. This signaled to the market an insatiable level of demand for GPUs and AI model training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Nvidia’s announcement, consumer launches like ChatGPT, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion had raised AI into the public consciousness. With Nvidia’s results, founders and investors were delivered empirical evidence that AI can generate billions of dollars of net new revenue. This has shifted the category into its highest gear yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While investors have extrapolated much from Nvidia’s results—and AI investments are now happening at a torrid pace and at record valuations—a big open question remains: What are all these GPUs being used for? Who is the customer’s customer? How much value needs to be generated for this rapid rate of investment to pay off?</p>



<p>Consider the following: For every $1 spent on a GPU, roughly $1 needs to be spent on energy costs to run the GPU in a data center. So if Nvidia sells $50B in run-rate GPU revenue by the end of the year (a conservative estimate based on analyst forecasts), that implies approximately $100B in data center expenditures. The end user of the GPU—for example, Starbucks, X, Tesla, Github Copilot or a new startup—needs to earn a margin too. Let’s assume they need to earn a 50% margin. This implies that for each year of current GPU CapEx, $200B of lifetime revenue would need to be generated by these GPUs to pay back the upfront capital investment. This does not include any margin for the cloud vendors—for them to earn a positive return, the total revenue requirement would be even higher.</p>







<p>Based on public filings, much of the incremental data center build-out is coming from big tech companies: Google, Microsoft and Meta, for example, have reported increased data center CapEx. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9dfee156-4870-4ca4-b67d-bb5a285d855c">Reports</a> indicate that Bytedance, Tencent and Alibaba are big Nvidia customers as well. On a go-forward basis, companies like Amazon, Oracle, Apple, Tesla and Coreweave should also be important contributors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The important question to be asking is: How much of this CapEx build out is linked to true end-customer demand, and how much of it is being built in anticipation of future end-customer demand? This is the $200B question.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-passes-1-billion-revenue-pace-as-big-companies-boost-ai-spending?rc=0uxjjk">The Information</a> has reported that OpenAI is generating $1B in annual revenue. Microsoft has said it expects to generate $10B in AI revenue from products like Microsoft Copilot. Let’s assume Google will generate a similar amount of revenue from its AI products, such as Duet and Bard. Let’s also assume Meta and Apple each generate $10B in revenues from AI. Let’s use a $5B placeholder for Oracle, Bytedance, Alibaba, Tencent, X and Tesla. These are all dummy assumptions—the point is that even if you assume extremely generous gains from AI, there’s a $125B+ hole that needs to be filled for each year of CapEx at today’s levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a large opportunity for the startup ecosystem to fill this hole. Our goal is to “follow the GPUs” and find the next generation of startups that leverage AI technology to create real end-customer value. We want to invest in these companies.</p>



<p>The goal of this analysis is to highlight the gap that we see today. AI hype has finally caught up to the deep learning technology breakthroughs in development since 2017. This is good news. A major CapEx buildout is happening. This should bring AI development costs down dramatically over the long-term. You used to have to buy a server rack to build any application. Now you can use the public clouds at a much lower cost. Likewise, today many AI companies are using a large portion of their venture capital on GPUs. As today’s supply constraints give way to a supply glut, the cost of running AI workloads will come down. This should spur more product development. It should also attract more founders to build in this space.</p>



<p>During historical technology cycles, overbuilding of infrastructure has often incinerated capital, while at the same time unleashing future innovation by bringing down the marginal cost of new product development. We expect this pattern will repeat itself in AI.</p>



<p>For startups, the takeaway is clear: As a community, we need to shift our thinking away from infrastructure and towards end-customer value. Happy customers are a fundamental requirement of every great business. For AI to have an impact, we need to figure out how to leverage this new technology to make people’s lives better. How can we translate these amazing innovations into products that customers use every day, love and are willing to pay for?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AI infrastructure build out is happening. Infrastructure is not the problem anymore. Many foundation models are being developed—this is not the problem anymore, either. And the tooling in AI is pretty good today. So the $200B question is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?&nbsp;</p>

You may encounter bugs or&nbsp;hiccups.</p><p>No fret.</p><p>For support related to the Aztec Sandbox, join our <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse forum</a>, where you can get hands-on support from Aztec Labs’ developer relation teams and build alongside the Aztec developer community.</p><blockquote>🗣 Join the conversation on Aztec Labs’ <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse</a></blockquote> Get Started in&nbsp;Minutes <p>The Aztec Sandbox provides a local development system for building and testing Aztec smart contracts in a fast, safe, and free environment.</p><p>The process of downloading the Sandbox, installing client libraries, and using it to deploy and use a fully private token contract on a local Aztec node takes less than 10&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>First, navigate to <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a></p><p>Or curl the&nbsp;site:</p><p>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL 'https://sandbox.aztec.network')"</p><p>A package will then download and execute, spinning up two Docker containers:</p>  Anvil  Aztec Sandbox  <p>The Sandbox will create servers on localhost ports 8545 (Anvil) and 8080 (Sandbox); ensure those ports are free to prevent any conflicts.</p><p>Within a few seconds the Sandbox should be up and&nbsp;running!</p> What can you do with&nbsp;it <p>The Sandbox is the starting point for Aztec smart contract and application developers. The Sandbox helps future-looking developers get a head-start interacting with ZK-native blockchain environments.</p><p>And as pioneers in smart contract privacy, developers will need to add a few useful heuristics to their public-blockchain mental models. Some new concepts&nbsp;include:</p>  Private state management  Account abstraction models  Understanding patterns to keep private information private  Transaction paths which span both private and public function execution  Organizing contracts into privately executable logic and publicly executable logic  <blockquote>For more about UTXO abstraction and how Aztec makes it convenient to manage manipulating private state, read our blog post <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/privacy-abstraction-with-aztec/">here</a>. For more information relating to privacy preservation best practices, see <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/privacy/main">here</a>. And for more about transaction architecture, see&nbsp;<a href="https://aztec.network/blog/aztecs-transaction-anatomy/">here</a>.</blockquote><p>Using Aztec.js, developers can build full-fledged applications that let&nbsp;users:</p>  write, deploy and test private smart contracts  create accounts (choosing one of various account abstraction schemes!)  manage their&nbsp;wallets  send transactions to the network and track their&nbsp;progress  query current chain state such as chain ID, block number,&nbsp;etc.  <p>Learn more about how to write an Aztec smart contract along with ready-made examples and walkthrough guides&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/contracts/main">here</a>.</p> Use-cases we’re excited to&nbsp;see <p>Aztec’s <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts">smart contract examples</a> include a broad swath of use&nbsp;cases</p>  Public and private token contracts  Private DeFi  Oracle price&nbsp;feeds  Air-drop contracts  Two-party private&nbsp;escrow  Account contracts that can privately validate account credentials  <p>We’re excited to see other application primitives including private identity, fully on-chain private games, and decentralized finance protocols offering privacy by&nbsp;default.</p><p>We can’t wait to see the explosion of higher-order privacy mechanisms that will be created by remixing and composing these basic primitives into complex smart contracts and full-fledged privacy-first applications.</p> What you can’t do&nbsp;(yet) <p>The Aztec Sandbox is our minimum viable local developer testnet. While developers can begin writing smart contracts, there is no shared in-production network.</p><p>While account creation, wallet management, smart contract creation, and transaction execution are all live, fee estimation, transaction sequencing, proving, and advanced key and address functionality will be released in future iterations of the&nbsp;Sandbox.</p><blockquote>🎻 For a full current list of limitations see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/limitations/main">here</a>.</blockquote><p>You can learn how to write and test Aztec smart contracts. You just can’t deploy production applications-yet.</p> What is Noir’s relationship to all&nbsp;this? <p>Aztec Labs first developed Noir as a standalone, open-source, universal language for zero-knowledge programming. Noir is designed to be compatible across proving systems while also being verifiable to any chain, not just&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>​​It’s no surprise then, that we’ve chosen Noir as a basis for writing smart contracts on Aztec. Using Noir, we’ve written a collection of functions, types, methods, state variables, annotations, etc. which together provide a rich, syntactically pleasing framework, to aid developers in writing intuitive and legible private smart contracts.</p><p>Imaginatively, we called this framework <a href="http://aztec.nr/">Aztec.nr</a>.</p><p>Aztec applications written with the <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Aztec.nr</a> framework have the advantage of features and tools developers might expect to be packaged with any smart contract framework:</p>  Contracts (including callable contract functions and inter-contract function&nbsp;calls)  Persistent state variables  Contract address semantics  Access to msg.sender and other call context information  Access to transaction context information  Access to historic blockchain data  Events (logs) (both encrypted and unencrypted)  Cryptographic primitives  Cross-chain (L1 -&gt; L2 and L2 -&gt; L1) message&nbsp;passing  <p><a href="http://noir-lang.org/">Noir</a> is an open-source language with universal applicability to zero knowledge use-cases. In fact, our hope is Noir’s extensibility allows it to be used even in non-blockchain / web2 applications!</p><p>But with Aztec.nr, Noir now fits hand-in-glove with Aztec. Noir developers now have access to the best privacy infrastructure for their applications.</p><p>Noir developers: it’s time to come&nbsp;home.</p><blockquote>🏃 Get started now at <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a>.</blockquote> Front-run the&nbsp;future <p>Joining now as a Sandbox developer represents a significant opportunity to gain early access and bend the blockchain universe toward more privacy, not&nbsp;less.</p><p>At Aztec Labs we’ve worked tirelessly to make zero knowledge cryptography accessible to non-cryptographers. The Aztec Sandbox now delivers that promise in a developer-friendly package.</p><p>We’re excited by the opportunity represented by this release to begin democratizing access to fully decentralized privacy-enabled applications.</p><p>We hope you are&nbsp;too.</p> Get started <p>The fastest way to get going with the Aztec Sandbox is our starter page at <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a>, which allows you to download the Sandbox, deploy an example private token contract, and do basic interactions with the contract to transfer tokens between private addresses via the Aztec&nbsp;CLI.</p> Additional resources:   <a href="http://docs.aztec.network/">Documentation</a>  <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse</a>  <p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy/">https://aztec.network</a> on September 20,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy-f7f883ae352d">Announcing the Aztec Sandbox: The Endgame For Smart Contract Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

This information can be used to target, dox or censor users and validators.</p><p>While the binary in the following tutorial is built for Cosmos, in theory, the principles should work on enabling pattern protection for any blockchain with the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p> Chains leak&nbsp;metadata <p>The purpose of <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/intro.html">the tutorial</a> is not to build production-grade code, but to familiarise developers with connecting Nym to the Cosmos blockchain.</p><p>Interoperability is crucial for the future of Web3. If ecosystems remain siloed they will become deserted islands. From the start, Cosmos has sought to resolve dependence on L1 blockchains by enabling an ‘internet of blockchains’ with the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) and CosmWasm smart contracts, allowing projects to interact with one another but retain their own distinct character and utility — like a sprawling archipelago of islands, all connected.</p><p>But the design of Cosmos means that all of the network traffic on and between chains — the boats connecting these islands, so to speak — is visible, and therefore vulnerable to attacks, surveillance, and censorship.</p><p>This is not only a problem with dApps, decentralised projects and blockchains of Web3, but with the internet as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>However, what makes decentralised infrastructure particularly vulnerable is the sheer amount of traffic that has to move across open networks in interchain and peer-to-peer broadcasts.</p><p>It is these patterns of ‘metadata’ traffic that are analysed by criminals, governments, big tech, and shady data broker businesses. And it is precisely these patterns that the Nym mixnet protects.</p> Build with the Nym Rust SDK on&nbsp;Cosmos <p>The <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/intro.html">first part of this tutorial</a> teaches users how to take a first step towards building a service which can interact with a Cosmos SDK blockchain via Nym, thus securing the network&nbsp;layer.</p><p>Think of the service you’ll build as a kind of proxy: it interacts with the blockchain on the client’s behalf, shielding the client from the validator that it interacts with. At the same time, the service is also shielded from the client by the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. Imagine you want to make a transaction. Generally speaking this would&nbsp;entail:</p>  Querying the blockchain for relevant information to construct the transaction;  receiving that back from the blockchain;  then constructing and signing the transaction and sending this to the blockchain;  and receiving a transaction hash back as confirmation.  <p>Using this tutorial, the queries and transactions will be sent from your client via the mixnet and a proxy service rather than directly from you, protecting your patterns of queries and transactions from the blockchain as well as any network observers.</p><p>Conversely, the validator would send information and transaction hashes back via the proxy service, which would send this through the mixnet (using something called <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/traffic-flow.html#private-replies-using-surbs">SURBS</a>) before it reaches your&nbsp;client.</p><p>NOTE: if you are a wallet developer and your wallet runs SOCKS5, SOCKS4a, or SOCKS4, check out using the socks client via the SDK instead of the websocket client. There is an example of how you’d connect&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/sdk/rust.html#socks-client-example">here</a>.</p><p>The tutorial covers writing two pieces of code in&nbsp;Rust.</p><p>The first piece of code is a client-side binary for constructing a blockchain query, which sends this to the Cosmos SDK blockchain before passing the response back to the client. The example in this tutorial is to query the balance of an&nbsp;account.</p><p>The second piece of code listens out for requests from the mixnet, acts on those requests, and anonymously replies to the client sending those requests.</p><p>The tutorial is in five&nbsp;parts:</p>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/preparing-env.html">Prepare your environment</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/lib.html">Prepare your&nbsp;library</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/client.html">Prepare your&nbsp;client</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/service.html">Prepare your&nbsp;service</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/querying.html">Querying the&nbsp;chain</a>  <p>By the end of the tutorial, you’ll have learned how to integrate the Nym mixnet for traffic transport — allowing you to build privacy-preserving apps for real-world use cases much more&nbsp;simply.</p> Most blockchains are not private — yet <p>Most blockchains are not designed with privacy in mind. They are designed to be immutable public ledgers that record transactions and remain unchanged and unalterable.</p><p>The Nym Rust SDK introduces pattern protection for Cosmos traffic. But it does not provide privacy once information is stored on a given blockchain itself.</p><p>Now, if you are simply querying a blockchain, the mixnet will effectively protect those queries. But if you want to write to a blockchain, the mixnet only protects transactions in transit. This means you will need a privacy L1 (such as Anoma or Penumbra) if you want to ensure on-chain&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The Nym Rust SDK is general purpose and can communicate with any blockchain — including those designed with privacy in mind. So integrate Nym for network layer privacy and choose your stack carefully!</p><p>The Nym mixnet is a general purpose, advanced privacy system for the whole internet, whether Web 2.0 or Web3, or a dApp, L1, or L2 blockchain. This tutorial shows that privacy primitives are becoming increasingly usable to build with privacy as the&nbsp;default.</p><p>Developers!

<p>In August 2023, Brave released <a>Leo—Brave’s native AI assistant</a>—on its <a>Nightly channel</a>. Since then we’ve incorporated a lot of user feedback, and made numerous improvements to the feature. There are more changes on the way, and soon we will launch Leo on our full release channel, making it available to our 60 million users.</p>
<p>We thought now would be a great time to share more about how Brave is thinking about Leo, and the future AI integrations within the browser.</p>

 Background: Brave as a user agent 
<p>Brave has always been a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent">user agent</a>. A user agent is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_%28computing%29">client</a> application that gives users better control of the content they access on the Internet, without conflicts of interest between server operators – including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_tracking">third parties</a> – and the user. Leo takes this concept one step further, moving beyond the limited stance of browsing content in the way the author or creator intended. With Leo, you’re not passively consuming web pages and videos, rather you’re actively exploring content: asking tangential questions, seeking clarifications, exploring diverse viewpoints, and overall tailoring the Web to your preferences.</p>
<p>Leo “understands” the current page you’re visiting—it’s the next best thing to talking directly with the author. In fact, in many ways it’s better, as Leo can independently analyze and reason about pages, free of the author’s or creator’s biases.</p>
<p>To be clear, Brave isn’t trying to create the world’s leading Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch. Instead, our goal is to link users with top LLMs and harness them in innovative and where feasible, privacy preserving ways. Our goal is to open novel, convenient, and private use cases that are often possible only in the context of a particular user’s browsing session.</p>
<p>As with all Brave products, Leo adheres to Brave’s core values and is built with privacy by design. User inputs are always submitted anonymously through a reverse-proxy to our inference infrastructure, giving users an AI experience with unparalleled privacy. Also, conversations are discarded immediately after the reply is generated and are not persisted on Brave’s servers. As we expand Leo’s development, we will continue to integrate privacy into its features and to innovate with new approaches to give our users the privacy they expect.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 General release channel availability: cost and viability&nbsp; 
<p>The first step to opening <a>this amazing feature</a> to our general release channel is to make sure the cost is viable for Brave to offer to its full user base. With more than 60 million users worldwide, the cost of running Leo as-is on our general release channel would be prohibitive without a paid option. For this reason, we’ll soon be offering a premium version of Leo. Alongside the free version of this feature, the premium version will cover the costs of hosting our premium models, and for paying the API access for other premium model choices.</p>
<p>This next update to Leo will include:</p>
 
 A seamless onboarding experience for the premium upgrade, including the ability to pay for premium access with BAT. 
 The ability to select different models directly in the main Leo interface. 
 The addition of integration points from other parts of the browser into Leo. 
 Access to better models such as Llama 2 70B, and Claude Instant (by Anthropic). 
 
<p>Here’s a table that summarizes the free / premium options:</p>

<p>We’re targeting mid to late Q4 for the Leo release.</p>

 Mobile parity 
<p>Mobile parity will most likely follow shortly after the desktop release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of the mobile release will be to make sure everything from the desktop release works on Android and iOS.</p>

 Roadmap 
<p>Major enhancements and features for Leo are described and grouped into categories below. Some of these features will be available with the first release, and others will roll out during each of our browser updates.</p>

 Local persistence of conversations, and full-page interactions 
 
 Ability to store and reference past conversations locally on your device, and continue these conversations at a later date. 
 Ability to sync these conversations across devices using Brave Sync. 
 Full-page interactive UI via a URL like brave://chat (or brave://leo). 
 

 Better answers 
 
 Provide Brave Search results to the model for up-to-date information. 
 Provide <a href="https://community.brave.com/">Brave Q&amp;A</a> and <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us">Brave Support</a> to the model for user questions. 
 Provide Brave News results to the model for help answering user questions. 
 Provide cryptocurrency context to the model for help answering Web3-related questions. 
 Provide a generalized extension framework, or adopt an existing form of extensions such as ChatGPT plugins. 
 

 Richer output 
 
 Image generation as part of Leo’s possible outputs. 
 Ability to highlight text within a page that’s currently being viewed to support Leo’s claims. 
 Ability for Leo to take actions on a user’s behalf (for example, for Leo to start a Web search, change the current page to dark mode, or change a browser setting). 
 Entity highlighting of response text to link to Brave Search (for example, if an output talked about Brave, it may highlight Brave and make it a Brave Search query). 
 

 Model expansions 
 
 Continually add access to the latest-and-greatest models. 
 Expand commercial relationships to offer more model choices for premium users. 
 Larger context sizes. 
 

 Better language support 
<p>Today, if Leo is prompted in another language, it can already answer in that language (such as French and Spanish). However, not all languages are covered, and a page’s context, when used, will likely determine the response language. We’d like to add better handling for languages, and overall to expand the number of languages, and the quality of the output of those languages, by adding better international models.</p>

 Chat interface and customization 
 
 At the time of writing, context for Leo interactions can derive either from the entire page, or it can work with no context at all. In the future, we’d like to make this better via context menus, allowing users to select a specific part of a page to supply the model its interaction context. 
 We’d like to offer access to Leo via omnibox (address bar) suggestions, a new tab card, and more. 
 A CodeLlama integration into developer tools and in the sidebar, with optional injection into the current page context. 
 

 Model personalization and personification 
 
 Customize Leo’s tone and summary styles for personalized interactions. 
 User-defined boundaries, mood, and context awareness. 
 

 Content consumption 
 
 PDF summarization: the ability to interface with not only web pages and videos, but also with PDF documents. 
 Using accessibility and other information available to help models understand web pages better. 
 Image understanding via drag and drop. 
 

 Writing tools 
 
 Tools for filling in editable fields on web pages (such as formatting and generating text). 
 Grammar, spelling, and other suggestions. 
 Content suggestions, and content auto-completion. 
 

 Local model support 
 
 We’d like to offer locally running models, and even allow users to configure their own models. Doing so would open more possibilities for assisting users with their local, private Brave data (for example, making a better suggestion bar or autocomplete suggestions). 
 

 Brave Ads &amp; Brave Rewards integration 
 
 We may offer a privacy-preserving ad-supported option for those users who don’t want to buy a premium subscription, but still want premium features. 
 Thinking beyond display ads, we’d like the model to help users make purchasing decisions, via context such as detailed product information; this could entail an ad catalog and all knowledge about the products behind those ads, but not advertise or give you phony or biased information (for example, if you were trying to buy a TV, Leo could tell you it knows of a less expensive TV, or one that offers features not available in the TV you’re currently asking about). 
 We’d like to investigate how to tie this recommendation engine to Brave Rewards. 
 In these shopping scenarios, the model would always genuinely act first as the user’s agent. For instance, it might respond that a TV you were viewing had a better price elsewhere than in an online ad you may have seen. 
 
<p>With Leo by their side, users can interact with the Web in groundbreaking new ways. The future of Leo outlined in this roadmap is exciting to us. Unlike other AI assistants, Leo is not a simple chat interface. Leo is a companion for helping you make sense of the Web as you browse, while preserving your privacy and helping you stay in charge of your experience.</p>

<p>A look into Aztec’s transaction architecture</p><p>We’ve all heard that “privacy UX sucks.” We tend to&nbsp;agree.</p><p>Users want to drive a car, not change the oil. We previously discussed how we abstract Aztec’s underlying UTXO architecture with Noir Lang and Aztec.nr, Aztec’s smart contract framework.</p><p>Today we’ll cover how we improve transaction processing via account abstraction and composable public-private design.</p><p>To date, protocols focusing on user privacy have exposed the underlying privacy architecture. And it turns out that users don’t like dealing with the nuts and bolts inside the&nbsp;machine.</p><p>We think user-friendly abstractions represent the future of intuitive UX in blockchains–a necessary step to bringing crypto to parity with web2. We’ll define transaction paths, explain what they mean, and explore how they future-proof the Aztec experience for developers and&nbsp;users.</p> Ethereum Accounts, A&nbsp;Primer <p>In Ethereum, every account is controlled by a private key, commonly derived from a mnemonic. If you’ve ever created an Ethereum wallet, you’ve seen the list of words you need to engrave, memorize, or at minimum jot down to secure your&nbsp;account.</p><p>Note that we’re talking about Ethereum externally-owned accounts here (EOA’s), not contract accounts, since on Ethereum, EOA’s are the only accounts that can initiate transactions.</p><p>When you initiate a transaction on Ethereum, the network expects a signature from the private key that controls the account. If you create a signature that matches the public key associated with the transaction, the transaction is submitted with a transaction payload that instructs the Ethereum Virtual Machine on exactly what functions to&nbsp;execute.</p> Account Abstraction, aka “Seed Phrases Ain’t It,&nbsp;Chief” <p>At Aztec Labs we’ve been thinking hard about forms of account authentication beyond signatures. The use of seed phrases has significant issues:</p>  No recovery: if you lose your phrase you may lose access to your account&nbsp;forever  Confusing hygiene: you should never, ever, ever copy your phrase to your computer’s clipboard using the copy and paste&nbsp;feature  Single point of failure: anyone who has your key has full access to your&nbsp;account  <blockquote>📕 Read this post by <a href="https://twitter.com/smpalladino">Santiago Palladino</a> for more about the account abstraction designs being developed for Aztec on our <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/ideas-on-account-abstraction/339">Discourse forum</a></blockquote><p>So how do we get around seed phrases and private keys as the sole forms of account validation? Seed phrases are just one very secure but very flawed form of account validation. There are myriad methods of account validation, spanning the spectrum from very secure to totally insecure, from intuitive to confusing, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Key sharding  Plaintext passwords  TouchID and other biometric signature schemes  <p>Keep in mind account validation can be as secure as you want it to be. One simple account validation scheme would be: “If you click the ‘yes’ button the account is validated.” It wouldn’t be secure AT ALL, but you could do&nbsp;it!</p><p>Account abstraction is confusing as a term, since it encompasses “everything but seed phrases,” but the holy grail of authentication would include three&nbsp;factors:</p>  Something you know (like a password)  Something you have (like a hardware wallet or Yubi&nbsp;Key)  Something you are (like biometrics or a decentralized proof of identity&nbsp;scheme)  <p>Aztec allows for combining all&nbsp;three.</p><p>But Aztec’s improvements to Ethereum go beyond the implementation of alternate authentication schemes.</p><p>Aztec’s transaction anatomy is also a bit different — users send proofs of computation rather than signing transactions from an&nbsp;EOA.</p><p>Here is the flow diagram for an Aztec transaction:</p>  User connects wallet to&nbsp;app  User expresses transaction intent  App supplies transaction info to&nbsp;wallet  Wallet executes&nbsp;function  Prove account interaction  Prove function  Wallet generates kernel&nbsp;proof  App receives kernel&nbsp;proof  Wallet broadcasts transaction to&nbsp;network  Aztec node includes transaction in rollup&nbsp;block  Ethereum finalizes L1&nbsp;block  <p>We’ll talk through each in&nbsp;turn.</p> Anatomy of a private Aztec transaction <p>Before we carve the patient open and look at its guts, know that there are two transaction paths within Aztec: private transactions and public transactions, each with their own attributes.</p><p>At the center of these transactions is something called the kernel circuit. The kernel circuit is the beating heart of the Aztec system, and validates private transactions. We’ll get back to it in a&nbsp;second.</p><p>For now let’s talk about what a blockchain transaction in general&nbsp;is:</p>  Authorization: typically a signature, but as we’ll see can be many&nbsp;things  Intent: typically a transaction payload that includes instructions such as FROM, RECIPIENT, SIGNATURE, and fee information  <p>We already discussed how Aztec allows for new forms of authorization, but how does it process transactions?</p><p>Aztec is a completely new execution environment beyond the EVM, and uses client-based zero knowledge proofs to prove individual transactions. That means the application developer’s job is to constrain functions appropriately and prove user&nbsp;intent.</p><p>Application developers can constrain user intents by writing smart contracts using Aztec.nr. In the private transfer example, the circuits behind the smart contract are checking a few conditions:</p>  Does the user own &gt;10&nbsp;DAI?  If so, destroy 10 DAI of their notes by creating nullifiers against&nbsp;them  Create a new 10 DAI note for the transfer recipient  Broadcast and encrypt the message containing the 10 DAI&nbsp;note  <p>The nullifier, new note, an encrypted log are all made public, but kept encrypted, such that the public information tells you nothing about what happened. Roughly all an observer can see is “a transaction happened here but I’m not sure&nbsp;what.”</p><p>That’s the core of Aztec’s value proposition — we know with mathematical certainty transactions are happening that follow blockchain rules, but we can’t derive any information about those transactions.</p><blockquote>📕 See our <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/privacy-abstraction-with-aztec-def9da73eb5">previous piece</a> on how Aztec’s privacy abstraction works</blockquote> Public Transactions <p>The path for public transactions is slightly different, as Aztec relies on the familiar Ethereum account-based model for public transactions.</p><p>The key to Aztec’s public transactions are unconstrained functions–Aztec’s public VM bytecode. Unconstrained functions just do “normal code stuff.” And by “normal code stuff” we mean simply execution code rather than proving execution as in Aztec’s private execution path. Unconstrained functions don’t lay down constraints. They just executes&nbsp;code.</p><p>If Aztec is a world computer, then unconstrained functions are the instructions the computer understands. Just like the EVM executes Solidity, the Aztec VM executes Aztec bytecode.</p><p>One key difference between the private and public execution paths is when code gets executed. In the private transaction example, code must be executed and proven locally–that is, before proof of the transaction is sent to Aztec’s network of&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>In the public execution path, the wallet has to receive authorization, but doesn’t process the transaction, instead sending transaction details onward to an Aztec node which then creates a proof of execution and inserts the proof into a&nbsp;block.</p><p>Because privacy is no longer a concern with public transactions, they can be sent unencrypted to the node to do efficient batch processing, rather than relying on a user’s local&nbsp;device.</p> Conclusion <p>Privacy UX sucks. Zero knowledge is complicated. Our goal is two-fold:</p>  Simplify DevEx with tools like <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-aztec-nr-aztecs-private-smart-contract-framework-54d716710407">Aztec.nr </a>— a smart contract framework that makes it intuitive to reason about private state management  Simplify UX with abstractions that help users access the blockchain with better tools than EOA signature validation  <p>Great privacy-first applications will be built on the backs of best-in-class tooling that makes it easy to build powerful software that makes preserving privacy smooth and intuitive for&nbsp;users.</p><p>That means more code, less cryptography.</p> Keep in&nbsp;touch <p>To learn more about Aztec generally, keep up to date on our <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse</a>, where we discuss major protocol decisions like <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-upgrade-mechanisms/605">upgrade mechanisms</a> and <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-decentralized-sequencer-selection/350">decentralizing sequencers</a>.</p><p>For more technical news on Aztec and Noir, join our e-mail newsletter:</p><blockquote><a href="https://embeds.beehiiv.com/83354329-29bf-48be-ba17-a99d72424ace">📬 Subscribe here to the Aztec Labs Developer Dispatch, the latest news and releases about Aztec and&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote> Join our&nbsp;team <p>Aztec Labs is on the lookout for talented engineers, cryptographers, and business people to accelerate our vision of encrypted Ethereum.</p><blockquote>👪 If joining our mission to bring scalable privacy to Ethereum excites you, <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec">check out our open&nbsp;roles</a>.</blockquote><p>And continue the conversation with us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork">Twitter</a>.</p> Acknowledgements <p>Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/Blulinski">Bruno Lulinsky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Maddiaa0">Maddiaa</a> for input on this&nbsp;piece.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-transaction-anatomy-53ad2d9bc35e">Aztec Transaction Anatomy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Summary:&nbsp;Reflections on advancing digital asset regulation in 2023. How can we eliminate roadblocks and engender robust and transparent markets?</p>



<p>Like so many of us who have busy lives and demanding careers, we preciously guard our time for private life and relaxation. For me, having an overabundance of free time between jobs was daunting in its own way. I am sure that many of you, in a period of calm, also tend to want to take stock of your life, read books, clean out your closets, listen to podcasts, and do all the “things” there normally isn’t time for, while paradoxically filling the time we wish to have more of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually I found a balance where I enjoyed the calm and time for positive self-reflection through lots of running and reading. Like many of you, I could not escape thinking about my profession, which frankly, I love. I contemplated how we can build on the solid work already undertaken this year in the nascent regulation of digital assets, through further collaboration and analysis, while eliminating barriers and roadblocks that aren’t helping to engender robust, fair, liquid, open and transparent markets.</p>



<p>Improve&nbsp;</p>



<p><a></a><a>&nbsp;</a>“To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.” -Winston Churchill</p>



<p>In discussing digital assets and the events of the past year, the saying, “don’t throw out the baby with the bath water”, is often used to emphasise the importance of not discarding the positives that DLT has delivered in seeking to improve financial markets through removal of bad practices such as fraud and market manipulation (to name just a couple) and increase participation in the financial system.</p>



<p>This can also be applied to regulation. There is a tendency to think that because there is new technology, the governing policies and regulations must also be completely new, yet this is not always the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Great Financial Crisis of 2007/2008 led to many useful reforms and strong global principles and standards in the (global) financial services sector. These provide a solid foundation that can be modified, improved, and built upon for the regulation of new technologies within financial markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many global standard setting bodies (GSSBs) have already begun to consult on and modify their principles and recommendations to provide guidance for emerging regional frameworks. There are a few foundational pieces of work by the GSSBs that have been set out over the past few years such as FATF policies<a>[1]</a>, FSB recommendations<a>[2]</a>, and IOSCO principles<a>[3]</a> aiming to improve their existing guidance and requirements and mitigate any unintended gaps.</p>



<p>At a regional level, financial regulators around the world seek to implement the improvements made by the GSSBs while also enhancing and modifying local frameworks. In Europe, work on digital assets frameworks has been predominately grounded in MiFID II. The EU’s MiCA Regulation aims to complement MiFID II, and the UK’s recent consultations have also indicated that they will seek to improve upon these frameworks, and others that are already implemented in the region.</p>



<p>North America has taken approaches that vary widely by country. The US and Canada have drawn predominately on both existing securities and commodities frameworks.&nbsp;Some, such as Bermuda have been amending existing regulation for specific topics such as issuance or custody.</p>



<p>The Asia-Pacific region has also drawn on securities regulation, as well as payments regulation. The UAE is racing ahead with a bold new approach for virtual assets while balancing these with strong securities laws and a common law framework. South America, by contrast has seen some countries jumping straight to using digital assets as legal tender and/or as a permissible mode of payment.</p>



<p>From these few examples of recent policy developments, it is clear there are frameworks that should be built upon. Regulation does not need to start from a blank sheet of paper, and market participants must continuously improve and implement best practices from the responsible innovation of the previous decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminate</p>



<p>“Their knowledge of their tools is purely empirical; and they have a firm belief in the mummery that surrounds them.” – Isaac Asimov, Foundation</p>



<p>The dangers of trust without a comprehensive understanding of digital assets and regulation are hazardous, and this is arguably evident in the rhetoric from all sides. It often appears that many are blind in their beliefs and will trust without question the technology or the current regulation from those who have taught it to them. While much of this works and appears to have a high degree of social utility, many do not have a true grasp on why it works, or how to closely interrogate any individual component to ensure it works in the future with a higher degree of social utility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Danger may present itself in overzealous faith in DLT, especially when compounded by new regulations that are not proportional and are ill-fitting to new digital technologies. If those who work in technology regulation allow ‘mummery’ to induce a haze of belief in the infallibility of innovation, bad actors will continue to undermine the ecosystem. Blind belief must be eliminated, and replaced with verifiable transparency, compliance, and technical understanding from both regulators and market participants.</p>



<p>Despite much work in 2023 to advance legal definitions, there remains a lack of clarity for many market practitioners. Unclear or undecided legal status for digital assets is a clear barrier for the market. There are other missing pieces as well such as a lack of a global taxonomy for digital assets that prevent clear dialogue and comprehensive development of global frameworks.</p>



<p>The persistent use of the term “crypto” when referring to any kind of digital asset muddies the waters and puts Shiba Inu coin into the same bucket as a fully reserved fiat stablecoin or a bank issued digital bond. That is not a particularly helpful association, and a comprehensive global taxonomy could serve to eliminate some of this conflation and confusion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it is important not to blindly believe in technology, it is also important not to vilify it. In a truly technologically neutral approach DLT is not a cult, to be either worshiped or rallied against. DLT-specific risk should be assessed based on its implementation model, lifecycle activity, and network archetype and then the risk management and controls configured accordingly, with regulatory treatment to match.</p>



<p>So, what isn’t working? Ideologically, blind belief, while either favourable or punitive towards digital assets and DLT can be harmful to the market as a whole. From a legal and regulatory lens, lack of clarity both in the terms used, and the legalities that apply must also eventually be replaced by specificity and global consensus.</p>



<p>Delegate&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In dealing with the future… it is more important to be imaginative and insightful than to be one hundred percent ‘right.’” – Alvin Toffler</p>



<p>Beyond the foundational aspects of existing regulation and the problems still to be eliminated, what are aspects of the digital assets market that are not ‘solvable’ so to speak, by immediate regulation?<a>[4]</a></p>



<p>DeFi is one such still evolving area where it may be prudent for regulators to delegate further analysis and research before imposing requirements. Recently, IOSCO published their consultation on DeFi<a>[5]</a>, and the BiS also published a report on the future of DeFi<a>[6]</a>. Yet it is still evolving rapidly and difficult even to define. Even if the right definition is agreed upon, an enterprise that is truly decentralised in nature would present regulatory challenges and a unique and imaginative approach may be necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another item that can, and perhaps should be delegated, is RegTech. The ability for regulators to access, analyse and interpret the digital assets market is imperative. There are many RegTech solutions being created by the private sector, and regulators who leverage those innovations to implement outsourced technology, will have a fresh capability for digital supervision and this is pivotal to complete the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are only two areas where perhaps creativity is needed to solve the problem. As progress is made, neither the public nor private sector may always have the ‘right’ answer, however with insight, and imagination, these answers can evolve to contribute to the broader framework in innovative ways.</p>



<p>My reading, running, and at times, at times self-absorbed reflections left me a singular conclusion – it is clear there is much to be improved upon, but not in the sense that what already exists is not beneficial or useful.</p>



<p>There is a wealth of knowledge and existing regulation that can be drawn from to build a comprehensive global digital assets framework. Dogma towards both technological developments and unclear policies should be eliminated to better support the further digital development of the global financial services ecosystem and mitigate risks.</p>



<p>While there are areas where regulation may not provide the (optimal) solution for society, further discovery through cross-sector, multi-jurisdictional, and public private sector cooperation remains pivotal to the success of a robust, transparent, viable, and innovative digital assets market for everyone.</p>



<p>Improve, Eliminate, Delegate.</p>

<p>Toward a fully decentralized privacy-first Layer&nbsp;2</p><p>Today, Aztec Labs is thrilled to share the winning proposal from Aztec’s Sequencer Selection Request for Proposals (RFP) — “Fernet”.</p><p>At the heart of Fernet’s design is a fully permissionless, random leader election. This allows anyone to participate in building Aztec blocks and operating the network, cementing Aztec’s position as a decentralized Layer-2 zk-rollup.</p><blockquote>📕 <a href="https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/fernet">Read the 3-minute summary of Fernet’s decentralized sequencer selection protocol</a></blockquote> Why Fernet? <p>The Aztec Labs team, with input from various industry leading experts, chose Fernet over the B52 protocol (and other designs submitted during the RFP process) due to its simplicity, safety, and ease of implementation.</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-sequencer-selection-finalists-122dbc6bb4">📕 Read our previous announcement sharing B52 &amp; Fernet as the two sequencer selection finalists</a></blockquote><p>The random leader election in its design ensures that all participants have an equal opportunity to contribute. This not only fosters inclusivity and decentralization but also contributes nicely to the network’s censorship resistance properties, alongside features like <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/forcing-transactions/606">forced transactions</a>.</p><blockquote>The Aztec Labs team could speak for hours on the tradeoffs and why this decision was made.

      Bringing Generative AI to Healthcare         
	By Josephine Chen	 



Animation: Matt Hamel



Published September 14, 2023
        Where startups have traditionally struggled, LLMs have the potential to unlock growth and disruption.      



 
<p>Healthcare is a massive market rife with administrative inefficiencies. Of the over $4T in annual spend in the U.S. alone, $300B of that is administrative opex, mostly in repetitive, labor intensive processes. Generative AI is especially well suited to attack the labor costs of this services-heavy industry. As we have seen in legaltech, LLMs may unlock growth and disruption in a traditionally difficult vertical for software. Right now, the main applications of this technology target cost saving and automation in back office operations and making workflows more efficient for frontline staff, but the dream is for generative AI to dramatically improve patient outcomes.</p>



<p>We are already seeing innovative companies attack specific use cases, such as medical scribing, patient engagement and other workflows like prior authorization—and new opportunities are being discovered every day. The battle is already brewing. Faced with the familiar incumbents’ advantages in distribution, new entrants must lean on all their speed, ambition and creativity to break through, succeed and endure.&nbsp;</p>



 Market Background 



<p>Over the past decade, many new healthcare software companies confronted unfavorable market dynamics. Providers operate with razor thin margins and are often unwilling to spend on the promises of long-term cost efficiencies. Payors also suffer low margins and are a concentrated buyer group, with the top 5 players commanding more than 50% market share. These organizations can be slow moving and sales cycles can be incredibly long, creating roadblocks for upstarts.</p>



<p>It is no surprise that the biggest success stories in digital health have largely sidestepped these barriers by:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Benefiting from one-time regulatory changes (Epic, Cerner, Aledade) 



 Focusing on healthcare delivery within specific verticals of care (Maven for fertility, Livongo for diabetes, Hinge/Sword for MSK, Lyra/Headway for mental health) 



 Delivering a product experience adjacent to care (Zocdoc to help patients find doctors and book appointments, Doximity to help doctors connect with each other)&nbsp; 
 



<p>On the other hand, success in attacking core healthcare operations are few and far between, with the rare bright spots generally emphasizing revenue enablement over cost reduction (e.g., Viz, Cedar). The picture is even dimmer on the payor side. Frustrated with the intransigence of payors to adopt new technology, some startups have marched into the payor market instead, often with similarly disappointing outcomes.</p>



<p>GenAI tackles these constraints directly. It overcomes the buyers’ “poverty trap” by delivering large and immediate value, while maintaining robustness to unstructured data and operating environments. Its novelty factor and recognizable impact help to galvanize buyers, especially those who hope to appear innovative among peers. Most importantly, new entrants can leverage genAI to get a foot in the door and a chance to attack the broader healthcare software stack. The companies in our landscape represent these opportunities across six broad categories of front and back office operations.</p>
 







 
 Front Office 



<p>Patient-facing workflows are well-suited to LLMs because they are natural language interfaces that require the flexibility to address a wide range of conditions and special cases. There is also the potential for alignment here between care providers, payors and pharma companies, creating vectors for monetization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patient Engagement<br>There are 3 parts to patient engagement—pre-consultation discovery, patient intake and post-consultation care adherence. Discovery and intake are good fits for generative AI, which can access unstructured data to reduce search friction and help patients find the right provider more easily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best opportunity here is to improve post-visit care adherence. Patients take only half of the medication prescribed for chronic conditions leading to more than $100B in unnecessary health expenses. The solution can be as simple as automating the texts and calls that remind patients to go to follow up appointments, take medications and answer their basic questions. These tasks are currently done by legions of nurses and case managers. Cleveland Clinic, for example, gets 6M calls every month. Because payors bear the cost of non-adherence from aggravated ailments while pharma loses revenue for drugs not taken, there may be creative go-to-market angles here that startups can leverage.</p>



<p>Documentation<br>Patient-doctor interactions during consultations generate a load of manual process work, particularly transcribing these conversations into EHR fields and coding them appropriately. This taxes already overworked medical professionals and is often blamed for elevated professional burnout rates. There are an estimated 100K medical scribes today, up from 20K in 2016. With an average spend of $40-50K per scribe per year, this seemingly narrow use case costs at least $4B, exclusive of physicians’ opportunity costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the long term, players here have strong platform potential. They can deepen their features on the captured data, providing better referencing and workflows and eventually becoming a first-class system of record. Some documentation companies are already expanding downstream into areas such as coding and billing.</p>



<p>This is not a new insight, but there is a clear “why now.” The last generation of startups fell short because the tech was not ready, but the problem lends itself well to today’s LLMs, particularly Whisper and GPT4 models. Ironically, the risk now is that it is too easy and the tech will almost surely commoditize. In the market of smaller health systems and clinics, startups will need to go beyond the scribing wedge to create an all-in-one suite for provider operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clinical Decision Making<br>As shown in legaltech, genAI can provide an interface to organize, retrieve and synthesize complex medical facts, notes and research. Physicians have traditionally been reluctant to embrace new workflows, but other use cases are potentially open to attack. For instance, one could envision LLMs empowering physicians to query a vast corpus of drug information or providing more personalized care for a patient.&nbsp;</p>



 Back Office 



<p>Much of the back office workload stems from the conflicting incentives between payors and providers. Providers often get paid for the service, rather than the outcome. Payors are naturally skeptical of what providers represent as necessary and would rather not pay for a service or drug. As a result, payors force providers through complex frameworks and arduous processes to justify their reimbursement requests and deny more than 1 in 10 claims. Payors are also burdened by the need to manually review and adjudicate claims. Both sides thus employ thousands of nurses and administrative staff to handle these tasks.</p>



<p>Prior authorization<br>Prior authorization is the arduous process insurance companies impose on physicians to seek approval before they can prescribe certain drugs to a patient or schedule certain procedures. In 2021, physicians submitted more than 35 million prior authorization requests to Medicare Advantage payors, of which 2 million were denied. AI-enabled automations arm the providers, patients and pharma companies—whose incentives are all aligned—against this death by administration. LLMs have been able to generate prior authorization forms with remarkable accuracy out of the box, which is why so many startups have started here.</p>



<p>There is a risk that this need may get regulated away. As the number of prior auths have grown so egregiously over the last few years, regulatory intervention looks increasingly likely. New policies that reduce the burden of prior auths overall would dramatically reduce the value of these products. And, as with AI-scribes, the technology to generate a prior authorization form is also fairly commoditized, so companies have to build out additional workflows to endure.</p>



<p>Coding<br>Medical coders read physician notes and look at labs to identify the right code for the diagnosis and procedure. These codes are then used for insurance billing. The medical coding market in the U.S. is worth around $21B, comprising about 35K medical coders. Despite all that labor, almost $20B of revenue is lost by U.S. hospitals annually due to coding errors, which has led to a cottage industry of local consulting firms that help providers “discover” missing revenue.</p>



<p>While most of the traditional solutions are rule-based, multimodal LLM models can collate unstructured physician notes, lab panels, and imaging to determine the right diagnosis codes. Automation can also reduce the administrative back and forth with payors and will be a natural lead into the massive opportunity that is revenue cycle management. Incumbents in the documentation space will also have a formidable advantage here.</p>



<p>Revenue Cycle Management<br>Medical billers create and submit a medical claim to the payor once they get the codes for the procedures/office visit. While claim submission is automated, following up on them is not. The combination of investigating and appealing rejected claims, verifying eligibility and benefits of all treatments and dealing with payors is probably the most significant administrative headache for provider systems. Eleven percent of all healthcare insurance claims were denied in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two ways to attack the RCM market: workflow automations or handling the billing itself. Automation comes with some tech risk and significant amounts of incumbent advantage (e.g., UiPath incorporating LLMs), while billing suffers from protracted sales cycles. The best entrypoint may be to expand into RCM over time from adjacent use cases.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Disruption in healthcare has historically been difficult and the windows of opportunities fleeting and narrow, but generative AI may finally provide the unlock. We are excited to meet teams who dare to reimagine the next decades of healthcare.</p>

 Noir gets extended with smart contract functionality <p>Today we’re announcing Aztec.nr, a powerful new smart contract framework for Aztec applications. Aztec.nr enables smart contract developers to intuitively manage private&nbsp;state.</p><p>In other words, Aztec now has a smart contract language.</p><blockquote>👀 <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-nr">Explore the Aztec.nr Github repo&nbsp;here</a></blockquote><p>Aztec.nr is a framework built on top of <a href="http://noir-lang.org">Noir</a>, an open-source, universal zk programming language to which Aztec Labs is a core contributor.</p><p>Aztec.nr allows developers to write private smart contracts in Noir and extend their functionality with templated functions that simplify state management.</p><p>Last week we teased how simple and intuitive private state management would be on&nbsp;Aztec.</p><blockquote>📕 Read the first post in this series: <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/privacy-abstraction-with-aztec-def9da73eb5">Privacy Abstraction with&nbsp;Aztec</a></blockquote><p>Today we’re explaining how Aztec.nr works and showing how you can get started building smart contracts and full-fledged privacy-preserving applications on&nbsp;Aztec.</p> The point of&nbsp;Aztec.nr <p>The Aztec.nr framework helps you deal with complex note management that is critical to privacy preservation within smart contract development.</p><p>But it does so in a way that makes it so that developers don’t have to rebuild smart contract functionality from scratch every time they write a Noir&nbsp;program.</p><p>Without Aztec.nr, you wouldn’t be able to emit events, make calls to other contracts, or even have the notion of a contract or an address. You’d have no msg.sender or access to historic blockchain.</p><p>Aztec.nr takes Noir — a general zero knowledge programming language — and gives it the smart contract functionality and syntax developers might expect coming from Solidity.</p><p>Developers can now access a complete set of smart contract features:</p>  Contracts (including callable contract functions and inter-contract function&nbsp;calls)  Persistent state variables  Contract address semantics  Access to msg.sender and other call context information  Access to transaction context information  Access to historic blockchain data  Events (logs) (both encrypted and unencrypted)  Cryptographic primitives  Cross-chain (L1 -&gt; L2 and L2 -&gt; L1) message&nbsp;passing  <p>For examples of Aztec.nr at work, check out examples&nbsp;of:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/uniswap_contract/src/main.nr">a swap&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/lending_contract/src/main.nr">a lending&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/card_game_contract/src/main.nr">a card game&nbsp;contract</a>   How we got&nbsp;here <p>At Aztec Labs we harbor two very strong&nbsp;beliefs:</p>  Privacy is the major unlock for the next leg of adoption. Having every single address, transaction, and balance exposed in plaintext is a non-starter for everyday users, businesses, and institutions coming on-chain.  Privacy UX has to be better than the existing state of the art in blockchains. Privacy-preserving technology is only useful if the experience of using it isn’t better than what is available today.  <p>The Aztec.nr framework is a major step in improving the developer experience for managing private state — functionality that “vanilla” Noir doesn’t&nbsp;have.</p><p>For example for a simple private token contract, Aztec.nr includes helper functions like:</p>  get_balance  increment  decrement  etc.  <p>In other words, the kinds of functions you might expect to call in a standard token contract!</p><p>Let’s walk through this private token contract to show you how Aztec.nr helps with abstracting private note management:</p><blockquote>Follow along in the Github repo of our private token contract example&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/private_token_contract/src/main.nr">here</a></blockquote>How private notes can be&nbsp;managed<p>Say Alice wants to send funds to Bob. Practically, she would have to aggregate all of the existing non-nullified notes they have of the asset she were sending, add up the values, and once she had enough notes to send the amount, create a change note to reconcile her&nbsp;balance.</p><p>For example, say Alice had two UTXO’s of 0.25 ETH each, and wanted to send 0.4 ETH to Bob. In order to spend the note Alice would have to sum the two 0.25 ETH notes together, nullify them both, and create a change note for herself of 0.1&nbsp;ETH.</p><p>Thankfully, Aztec.nr makes it easy to manage notes. Take for example the decrement and decrement_by_at_most functions written by the Aztec Labs team for the private token example&nbsp;above.</p><p>Here’s how decrement_by_at_most works:</p><blockquote>Follow along with the decrement_by_at_most example&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/0247b859d88781740fa990801a24881c09c5ca3c/yarn-project/aztec-nr/value-note/src/utils.nr#L59">here</a>.</blockquote><p>1. Find notes to decrement. The function begins by getting some notes that add up to max_amount or less from the set of notes owned by&nbsp;owner.</p><p>2. Destroy selected notes. It then iterates over these selected notes and destroys them, adding their values to a variable decremented.</p><p>3. Handle Change: If the total value of the destroyed notes (decremented) is greater than max_amount, it creates a new note with the excess value (change_value) and assigns it back to the&nbsp;owner.</p><p>4. Return the Decrement: Finally, the function returns the total value that was decremented, which is stored in decremented.</p><p>The decrement example is a perfect showcase for how Aztec.nr makes it easy to manage notes and nullifiers with built-in get, insert, replace, and remove functions.</p><p>If a dev wanted to write this without Aztec.nr (as in, write it with “vanilla” aka non-smart-contract Noir), they would have to write their own Merkle trees to insert and prove membership of notes and support non-membership checks for nullifiers.</p><p>But as a developer, you don’t have to worry about rebuilding core privacy primitives — the Aztec Labs team has already done all of that work on your&nbsp;behalf.</p><p>You just focus on smart contract&nbsp;logic.</p> When will I get to play with all this cool&nbsp;tech? <p>Soon, anon,&nbsp;soon.</p><p>We’ll soon release a local developer environment for developers to write and test Aztec smart contracts against a local instance of an Aztec&nbsp;node.</p><p>Developers will soon get a full-fledged development kit for building smart contracts and applications on Aztec, supported by Aztec.nr’s functionality.</p><p>But for now, you can preview what comes in the&nbsp;box.</p><blockquote>Explore the Aztec.nr Github repo&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-nr">here</a></blockquote><p>Start familiarizing yourself with Noir syntax, since Aztec.nr is simply a smart contract framework written in vanilla&nbsp;Noir.</p><p>To get started learning Noir, check&nbsp;out:</p>  The <a href="https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter">Noir starter</a>&nbsp;repos  The official <a href="https://noir-lang.org/">Noir&nbsp;docs</a>  <p>Finally, sign up for Aztec Labs’ developer e-mail list to stay apprised of all technical developments across Noir and&nbsp;Aztec:</p><blockquote><a href="https://embeds.beehiiv.com/83354329-29bf-48be-ba17-a99d72424ace">📬 Subscribe here to the Aztec Labs Developer Dispatch, the latest news and releases about Aztec and&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote><p>To learn more about Aztec generally, keep up to date on our <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network">Discourse</a>, where we discuss major protocol decisions like <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-upgrade-mechanisms/605">upgrade mechanisms</a> and <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-decentralized-sequencer-selection/350">decentralizing sequencers</a>.</p> Join our&nbsp;team <p>Aztec Labs is on the lookout for talented engineers, cryptographers, and business people to accelerate our vision of encrypted Ethereum.</p><blockquote>If joining our mission to bring scalable privacy to Ethereum excites you, <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec">check out our open&nbsp;roles</a>.</blockquote><p>And continue the conversation with us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-aztec-nr-aztecs-private-smart-contract-framework-54d716710407">Introducing Aztec.nr: Aztec’s Private Smart Contract Framework</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      Retooling the Status Quo         
	By Emma Starer Gross	 



Photography: Mark Davis



Published September 13, 2023
        David Hsu’s rebellious spirit led him to re-imagine the world of software.      



 
<p>David Hsu looked out the window of his childhood bedroom in Palo Alto. It was 2017, and for the greater part of the year, the room had served double duty as Hsu’s living quarters as well as the headquarters for his peer-to-peer payments startup, Cashew. Hsu’s parents had welcomed their son and the Cashew team into their home, sharing meals, couch space and the washing machine with the 20-something-year-olds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few months earlier, Cashew had been accepted to Y Combinator, but more recently, on Demo Day, when participants present their companies to potential investors, the Cashew team remained seated. They had nothing. Unable to make Cashew’s financial model work, Hsu and his team had burned through half their cash, and would ultimately decide to call it quits.</p>



<p>Hsu recalls the pain of this moment. “Our peers were up on stage raising all this money, and we felt like we let all the people who believed in us down,” he says. “I remember thinking, ‘What are we doing? Why are we burning away our savings, working on an app that loses money on every transaction?’” Mulling it over in his childhood bedroom, with its walls covered in punk-rock posters—relics that reflected his teenage rebelliousness and fighting spirit—Hsu decided he wasn’t done yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Failure is something you can recover from,” Hsu says. “I thought, ‘Okay, what did we learn? And how can we apply that to what’s next?’” From this soul searching, Retool was born.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retool is a software development platform that offers drag-and-drop, customizable building blocks for developers to quickly assemble commonly-used software systems—admin panels, support dashboards, customer portals and more—so that they can focus on core features that set their businesses apart. “Our view was that the way people were building software was ridiculously inefficient,” Hsu says. “There’s no need for everybody to be constantly writing all this boilerplate code.” While critics bristled initially at this belief and found elements of Retool’s business counterintuitive, Hsu stuck to his guns. Today, the platform launched from Hsu’s childhood bedroom powers tens of thousands of companies including Disney, Airbnb and Mercedes-Benz.</p>

<p>When Hsu was 16, his parents told him they’d had enough. His grades were terrible and his friend group—fellow punk-rock fans who favored mosh pits and garage jam sessions over school—was, in their eyes, even worse. Hsu’s parents, who had immigrated from China to the United States for post-graduate studies, had tried everything, from curfews to taking away Hsu’s bicycle (Hsu simply walked instead). They informed their son they were moving him to Saratoga, a quaint suburb near Palo Alto. No more wayward friends, no more East Bay counterculture to distract him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hsu acknowledges that, angry as he was, the change helped. With fewer diversions, he started thinking about his future. Hsu was already an avid Hacker News reader and remembers an essay where Paul Graham, the venture capitalist who co-founded Y Combinator, described the creation of startups as “almost a measurement of the accuracy of your worldview. In a startup, there’s nowhere to hide,” Hsu says. “You can’t hide behind the work of others, you can’t fake your way to long-term success. You have to work hard (since otherwise you fail), you have to be smart (since otherwise you fail), and you have to be correct often enough (since otherwise you fail). But if you do it right, the impact of your work is remarkable: you can create something that actually puts a dent in the universe.” As a rebellious teenager who dreamed of having an impact and proving to others that his worldview was correct, Hsu was enamored by this challenge.</p>



<p>This fascination was heightened by the fact that Hsu’s high school experience coincided with the rise of Twitter and the Arab Spring. “I watched as this website, which was created in a matter of days, just miles from where I lived, topple a dictator halfway around the world,” Hsu says. “Technology could change peoples’ lives for the better, and that was exhilarating to me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Silicon Valley founder trope would suggest Hsu might forgo or drop out of college to focus on technology. Instead, he did the opposite. He hunkered down, was admitted to Oxford to study philosophy and computer science, graduated high school early, and spent a gap year in China. “I wanted to learn more about the innards of computers,” Hsu says. “But I also wanted to leave the bubble of Palo Alto.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for his interest in philosophy, Hsu says it stemmed from Douglas Hofstadter’s Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. He recalls a particular chapter about the relationship between ants and anthills. In it, a crab, anteater and tortoise discuss the paradox of how individual ants (who are not intelligent), when formed into a colony, can demonstrate signs of intelligence at the colony level. “This phenomenon is similar to neurons in the brain, where any individual neuron isn’t doing anything particularly smart,” Hsu says. “But then you put all the neurons together and you create a brain. That’s pretty smart.” Back in 1979, Hofstadter also used this logic of emergent intelligence to predict computers gaining the power to think like humans. “These philosophical ideas about humanity and science really interested me,” Hsu says. And then, of course, “the other reason I chose this area of study was that philosophy is kind of a big f*** you to your parents.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I wanted to learn more about the innards of computers. But I also wanted to leave the bubble of Palo Alto.”</p>

<p>“What’s the worst that could happen?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was 2015 and Hsu, now in his senior year at Oxford, had gone out for ice cream with classmates. “We wanted to pay each other back,” Hsu says, “But England didn’t have an easy way for people to send money to each other.” Venmo, so popular in the United States, didn’t exist in the U.K. Hsu turned to his friends: “I was like, ‘It can’t be that hard. I bet we can build something similar.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One year earlier, on a whim, Hsu had joined his college’s Ball Committee, which organized the school’s seasonal dances. He quickly realized that ticketing for the balls was an unwieldy process. “Technology is unevenly distributed across the world,” Hsu says. “In the U.S., you have good ticketing platforms, but there wasn’t anything good in England.” So Hsu, having never built a production ticketing system before, decided to engineer a system where students could RSVP to the balls, buy tickets in advance, and check in by scanning their wristbands by the door. “It wasn’t particularly complicated, but attendees were shocked: there were no queues for purchasing tickets, the site handled thousands of concurrent users successfully, and scanning the wristband admitted you directly to the ball,” Hsu says. “If I had been back in Silicon Valley and built a ball ticketing site, no one would have cared. But at Oxford, where there were very few computer scientists, the skillset I had was valuable, and I was happy to have found a use for it.”&nbsp;<br>Back at the ice cream parlor, Hsu saw a similar opportunity and laid out his argument: there was a need in the U.K. for a peer-to-peer payments system. No one had built one; why shouldn’t they? What’s the worst that could happen?</p>
 







 
<p>“It’s a terrible idea,” John Collison said. The Stripe co-founder sat across from Hsu in Mountain View, at Y Combinator’s office. It was the winter of 2017, and in the time since the ice cream outing, Hsu had graduated from Oxford, launched Cashew, gained a small, local following for the app, and been accepted to Y Combinator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hsu had 30 minutes booked with Collison. He spent the first three minutes pitching Cashew. Collison, in turn, took the next three explaining why it wouldn’t work: Cashew lost money on every transaction with fees paid to credit card providers, and while this was negligible in the startup’s early stages, if the app’s adoption continued, the cost would become a death sentence. Building out a business model that could offset transaction costs in the U.K. would be next to impossible. “I had arguments against what he said, but he rebutted each one,” Hsu says. “He was like, ‘no, nope, no, no, no.’ After maybe 10 minutes of our 30-minute allotted time, there was nothing left to say.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Had Hsu taken a page from his philosophy textbook, perhaps he would’ve listened to Collison. Hsu says one of his main takeaways from studying philosophy relates to the idea that reality isn’t objective. “People see the world from different angles,” Hsu says. “The way we react to things, evaluate pros and cons, and generate opinions is based on our own axioms and lived experiences. There’s no one ‘right way’ or ‘right reality.’ And so approaching situations with empathy and humility, seeing the world through someone else’s perspective, and then often revising your previously held beliefs, is critical.”</p>



<p>Still fresh from uni, however, this lesson hadn’t fully registered. Hsu left his meeting with Collison (respectfully) defiant and determined to prove him wrong. “And then, of course,” Hsu says, “he was right.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the spring of 2017, the company was hemorrhaging money in transaction fees and its bank account was rapidly dwindling. The Cashew team had attempted to cut its losses by convincing retailers to take payments via a Cashew digital wallet, but its development proved costly and time-intensive. “Looking back, I was incredibly naive,” Hsu says. “I had a pie-in-the-sky sort of attitude about what I thought of as this rebellious undertaking that everyone said wouldn’t work. Cashew had started as a project with friends, right? But after Y Combinator invested in us, after I moved back home, it was like, ‘Okay, this is real now. It’s time to get serious.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Cashew’s Achilles’ heel was its financial model, Hsu recognized that the internal systems the team had developed to support the app were powerful. The process of building these systems, however, had been repetitive and inefficient. “I remember always thinking, ‘I wish there was a faster way to build this software,’” Hsu says. “And so, post-Cashew, we had this idea of, ‘What if we took the code that we already had from Cashew and repurposed it? What if we gave it to other developers so they didn’t have to build the same internal systems from scratch?’” Hsu says. “This was the provenance of Retool.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I remember always thinking, ‘I wish there was a faster way to build this software.’”</p>
David Hsu</blockquote>



<p>As with Cashew, Hsu’s new idea—offering visual building blocks for engineers—had its share of naysayers. “Most people thought it was a pretty bad idea,” Hsu says. “Why would engineers buy something they could build themselves? Why not target non-coders? Why give engineers a vitamin when you could give non-coders a lifesaver?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies offering low-code or no-code solutions were trending at the time, but Hsu’s take was that, in the case of what Retool was looking to solve for, targeting non-coders was unrealistic. “Yes, these are building blocks, but they’re not one size fits all. They require customization and stitching together into a system that is fairly complex,” Hsu says. “You need to be able to talk to your computer, and to code, to achieve this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the argument of why engineers wouldn’t simply build the features Retool was offering themselves, Hsu’s view was that a company’s edge is its core product, not its internal systems. “Why not provide building blocks for those internal systems so that engineers can focus on their company’s core product, the custom stuff that’s fun, creative, exciting and differentiating?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the echoes of “this won’t work” from a previously failed endeavor might have stopped someone else, Hsu’s individualistic streak won out again. But he was also no longer the “pie-in-the-sky” college graduate who pitched John Collison and plowed ahead despite his warnings. His experience with Cashew had taught him “just because you’re a contrarian, it doesn’t mean you’re right,” Hsu says. “To know whether you’re a contrarian and right, or a contrarian and wrong, you have to take the time to fully understand the world in which you’re operating, the customers you’re serving and the business you’re building.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To achieve this, Hsu began talking to other engineers to see if a product like Retool might be useful to them. “I remember one day going into Y Combinator in Mountain View and going around to all the other startups asking, ‘Is it just us, are we the weird ones, or would this be helpful?’ And they responded enthusiastically to the idea,” Hsu says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bryan Schreier, the Sequoia Partner who led Retool’s Series A funding, was one such early enthusiast. “I used to work at Google, and I managed a large team of engineers who built internal tools. Despite being mission-critical, those engineers couldn’t wait to graduate and take on higher-value work. And when they did leave internal tools, they went on to build Gmail and Google Drive. If we had had something like Retool, we could have liberated all those engineers and the team wouldn’t have needed to exist at all,” says Schreier, “so for me, it was just clearly obvious that a company should address this space.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If we had had something like Retool, we could have liberated all those engineers and the team wouldn’t have needed to exist at all, so for me, it was just clearly obvious that a company should address this space.”</p>
Bryan Schreier</blockquote>



<p>This support from the YC collective left Hsu determined to pursue Retool in earnest. “Later that day, during the 20-minute drive home to Palo Alto, I had this conviction that our contrarian view was right. That the way engineers built software was ridiculous. We could build a company to change that,” says Hsu.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When he returned to YC for Demo Day in the summer 2017, Hsu stood confidently in front of an audience of investors. The team had already signed a large enterprise customer to a $1.5 million pilot. Redemption achieved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In keeping with his commitment to know his own company nuts to bolts, instead of hiring a head of sales at the onset, Hsu took on the role himself. “I’d never done sales before and always pictured that scene in Glengarry Glen Ross where it’s all about charisma and closing,” Hsu says. “In reality, sales hinges on empathy and being able to explain your product. It’s about figuring out what a win-win situation could look like for both of you to work together.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each time a customer signed up for Retool, Hsu remembers “it felt unbelievable.” But these achievements were ones he and his team barely acknowledged. After the failure of Cashew, Hsu was skeptical of success. “I didn’t want to celebrate prematurely. Every customer felt like it might be our last. Eventually someone’s going to find out that we’re writing code from my parents’ house!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parental HQ notwithstanding, Retool’s users grew steadily in numbers, and Hsu’s approach to his new venture reinforced just how far he had come from his Cashew days. “With Retool, we prioritized having a sustainable business from the get-go, so we cared quite a bit about unit economics and stayed very lean as a company. Compared to Cashew, where every transaction cost us money, this was a pretty different mindset. Here, people were paying us to use the software we wrote—in my childhood bedroom. Wow.”</p>



<p>Today, Retool has tens of thousands of customers; it’s helped businesses save hundreds of millions in operational costs; it boasts use cases including forecasting for the Olympics and operating networks of satellites. But Hsu’s focus on pragmatism with respect to his business remains strong. “Yes, Retool’s much larger now,” Hsu says. “But even today, we don’t want to oversell ourselves.” As Retool’s customer base grows, Hsu feels it’s more important than ever to remain empathetic and open-minded in order to understand their increasingly varied and complex needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in 2017, a customer suggested that Retool be able to connect to application programming interfaces (APIs) as opposed to just a company’s databases. “For a while, we pushed back on this,” Hsu says. “We were like, ‘We think connecting to databases alone is fine and this is a request we can ignore.’ But then we self-reflected and thought, ‘Actually, you know, why not? Is it a core belief of ours that Retool must not connect to APIs? No.’ So we changed our mind, and today APIs are our most popular resource.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our approach was, rather than immediately jumping on the AI bandwagon, let’s talk to our customers and understand how we could use AI to actually deliver value to them.”</p>
David Hsu</blockquote>



<p>The ability to connect to APIs has proven fruitful in other ways, perhaps most significantly in putting the pieces in place to help Retool’s customers make use of AI—a shade of Hofstadter’s Gödel, Escher, Bach prediction realized. “There’s a lot of hype around AI, and we’ve seen a lot of startups in Silicon Valley try to rebrand themselves as AI companies,” Hsu says. “Our approach was, rather than immediately jumping on the AI bandwagon, let’s talk to our customers and understand how we could use AI to actually deliver value to them.” They found that most of their customers were interested in AI, but weren’t sure how to approach it or how it could help them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of these conversations, Retool developed a <a href="https://retool.com/products/ai">suite of AI features</a> that work in tandem with its current library of tools. “These features fall into two categories,” says David Dworsky, Retool’s Product Manager for AI. “The first category helps engineers build applications faster—so using AI to assist with code generation, query generation and debugging. The second category helps companies expedite AI-powered workflows that are specific to them. So if you’re an insurance company, using AI to match a claim with a policy. Or if you’re a fintech company, using AI to flag fraudulent transactions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because Retool is already connected to its users’ databases and APIs, “you can start stitching AI actions together with that data in literally a matter of minutes, without having to become an AI expert,” Dworsky says. “And we’re enabling these actions to be backed by whatever vendor a company wants to use—OpenAI, LLaMA, Cohere, etc. Our key insight here was to maintain flexibility behind the scenes, while making our AI features really intuitive to use.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For 16-year-old Hsu, a teenager with punk aspirations, siloed from friends and under the rule of parents, the prospect of founding a startup and getting to be his own boss was enticing. But today, at 28, Hsu recognizes that the job demands more than just rebellion. “Yes, you have to have your own differentiated view of the world and stand by it,” Hsu says. “But, when it comes to every element of your business, you have to be open-minded. You have to acknowledge when you are wrong, be willing to change your beliefs, and take a philosophical approach to understanding your customers and the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hsu no longer works out of his childhood bedroom: Retool now operates out of offices in San Francisco, New York and London. While the Retool of today differs from the company at its outset, Hsu has made sure its humble beginnings aren’t forgotten, documenting the company’s journey via photos. “That’s a piece of advice I have for founders,” He says. “Take pictures every step of the way. Five, six years out, you can look back and see how far you’ve come.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of Retool, the photos on its walls show a team that has expanded from a nonconforming party of just a few, to hundreds of people around the globe who recognize the value of thinking outside the box, and the possibilities that come with questioning, retooling—and occasionally rebelling against—the status quo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today we are excited to announce our partnership with ZebPay, one of India’s leading crypto exchanges. ZebPay represents a new custodial account provider option for <a>Brave Rewards</a> users in India, and is available in Brave version 1.58 on both desktop and Android.</p>
<p>With this partnership, Brave Rewards users in India will now be able to connect a ZebPay account to Brave Rewards in order to begin earning <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Tokens (BAT)</a>. Existing users in India with <a>previous earnings</a> will also be able to connect a ZebPay account and have their balances redeemed for BAT and transferred to their ZebPay accounts.</p>
<p>In the near future, creators will also be able to connect a ZebPay account to their <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creators</a> account, allowing them to receive BAT contributions from Brave Rewards users.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with ZebPay to enable our millions of Brave users in India to benefit from their Brave Rewards experience,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “With this custodial integration, users can seamlessly access their BAT payouts in their ZebPay account and get rewarded for their online attention.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to be the exclusive partners for Brave Rewards in India,” said Rahul Pagidipati, CEO of ZebPay. “This strategic partnership not only reinforces our commitment to empowering users but also demonstrates our unwavering support of the crypto ecosystem in India. By enabling users to seamlessly transfer Brave Rewards to ZebPay, we are unlocking a new realm of possibilities for crypto enthusiasts. This is a testament to ZebPay’s vision of creating a more inclusive and accessible crypto ecosystem where users can fully harness the potential of their digital assets.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave provides users with a better Internet experience by protecting their privacy. The Brave browser blocks invasive ads and trackers, which provides a faster (3-6x) and more private Internet experience, as well as less battery drainage. Brave users can earn BAT for seeing privacy-preserving ads in Brave. Online creators can also earn BAT from Brave users with <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creators</a> by publishing great content across a range of platforms including YouTube, Twitter/X, Vimeo, Github, Twitch, or their own website.</p>

 Instructions 
<p>To connect a ZebPay account to Brave Rewards, first make sure you’re on the latest version of Brave (version 1.58 or above). On Android, some users may only see Brave version 1.58 on the app store in a few days.</p>
 
 Open the Brave Rewards panel by selecting the BAT icon in the URL bar. Select “Connect account”, and then select ZebPay as your account provider. 
 


    
    

    


    


    
    

 
 Follow the steps on ZebPay. If you don’t already have a ZebPay account, create one and then complete these steps. Make sure to complete all ID verification steps for your account on ZebPay. 
 


    
    

    


    


    
    

 
 Voilà! Once your ZebPay account is connected, you’ll see a “Connected” status and a ZebPay zebra icon in the Brave Rewards interface.

<p>Deirdre Connolly joined the Zcash Foundation in <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-zcash-foundation-welcomes-a-core-engineer/">May 2019</a>. Over the past four years, she has been a key member of the Foundation’s engineering team, helping it grow from two people to nine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deirdre has been a key contributor to the development of both the Zebra node and the Foundation’s FROST implementation. She co-authored the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">FROST specification</a> (and will continue to contribute to that effort), and has served as a ZIP editor since 2020, helping steer Zcash through the lengthy and challenging NU5 upgrade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outside her work with the Foundation, Deirdre co-hosts the <a href="https://securitycryptographywhatever.com/">Security Cryptography Whatever</a> podcast, and is fascinated by isogeny-based cryptography. She has also held a long-standing interest in quantum-resistant cryptography, and she has been tempted away from the Zcash Foundation by an opportunity to pursue this topic more deeply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her departure is bittersweet in that, while we are disappointed that her future career path lies outside the Zcash Foundation, we are pleased that she has found an opportunity that will allow her to further develop her talents as a cryptographer, and that she will continue to contribute to Zcash as a member of the Zcash Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the Zcash Foundation team members past and present, and the Zcash community as a whole, we want to thank Deirdre for her contributions to Zcash and the broader mission of financial privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new feature for NymConnect boosts speed by 10x and offers a tantalising look at holistic privacy for the upcoming Nym&nbsp;VPN.</p><p>Blink and you’ll miss it! Ahead of the Nym VPN launch by the end of 2023, a lightning-fast new feature 10 times faster than the default mixnet option in NymConnect. With the upcoming Nym VPN, this feature is the first step towards letting users pick the privacy protection that’s most suitable for their needs.

This means that it does not protect traffic patterns from global adversaries, only against local adversaries, similarly to a dVPN. By default, Speedy Mode is not enabled, and users will have to switch the option on — allowing users to decide whether they want to optimise for speed or optimise for&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The Nym mixnet is designed to be a privacy layer for the whole internet. But this can only be achieved if it is fast enough to support a wide range of use cases. Right now, the Nym mixnet works and can be integrated with any SOCKS5-compatible application.</p><p>However, the mixnet is slow and its utility is limited to use cases where speed is not so much of the essence, like&nbsp;email.</p><p>NymConnect with Speedy Mode will solve this by optimising latency across use cases. The first step will allow users themselves to manually optimise for privacy and latency depending on what they are using the mixnet for. As the system moves towards a full-stack VPN, some of this will be automated.</p><p>According to recent load testing benchmarking, the default mixnet currently averages download and upload speeds of 100KBps. Ping times were typically in the range of 800–1,000ms.</p><p>Those same tests found average upload and download speeds of Speedy Mode were 1,000 KBps, while ping times were as low as&nbsp;200ms.</p><p>The default option in NymConnect will be complete privacy protection via the regular mixnet. But if users want to optimise for a specific low-latency use case, they can “dial down” the mixnet by reducing cover traffic and enabling Speedy&nbsp;Mode.</p><p>Dial down cover traffic, dial up the&nbsp;speed!</p><p>Users in Speedy Mode can still trust the mixnet to provide robust privacy protections because data still travels through three hops. The majority of VPNs offer just one hop, merely obscuring your IP from your internet provider and little&nbsp;else.</p><p>To achieve the breakneck 10x pace of Speedy Mode, the cover traffic feature of the regular mixnet, where dummy data packets are mixed in with real data, has been dropped. However, cover traffic will still be sent when accessing the default&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Quickly now, without&nbsp;delay</p><p>A feature of the default mode is that packets are sent at randomised, delayed intervals through the mixnet. This provides extremely strong privacy protection. To whizz data along faster, Speedy Mode does not delay these packets, optimising for speed&nbsp;instead.</p><p>Bigger packet sizes, better&nbsp;speeds</p><p>The default mixnet splits content up into tiny packets of 2KB before sending these across the mixnet. To make things faster, Speedy Mode uses slightly larger packets of 16KB. These are still small enough to throw off snooping adversaries but because they’re larger, fewer of them need to be&nbsp;created.</p><p>Geo-optimisation</p><p>The mixnet splits up and casts your data far and wide all around the world. This makes it near-impossible to track metadata. For this reason, the default mixnet does not operate with geo awareness switched on. However, sending packets across the whole world is not particularly efficient for connectivity or usability.</p><p>When operating in Speedy Mode you will be switching on geo-awareness. Behind the scenes, Speedy Mode contacts mixnet gateways and locates the closest to your region and then identifies which Network Requesters are nearby. All other nodes are then grouped by region based on the selected gateway for that session, meaning the nodes used to mix traffic will be closer, and the mixnet will be much, much&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Only the first hop can assess your location. This cannot subsequently be linked to any of the other hops, nor your final recipient, so your communications remain safe, unlinkable and untraceable.</p> How to turn on Speedy Mode in NymConnect <p>Switching Speedy Mode on couldn’t be&nbsp;simpler.</p><p>Open NymConnect, click the menu icon, and navigate to ‘Privacy&nbsp;Level’.</p><p>Hit ‘Enable’ and that’s it — NymConnect is in Speedy&nbsp;Mode!</p> Split tunelling: the optimised Nym&nbsp;VPN <p>The upcoming VPN will put holistic privacy in the hands of you, the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Just like NymConnect, users will be able to opt for the default Nym mixnet for hardcore pattern protection against the most powerful adversaries. Or they will be able to optimise for speed instead of privacy where that makes sense, such as for streaming video via Speedy&nbsp;Mode.</p><p>But Nym VPN will eventually go even further into the application level.</p><p>With split tunelling, users will be able to select the level of privacy protections for each individual app across their whole&nbsp;stack.</p><p>In short, your crypto wallet could run over the highest possible privacy settings via the default mixnet, while your web browser could run in Speedy Mode for content streaming! The choice is&nbsp;yours.</p><p>Speedy Mode is a proof of concept, so please test it! As NymConnect is still in beta, it should not be used for strong privacy protections yet, and that goes for Speedy Mode too. Speedy Mode is a work in progress, and Nym needs your help to determine the privacy implications, so feedback is essential.</p><p>Send your feedback via error reporting <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/nymconnect">in the NymConnect app</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/channels/824256813200834580/1045634270766563358">the feedback channel on&nbsp;Discord</a>.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/meet-speedy-mode-the-mixnet-but-10x-faster-70e6573920b4">Introducing Speedy Mode on NymConnect!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>with @alive_eth @danboneh @smc90</p><p>This week's all-new episode covers the convergence of two important, very top-of-mind trends: AI (artificial intelligence) &amp; blockchains/ crypto. These domains together have major implications for how we all live our lives everyday; so this episode is for anyone just curious about, or already building in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversation covers topics ranging from deep fakes, bots, and the need for proof-of-humanity in a world of AI; to big data, large language models like ChatGPT, user control, governance, privacy and security, zero knowledge and zkML; to MEV, media, art, and much more. Our expert guests (in conversation with host Sonal Chokshi) include:&nbsp;</p>  Dan Boneh, Stanford Professor (and Senior Research Advisor at a16z crypto), a cryptographer who’s been working on blockchains for over a decade and who specializes in cryptography, computer security, and machine learning -- all of which intersect in this episode;  Ali Yahya, general partner at a16z crypto, who also previously worked at Google -- where he not only worked on a distributed system for a fleet of robots (a sort of "collective reinforcement learning") but also worked on Google Brain, where he was one of the core contributors to the machine learning library TensorFlow built at Google.  <p>The first half of the hallway-style conversation between Ali &amp; Dan (who go back together as student and professor at Stanford) is all about how AI could benefit from crypto, and the second half on how crypto could benefit from AI... the thread throughout is the tension between centralization vs. decentralization. &nbsp;So we also discuss where the intersection of crypto and AI can bring about things that aren't possible by either one of them alone...</p><p>pieces referenced in this episode/ related reading:</p>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06616.pdf">The Next Cyber Reasoning System for Cyber Security</a> (2023) by Mohamed Ferrag, Ammar Battah, Norbert Tihanyi, Merouane Debbah, Thierry Lestable, Lucas Cordeiro  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14752.pdf">A New Era in Software Security: Towards Self-Healing Software via Large Language Models and Formal Verification</a> (2023) by &nbsp;Yiannis Charalambous, Norbert Tihanyi, Ridhi Jain, Youcheng Sun, Mohamed Ferrag, Lucas Cordeiro  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01215.pdf">Fixing Hardware Security Bugs with Large Language Models</a> (2023) by Baleegh Ahmad, Shailja Thakur, Benjamin Tan, Ramesh Karri, Hammond Pearce  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?</a> (2022) by Neil Perry, Megha Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, Dan Boneh  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09293">Asleep at the Keyboard?

<p>The PIVX community is dedicated to decentralized governance, allowing members to actively participate in shaping the project’s future. However, navigating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) can be challenging, leading to reduced engagement. To address this issue, a comprehensive suite of PIVX DAO tutorials was created, aiming to empower the community and promote active participation in the DAO. <br>Let’s explore the significance of these tutorials and their impact on the PIVX community.</p><p>Voter apathy can hinder the effectiveness of any DAO, including PIVX. The tutorials will educate community members on launching proposals, voting, and tracking progress. The objective is to enhance the community’s understanding and knowledge of the DAO, creating a more inclusive, engaged, and empowered PIVX community.</p><p>The tutorial series comprises of six videos, each focusing on a crucial aspect of participating in PIVX’s decentralized governance. These videos will provide clear instructions on creating proposals, voting, and tracking their progress.</p><p>The topics covered include:** <br>1- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkJcWK0iMaM&amp;t=1s">Introduction</a> <br>2-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0Lx2VJSJlg"> Setting up a PIVX Wallet</a><br>3- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HL7sLovu6A">How to launch a pre-proposal</a><br>4 -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3G7y6Jjcq0">How to launch a proposal on chain</a><br>5 -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVrT2lg8UDI">Monitoring your proposal</a><br>6 <a href="https://youtu.be/MujGHHmT0cE?si=aCNvtQqESRxlGNUv">-How to promote your&nbsp;proposal</a></p><p>The tutorial videos are hosted on<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PIVXCrypto"> PIVX’s YouTube</a>&nbsp;channel.</p><p>The PIVX DAO tutorials aim to bridge the knowledge gap, increase voter participation, and attract new members to the community. By providing educational materials, these tutorials will empower the PIVX community to actively contribute to the project’s future.</p><p>PIVX community would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Crypto_SI">CryptoSi</a>, host of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@smartreach5326">SmartReach </a>and DAOWatch for creating these&nbsp;videos.</p><p>** Please note, as each Video goes live, the YouTube links will be added to the list of topics above for easy search and viewing purposes.

  Partnering with Co:Helm: The Co-Pilot for Health Care  <p>Abdel, Zahid and their team are giving clinicians a second set of hands—and fixing one of the biggest pain points for patients.</p>   
	By George Robson	 



Published September 11, 2023
  



Co:Helm co-founders Zahid Mahmood and Abdel Mahmoud.



 
<p>When your doctor orders a scan, prescribes a new medication, or tells you you need a surgery, you usually want to move as quickly as possible. But you also want to know it will be paid for, which for many patients in the U.S. means first getting your insurance company to sign off. In this “prior authorization” process, the insurer’s clinicians review your medical records—often a massive amount of different kinds of information, from test results to doctors notes, PDFs to imaging files—and compare them with a set of care guidelines to make a decision.</p>



<p>It is a time-consuming, manual process—and not just for the insurance company’s doctors and nurses, but for those on the provider side, as well, who sometimes spend hours responding to requests when they would otherwise be treating patients. Meanwhile, those patients have to wait for even the simplest approvals; in some cases, care is delayed as much as a month. And the problem is not just about speed, but also cost: <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/administrative-simplification-how-to-save-a-quarter-trillion-dollars-in-US-healthcare">One-quarter</a>, or $950 billion, of U.S. health care spending goes to administrative expenses, with as much as <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/briefs/administrative-waste-excess-health-spending?mkt_tok=ODUwLVRBQS01MTEAAAGHYLsgjXQJM8WofOYcJiWvqPptP5gxpsCn6iLacQY0QFcMunVE7Y0NWxKxNGRbiKYlHrnsLYiy0pwKPYQlNV7gki8eZRyyUMGkmpbleRKZUPxa">$570 billion</a> lost to inefficiencies that don’t improve patient outcomes.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia have seen again and again, across industries, that AI can be a powerful tool for solving just such challenges. But in this case, the trouble has been that while people with expertise in health care or AI are relatively easy to find, people with both are quite rare.</p>



<p>Luckily for us, though, <a href="https://www.co-helm.com/">Co:Helm</a> co-founders Abdel Mahmoud and Zahid Mahmood applied to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Born in Libya, Abdel came to the U.K. as a refugee at 8 years old. By 15, he had his own software business—and by 18, he had joined the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he became the youngest infantry officer in the U.K. Then Abdel became a doctor. He loved helping patients, but grew frustrated with the mountains of paperwork that kept him from spending more time with them, and eventually left medicine, returning to University College London for a master’s in computer science and going on to work in product at Facebook and Google.</p>



<p>Zahid, too, founded a company as a teenager—the first of his now-four founder journeys. He started the other two as side projects during a successful run as a software engineer building payment platforms for large insurance companies, which gave him deep expertise in the industry. He and Abdel became friends at UCL, and now they are teaming up to give doctors and nurses the extra set of hands that Abdel, when he was treating patients, always wished he had.</p>



<p>Co:Helm is an LLM-powered co-pilot for administration, handling all the work that comes before the clinical decision-making. Where it might take a nurse several hours to track down, organize and summarize hundreds of pages of records they need, Co:Helm can do it in seconds, allowing clinicians to increase their output tenfold and focus on what matters most: helping patients.</p>



<p>With partners including one of the top U.S. health plan administrators, Abdel, Zahid and their team will soon be making a difference for millions of patients, and the waitlist is growing quickly. We are proud to lead this seed round and help them hit the gas pedal as they <a href="https://www.co-helm.com/p/careers">hire</a> across engineering, sales and GTM, and regulatory roles. And while they are starting with prior authorization, there is a long list of pain points Co:Helm will ultimately be able to address, from case management to underwriting and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fixing these problems will take grit, imagination, and both high IQ and EQ—but as we’ve seen ever since meeting Abdel and Zahid, those are defining qualities of the Co:Helm team. Throughout Arc, they also proved themselves to be great students: humble, eager for feedback, and serious about continuously improving their product. They have truly been a joy to work with, and we look forward to the joy of helping them build better health care.</p>

 Feature: Secrets, and how to prove them — a magician’s guide to zero knowledge proofs <p>with Michael Blau</p><p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic (or so science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke famously said). One such area of sci-fi-like progress is that of <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/zero-knowledge-canon/">zero-knowledge</a> proofs (or ZKPs), a cryptographic tool that addresses two critical challenges in web3: scalability, and privacy. In particular, ZKPs could be the key to unlocking lower transaction fees and designing new privacy-preserving applications — ushering in many more crypto users. But beyond crypto, ZKPs can also help transmit sensitive data securely, combat illicit finance through <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/privacy-protecting-regulatory-solutions-using-zero-knowledge-proofs-full-paper/">privacy-preserving regulatory solutions</a>, and fight <a href="https://medium.com/@boneh/using-zk-proofs-to-fight-disinformation-17e7d57fe52f">disinformation</a>. </p><p>But what are ZKPs, really? There are many clever explanations out there, but even with the wealth of analogies available — from Waldo to Ali Baba’s Cave — it’s not easy to find an accurate, easy-to-grasp explanation of zero-knowledge proofs. Especially one that fully captures their superpowers, including for those who aren’t cryptography researchers or engineers.</p><p>So in this post and special demo, a16z crypto partner Michael Blau combines his background in magic with his work in crypto to explore a new analogy for demystifying ZKPs: a magic trick. Magic tricks, and magicians hiding secrets, can serve as a helpful mental model for understanding the key properties of ZKPs. Which makes sense, since zero-knowledge proofs in practice are indistinguishable from magic…  </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/a-magicians-guide-to-zero-knowledge-proofs/">read more/ watch here</a><br>share: on <a href="https://twitter.com/blauyourmind/status/1700175388557885828">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0xb8bff3">Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/a16zcrypto_magic-tricks-are-zero-knowledge-proofs-activity-7105942084783636480-sKAY">LinkedIn</a></p> Resource: ‘Back to school’ special playlists  The latest in crypto research  <p>Tim Roughgarden</p><p>With the goal of advancing the science and technology of the next generation of the internet, last year we <a href="https://a16z.com/announcing-a16z-crypto-research/">introduced</a> a16z crypto research — a new kind of multidisciplinary lab dedicated to helping shape crypto and web3 as a formal area of study. One of our goals was to help bridge the worlds of academic theory with industry practice, and one of the ways we do so (besides working with our portfolio and publishing our own work) is by bringing together the very best research talent across disciplines relevant to the space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, we’ve now hosted two immersive summer programs at the a16z crypto office — where we invite both established and emerging researchers to present their work and ideas, collaborate on some of the hardest problems in the ecosystem, and sharpen each other’s ideas by spending time with one another. You can watch many of the seminars (and listen in on our in-room conversations!) from summer 2022 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQ9HCQMu_8yPGgfvsscHgt1w1KJkx8BN">here</a>, and from fall 2022/ spring 2023 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQ9HCQMu_8yyzwwop1pq0MGCHC-WRC6B">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we’re releasing new talks <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/introducing-our-summer-23-research-seminars/">from the latest summer 2023</a> program &amp; cohort. The initial drop included talks from a16z crypto research partners Joe Bonneau on distributed randomness beacons and Lera Nikolaenko on distributed data storage; as well as talks from Matt Green (Johns Hopkins) on “going beyond zero knowledge: next steps for compliance and constrained encryption on blockchains”; Sarah Meiklejohn (University College London, Google) on distributed key generation; and Ittai Abraham (Intel Labs, former VMWare; also <a href="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/">Decentralized Thoughts</a> blog) on “it’s all about trust”. The second drop, themed “<a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1696632783194718451">cryptography week</a>”, features talks from Dan Boneh (Stanford, a16z crypto); Elaine Shu (CMU); Foteini Baldimitsi (GMU); and Ron Rothblum (Technion), <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1696632783194718451">here</a>.

There are 3 main types of secrets most people have to hold for online access:</p>  <p>Passwords — which people use to access various websites and services. These must not only be kept secret, but be unique from service to service.</p>  <p>TOTP codes — which are often generated by an authenticator app or TOTP (time-based one time password) system. These provide two-factor authentication, where a second layer of security (hence the “two”, and “multi-” if more layers) helps protect access.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Seed phrases — “mnemonic” codes or recovery phrases that give direct control of all crypto wallets derived from that seed phrase. This reflects one of the empowering features of crypto wallets: Once you enter your seed phrase, you have total control of your assets without needing to move them from one custodian to another.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Note, these “secrets” aren’t all specific to crypto/ web3; anyone using the internet today should be using these practices (or something custom tailored for their needs)! And while our recommendation would be to harden everything to the maximum extent possible, the practical reality is that purchasing hardware wallets, webauthn keys, and machines with TEEs isn’t easy to do for most people (at least, not yet). Furthermore, losing secrets can sometimes be a greater risk than having them compromised: some information, once lost, can’t ever be found.&nbsp;</p><p>So one could consider this a “minimal viable security” approach. That minimum setup — using things many people already have — would be to use a well-vetted password manager to store your seed phrases and passwords; and a TOTP app on your phone to store and use TOTP codes for 2FA (two-factor authentication). Here’s more on why and how:</p><p>Do NOT use text messages on your phone (SMS) as a second factor for authentication. SMS is a very weak choice for 2FA, given <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208">the rise</a> of SIM swapping/ jacking: where a hacker pretends to be you to your mobile provider (“I lost my phone and need help accessing it…”); then reroutes your phone number to their device; and then can then access any accounts linked to that phone. That’s why we recommend using authenticator apps (like Authy, Google Authenticator, etc.). Not all services allow two-factor authentication, unfortunately; so you should still make sure you’re using strong, unique passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Store your passwords in a password manager. This is mostly to make having unique passwords for all internet services possible; otherwise most people default to reusing passwords across sites. A password manager secures each online account with a unique, complex password — and uses one strong “master password” to encrypt all the stored passwords (see for example <a href="https://1passwordstatic.com/files/security/1password-white-paper.pdf">1Password</a>, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-security-white-paper/">Bitwarden</a>, or <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/download/whitepaper-en.pdf">Dashlane</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Your master password should be at least 16 characters — preferably a randomly generated passphrase of at least 5 words, which is usually around 30 characters, but easier to remember. This is not an arbitrary recommendation; the GPU costs for computers to guess passwords by brute force <a href="https://support.1password.com/pbkdf2/">goes up exponentially</a> the more characters and words there are in a password. That’s why longer is better. Finally: Never forget the master password! If you have to, you can write down a password hint with pen and paper, store that in the safest place you can think of, and remember where it is.</p><p>Store an encrypted copy of your backup codes/ TOTP in cloud storage, and print them out in a secure hard safe. But what about storing your TOTP codes in a password manager? Some password managers do support this, but it is better to use two different applications so that both security “factors” — password, and TOTP — remain separated. So then where should you store seed phrases? While the answer is a bit more complicated, the short answer is: in your password manager. (If you have a crypto wallet with a lot of assets in it, consider a more complex scheme; otherwise, this approach should work for most).</p><p>related:</p>  <p>📑 <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/wallet-security-non-custodial-fallacy/">Wallet security: the ‘non-custodial’ fallacy</a> (with Nassim Eddequiouaq &amp; Riyaz Faizullabhoy)</p>  <p>🎧 <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/crypto-web3-security-bridge-hacks-wallet-hacks-nomad-slope-MomCe42_">Bridge hack, wallet hack</a> (with Matt Gleason)</p>  <p>☑️ <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/12/16-steps-secure-you/">16 steps to securing your data, and life</a> (a16z)</p>  <p><br>-- Sonal Chokshi and a16z crypto teams</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6db3e133-2c70-4dbb-bb2a-d5ad55d3c1fa_550x69.png">   </a> <p><br>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

<p>Social media revolves around content creation, and while the content itself could be tokenised through NFTs, SocialFi aims to take it a step further. The recently released friend.tech app went to show that users might be interested in something more than just content - creator shares. This implicitly links back to handles and profiles, and we can slowly start to unveil the primitives of social media. Lens Protocol predates the friend.tech venture, in both timeline, as well as scope. While social media became synonymous with monopolistic central entities, Lens Protocol aims to build the decentralised bedrock for Web3’s social layer. These primitives would not only be interoperable with any Web3 application, but they would redefine content creation, feed generation and monetisation.</p><p>We were joined by Stani Kulechov, founder of Lens Protocol &amp; Aave, to discuss decentralised social graphs and how to leverage smart contracts to build the primitives for Web3's social layer.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The vision behind Lens  Lens V2 and smart contract capabilities  Social media development platform  Defining the Web3 social media primitive  Feed generation algorithm on Lens  Integrating on-chain and off-chain infrastructure  The tragedy of the commons in decentralised social media  Can a public good architecture also accommodate private goods?

 Smart contract privacy without the brain&nbsp;damage <p>Aztec’s architecture is a departure from the current trend in blockchains of horizontal scaling via more general-purpose EVM-compatible execution environments. At Aztec Labs we joke we’re the first protocol not to build a&nbsp;zkEVM.</p><p>Instead, we are focused on one thing: becoming the ultimate destination for developers who understand and need smart contract&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>We are building a network and set of tools that gives developers everything they need to build privacy-first apps&nbsp;with:</p>  Anonymity by&nbsp;default  Private state read/write functionality  Private smart contract function execution  <p>In this piece you’ll learn why privacy on account-based systems like the EVM doesn’t really work, why Aztec therefore isn’t EVM-compatible, and how Aztec makes dealing with the unique architecture of private state environments as intuitive as possible for smart contracts developers used to EVM-like environments.</p> Why do this at&nbsp;all? <p>Since day 1, Aztec Labs has pursued smart contract privacy: private compute that doesn’t rely on trusted third parties or trusted hardware security&nbsp;modules.</p><p>And in a world with fully on-chain smart contract privacy, private state has to be a first-class citizen.</p><p>That means no EVM, no Solidity, and no account-based blockchain architecture, all of which are privacy-leaking.</p> Privacy isn’t EVM-compatible <p>Now you might find yourself asking, “Wait, why doesn’t the EVM support privacy?” And in fact there have been Solidity smart contracts that run on the EVM and provide primitive, non-programmable privacy functionality like&nbsp;mixing.</p><p>But we’re not talking about&nbsp;that.</p><p>We’re talking about smart contract privacy — an entire system that incorporates programmable privacy within the contract itself — at the level of state variables and functions.</p><p>In Ethereum’s model, state variables are stored in a public account-based tree, and to edit one of those variables you need to broadcast to the world exactly which leaves of the tree you’d like to edit, what they contain, and how you’d like to edit&nbsp;them.</p><p>This has some drawbacks.</p>  The current and historic values of every state variable are&nbsp;public  The functions invoked to execute state changes are&nbsp;public  The state variables modified by those functions are&nbsp;public  <p>Et cetera.</p> UTXO’s and nullifiers, name a more iconic&nbsp;duo <p>Instead of this nakedly public way of doing things, Aztec relies on an encrypted UTXO (Unspent Transaction Object) data architecture — the same technology Bitcoin uses to store network&nbsp;state.</p><p>The foundation of Aztec’s privacy design is an append-only data tree containing encrypted UTXO’s and another data tree containing their nullifiers. And we owe the original UTXO-nullifier design to the pioneers who created the ZCash protocol.</p><p>UTXO’s are also referred to as “notes,” and we’ll refer to them as such for the rest of the&nbsp;piece.</p><blockquote>For a layman’s explanation of our UTXO architecture, see <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/fully-confidential-ethereum-transactions-aztec-networks-privacy-architecture-274f968b13d4">this&nbsp;post</a>.</blockquote><p>In order to manipulate an owned note (which as a reminder are encrypted UTXO objects), users take the following steps:</p>  A function is&nbsp;called  The function requests an edit to a private&nbsp;state  The function asks the user’s note database for all notes belonging to that private&nbsp;state  The user (in reality the user’s Aztec node) proves on their local machine that each of the retrieved notes exists as a leaf in the tree machine without revealing which&nbsp;leaf  The user does an action: read, change, or delete values inside the&nbsp;note  The user furnishes a nullifier, which prevents duplicate action and prevents the user from reading the same leaf ever&nbsp;again  The user inserts a new leaf, containing a new value, as a way of updating the private state’s&nbsp;value   A short history&nbsp;lesson <p>You can trace our obsession with notes back to our initial desire for smart contract&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>And one of the things “smart contract privacy” requires is hidden function&nbsp;inputs.</p><p>We started with zkSNARKs, which allow us to hide function&nbsp;inputs.</p><p>We then built Noir, an intuitive, open-source universal ZK language for writing functions whose inputs can be hidden. But Noir doesn’t have a built-in notion of state storage and state variables.</p><p>So now, we’re introducing a smart contract framework that creates state variable structs on top of&nbsp;Noir.</p> Let variables be variables! <p>So to have privacy, you need private state, and for private state you need private state variables.</p><p>But what are private state variables? Well they can’t be&nbsp;notes.</p><p>Notes stores data or information, and when combined with nullifiers they can preserve privacy, but notes are constant and immutable.</p><p>Variables are variable! They can be modified by the functions of a contract. So how can we create the concept of a private state variable using notes as a building&nbsp;block?</p><p>Well, as we saw above, notes can be destroyed and created. To create the abstraction of a private state variable, maybe we can cleverly destroy and create notes behind the&nbsp;scenes.</p><p>That’s exactly what Aztec does: declare a named private state variable, then write functions which read current state, edit that state, and write the updated state at the&nbsp;end.</p><p>Behind the scenes, these private state variable structs are figuring&nbsp;out:</p>  which notes they need to gather as leaves in the private state&nbsp;tree  which notes they need to prove existence of in the&nbsp;tree  which notes they need to&nbsp;nullify  any new notes that need to be created and inserted into the&nbsp;tree  <p>But to a developer, the variables just look like variables.</p> Private token contract&nbsp;example <p>To be less abstract, let’s think about the bread and butter of blockchain: a private token contract. The first thing a dev would wish to declare is a private_balance state variable.</p><p>Aztec allows a dev to declare a private_balance state variable, and then modify the balance in a transfer function.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the private_state struct that’s been exposed can figure out how to create and destroy notes in a way that represents adding-to or subtracting-from a user’s balance, all while not leaking that user’s balance (by emitting nullifiers from the function).</p><p>You can represent anything as a private state variable:</p>  Values: an object with a value and owner field, like a banknote / $100&nbsp;bill  NFTs: an object with a unique identifier, or that contains all the unique attributes of an&nbsp;NFT  Accounts: an object owned by one or many&nbsp;owners  and more! Votes, DeFi positions, identity objects, and anything else you can dream&nbsp;of  <p>Private state variables store data or information, and can be programmed with two useful properties:</p>  They can be mutable (updateable) or immutable (non-updateable); and  They can either comprise a single note (be a singleton) or comprise a group of notes describing a state variable (in this case a type of private state variable called a&nbsp;set)  <p>It’s important to note (!) that notes are just used to store information, and don’t store functions or contracts. We will cover private and public execution in a future&nbsp;piece.</p><p>In case you can’t tell, managing UTXO’s would normally be a little bit complicated, and involves a few “gotchas” including how&nbsp;to:</p>  Search the tree for one’s own notes efficiently  Combine notes  Make change from combined&nbsp;notes  Destroy and update notes with nullifiers  <p>Unlike Ethereum accounts, which can simply be credited and debited, notes have to be created, combined, and nullified, which represents a distinctly different mental model. And where Ethereum values are just that — values — notes contain&nbsp;values.</p><p>Luckily, we at Aztec Labs have designed Aztec as a network with abstraction in mind. Our aim is to eliminate these difficulties and make writing Aztec smart contracts as similar to writing Ethereum smart contracts as possible.</p><p>Finally, while one of the benefits of our architecture is helping smart contract developers manage note complexity, one of the primary goals of this design is to abstract notes entirely from&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>Application developers rejoice! You’ll never have to think about UTXOs or notes at all, instead being able to call functions you would expect, like token.transfer(amount) or token.getBalance().</p><p>Passed around specific notes in an application would be extremely painful, and our smart contract framework helps abstract that completely from the dApp&nbsp;layer.</p><p>In the next post, we’ll cover Aztec’s smart contract framework and how it assists developers in managing private&nbsp;notes.</p> Start learning Noir&nbsp;today <p>Aztec Labs is a core contributor to <a href="https://noir-lang.org/">Noir</a>, the universal language of zero knowledge. We’re building an Aztec smart contract framework on top of Noir that extends its functionality beyond zk circuit writing language and toward private smart contracts.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter">Get started with Noir</a>, <a href="https://noir-lang.org/">read the docs</a>, and get ahead of learning the prerequisites for building on&nbsp;Aztec.</blockquote> Jump into the conversation <p>The Aztec Labs team is committed to building our privacy technology publicly. Bringing a fully decentralized L2 with smart contract privacy to market means there is plenty of debate about network&nbsp;design.</p><blockquote>Join the conversation at <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network">discourse.aztec.network</a> and participate in the design of Aztec’s network and economics.</blockquote> Join our&nbsp;team <p>Aztec Labs is on the lookout for talented engineers, cryptographers, and business people to accelerate our vision of encrypted Ethereum.</p><blockquote>If joining our mission to bring scalable privacy to Ethereum excites you, <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec">check out our open&nbsp;roles</a>.</blockquote><p>And continue the conversation with us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/privacy-abstraction-with-aztec-def9da73eb5">Privacy Abstraction with Aztec</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In November 2024, the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/reaching-consensus/">current Zcash development fund</a> will expire. Conversations about a new dev fund have begun, and community sentiment seems to favor changes regarding who receives Zcash issuance and how much issuance they receive. There’s little support for carrying over the current structure into a new dev fund, and there is a vocal minority who advocates against any new dev fund.</p>



<p>A little over a month ago, I gave <a href="https://youtu.be/Cy0rwBhlv10?si=2MvzjDRK2qTt8FRz">a presentation</a> at Zcon4, the annual conference hosted by the independent Zcash Foundation, about the importance of the Zcash dev fund and why it’s Zcash’s superpower. I made the argument that every decision is about balancing trade-offs and that the community needs to consider this in structuring funding and governance.</p>



<p>For context, here’s a common view of how Zcash community funding works today: 80 percent of Zcash issuance is distributed to miners, while 20 percent is devoted to Zcash development funding. Importantly, 8 percent of the total block reward (or about 40 percent of the current dev fund) goes into the Zcash Community Grants organization, which exclusively funds independent third-party developers. ECC (through the Bootstrap org) receives 7 percent of the total rewards, and the remaining 5 percent goes to the Zcash Foundation.</p>







<p>While this view of funding and governance is accurate, there are alternate views that are also accurate.&nbsp;</p>



 Tradeoffs in the current dev fund structure 



<blockquote>
<p>“There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.”</p>
Thomas Sowell</blockquote>



<p>The Zcash Community Grants organization actually receives its funding through the Zcash Foundation; it doesn’t receive funds directly. It was set up this way for good reasons (mainly, creating a wholly new and separate entity is expensive), and Exhibit B represents this flow of money.&nbsp;</p>







<p>In <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014">ZIP 1014</a>, the community stipulated that the Zcash Foundation must not interfere with Zcash Community Grants’s decisions, and both the Zcash Foundation and Zcash Community Grants should be commended on their financial transparency. In a majority of cases, this structure in which money flows through the Zcash Foundation to the ZCG to independent developers and teams is just fine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the tradeoff is that the Zcash Foundation is beholden to US laws* which means that any organization or team that is downstream of the Zcash Foundation is also constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my Zcon4 presentation, I highlighted two recent examples of the real-life implications of this structure.</p>



 
 In 2022, a person living in Iran who goes by Bitcoin Buddy applied for a grant to become a Zcash ambassador. They wrote about living under a theocratic dictatorship and incompetent kleptocracy that inflicts poverty and allows women to be attacked in the streets. Their goal was to tell their community about Zcash and frame it as an alternative or an “escape” from the oppressive Iran ruling regime. I suspect Zcash Community Grants would have liked to fund Bitcoin Buddy, but it couldn’t because its money flows through the Zcash Foundation, which is based in the US, is subject to the laws of the US, and would find its nonprofit status at jeopardy by funding a person or project in Iran. 



 In another example, a team of engineers who wished to remain anonymous applied for funding to build and implement new code on Zcash. However, because the team refused to give information like names and home addresses, a US KYC (Know Your Customer) requirement, its application was rejected. 
 



<p>If these scenarios alone don’t demonstrate the need for changes in a “Dev Fund 2,” consider that ECC, the organization I lead, is also based in the US and subject to the laws of the US, which means that all dev fund monies are constrained by the laws of a single government and regulatory framework.</p>







<p>It’s worth noting that miners, who receive 80% of all Zcash issuance, live outside the control of the US government and are not bound by rules on how they use that issuance.</p>



 A metric for Zcash sustainability and resilience 



<p>One useful way to address trade-offs is to look at a metric: the number of independent and sustainable organizations that support Zcash.</p>



<p>Exhibit A shows us that the number is three: ECC, Zcash Foundation, and Zcash Community Grants. Exhibit B illustrates that there are only two, and Exhibit C suggests that all of these organizations are consolidated and beholden to one entity, the US government. (I don’t count miners as supporters of Zcash because, to my knowledge, none of the large commercial miners do anything to improve Zcash. And in fact, most sell it at the end of each day to buy Bitcoin.)</p>



<p>There’s an ineluctable trade-off between independence and accountability. For any circle in these illustrations, you can choose independence or accountability, but only one attribute, not both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Exhibit B, for example, the Zcash Foundation serves a valuable role, which is that it holds Zcash Community Grants accountable to its charge. But because it’s downstream of the Zcash Foundation, Zcash Community Grants isn’t actually independent.</p>



<p>At the blockchain level you can create accountability by the community as a whole adding and removing recipients of a dev fund, but below the blockchain level independence and accountability are a trade-off.</p>



 Failure modes 



<p>As a security engineer, I really like thinking about failure modes. In Exhibit D, I break them into four categories.</p>







<p>The first two failure modes, external and internal attacks, are pretty self-explanatory. Either could have a huge impact and even cause catastrophic failure of a project. US policy appears to be lining up against crypto as an industry, but for now, I still categorize these failure modes as “rare.”</p>



<p>Category 3, however, is common. Sadly, two-thirds of everyone who sets out to do anything never quite finishes, because success requires a mix of vision, timing, talent, and luck. When designing governance, we must be aware of and protect against a simple law of the universe: No matter how well-intentioned and skilled a person or team appears to be, there’s a not-insignificant chance they will fail to live up to expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last failure mode, Category 4, is 100% likely. Every person and every group of people is a special interest with differing motivations, differing blindspots, and differing values and perspectives. Systems of governance must be resilient enough to produce good results in spite of this universal law.</p>



 Designing the next Zcash dev fund 



<p>Even with guaranteed failure modes and complex tradeoffs, it’s possible to design a governance system that increases the sustainability and resilience of Zcash.<br></p>



<p>As I said at Zcon4, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” The next dev fund the Zcash community implements needs to (1)&nbsp; include more, independent teams than the current iteration, and (2) at least one of those teams should be headquartered outside the US.</p>







<p>No governance model is perfect, but my opinion is that these two recommendations will foster lasting benefits for Zcashers and the future of Zcash. I have extremely high confidence in the voice of the community, and I’m looking forward to continuing this conversation into 2024 and beyond!</p>



<p>*The Zcash Foundation recently announced that it has begun the process of setting up an operational nonprofit entity in the Cayman Islands, so that’s excellent news!</p>

  Crucible Moments: The Pivotal Decisions That Define Us  <p></p>   
	By Roelof Botha	 



Published September 7, 2023
  



 
<p>In 2012, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noticed something strange. The GPUs his company was producing for gaming consoles and computer graphics were starting to pop up in research labs and academic circles. Machine learning computations that had been taking weeks to complete shrunk to hours when run on Nvidia processors. There were no commercial applications for this technology—but Jensen saw a far-off opportunity and pounced, leading what he calls a “wholesale pivot” to reorient Nvidia toward enabling AI. Most saw this as profoundly risky. It took a full decade, until ChatGPT launched in 2022, to comprehend the magnitude of Jensen’s audacious decision.</p>



<p>This is what we at Sequoia call a crucible moment—an inflection point where a choice you make today has an outsized bearing on your trajectory for years or even decades. Crucible moments define companies. They also shape our careers and lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can identify a handful of decisions that disproportionately influenced the trajectory of my life. I grew up in South Africa. The country’s history cast a shadow, and I always felt that the innovation pushing the world forward—which I longed to be a part of—was happening elsewhere. Leaving my home, where I had deep roots, and setting off for the unknown in California was unnerving and lonely. It was full of risk. But it was also full of promise. Embracing uncertainty and moving to the heart of Silicon Valley just as the internet was taking off in the late 1990s profoundly altered the course of my life.</p>



<p>I faced another crucible moment soon after arriving in California for business school. A currency collapse in South Africa in 1998 wiped out my savings. I had a stark choice to make. I could rejoin McKinsey (where I’d worked briefly in South Africa), which generously offered to pay for my education. Instead, I was drawn toward a scrappy startup I’d met that was facilitating payments over the nascent internet. The company was burning cash and had offered me a scant salary to work part-time while finishing my degree. But it was building a magical product with transformational potential. It wasn’t the obvious choice, but I joined PayPal—and once again my life changed course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Sequoia, we have had the privilege of partnering early with many of the most iconic founders of the past half-century. Time and again, we’ve seen how their willingness to make bold decisions in crucible moments—to optimize for long-term impact over short-term wins—is what enables them to build legendary companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes these moments are proactive, like Jensen pivoting to AI long before its time. Sometimes external factors create a forcing function for transformational change. A powerful example is Brian Chesky radically repositioning Airbnb through the pandemic. Airbnb’s revenue plunged 80% as lockdowns took hold—just as the company was preparing for an IPO. Less than two years later, after doubling down on its community and adapting its product for long-term stays, Airbnb went public at a valuation double its initial plan. That’s the impact of a crucible moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crucible moments typically don’t announce themselves. They can sneak up on you. I believe learning to recognize them and having the courage to act decisively—even when it requires defying conventional wisdom—is the single biggest determinant of sustained success.</p>



<p>Following through on the initial insight often requires making painful changes. You may discover you need a new set of capabilities on your team—or that capabilities you’ve toiled to build no longer serve you. In every case, navigating a crucible moment requires conviction and the grit to overcome naysayers, near-term obstacles, and the possibility of failure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For over 50 years, Sequoia has faced its own crucible moments. When I joined in 2003, the scars of the 2000 dot-com crash remained fresh. Most firms had afforded themselves a “mulligan,” telling LPs that funds raised in the lead-up to the crash had been written off. Sequoia chose to do the opposite. We forfeited fees and reinvested proceeds until the funds yielded gains for our LPs. The decision established a defining principle that we would not let our clients lose money and helped crystallize core values of performance and stewardship that still guide us today.</p>



<p>More recently, we have made foundational changes: we established the Sequoia Capital Fund, an innovative open-ended structure designed to weather short-term market fluctuations in order to attain the best long-term performance. The trust we earned with LPs following the dot-com crash and our continued performance allowed us to pioneer this approach. And in early 2023, after 15 years of growing leading firms under the Sequoia banner in China and India, we collectively decided to become fully independent partnerships across all five business units. Separating was not an obvious choice given each unit’s success—and yet it was the right decision for enduring impact in the coming decades.</p>



<p>Recognizing the opportunities and risks inherent to crucible moments is core to how we work with founders. Each company will face a unique set of pivotal decisions that shapes their trajectory, and we spend most of our time helping identify and navigate them. Occasionally, we convene our companies to help them see around corners when seismic shifts create a crucible moment for everyone—as we did in the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, at the start of pandemic in 2020, and early in the 2022 market correction.</p>



<p>Most recently, we convened founders at our AI Ascent event in March, 2023 to call attention to the collective crucible moment we all currently face. The era of low-cost capital and easy fundraising has ended; meanwhile, an era of unprecedented innovation potential and productivity growth driven by AI is just beginning. The convergence of these factors requires us to adapt. How we do will define the next decade. Careers will be made. Companies will be formed that change how we live, work and play.</p>



<p>We created our new podcast series, Crucible Moments, to offer a window into this mindset and this critical aspect of company-building. Legendary founders like Max Levchin of PayPal, Jack Dorsey of Block, Jensen Huang of Nvidia, Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe, Brian Chesky of Airbnb and Julia Hartz of Eventbrite will bring you inside their decision-making and reveal how they navigated the crucible moments that shaped their journeys. Jensen will break down that pivotal pursuit of AI; you’ll learn how Airbnb navigated the pandemic to emerge stronger, and much more.</p>



<p>At Sequoia, we help the daring build legendary companies from idea to IPO and beyond. We hope this series will prove useful and inspiring to a new generation of ambitious founders—and anyone curious for a new perspective on how to navigate the most important decisions you face when the answers are unclear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market#:~:text=Report%20Overview,13.4%25%20from%202023%20to%202030.">gaming market set to grow at 13.4% yearly until 2030</a>, gaming is bigger than ever. And in a digital era marked by blockchain innovation, GameFi emerges as a game-changer, blending gaming with Web3 technologies. This article sheds light on what GameFi is, explaining its core elements, the exciting opportunities it offers players and publishers, and the complex challenges it faces.</p>



<p>GameFi isn’t just a passing trend; it’s a dynamic system that lets players earn while they play, provides publishers with new ways to make money, and creates special communities. But it also needs to deal with tricky issues like regulations, market ups and downs, and security concerns. As GameFi continues to evolve, it’s not just changing how we see gaming; it’s a symbol of the resilience and innovation of our digital world. The future of gaming has arrived, and GameFi is leading the way, ready to transform the gaming industry in ways we are only beginning to understand.</p>



 What is GameFi?  



<p>At its core, GameFi represents the usage of novel web3 aspects in traditional games, referring to things like changes in ownership of in-game assets as well as changes in reward mechanisms.</p>



<p>Some of the key components of GameFi include play-to-earn models as well as tokenised assets, both of which we will explain below to give you a better understanding of what GameFi is about.</p>



 Play-to-earn models 



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/play-to-earn-business-models-games/">Play-to-earn models</a> are models for games in which players get rewarded for playing the game. These rewards can then be exchanged for real money (or cryptocurrencies).</p>



<p>In contrast to traditional gaming models such as pay-to-play or free-to-play models, where players either purchase the game upfront or invest money for in-game benefits, play-to-earn models harness the power of blockchain technology to establish an entirely new dynamic. While pay-to-play and free-to-play models have effectively catered to gamers’ preferences for years, the introduction of play-to-earn models represents a shift in how players perceive their gaming experience and their potential to make money while gaming.</p>



<p>Play-to-earn models approach this differently and compensate players for their time spent in the game. This compensation usually happens in the form of digital assets, both in the form of ‘regular’ tokens as well as non-fungible tokens. Players can also receive certain rewards for reaching specific milestones, achievements, levels, etc. After a player receives these rewards, they can either use them again in the game or sell them on a marketplace.</p>



<p>All in all, this kind of model provides a greater incentive for the players to continue playing, and it allows game publishers to push players in certain directions by changing the reward structure.</p>



 Tokenised assets  



<p>Closely related to these play-to-earn models are <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/tokenisation/">tokenised assets</a>. In a GameFi context, tokenised assets are actually the same as regular in-game assets, with the only difference being that instead of the game developers controlling the assets, the user controls the asset.</p>



<p>And this opens up a whole barrage of options. First of all, when players purchase in-game assets, their financial investment doesn’t simply disappear within the gaming ecosystem. Instead, they can sell or trade these items outside the game environment, linking their tokenised assets to real-world financial opportunities. While platforms like Steam currently allow the sale of in-game assets, these transactions are limited to the platform’s ecosystem. Tokenised assets have the potential to break down these barriers, offering a more versatile and user-friendly solution.</p>



<p>Secondly, tokenised assets empower players with greater influence over the in-game economy. Traditionally, game economies are subject to the control of developers. While this dynamic still holds true to some extent in play-to-earn games, players are gaining a voice in determining the value and significance of different aspects of the game, including specific items or features.</p>



<p>Thirdly, by tokenising assets, game developers can hand out limited in-game assets more transparently and easily. Blockchain technology can prove the scarcity of the items, adding more trust and also making it easy to verify the authenticity of in-game items in marketplaces and inventories.</p>



<p>These tokenised assets are key to play-to-earn models, as well as to GameFi as a whole.</p>



<a href="https://alienworlds.io/"></a><a href="https://alienworlds.io/">Alien Worlds</a> is one of the largest GameFi games in the world in terms of transaction volume.



 Opportunities of GameFi 



<p>There are a variety of opportunities opened up by GameFi, ranging from new ways to make money for both players and game publishers to the opportunity to create new kinds of exclusive communities. Let’s dive into each of these below!</p>



 Earn money while playing  



<p>GameFi offers gamers a unique chance to turn their favourite pastime into a potentially lucrative venture. Unlike traditional gaming, where the fun is its own reward, GameFi lets players earn real money while they enjoy virtual adventures. This shift is exemplified by play-to-earn models, which allow players to collect valuable in-game items and cryptocurrencies as they play.</p>



<p>Another fascinating aspect of this is the creation of limited special items. Game developers can use blockchain tech to make unique, scarce digital goods that players can get through in-game achievements or events. These limited items create a buzz, making players compete to get them, and they often become valuable assets that can be sold for profit on secondary markets. Furthermore, they can be used by game developers to incentivise player behaviour or to generate hype around certain events.</p>



 Secondary market fees for publishers 



<p>For game publishers, GameFi opens up a new way to make money through secondary market fees. As players actively trade and sell tokenised in-game items on external marketplaces, publishers can charge small fees for each transaction. These fees, although tiny individually, add up significantly as more and more trades happen within the game’s ecosystem.</p>



<p>These secondary market fees offer publishers a steady income source that goes beyond the traditional game purchase or in-game purchases model. This consistent revenue stream enables publishers to invest more in game development, enhancing the overall gaming experience and attracting a wider audience.</p>



<p>The secondary market also creates a lively ecosystem, encouraging players to actively participate in trading and investing in virtual assets. This dynamic player-driven economy enhances the game’s long-term appeal.</p>



 Exclusive communities  



<p>Another benefit of GameFi is the ability to create exclusive communities within gaming ecosystems. As players accumulate achievements, assets, and more, they become part of a unique group of individuals who share similar experiences or possess similar skills and/or items. These communities can be built around the shared ownership of rare in-game items, achievements, and a mutual interest in exploring the possibilities of GameFi.</p>



<p>These exclusive communities offer several advantages. They enable players to verify and show off their in-game achievements and items transparently, thanks to blockchain technology. This transparency builds trust among players and makes it easy to confirm the authenticity of in-game items in marketplaces and player inventories.</p>



<p>Game developers can also use these exclusive communities to foster direct communication with their player base. This direct engagement allows for real-time feedback, which can be invaluable in shaping game development and ensuring a responsive and player-centric gaming experience.</p>



 Challenges of GameFi  



<p>As with any new technology, challenges are part of the adoption process. GameFi is no exception to this, so it is important to consider the following three challenges related to GameFi.</p>







 Regulatory issues 



<p>One of the foremost challenges facing GameFi is the ever-evolving landscape of regulatory frameworks. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are still grappling with how to classify cryptocurrencies, decentralised applications, and blockchain-based assets. This ambiguity can result in uncertain legal status and potential compliance challenges for GameFi projects.</p>



<p>Moreover, the integration of real-world financial incentives, such as cryptocurrencies, within gaming environments can raise concerns about consumer protection, taxation, and money laundering. Navigating these complex regulatory waters requires a delicate balance between innovation and adherence to evolving legal standards, making it essential for games using GameFi components to stay informed and proactive in addressing regulatory challenges.</p>



 Market volatility 



<p>GameFi’s reliance on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology also exposes it to the inherent volatility of these markets. The value of cryptocurrencies can experience rapid fluctuations, impacting the real-world value of in-game assets and player earnings. Players and developers alike must grapple with the potential for sudden wealth fluctuations, which can pose financial risks and affect the overall stability of the GameFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>These fluctuations in prices of both cryptocurrencies and assets related to the game can heavily influence interest, player behaviour, and overall sentiment. To mitigate these challenges, developers may need to implement strategies like stablecoin integration or token stabilisation mechanisms within their games. Such measures can help shield players from extreme volatility while maintaining the economic incentives that make GameFi appealing.</p>



 Security concerns  



<p>As GameFi relies heavily on blockchain technology, the security of smart contracts, wallets, and decentralised applications becomes paramount. Malicious actors are constantly probing for vulnerabilities and exploits, and the financial aspect of GameFi makes this even more appealing. Incidents like hacks, exploits, or scams can erode player trust and confidence in the platform.</p>



<p>It is key to invest in robust security measures, including rigorous code audits, multi-layer authentication protocols, and secure wallet integrations. Additionally, educating players about safe practices in handling cryptocurrencies and in-game assets can help protect them from potential security breaches. After all, you decide for yourself how secure you store your assets.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>This month, we completed Stage 0 of our v1 testnet, launched Testnet Stage 1, saw the DAO put across two crucial improvement proposals (one of them forming a solid alliance!), and expanded the information available in the Panther-verse.</p><p>Let’s recap everything that happened in August.</p> Tech Updates  Stage 0 is complete, but the Miner will keep going! <p>We are proud to announce that Stage 0 of the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-announcement-panthers-testnet-is-going-live-on-july-10th/">v1 Testnet</a> was successful! We're thrilled by the engagement we registered during it, and invite you to be a part of the journey towards Panther’s v1 launch.</p><p>Importantly, the Miner will continue working during the whole Testnet, with rewards not exhausted yet. However, browser mining has been discontinued, and only the desktop version will remain available.</p><p>Here’s, so far, how mining testing is going:</p>Mining Testnet results. v1 Testnet: Stage 1 Stage 1 is LIVE!<p>After a successful <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage0-live/">Stage 0</a>, we are debuting <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet</a>. At this stage, you’ll test two of Panther’s very anticipated innovations: third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts.</p><p>Stage 1 is public and will have dedicated rewards. Differently from Stage 0, users are rewarded for completing the product flow. However, we encourage the community to try to find and submit bugs, as well as to provide feedback. This process ensures that the Testnet returns a bug-free protocol, ultimately improving our product and its users’ experience. Furthermore, it works only on desktops, and not mobile devices. </p><p>At this stage, you’ll be testing two features that allow Panther to combine privacy-preserving DeFi access with compliance capabilities:</p>  <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/third-party-compliance-integrations?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Third-party compliance integrations</a>  <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/panther-accounts?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Accounts</a>  <p>Users can visit the Testnet link for Stage 1 <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">in the info repository on our docs</a> to test the onboarding functionality. This involves creating a Panther Account, undergoing a simple verification process (name and email required, ID NOT required) with PureFi, and activating their Account. </p>Stage 1 of Testing showcases our first-ever third-party integration: PureFi!<p>To share feedback, testers will be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a dedicated form</a> as the only accepted procedure. The steps mentioned in the form’s description are needed to make this interaction both efficient and productive.</p> v1 Testnet documentation <p>Our Testnet documentation page will compile all the relevant links and info as our Testnet release progresses. This will guide users through our Testnet's development, ensuring easy access to the latest updates, key milestones, and important information. </p><p>Click here to view the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">v1 Testnet page</a> on our docs.</p>This chart containing all relevant Testnet information will be updated as our Testnet release progresses. Panther’s compliance integrations <p>We recently shared an in-depth article on <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">Panther's compliance integrations</a>. These integrations are a major milestone for the protocol and will be tested at Stage 1 of Panther's Testnet!</p>Panther’s privacy-preserving compliance integrations.<p>Panther recognizes the need for a robust solution that safeguards privacy and also ensures compliance with regulatory standards. This keeps malicious actors away from the protocol while adhering to &nbsp;the Web3 ethos of decentralization and anonymity.</p><p>The Panther team and DAO have meticulously discussed ways to address this challenge, with ongoing conversations around regulatory best practices. As a result, we’ve designed an approach to bring compliance to the protocol while retaining neutrality.</p><p>Within Panther's solution, compliance providers need to be able to process users' data without the protocol learning it, proving a user's ownership of their wallet and giving them a zero-knowledge proof attesting to the validity of their statements. This allows users to access Panther while maintaining the protocol's neutrality.</p><p>Panther's strategy hinges on three core components:</p><p>1) Third-party compliance vendor integrations, maintaining neutrality and decentralization.</p><p>2) Panther accounts (zAccounts), creating a ZK bridge between verification and privacy.</p><p>3) Zones, logical partitions within Shielded Pools.</p><p>This article sheds light on Panther's simple yet elegant solution to the privacy-compliance paradox, adding yet another innovative feature to Panther’s groundbreaking solution.

This makes PureFi the first issuer of compliance credentials for Panther Protocol, and brings us closer to Panther's ultimate goal of creating a cross-chain architecture that allows users to access DeFi without exposing their data or activity. </p><p>PIP-17 also marks a significant step towards Panther v1 by enabling secure and compliant DeFi.</p>PIP-17 - Compliance Vendor Integration Ecosystem  And yes, we’re integrating PureFi! <p>Panther welcomes PureFi as the protocol’s first compliance vendor.</p><p>PureFi has gained recognition in the Web3 space for its innovative use of verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proofs in a decentralized manner.</p><p>The protocol aims to become a one-stop decentralized compliance solution that onboards institutional money to DeFi. To achieve this, PureFi has focused on implementing zero-knowledge and self-sovereign identity (SSI) technologies.</p><p>The Panther community has been discussing compliance-related topics <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/t/regulatory-compliance/90/22?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">on the Panther forum</a> for the past few months. During this discussion, multiple compliance vendors have been mentioned, and through <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x454f67e23b7f38f65b837a3c97233f467967fcb304e8c2826e3ab9b5fee97d35">PIP-17</a>, PureFi was proposed as the best solution for Panther Protocol based on, but not limited to, the following criteria:</p>  Decentralization.  Protocol-level integrations.  On-chain support for ZK-compatible attestations and signatures.  Fees paid (in $ZKP) on-chain by the protocol, enabling further utility for our token.  <p>As such, this integration will be of great importance as we progress towards Panther v1. Panther’s compliance integrations and PureFi’s flow can already be tested at Panther’s Testnet Stage 1. </p><p>In time, we’ll publish a blog post with all the details about the integration, which are also found at <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x454f67e23b7f38f65b837a3c97233f467967fcb304e8c2826e3ab9b5fee97d35">PIP-17</a>.</p> Events  ParisDOT conference <p>At <a href="https://twitter.com/Paris_Dot_Comm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ParisDOT Conference</a>, our Co-Founder Anish Mohammed shared his expertise on Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) during a panel with <a href="https://twitter.com/hydra_dx?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">HydraDX</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/paritytech?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Parity Tech</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/BifrostFinance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Bifrost Finance</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/DIAdata_org?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIA</a>! </p><p>Take a deep dive into this exciting DeFi trend:</p> Media  Router Protocol interview <p>Co-founder Anish Mohammed also participated in a Twitter Spaces organized by<a href="https://twitter.com/routerprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Router Protocol</a> to discuss Panther.

 About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>The maximal extractable value (MEV) problem, if left unchecked, could represent an existential threat to Ethereum’s core values. One might argue that it is a natural result of solving market inefficiencies, but it entices to centralisation and collusion in order to extract the highest amount of value. Additionally, through front-running and back-running, it creates unnecessary overhead, which caused up to 2.4% of the total network congestion back in DeFi summer of 2020 (according to Flashbots’ research). As current infrastructure cannot eliminate MEV altogether, Flashbots and other research groups have tried to come up with solutions to address its aftermath.</p><p>We were joined by Stephane Gosselin, co-founder of Flashbots and Frontier Research, to discuss the MEV landscape, what research breakthroughs have been recorded and how they impact DevEx and UX.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Reflecting on ‘Frontrunning the MEV crisis’  Decentralising the MEV ‘supply chain’  The vision behind Frontier Research  Request-for-Quotation (RFQ) explained  Block building  Uniswap X and how it might impact LPs &amp; block building  Decentralising block building  Proposer-builder separation (PBS)  MEV burn  How MEV influenced different applications’ UX   Intents  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/thegostep">Stephane Gosselin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://frontier.tech/">Frontier Research</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FrontierDotTech">Frontier Research on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Brian Fabian Crain &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p>7 years of experience building blockchain communities. Privacy advocate. Previously at Oasis&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Alyssa (Aztec): Hey Meredith! So the idea of this interview is to get a sense of your career path, your role at Aztec, and what you’re excited about as a new member of our commercial team!</p><p>Can you start by sharing your web2 background and how it helped lead you to&nbsp;web3?</p><blockquote>Hi there, and yes! I was previously working in real estate, and funny enough I was an Assistant Leasing Manager for ~7 apartment complexes here in Baton Rouge. In a way, I was “Community Manager” — doing marketing and other leasing&nbsp;work.</blockquote><blockquote>I wanted to start investing, but wasn’t exactly sure about what to invest in. I started doing copious amounts of research and stumbled upon crypto. I had heard of it like most people, had seen it in the news, and just generally heard all the crazy stories about how crypto was being used back in those days. This was around 2016, and I was young and&nbsp;excited.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: How about what falling down the web3 rabbit hole looked like for&nbsp;you?</p><blockquote>It took me a while to piece together what a smart contract or protocol was, and why these systems made sense for this transparent blockchain context as opposed to what we have in web2 — where everything is off-chain and we don’t have much control or flexibility.</blockquote><blockquote>Once I really started understanding what this technology meant for the future of society, for my children, I was inspired. I was working full time, mom of two, and staying up until 2:00 or 3:00am every single night on Reddit, on Facebook groups, on Twitter. Learning everything that I could — reading white papers. Since then, I’ve remained extremely passionate and&nbsp;curious.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: How do you feel about the industry’s evolution over the past ~8&nbsp;years?</p><blockquote>Of course there’ve been periods when I’ve been disappointed in the industry, and seen the exact behaviors that we wanted to avoid from the traditional finance sector/web2 world replicated in this space that I saw as a shining&nbsp;beacon.</blockquote><blockquote>But I’ve really enjoyed most of it, and now I’ve reached a point where I fully acknowledge that things are shifting rapidly, and people are going to make mistakes. Web3 is a place where we can learn and improve together.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Why did you decide to join&nbsp;Aztec?</p><blockquote>I’m super passionate about privacy in general. I was previously working at another privacy project called <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis</a>. And before that, I did work for <a href="https://pivx.org/">PIVX</a> — also centered around privacy. This has been a major theme in my excitement about what blockchain means.</blockquote><blockquote>There’s this public side of things which is great. But to expand these really cool use cases, some degree of privacy is needed. Having more control over our privacy is an opportunity in&nbsp;web3.</blockquote><blockquote>I’ve been super passionate about projects that are building in this direction and I became involved with the <a href="https://privacyalliance.com/">Universal Privacy Alliance</a> (UPA). That’s how I got Aztec-pilled.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Would love to hear more about how you got Aztec-pilled, what did connecting with the project and team look&nbsp;like?</p><blockquote>I was already very impressed with Aztec when <a href="https://twitter.com/Blulinski">Bruno</a> and I had the opportunity to work on an ETHDenver event together - it was a mini-summit that I organized with about seven other members of the&nbsp;UPA.</blockquote><blockquote>While we were in Denver, I went to the Aztec meetup and got to chat with some of the other teammates. I felt synergy as it was clear to me that this team cared about doing things the right way, not the easy&nbsp;way.</blockquote><blockquote>I’ve always wanted to serve a community actively working towards putting privacy tools in the hands of developers, so that privacy can be leveraged by everyone else. In my core, I want to make sure that I’m a part of that privacy piece, specifically. This is why joining Aztec — where we’re paving the way to programmable privacy — made sense for&nbsp;me.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: What are you focused on as Developer Advocate and what do you enjoy most about the role? Would be great to hear more about your work right&nbsp;now.</p><blockquote>Yea! The title Developer Advocate is a new one for me. I’ve had many different ones, and in web3 we’re often required to wear many&nbsp;hats.</blockquote><blockquote>I’ve been a Community Lead, Social Media Strategist, and Marketing Manager. I’ve also had plenty of different hybrid roles across the projects I’ve been fortunate to be involved&nbsp;with.</blockquote><blockquote>As a Developer Advocate, I believe my core responsibility is to speak up for developers and make sure their feedback is being heard by the internal Aztec&nbsp;team…</blockquote><blockquote>…and also educate developers about what we’re building. We accomplish this through Discord, community events, 1:1 meetings, diving into GitHub — looking far beneath the surface of what people say to try to piece together: Where are we lacking? How can we improve? And conveying that to our&nbsp;team.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: What does a robust, healthy developer community for a project like ours look like? What does it have and what does it need to&nbsp;have?</p><blockquote>We can learn from a book that Bruno recommended to me when I first started at Aztec, it’s called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Producing-Open-Source-Software-Successful/dp/0596007590">Producing Open Source Software</a>. When you look at how this book outlines everything that matters for an open source software project, including building the community, you can learn a&nbsp;lot.</blockquote><blockquote>First of all, you want to have a place where people can openly and freely contribute in a way that make sense for them — not putting the barrier too high on how people can get involved, or the time commitment. If they want to tinker with Noir or Aztec for 30–45 minutes a week — they’re still welcomed in our community. We leave expectations at the&nbsp;door.</blockquote><blockquote>For any developers engaged with our community, of course we want to provide a supportive environment that includes educational content, tooling, funding, listening to their feedback, and connecting them with fellow devs. Also seeding inspiration/ideas.</blockquote><blockquote>If you have a developer community where people feel like they belong, heard, and accepted, that’s&nbsp;key.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Wow, it’s really inspiring to hear you talk about&nbsp;it.</p><p>And what about beyond web3? Just general interests and maybe hobbies. Are they pretty tech focused given you work in blockhain?</p><blockquote>I’m a big time reader. I’ve read 39 books this year, and I’m working on a couple more. It’s my little escape — I read a mix of fiction and non-fiction to balance&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m learning how to garden as well. I live in the south so I’ve been growing okra, peas, tomatoes, and carrots. My garden is flourishing, so I’m happy about&nbsp;that!</blockquote><blockquote>I also very much enjoy cooking, taking care of my family — that’s not necessarily a hobby but definitely my primary interest…taking care of my 3 kiddos and teaching&nbsp;them.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m hoping to foster in them a curiosity about life, so a lot of my newer interests overlap with the stuff they want to&nbsp;do!</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Aw, I bet. That’s awesome. Anything else you want to share? How can people keep up with&nbsp;you?</p><blockquote>Anyone who’s interested in building on Aztec and/or using Noir, don’t be afraid to reach out. Don’t let what is a seemingly steep learning curve deter you from getting your feet&nbsp;wet.</blockquote><blockquote>If anyone is interested in building with us or just joining our developer community, and wants to learn about the resources available, they can reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/merfymerf">Twitter</a> (@merfymerf), on Telegram (@Meredithdarden), via email (meredith@aztecprotocol.com) — all are&nbsp;fine.</blockquote><blockquote>The link to join our Discord server can be found in the <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/">docs</a>, I’m in there as well. I’d love to help out however I&nbsp;can.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Amazing. Thank you so&nbsp;much.</p><blockquote>Thank you!</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/q-a-with-aztec-developer-advocate-meredith-darden-70abe4ca2140">Q&amp;A with Aztec Developer Advocate, Meredith Darden</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As humans age the chances of dying from specific diseases (cancer, coronary, neurological, etc.) increase, where the rate of aging is controlled by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. Although the hallmarks of aging (including several cellular and molecular processes such as genomic instability, telomere attrition, stem cell exhaustion etc.) have been a major focus of research for many decades, the scientific pathways behind reversing aging are complex and remain elusive. Recently several approaches to cell rejuvenation have been based on partial cellular reprogramming (demonstrating that reprogramming cells to pluripotency can reverse age-related cell phenotypes), although there are still many challenges when trying to reprogram cells including the loss of somatic identity&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Clock.Bio is taking a new approach to cellular reprogramming in order to develop novel, anti-ageing therapeutics and drugs with technology developed at Cambridge University. Their initial goal is to identify the entire set of rejuvenation programs in human cells. They will leverage Bit.Bio’s opti-ox technology to screen for rejuvenation biology and identify repair mechanisms that can reverse the hallmarks of aging. In addition to opti-ox the company leverages tools such as CRISPR/a to modulate genes and combinations of genes, attempting to understand the full biology of reversal of&nbsp;aging.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Aging is core to many human ailments and by reversing aging we can potentially cure age related conditions. By leaning on Bit.Bio’s opti-ox technology and by tapping into the company’s screening, synbio stack and customer relationships, Clock.Bio will be able to accelerate data collection and conduct relevant anti-ageing screens, giving them a head start in the race for anti aging solutions. Ultimately we believe that by screening for therapeutic leads (existing and novel small molecules, cell and gene therapies, etc.) and creating specific rejuvenation effects on cells, Clock.Bio are well positioned to bring a number of antiaging assets into the&nbsp;clinic.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the entire Clock.bio team on their longevity mission to extend healthspan by 20 years or even more. Read more about the company’s pre-seed round <a href="https://endpts.com/exclusive-bit-bio-founder-launches-new-startup-clock-bio-to-find-drugs-that-increase-healthspan-by-20-years/">here</a> as well as their white paper&nbsp;<a href="https://mark-kotter.medium.com/a-white-paper-for-rejuvenation-therapies-and-blueprint-for-clock-bio-29a52d375059">here</a>.</p>

<p>Progress for Private&nbsp;Voting</p><p>Private voting is the “real-world” default, and for good reason!

TL;DR:</p>  Is it possible to build a voting system on Ethereum that’s user-friendly, trustless, fair, weighed, and ballot-secret? Yes,&nbsp;very!  If these properties can’t all be met at the same time, which of them are incompatible, and why? All of them can be&nbsp;met.  What is needed to make the full combination of properties available to the Nouns community? Present our findings to date + bring TBD multisig and vote aggregation solutions to production.  <p>You can review the <a href="https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/noir-trie-proofs/">code</a> and <a href="https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html">general report</a> for AZKR’s early roadmap for what is currently called zk-POPVOTE (zk Proof-based On-chain Private Voting), which is a continuation of the project we’ve started together.</p><blockquote>🐦 Join the Twitter Spaces we’ll host on September 5th at 12:00 UTC&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YpJkgBvQgYJj">here</a></blockquote><p>At Aztec Labs, we will continue contributing to the development of the <a href="https://aztec.network/noir">Noir</a> programming language, and we look forward to building privacy-preserving infrastructure to empower private governance.</p> Resource List   <a href="https://research.aragon.org/nouns-tech.html">Read the technical report</a>.  <a href="https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html">Read the general&nbsp;report</a>.  <a href="https://blog.aragon.org/announcing-a-proof-of-concept-for-private-voting-in-nouns-dao/">Read Aragon’s announcement blog</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/noir-trie-proofs/">Check out the code in&nbsp;GitHub.</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1YpJkgBvQgYJj">Join the Twitter Space</a> on September 5th at 12:00&nbsp;UTC.  <a href="https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter">Get started with Noir</a> — the universal language of&nbsp;ZK.

<p>As a followup to our <a>February blog post regarding the changes to Brave Rewards</a>, today we are announcing the expected vBAT sunset deadline: October 31, 2023.</p>
<p>If you’re a Brave Rewards user without a custodial account connected, soon you will see vBAT-related notices appear across the Brave Rewards interface that look like this:</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Users in unsupported regions will still have the option to contribute their vBAT balances to <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Verified Creators</a> of their choice before the deadline.  For a refresher, see <a>our original blog post</a>.</p>

 Update on supported regions 
<p>As promised, we’ve been working with our custodial account provider partners to widen regional support for Brave Rewards before saying goodbye to vBAT. Since the announcement in February, we’ve been able to re-enable support for the following regions:</p>
 
 Croatia 
 Greece 
 Slovakia 
 Slovenia 
 Taiwan&nbsp; 
 
<p>You can find the latest <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/6539887971469">list of supported regions for each custodial account provider here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re delighted to confirm that users in India with vBAT will soon be able to connect an account from one of our new custodial partners to Brave Rewards, allowing them to redeem their balances for BAT before the deadline. More information to come!</p>
<p>If you have any questions, join us on the <a href="https://community.brave.com">Brave Community forums</a>.</p>

From the tension between centralization vs. decentralization and the role of platforms in power, we also talk about the importance of financial freedom and American innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/payments-bitcoin-crypto-decentralization-platforms">listen here</a><br>share <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1694008498580021696">on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x8480c8">on Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7099761028321705984">on LinkedIn</a></p> 💎 Resource: On ‘protodanksharding’, ‘danksharding’, and ‘data availability sampling’ … in 30(ish) minutes <p>Valeria Nikolaenko</p><p>In just 36 minutes, a16z crypto research partner Valeria Nikolaenko describes and explains protodanksharding, danksharding, data availability sampling, rollups (how they work, types)… all of which are important for future upgrades to Ethereum, and for understanding networking/ blockchain scalability. Nikolaenko also highlights some of the best data availability schemes so that others can improve on them, incorporate those ideas into their own projects, or do further research.

So she covers the process of pitching from start to finish — before making a deck, before the pitch, during the pitch, and following up after — including especially how to craft a narrative for your product and team. Why is this a big market/ vision/ opportunity? Why are you the right team to bring it to market? And what is the one question Simpson likes to ask every founder? (Hint: the answer will be the key theme throughout your pitch).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/JL0zM7MkDpI?si=Ttx8bQEazrxunSMd">watch this video</a> &nbsp;<br><a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1692693948433608882">share</a></p> 🌐 Trend: On stateless blockchains <p>Miranda Christ and Joe Bonneau</p><p>As blockchains grow to support more users and more frequent transactions, so too grows the amount of information (the “state”) that validators have to store to verify transactions. For example: in Bitcoin, the state consists of a set of unspent transaction outputs; while in Ethereum, the state consists of an account balance for each account, as well as code and storage for each smart contract. These storage burdens will become unwieldy as blockchains grow (given enough accounts or everyday transactions), making it difficult to become a validator — posing a potential threat to decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s tempting to turn to cryptography as a solution — where tools such as Merkle trees and zero-knowledge proofs have previously helped us achieve the implausible — to create “stateless” blockchains, they remain far from practical despite substantial research (e.g., <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1188">Boneh et al</a>, <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal">Buterin</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/599">Srinivasan et al</a>, <a href="https://petertodd.org/2016/delayed-txo-commitments">Todd</a>). In fact, argue the authors of this piece (including a16z crypto research intern &amp; PhD student Christ), stateless blockchains won’t ever be feasible without additional measures to manage the state. But such “impossibility results” shouldn’t be discouraging, because they can direct researchers and builders to pursue more fruitful paths…</p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/on-the-impossibility-of-stateless-blockchains/">read the post</a> “On the impossibility of stateless blockchains”&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/UGcfTkZbjAw?si=rpL-hXcQcDVhNJHd">watch the video</a> “On limits on revocable proof systems, with implications for blockchains”</p>  <p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1478">check out the full paper</a> “Limits on revocable proof systems, with applications to stateless blockchains”</p>  <p>share on <a href="https://twitter.com/miranda__christ/status/1694735693463826856">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0xa76b82">on Farcaster</a></p>   🗞️ News &amp; moves: IRS guidance on staking; crypto &amp; banks; more <p>Our ongoing <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/regulatory-updates-roundups-recaps">regulatory updates</a> — as curated by the a16z crypto regulatory team — cover news, guidance, legislation, and frameworks released by agencies, associations, governments, banks, and other entities around the world as they impact the crypto industry in terms of regulation and policy.

<p>Panther community,</p><p>After a very successful Stage 0, today we are debuting Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet. At this Stage, you’ll test two of Panther’s very anticipated innovations: <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts</a>. </p><p>Stage 1 is public and will have dedicated rewards. It will work only on desktop, not mobile devices. Differently from Stage 0, users will be rewarded for completing the product flow. However, we encourage the community to try to find and submit bugs, as well as to provide feedback. This process ensures that the Testnet returns a bug-free protocol, ultimately improving the protocol and its users’ experience.</p><p>Let’s dive deep into Stage 1:</p><p>(Note: For this Stage, the Panther Miner used in Stage 0 will be shut off for two days. We’ll put out an announcement when it is back to activity).</p> Why Stage 1 matters <p>At this stage, you’ll be testing two features that allow Panther to combine privacy-preserving DeFi access with compliance capabilities:</p> Third-party compliance integrations <p>Panther has built a system that retains neutrality by plugging directly into compliance providers and integrating them into the application’s flow. These systems can capture certain types of user data and issue a zero-knowledge proof attesting that users have been verified without the protocol learning any information from them.</p><p>The Panther DAO has been commissioned to select a compliance vendor that aligns with its interests, a discussion taking place in <a href="http://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s forum</a>. For the sake of this Testing exercise, an integration has been built that uses <a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi’s</a> system. PureFi is a multi-vendor compliance provider that has demonstrated interest in partnering with Panther through the DAO discussions.</p><p>Registering using these integrations is a multi-step process that connects a user’s Panther Account with the verification performed by PureFi.</p><p>It consists of:<br><br>a. Creating a Panther Account by connecting your wallet (e.g., Metamask).<br>b. Undergoing a basic verification on PureFi’s site (opened in a pop-up tab).<br>c. Completing the verification process in the Panther dApp by providing the created proof of verification. This process involves downloading files on your browser (around 30MB), which can sometimes take 2-3 minutes (depending on IPFS’ responsivity at the time. In case of trouble, reloading may help.)</p><p>The above activates the user’s Panther account created in step (a) above, and issues account creation rewards to the user.</p> Panther Accounts <p>Within Panther, users are identified through their Panther Account (which has a corresponding zAddress), a concept similar to a bank account in that it englobes all of a user’s transactions within a single reference point. Accounts attest to users’ compliance verification while retaining zero-knowledge properties. In other words, they prove that a user has passed verification (as well as the type of verification passed), but they do not store any private information about users.</p><p>We posted an article further expanding on the rationale behind both of these components, as well as Panther’s compliance focus. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">Check it out here!</a></p> Testing and providing feedback <p>As we mentioned, Testnet rewards are automated, and as such, the Testnet itself will reward users for going through the Account creation flow. However, the goal for the Testnet is to debug and enhance the protocol before v1’s launch. </p><p>Our expectation is that users submit bugs and share ideas to enhance end-to-end functioning, interaction and usage of wallets, UI/UX flows, and let us know about any component that doesn’t look or feel as expected. We have created the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">spreadsheet</a> containing all the details that users can test, which includes functional and visual components. Note that every testing case is numbered to facilitate the process of providing feedback.</p><p>Spotting and fixing any possible bugs within the Testnet will make the first version of the protocol more sustainable in the middle term while allowing users to receive their earned rewards.</p> How to test <p>Users can visit the Testnet link for Stage 1 found <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">in the info repository on our docs</a> to test the onboarding functionality. This involves creating a Panther Account, undergoing a simple verification process (name and email required, ID NOT required) with PureFi, and activating their Account. We recommend that you test along with reviewing the testing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">spreadsheet</a> so that you can keep track of everything you need to test.</p><p>To share feedback, testers will be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a dedicated form</a> as the only accepted procedure. The steps mentioned in the form’s description are needed to make this interaction both efficient and productive.</p><p>Users will be rewarded with 100 $tzZKP (test $zZKP) sent to their wallet as soon as they complete the onboarding process and successfully activate their Panther account. tZKP tokens will be used to interact with the protocol during later stages. Interactions with the protocol also accrue rewards for users in the form of tPRP, which will be used in the second stage. As such, testers will receive 500 tPRP.</p><p>Remember that, to test, you will need to use the Mumbai Polygon Testnet. To use this network, you may also use a faucet (such as <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">this one</a>) to obtain test MATIC to pay for transactions.</p> Important note (do not skip this!) <p>It’s possible that, during testing, you might encounter a set of RPC errors derived from the Mumbai testnet network itself. These errors are due to infrastructural challenges and outside Panther’s control. <br><br>If at some point (such as while logging in or trying to switch networks) you encounter an error that prevents you from signing transactions (which might even cause your wallet extension to crash needing a browser or PC restart), please: </p>  Visit <a href="https://chainlist.org/chain/80001/to?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://chainlist.org/chain/80001/</a> to see a list of Mumbai network working nodes.  Identify a working node. Note that, since this is a Testnet product, privacy is non-essential.  Access your wallet’s Network settings, and edit the Mumbai network to use the working RPC’s server address.  If needed, change the Chain ID to “80001”.  Re-start the product flow.  <p>If the problem persists even after trying a new valid RPC, please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">the official form</a> to fill out a bug report.</p> Thank you for testing!<br> <p>The Panther community has done a great job testing Stage 0. We’re sure this will be a constant as we progress through the different stages of our Testnet leading up to v1. </p><p>We’re looking forward to receiving your feedback. If you have any further questions, please reach out through our official channels below!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases.

<p>Due to abnormal metabolism, certain diseased tissues, most notably solid tumors, produce an acidic extracellular microenvironment that is still little understood. Nevertheless, today all drugs in oncology are developed by R&amp;D teams using the same classic textbook definition of tumor acidity which leads to (among other issues) poor tumor targeting and specificity, resulting in a paradoxical situation: despite an increasing number of promising oncology treatments, most cancer therapeutics or chemotherapy agents still have significant toxicity issues and severe side effects, mainly due to off-target effects, ie. where drugs kill healthy&nbsp;cells.</p><p>The <a href="https://cytosolix.com/">Cytosolix</a> team has spearheaded a decade-long research program at the Engelman Lab at Yale that recently resulted in a paradigm shift in our understanding of tumor acidity by discovering that the tumor micro-environment is much more acidic than previously thought, opening up the possibility to create better acid-targeting cancer therapeutics. Based on this discovery, Cytosolix has developed a platform focused on small molecules, called TAP (tumor-activated permeability), and has developed a unique chemical library over the past decade as part of its goal to make order of magnitude better cancer therapeutics.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>In an era when a single blockbuster therapeutic for cancer can be worth billions of dollars in annual revenue, we believe Cytosolix’s TAP platform has the potential to be applied to nrealy all solid tumor targeting small molecules that are already approved and in development, meaning that Cytosolix could receive a part of the upside from a number of existing drugs if TAP is genuinely effective. Moreover, the company’s first oral lead small molecule has been shown to enhance in vivo biodistribution to tumor cells by several orders of magnitude, compared to the original drug, which could translate to a significant efficacy benefit and the company’s own best-in-class drug. Cytosolix will pursue several more candidates during the seed&nbsp;phase.</p><p>We look forward to joining <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinjohnfoster/">Colin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-deacon-cytosolix/">John</a> and the <a href="https://cytosolix.com/">Cytosolix</a> team on their&nbsp;journey.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, Cosmos set out to provide an alternative to the monolithic blockchain architecture proposed by Ethereum. Cosmos SDK was the cornerstone of this vision, as it allowed developers to spin up blockchains effortlessly. Its modularity enabled custom, self-sovereign chains to become a reality. And, instead of being a jack of all trades, those chains were centred around a sole purpose, thus transforming them into appchains. In turn, as the ecosystem grew, appchains had to be interoperable with one another, but this was already a core feature of Cosmos, via IBC. Before Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap, appchains were thought to be a much-needed scaling solution. However, with the advancements of zero knowledge technology, the Cosmos SDK now faces another set of challenges as it navigates the market demand for L2 scaling solutions.</p><p>We were joined by Marko Baricevic, Cosmos SDK product lead, to discuss the development philosophy behind the Cosmos Hub and how appchains evolved over time.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Marko’s background  Cosmos SDK’s history and high-level overview  Cosmos SDK modules and VMs  Ethereum’s &amp; Cosmos’ development philosophies  Cosmos SDK value prop and use cases  Cosmos SDK vs. other frameworks (e.g. Substrate)  Token value accrual and the fragmentation dilemma  Using the Cosmos SDK to build rollups  Cosmos SDK vs. Avalanche’s HyperSDK  Adoption of fraud proofs and validity proofs by the Cosmos SDK  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/mark0baricevic">Marko Baricevic on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmos">Cosmos on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmos_sdk">Cosmos SDK on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/interchain_io">Interchain Foundation on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/binary_builders">Binary Builders on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Meher Roy &amp; Felix Lutsch.

 Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) — Provable, Decentralized Cross-chain Communication  Written by Mike Toutonghi, lead developer of the Verus Protocol.  How it&nbsp;started <p>Bitcoin proved that decentralized, secure, permissionless and provable agreement on a worldwide blockchain network of participants is possible.</p> How it’s&nbsp;going <p>Beyond Bitcoin, most leading blockchain networks today were initially centralized through ICOs or large pre-mines, rather than a fairly launched protocol. In some cases, the ICO or pre-mined share of ownership was further entrenched by switching from proof of work, as a way for anyone to earn, to pure proof of stake, where owning the network currency is required to earn and those with the most earn the most. As part of prioritizing early growth to capture maximum crypto market share, these platforms generally abdicated the hard work of designing or implementing core protocol primitives, such as currencies or identities, beyond one native currency, as originally conceived in&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Instead, the popular VM model of many blockchains today, which generally provide a shared “computer” or VM on top of a decentralized blockchain, leaves building critical primitives as someone else’s problem, usually companies and app designers, basically writing centralized apps. Instead of a secure set of underlying rules for currencies, we get best practices and the evolutionary legacy of thousands of “dApps”, which ironically, are mostly just partial or full re-implementations of the secure primitives missing in the consensus-based L1 protocols themselves.</p><p>As a result of the focus on pumping and market capture vs. evolving what we could learn from Bitcoin with sustainable, decentralized, more secure primitives and better protocol design, billions of dollars of value has been lost or transferred from naive early users who bought into the pumped crypto hype to hackers, scammers, VCs, centralized exits, and MEV-exploiters who all leveraged the mass of weaknesses they either failed to protect against or in some cases created and obscured themselves on systems that don’t define or enforce even the most common core primitives, currencies or identities. A great deal of loss has been due to obviously poor cross-chain “bridge” design, with the most common problem being bugs in complex smart contract workflow, followed by stolen or compromised private keys of contract owners / controllers, and in some cases, outright theft by contract controllers.</p><p>The lack of agreement on basic primitives and how to represent them in a globally resolvable way has held back general, robust solutions to the fundamental problem of interoperability between blockchains and other financial networks today. To complicate our collective challenges, adding full primitive support in the protocols is hard work, especially in an industry where just a year of development is considered a massive investment that must be rewarded by timely exit liquidity. Consequently, an abundance of shortcuts and heavily marketed yet hastily built solutions still dominate the popular narrative, as hacks, rugpulls, and losses continue to pile&nbsp;up.</p> The solution <p>Verus was founded by technology veterans and others who believe humanity can do better than being exploited by the technology these same veterans had been building for corporations over decades. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed, built, and tested over more than 5 years by a self-selected and often volunteer group of technology, finance, legal, operations, or just life veterans and newbies alike. Early Verusians shared a common vision and made it reality, achieving a fairly launched, community driven project without VCs or ICO participants who may want to exit and a truly decentralized unlimited scale network that all humanity can use and build upon without paying rent to&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>It has taken exactly as long as it has to realize the vision laid out 5 years ago, which is more clearly relevant today than ever. Along the way, that vision has grown and evolved as new community members contributed their own vision to help us improve, making the Verus PBaaS protocol, of which VIP is a small part, a major milestone for the crypto industry and a move back to the original intent of decentralized networks that was pioneered, if not fully realized by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin. Verus has taken Nakamoto consensus to the next level with consensus driven functional protocols for network primitives that are needed in any network hoping to securely enable financial applications.</p><p>To ensure maximum decentralization, the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) takes a maximally decentralized, validator driven approach to its multi-network bridging by incorporating and accounting for currencies, identities, namespaces, and the concept of connected networks themselves in the L0 and L1 consensus protocols. The Verus Internet Protocol provides just enough structure to interoperate with any system that can control funds based on logic and exposes a provable representation of currencies and/or identities.</p><p>By grounding interoperability in a cryptographically provable, hierarchical namespace of self-sovereign, worldwide resolvable identities, VIP enables the first high-throughput, unlimited scale, decentralized, multi-protocol, non-custodial, auditable and transparent, currency and identity aware cross-blockchain communications protocol.</p> A cross-chain protocol with same chain properties <p>VIP can be seen as a cross-chain protocol that operates on proof of proof of consensus (PoPoC). VIP has the following properties:</p>  Transactions that include cross-chain operations, cross-system currency transfers, or new currency and identity definitions, are standardized in the protocol, as are the semantics of their cross-chain use, fee models, cross-system, name-centric provable routing, and MEV-resistant bundling and rollup properties. These characteristics can be and have been implemented on UTXO, VM-based, and transparently centralized networks.  VIP supports direct or indirect system&lt;-&gt;system communication, including cross-system export and import of currency and identity definitions, as well as revocation, recovery, and controlling keys. All cross-chain or DeFi functions in the protocol are accessible to full or lite node clients and applications by simply creating standard transaction inputs and outputs that specify the operations. Available APIs on every node or FOSS API server simplify the creation of transactions with cross-chain outputs in response to command requests or JSON RPC&nbsp;calls.  Transactions with Identity, DeFi, or cross-chain operations, including all inputs and outputs, even exports and imports of all currencies, are checked for validity by miners and stakers with network consensus, just as single currency inputs and outputs are in today’s single currency blockchain networks.  Cross-chain protocols operate in the same way as on-chain DeFi protocols and are processed on chain by miners and stakers with a bundle-&gt;export-&gt;import workflow, enabling high-throughput DeFi and cross-chain operations.  In PBaaS, exports, imports, and DeFi operations are all solved simultaneously and processed with at per-block or larger granularity in an MEV-resistant manner as part of the core protocol, recognizing and enabling the need for beneficial arbitrage, while eliminating toxic MEV such as front-running and sandwiching once and for&nbsp;all.  All cross-chain operations are proven based on one of the following proof models, which are configurable on a per system/chain basis:    Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness enhanced, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (auto-notarization)  Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (notary dependent notarization)  Semi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway&nbsp;proofs  <p>Full auto-notarization is only available between Verus and PBaaS chains, and operates faster with but is not dependent on notary witnesses. When auto-notarization is applied to other gateway connections, the protocol will fall back to the closest it can come between auto-notarization and notary dependent, which may evolve towards less dependence on the notaries in future versions. Whether you auto-notarize or depend on notary witness confirmation, all forms of notarization operate similarly. We’ll start with the basic workflow, then highlight differences:</p>  “Earned” and “Accepted” notarizations — VIP broadly defines two types of cross-system notarizations, earned and accepted.    Generally, one side of a connection will create “earned” notarizations, which on PBaaS chains or for the Ethereum bridge, are created by miners and stakers adding a notarization output to the coinbase. Earned notarizations, which can only be created by Verus or PBaaS chain miners and stakers, include a way to agree or disagree with specific past notarizations, and are subject to further “confirmation” rules, which may vary depending on if the rules are “auto”, centralized, or “notary confirm”.  Once a new, earned notarization is confirmed, the proof of confirmation is sent to the “notary” system, which is typically a launch chain, and in the case of the ETH bridge, is Ethereum, along with any notary signatures necessary to prove confirmation, which are typically present. The new, confirmed, earned notarization is entered on the notary chain as an “accepted” notarization, and is entered as “agreeing” with a prior accepted notarization along with proof of the agreement. If the prior accepted notarization it agrees with is not yet confirmed, then it may be considered newly confirmed.  <p>2. Once an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, alternating between PoW and PoS blocks to help further decentralized requirements for agreement, and by following all notarization rules, notary witnesses may sign signifying they agree with the notarization as well. Although they can disagree with a signature, no signature is also a valid way to disagree.</p><p>3. After validators and notary witnesses have agreed, or in the case of auto-notarization, a longer validation period with more agreement has passed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement, is confirmed. Once that happens, the blockchain is considered final up to the point of that confirmation and will resist reorganizations to any point&nbsp;behind.</p><p>The primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization. Most notably, “notary confirm” always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence in the face of randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs and disagreements. Fully centralized gateways still operate on cryptographic proofs, but they only need notaries to agree on the cryptographic roots in order to consider them true and do not need cryptographic proof to establish the notarization proof&nbsp;root.</p><p>Once a proof root has been established by notarization, this root is used to cryptographically prove bundles of transactions exported from one chain or system and imported to another. Even Ethereum transactions are proven in both directions using the same workflow, although Ethereum transactions are validated using <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">PATRICIA Trie</a> proofs, while PBaaS chains use the Verus <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range (MMR)</a> method, both being cryptographically sound. Cross-chain bundles of transactions follow the same bundling protocol when sourced from Verus or PBaaS chains as is followed in DeFi to prevent&nbsp;MEV.</p><p>Transactions are always delivered to the destination network with bundles in the order they were created on the source network and according to the enforceable rules of the source network. Since a relayer may add arbitrage transactions when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but may not affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle from one network to another, no restriction is placed on who relays a valid bundle of transactions. Since validators who relay and mine or stake transaction bundles into a block may earn a validation fee from the import transaction itself, validators or notaries will generally shuttle transaction bundles between chains and networks out of self interest, while having no ability whatsoever to censor or modify protocol level&nbsp;bundles.</p> What witness / notaries do NOT&nbsp;do <p>Witnesses / notaries have no control over what transactions are or are not included or the order in which they arrive from one system to another, as all of that is dictated by the protocol. By default, notaries cannot create notarizations and can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.</p><p>Witness notaries’ primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators’ earned notarizations, which are earned on one blockchain and accepted on another chain or system. As long as validators enter valid notarizations as part of the merge mining or staking process, confirm other notarizations entered by past validators, and a majority of notaries sign and witness their recognition of those events, a proof root that can be used by anyone to prove committed bundles of cross-chain transactions is established on both systems for the other. As the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform, which relies on the proof established in relation to a confirmed, notarized proof&nbsp;root.</p> Do auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations? <p>Yes. Proper planning and selection of options and witness ID structure during the launch of a blockchain network or gateway can ensure that security levels meet network demands. There are security tradeoffs between auto-notarization and notary-confirm options, which basically are a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, auto-notarization vs. a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses, which can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs, allowing for further decentralization, even while requiring participation of a&nbsp;quorum.</p><p>Determining which option to choose, how many and what notaries to choose, what other safeguards can further enhance security, and then understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices, is important when launching a blockchain or gateway. The following outlines the current high-level security considerations when configuring a new chain or&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>Currently, Verus VIP supports 2 proof models for interchain communication, the Verus PBaaS Merkle Mountain Range proofs, which also assume the Verus Proof of Power protocol, and Ethereum PATRICIA Trie proofs that enable interfacing with VIP between any PBaaS chain, and any Ethereum VM + PATRICIA Trie compatible network.</p><p>Since Verus PBaaS is the only interface to fully support notarization finalization using full auto-notarization, it is important to understand the differences between PBaaS and Ethereum proof protocols. At present, there is no objective proof protocol implementation for Ethereum that is known and implemented, which can operate without dependence on some set of notary witnesses. At this time, auto-notarization, when applied to Ethereum, is more similar to notary-confirm, with additional revocation safeguards that could address more edge-case threat&nbsp;models.</p><p>As new proof algorithms evolve for Ethereum, enabling trustworthy cross-chain proof models in both directions that are both timely and do not need to be backed by witness signatures, it will be possible to update the protocols to remove dependence on witnesses over time. To ensure maximum decentralization on the Ethereum bridge, the network itself can permissionlessly propose contract upgrades, and if affirmatively voted on by Verus validators, an upgrade and new contracts can eventually change the cross-chain proof conditions.</p><p>Auto-notarization of one PBaaS chain on another (PBAAS_AN) differs from and Ethereum interface or notary-confirm (NC) in that, if there are enough validated blocks, both mined and staked, as well as validator agreed notarizations, PBAAS_AN allows validators to finalize a notarization and submit it to the alternate chain. If there are disagreements about the correct notarization, the process becomes an on-chain proof competition, requiring each party to represent a growing, actual chain with both proof of work and proof of stake with an eventual winner. NC still has the miners and stakers create and earn from earned notarizations, but it also must have agreement from specified notaries to finalize any notarization and cannot finalize cross-chain proof roots without that agreement.</p> Improvement over common cross-chain protocols <p>Since Verus VIP does not ever have any identity, multisig or otherwise, hold custody over any funds when crossing from one decentralized network to another, even in the context of the Verus Ethereum contracts, threats caused by malicious notaries or stolen keys to drain funds on decentralized bridges or currencies are simply not viable against the Verus VIP protocol.</p><p>Cross-chain notarizations must first be entered by an earning validator, either PoW or PoS, and must also be agreed to by another validator, alternating between work and stake in eligibility. Only after that happens can notary witnesses apply their signature and agree to make that a confirmed notarization candidate. Still, what happens if a majority of notaries are malicious and colluding, or if some entity was able to somehow steal a majority of the notary private&nbsp;keys?</p><p>If the majority of notary witnesses are honest and operate their witnessing nodes according to the protocol, the security of such a model should be sufficient for any level of cross-chain transaction proof. If, however, a majority of the notaries were colluding and malicious or if their keys were stolen, Verus VIP still provides ways to ensure that the protocol responds to such a situation without risk of loss. Although there are ways to mitigate such a form of attack, even if no mitigation were available, such malicious or fraudulent notary witnesses would need the following in order to attack a PBaaS cross-chain connection:</p>  Colluding, malicious notaries  Fake validators with more combined hash + stake power than the publicly validated chain making earned notarizations  Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow&nbsp;chain  <p>While you may recognize these requirements as very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain, the Verus VIP protocol provides a way to even defend against such an unlikely scenario. VIP provides for revocation of all VerusIDs, including notary IDs, even those that are used for Ethereum protocol bridges. Furthermore, each PBaaS chain, including Verus, has a network agreed multisig chain oracle that can separately pause cross-chain notarizations or transactions temporarily, which also can be overridden by network validators.</p><p>To enable yet another layer of safeguards, the Verus VIP protocol does not confirm any notarization that has first been agreed to by validators, then agreed to and signed by all notaries on either the earned or the accepted chain, until a second such notarization confirms the first. This ensures that every notarization on any chain is first made public, given a period of time before confirmation, and finally, if nothing stops it, confirmed.</p><p>Meanwhile, with basic monitoring by witnesses to see if their own identities have signed for anything they do not actually agree with, meaning their keys were stolen, notaries can auto-revoke their own identities and prevent stolen key attacks from being anything more than an inconvenience. Additional monitoring by chain oracle controllers to look for clear discrepancies between soon to be confirmed notarizations and chains that they monitor can also use the oracle notification network to pause cross-chain transactions, providing yet another line of defense for each chain on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>While there are numerous capabilities and safeguards built into the Verus VIP protocol beyond those described in this document, by separating the proof root notarization process and using cryptographic proof as the foundation of a provable, high throughput, cross-chain export/import protocol, VIP enables the most secure, scalable, decentralized and multi-modal cross-chain protocol ever designed for blockchains and the Internet of&nbsp;Value.</p> Try the Verus Protocol Yourself! ✅ <p>Look up <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a> to use many API commands (e.g. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">launching currencies, tokens &amp; liquidity pools</a>).</p><p>Or look up the <a href="https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-02_verus_commands.md">complete command list&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Join the community.
