<p>The promise of airdrops rewarding early adopters and building vibrant Web3 communities has been undermined by a persistent, costly crisis: bot manipulation.</p><p>In recent years, bots and Sybil attacks have consistently hijacked airdrop campaigns, draining rewards from real users and eroding trust across the ecosystem.</p> The Airdrop Bot&nbsp;Crisis <p>Airdrops are intended to reward genuine engagement and foster decentralized communities. Most projects rely on heuristic filters (activity patterns, wallet age, transaction volume), manual reviews from centralized teams and multiple snapshots or social media&nbsp;checks.</p><p>These methods are not only opaque and error-prone, but also exclude real users and fail to reliably block bots, who constantly adapt and exploit loopholes. It&nbsp;causes:</p>  ❌ Bots and Sybil attacks Automated scripts create thousands of fake accounts, often claiming majority of airdrop allocations.  ❌ Real users lose out Bots outnumber real users by multiples, diluting rewards and undermining the value of community participation.  ❌ Failed anti-bot measures and community trust erodes Last-minute disqualifications and unclear eligibility criteria have become common, damaging project reputations and discouraging real engagement   Empeiria’s Solution: Verifiable Credentials (VCs) <p>Empeiria sets a new standard by making airdrop eligibility provable, transparent, and bot-proof through Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p><p>How it&nbsp;works?</p>  ✅ Every participant must obtain a cryptographically signed Verifiable Credential. By scanning a QR code in the Empe DID Wallet&nbsp;app.  ✅ No Verifiable Credential = no reward. No exceptions. This cryptographic proof cannot be faked or automated by&nbsp;bots.  ✅ Rules are enforced by code, not centralized teams. Once you hold a valid VC in your Empe Wallet, your reward is guaranteed — no last-minute exclusions or arbitrary cuts.  ✅ All qualifying actions are transparently recorded on-chain. Ensuring full auditability and fairness.   Empeiria’s On-Chain Testnet&nbsp;Airdrop <p>Since launching its testnet in April 2024, Empeiria’s Layer-1 blockchain has processed over 1,000,000 transactions and is secured by 150 top-tier validators. Recognized as a top 5 transformative crypto project by OKX and piloted with leading institutions.</p><p>Join Empeiria’s On-Chain Testnet Airdrop: <a href="https://docs.empe.io/user-guide/airdrop/on-chain-testnet-airdrop">docs.empe.io/user-guide/airdrop/on-chain-testnet-airdrop</a></p>

<p>In what could pass as a scene from a crime thriller, a British IT worker will be cooling off in jail for hacking his employer after being suspended.</p><p>It was in July 2022. The air crackled with tension as Mohammed Umar Taj faced suspension from his position. Within hours, resentment transformed into a digital weapon. He launched a calculated cyberattack against his employer, an unidentified firm with a global reach across the UK, Germany, and Bahrain. His mission was to cripple their operations by altering login credentials and sowing&nbsp;chaos.</p><p>The firm reeled. Daily activities ground to a halt, and the financial damage mounted, reaching a staggering £200,000 (approximately $275,000), not to mention the harm to their reputation. But Taj’s fury wasn’t&nbsp;sated.</p><p>The very next day, he escalated his assault, changing access credentials and multi-factor authentication, directly impacting the firm’s clients and creating a ripple effect of disruption that stretched far beyond the UK’s&nbsp;borders.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Taj, a digital breadcrumb trail was being laid. <a href="https://www.westyorkshire.police.uk/news-appeals/disgruntled-it-worker-jailed-cyber-attack-huddersfield">Investigators</a> from West Yorkshire Police’s cyber team meticulously pieced together the fragments of his attack. What they uncovered was chilling: Taj had not only recorded his malicious activities but had also brazenly discussed his digital assault in phone recordings.</p><p>The hammer of justice finally fell last week. Taj pleaded guilty to a Computer Misuse Act offense and was sentenced to seven months on June 26. But this is not an isolated case; it’s a modern-day fable, a chilling reminder that in the interconnected world, the human element remains the most unpredictable vulnerability, capable of wielding digital tools for destruction when trust is broken and anger takes hold.

 Focus: Enhancements Across Redeemer, PIVCards, and MyPIVXWallet for 6.0 Testnet Preparation <p>The PIVXLabs development team has been advancing multiple projects: Redeemer, PIVCards, and MyPIVXWallet (MPW), to ensure a robust and user-friendly ecosystem in preparation for the PIVX 6.0 testnet release. This report highlights the most significant updates in chronological order, focusing on key features like multi-account support and voting groups in MyPIVXWallet, alongside notable improvements in Redeemer and PIVCards.

<p>Before Panther’s recent successful <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/introducing-the-panther-limited-mainnet-beta/">Limited Mainnet Beta launch</a>, the Panther community tested the protocol components and functionalities through Panther’s testnet, which consisted of nine different testnet stages. We would like to extend our gratitude to all testers and their feedback, which helped us fulfill our mission of building tomorrow’s decentralized finance. Today, we share everything you need to know about the testnet airdrop and how you could claim your testnet rewards. Let´s dive in!</p> Panther’s testnet recap and reward allocation <p>For approximately one and a half years, testers tried out the protocol’s UTXO algorithm, reward mechanisms, relayers, swap functions, and more. In total, 1.7M $ZKP has been allocated to the testnet participants. Aside from stress-testing the infrastructure, the goal of the testnet was also to enhance the end-to-end functionality of the protocol before launching the Limited Mainnet Beta version, which is available for testing today. And now, these 1.7M $ZKP testnet rewards can be claimed.</p> Distribution/Claim details <p>Since the launch of the testnet, rewards have been allocated to users who have engaged with the protocol's functionalities. The testnet rewards can be claimed through <a href="https://sablier.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Sablier</a>, an onchain token distribution infrastructure. By searching for the ‘’Panther Testnet’’ in the search bar, testers can find the right airdrop program for this airdrop. Testers can check their eligibility by connecting their Rainbow, Metamask, or Coinbase wallet to the Sablier application. In total, there are 5203 addresses eligible for claiming their testnet rewards.</p><p>The airdrop contract was deployed on June 30, and the program continues until October 30, 2025, as shown on <a href="https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xe124f9a069d1cf30e3a79c1bf6e11b4551933a24515e6e570f786c4abd2e9517?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Polygoncan</a>.

Once again, a big thank you to all the participants. We will keep you posted on the progress as we progress towards a fully functional Panther Protocol.&nbsp;</p> About Panther Protocol Foundation <p>Panther Protocol Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the growth, sustainability, and responsible use of Panther Protocol. While it does not operate the protocol or facilitate digital asset services, the Foundation plays a critical role in promoting adoption, supporting open-source development, advancing research, and raising awareness around the protocol’s core privacy-preserving technologies.</p><p>By empowering users, developers, and permissioned actors within DeFi and web3, the Foundation contributes to building a more secure and confidential digital future.</p><p>For more information, visit<a href="https://www.panther.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> www.panther.org</a>.</p><p>To learn more about Panther Protocol, visit<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> www.pantherprotocol.io</a>.</p>

<p>Building BAT Utility and Driving Adoption</p>
<p>Since launching in March, the <a>Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program</a> has steadily gained momentum. Designed to expand <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token (BAT)</a> utility across Web3, the program connects partners with Brave’s over 88 million monthly users through premium placements—including New Tab Takeovers and the new Rewards Offer Wall—and amplifies reach through co-marketing and community-driven initiatives.</p>
<p>This month, we’re sharing progress updates from our existing cohort of partners, highlighting how they’re leveraging BAT to power new experiences across decentralized identity, DeFi, fitness, gaming, the metaverse, sports, and more. From Brave Ads campaign performance to live activations and on-chain integrations, each milestone fuels BAT’s multichain expansion and real-world utility.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
 
 Bandit supporting 20 Web3 projects in running self-hosted campaigns through Brave’s private advertising platform 
 Brave and Ubisoft hosting a live community event on July 1 at EthCC in Cannes (<a href="https://x.com/pethanque">Masters of pETHanque</a>) and gameplay demos inside the Brave browser with the new Brave avatar skin&nbsp; 
 Over 6,200 .brave domains minted on Unstoppable Domains 
 The debut of a new Brave-themed character mask in Decentraland 
 Fanon and Brave working directly to launch Brave Games&nbsp; 
 A collaboration on an exclusive Brave merch capsule for the GolfN Pro Shop 
 Over 225,000 BAT locked in GuanoCoin’s Cave for increased utility on Solana 
 A new Brave Community Group on the Moonwalk Fitness app 
 

 Updates from our Rewards 3.0 Program Partners 

 Bandit’s Badchain&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://earn.badchain.org/">Bandit’s Badchain</a> launched a <a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bandits-badchain-launches-1-million-growth-fund-to-power-web3-adoption/">$1 million Growth Fund</a> in June to accelerate Web3 adoption—starting with Brave. As part of the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program, Bandit will curate and deploy the fund to support 20 Web3 projects in running self-hosted campaigns through Brave’s private advertising platform, reaching millions of users worldwide. These campaigns will combine premium exposure via Brave Ads with Bandit’s proven growth tools, including quests, leaderboards, and NFT mints.</p>
<p>The initiative reflects a shared commitment to authentic growth; Bandit and Brave aim to help projects reach the next 50 million real users through meaningful, product-led engagement rather than chasing hype or vanity metrics. As Brave approaches 100 million users, the Growth Fund presents a powerful opportunity for Web3 builders to find early market fit within one of the most crypto-native audiences on the Web.</p>

 Decentraland&nbsp; 
<p>On Friday, July 11, Brave and the BAT Community will host an immersive metaverse event in <a href="https://decentraland.org/">Decentraland</a>, featuring the debut of a new Brave-themed character mask. The event will include a live presentation on Brave and BAT, followed by an interactive afterparty with a DJ and other community-led activities. Attendees who participate will be able to claim the exclusive Brave mask in-game.</p>

 GolfN 
<p>Brave and <a href="https://www.golfn.com/">GolfN</a> are collaborating on an exclusive merch capsule for the <a href="https://proshop.golfn.com/">GolfN Pro Shop</a>, featuring custom Brave golf towels, golf tees, and ball markers, introducing new sports and lifestyle-oriented utility for BAT. Fans will be able to purchase items using BAT, as well as other cryptocurrencies or credit cards. A dedicated banner in the <a href="https://store.brave.com/">Brave Merch Store</a> will guide users directly to GolfN’s storefront.</p>
<p>This upcoming drop marks the next step in an ongoing partnership focused on bridging rewards and recreation, both on the green and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

 GuanoCoin 
<p>Since joining the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program in March, <a href="https://www.guanocoin.com/">GuanoCoin</a>’s Cave has grown to <a href="https://x.com/guanocoin/status/1934985870999691686">over 225,000 BAT locked</a>, a milestone that reflects rising community participation and long-term belief in the BAT ecosystem. By locking BAT in the Cave, fans help reduce the circulating supply and reinforce BAT’s utility on Solana, all while earning GUANO rewards.</p>
<p>Born from within the BAT Community, GuanoCoin continues to deliver creative, community-first ways to engage with BAT on-chain. Follow <a href="https://x.com/guanocoin">@Guanocoin</a> for exciting quests and ecosystem experiments emerging from the Cave.</p>

 Moonwalk Fitness 
<p>Brave recently joined <a href="https://moonwalk.fit/">Moonwalk Fitness</a>’s new Communities feature, a social layer within the Moonwalk app that makes movement more interactive, connected, and habit-forming. Communities foster accountability and shared goals by bringing together users based on their interests, location, or the type of challenge they face.</p>
<p>The new Brave community group offers a dedicated space where Rewards users and BAT holders can access exclusive invite-only games, share updates, and participate in group step challenges. Fans can join by downloading the Moonwalk Fitness app on iOS or Android and searching for Brave’s community.</p>
<p>In May, Brave sponsored Moonwalk’s  <a href="https://x.com/moonwalkfitness/status/1923456840228040901">Accelerate Impact</a>, a charity step challenge which <a href="https://x.com/moonwalkfitness/status/1927852846919135481">raised over $64,000</a> to benefit  <a href="https://bonkcoin.com/">BONK</a>’s  <a href="https://www.bonkforpaws.org/">Bonk for Paws</a> initiative. Building on that success, Brave and Moonwalk plan to launch additional challenges, some supporting charitable causes, others offering BAT-powered rewards for users who hit their daily step goals.</p>

 Pudgy Pop, Fanon, &amp; Brave Games 
<p>As part of our ongoing partnership, Brave previously teamed up with <a href="https://www.pudgypop.com/">Pudgy Pop</a> to explore new ways of engaging users through socially driven, gamified campaigns. Based on the strong community response to those experiences, built on <a href="https://x.com/Fanonclub">Fanon</a>’s social gaming platform, Brave is now working directly with Fanon to launch Brave Games: a new series of interactive challenges designed to deepen visibility and engagement for Rewards 3.0 Partner Program campaigns. Pudgy Pop will also participate by rewarding top Brave Games players with collectible pins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave Games blends prediction mechanics, progressive “Squid Game”-style rounds, and social gameplay to transform passive questing into something far more dynamic. Instead of static checklists and inflated incentives, players stay engaged by making smart guesses, completing challenges, and outlasting the crowd.</p>

 Ubisoft 
<p>Brave and <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us">Ubisoft</a> are bringing their collaboration to life at <a href="https://ethcc.io/">EthCC</a> in Cannes with a live community event on July 1: <a href="https://x.com/pethanque">Masters of pETHanque</a>. (<a href="https://lu.ma/wzqcjma3">Register here</a>.) At the event, they’ll co-host a dedicated space featuring Watch Dogs: DedSec gameplay demos inside the Brave browser and unveil the new Brave avatar skin in __ <a href="https://edenonline.ubisoft.com/game">Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E.</a>, a community-driven adventure set in a dystopian world where players shape the narrative through collective decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The custom Brave skin is a symbol of digital defiance, created for players who challenge the status quo and believe in reclaiming their agency—whether from Big Tech or fictional adversaries—values deeply shared by both Brave and Ubisoft. This experiential activation continues Ubisoft’s involvement in the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program, underscoring its commitment to delivering rich, meaningful experiences to Brave users and its broader gaming audience.</p>

 Unstoppable Domains&nbsp; 
<p>Interest in the new .brave on-chain top-level domain, launched last month in partnership with <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19731315783">Unstoppable Domains</a>, continues to grow. In just four weeks, over 6,200 .brave domains have been minted, each representing a piece of digital identity that lives fully on-chain. Fans can still claim theirs at  <a href="https://get.unstoppabledomains.com/brave/">get.unstoppabledomains.com/brave</a>, using BAT, other cryptocurrencies, or a credit card.</p>
<p>In a <a>recent episode of The Brave Technologist podcast</a>, Unstoppable COO <a href="https://x.com/sandy_carter">Sandy Carter</a> and Brave’s <a href="https://x.com/lukemulks">Luke Mulks</a> discussed what could be next for .brave: a potential application to become an official ICANN-registered domain. If approved, .brave would operate across both Web2 and Web3 infrastructure, making it the first digital identity asset to be fully on-chain and recognized within the traditional DNS system. That means .brave domains could eventually be used as standard website URLs, compatible across all browsers and apps, while remaining rooted in the decentralized web.</p>
<p>This partnership is a bold step toward bridging the worlds of Web2 and Web3, and underscores Brave’s broader mission to give users ownership over their online identity: on-chain, in the browser, and beyond.</p>

 How interested partners can get involved 
<p>Web3 builders and projects can join the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program to gain access to a highly engaged, privacy-conscious user base, and help shape the next wave of utility for BAT. <a href="https://blocksurvey.io/brave-rewards-30-partner-program-interest-form-3jNtl5c9Sb2om5LOneVd7Q?v=o">Get in touch to learn more</a>.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more partner announcements and ways to engage with BAT.</p>
<p>Brave is a driving force leading the way for Web3 adoption, directly supporting Web3 into the broader Web through its privacy browser, independent search engine, and browser-native, multi-chain crypto wallet. Brave currently has over 88 million monthly active users. Learn more at <a>brave.com</a> and <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">basicattentiontoken.org</a>.</p>

<p>There are primarily two options when it comes to storing your cryptocurrencies: to self-custody your digital assets or trust a third-party exchange. Each approach comes with its own pros and cons and this article will help you decide which option is right for&nbsp;you.</p> What is Self-Custody? <p>Have you ever had an issue with your bank that led to the freezing of your account? Maybe not! But the reason your traditional bank is able to freeze your account is because you do not have full control. They can come up with new KYC or tax rules that you will be forced to comply with and you don’t really have a choice. Self-custody is the opposite of all I have just talked&nbsp;about.</p><p>A self-custody wallet (aka non-custodial wallet) allows you to hold your private keys, the cryptographic string of characters that grants access to your funds. This means that no central authority, government, or exchange can freeze your funds. You are probably familiar with the crypto saying, “Not your keys, not your&nbsp;coins.”</p><p>The tools for self-custody range from hardware wallets (like Ledger or Trezor), which store your private keys offline, to software wallets (like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and MyPIVXWallet), which offer convenience for everyday transactions. For many, the peace of mind that comes with knowing they are the sole guardian of their digital wealth is invaluable.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum is custodial wallets, otherwise known as exchange wallets. These wallets are ideal for crypto newbies. Their user-friendly design makes them an excellent gateway for those just starting to explore blockchain technology and fundamental actions like crypto trading. Exchanges like Binance and Coinbase fall under this category.</p> Pros of Self-Custody <p>· Absolute Control: You may not realize it but self-custody embodies the foundational ethos of cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto, in the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper</a>, repeatedly mentioned the need to transact without third parties. While custodial wallets such as centralized exchanges offer ease of use, users do not have full control of their&nbsp;funds.</p>  Reduced Counterparty Risk: From Mt. Gox to the infamous FTX, and countless others, self-custody eliminates the risk of an exchange being hacked, going bankrupt, or engaging in questionable practices with your assets. Your funds are not commingled with those of millions of other users. Imagine the CEO of an exchange using your digital assets to buy a&nbsp;Lambo.  Privacy: Although many blockchain transactions are public, self-custody offers a greater degree of privacy regarding your holdings. This is because they may not be directly linked to a KYC-verified exchange&nbsp;account.   Cons of Self-Custody   Irrecoverable Loss: Lose your private keys or your seed phrase, and your funds are gone forever. There’s no “forgot password” button in crypto. Hardware wallet malfunctions, house fires, or simple forgetfulness can lead to catastrophic losses. I still remember the story of James Howells, a computer expert who accidentally threw a drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin in 2013. He has been in a running battle with local authorities for years to buy the Welsh landfill, which now holds over $800 million worth of Bitcoin. Trust me, you don’t want to be this&nbsp;guy.  Vulnerability to Personal Hacks: While exchanges are targets for large-scale hacks, individuals are susceptible to phishing scams, malware, and social engineering attacks that can compromise their personal devices and, by extension, their self-custodied funds. For example, one of the offline wallets of Bybit was hacked in February 2025, with the attacker(s) making away with nearly $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency.  Complexity and User Experience: Although the UI and UX of self-custody wallets have improved greatly, setting up and managing self-custody solutions can be daunting for newcomers. The learning curve for securely storing seed phrases, understanding transaction fees, and navigating different blockchain networks can be&nbsp;steep.   Pros of Custodial Wallets   Ease of Use: Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) offer a familiar user experience, akin to traditional online banking or brokerage accounts. Buying, selling, and trading are streamlined, making them ideal for beginners.  Liquidity: Exchanges provide deep liquidity, allowing users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies quickly and efficiently at competitive prices. This is particularly useful if you are a&nbsp;trader.  Customer Support &amp; Recovery Options: In many cases, if you forget your password or have issues with your account, there’s a customer support team to assist. Some exchanges also offer insurance against certain types of hacks (though the scope and reliability of this vary&nbsp;wildly).  Advanced Trading Features: For active traders, CEXs offer a range of tools like margin trading, futures, and staking services, often with higher yields than self-custodial options.   Cons of Custodial Wallets   Centralization Risk: The primary drawback of using a CEX is encapsulated in the popular crypto adage: “Not your keys, not your crypto.” You are entrusting your funds to a single entity, making them vulnerable to exchange hacks, regulatory crackdowns, or internal mismanagement. The collapse of FTX served as a brutal reminder of this&nbsp;risk.  Lack of Control: Exchanges can freeze your account, restrict withdrawals, or even seize your funds if they deem your activity suspicious or are compelled by legal authorities.  Reduced Privacy: To comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, exchanges require extensive personal information, linking your identity directly to your crypto holdings.   Finding the Sweet&nbsp;Spot <p>In conclusion, rather than settle for a one-size-fits-all approach, I believe that the optimal solution lies in a hybrid approach. Use exchanges for quick trades, dollar-cost averaging into positions, or keeping smaller amounts of crypto readily accessible for immediate use. On the flip side, move significant portions of your portfolio and assets you intend to hold for the long term into secure hardware or software wallets. This minimizes exposure to exchange&nbsp;risk.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>By Matt McAlister, Senior Director, Premium Products and Services at Brave</p>
<p>In late 2023 we published our first <a>roadmap for Leo</a>, Brave’s <a>built-in AI browser assistant</a>. In that post, we outlined our vision for Leo as a companion that helps you make sense of the Web, while still preserving your control and privacy.</p>
<p>Since then, Leo has been evolving from a helpful browsing companion toward a smart, personalized collaborator—a shift that reflects broader changes in how we think about AI and the Web. While we’ve delivered on our core promises around model quality, search capabilities, and multi-platform support, several of our most exciting innovations weren’t even on our original roadmap. Features like Multi-Tab Context, Tab Focus Mode, and Agentic AI emerged from user feedback and our ongoing commitment to making AI fundamental to how browsers work.</p>
<p>What hasn’t changed is our commitment to privacy-by-design and user choice. Given the product’s evolution since late 2023, we thought it was time to document Leo’s journey and share where we’re heading next.</p>

 What we’ve accomplished 
<p>Over the past 18 months, we’ve made progress with both foundational capabilities and innovative features:</p>

 Model improvements and performance 
<p>When we first launched Leo, we started with Llama 2 models. Since then, we’ve expanded our model offerings and given you more choice and options:</p>
 
 Better default models: We’ve upgraded our default from Llama 2 13B to Mixtral 8x7B to Llama 3.1 8B, and we also offer Claude Haiku and&nbsp; Qwen 3 14B, with Premium users getting access to reasoning models like Claude’s latest Sonnet 4 and DeepSeek R1. 
 Model selection: You can choose from a variety of models, with free and premium tiers offering different capabilities. Or you can let Leo choose the best model for each response with the new automatic model selection. 
 Bring your own model (BYOM): Brave also lets you choose your preferred AI provider via a feature called <a href="https://support.brave.app/hc/en-us/articles/34070140231821-How-do-I-use-the-Bring-Your-Own-Model-BYOM-with-Brave-Leo">bring your own model</a> (BYOM). This lets you connect your own API endpoints for models like GPT-4, Grok, and others, or connect to locally-running models through tools like Ollama. 
 
<p><a href="https://support.brave.app/hc/en-us/articles/26727364100493-What-are-the-differences-between-Leo-s-AI-Models">Learn more about the differences between Leo’s AI models</a>.</p>

 Context and content 
 
 Awareness: Leo adapts to different content types, handling webpages, PDFs, YouTube videos, Google Docs, and more. Leo can suggest questions about your page to help surface deeper insights. Automatic mode determines the best model to use for the current context. We’ve also recently added image understanding. 
 Content generation: Leo can generate documents, lists, tables, code, and more using output formats including standard markdown. Edit prompts and regenerate responses to get the best output for your needs, then copy and paste into other projects and tools. 
 Inputs and outputs: We’ve increased context window sizes and rate limits, allowing for more comprehensive conversations looking at multiple contexts. Outputs were increased for more robust responses, and ongoing performance improvements have reduced first token latency. 
 

 Going native 
 
 Browser: Use Leo in the sidebar as a companion while browsing, or in full-page mode for a dedicated conversation at brave://leo-ai.
 
 Multi-platform support: Leo is available on desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux) and mobile (Android and iOS). <a href="https://support.brave.app/hc/en-us/articles/24692731286029-How-do-I-use-Brave-Leo-Android">Leo for Android</a> and <a href="https://support.brave.app/hc/en-us/articles/25362740009613-How-do-I-use-Brave-Leo-iOS">Leo for iOS</a> also include voice input capabilities. 
 Quick access: Use the browser toolbar icon to open Leo or start a conversation from the browser sidebar. 
 Right-click tools: Quick access to Leo’s capabilities through contextual menu options for working with page content. 
 Internationalization: Support for multiple languages in both the interface and models, ensuring Leo detects and maintains conversation in your preferred language. 
 
 
 Search: Like many AI products on the market today, Leo uses <a>the Brave Search API</a> to incorporate real-time Brave Search results and provide more accurate, up-to-date information. It also includes citations with links to sources used to inform responses. Links between Brave Search and Leo help you transition between different information needs. 
 Brave Talk: Summarize meetings, catch up if you join late, and automatically generate meeting notes from Brave Talk video call transcriptions, all thanks to the <a href="https://support.brave.app/hc/en-us/articles/25728936518285-How-to-use-Leo-with-Brave-Talk">Leo / Brave Talk integration</a>.

 User experience improvements 
 
 Chat history: With <a href="https://support.brave.app/hc/en-us/articles/32663367857549-How-do-I-use-Chat-History-in-Brave-Leo">chat history</a>, conversations are saved locally (rather than sent or saved to Brave servers), allowing you to manage conversations and continue them later. 
 Feedback: Like or dislike buttons and feedback forms to help us improve Leo based on in-the-wild usage. 
 Conversation starters: Contextual suggestions to help you get more from Leo. 
 Ongoing UI/UX improvements: Continual refinements to interfaces, including model lists and presentation, conversation UI, content output, tab attachment and document upload, and more. 
 

 Privacy and security enhancements 
<p>We’ve added to our original privacy protections with <a href="https://support.brave.app/hc/en-us/sections/20991947768717-Leo-AI">better documentation</a> and consistency in our messaging when new features are added:</p>
 
 Account-free access: Access Leo’s free tier without creating a Brave account. 
 Privacy-preserving subscription model: <a href="https://account.brave.com/">Leo Premium</a> uses unlinkable tokens to validate subscriptions, and the email used for account creation remains separate from day-to-day Leo usage, creating a privacy-preserving credentialing system. 
 No chats in the cloud: Your conversations and chat history are never stored on our servers, and your chat history exists only on your device in your local storage. Chats can be temporary, meaning they aren’t kept in your local storage, and chat history can be disabled entirely so conversations don’t exist on your device or anywhere else after you close them. 
 No context in the cloud: Unlike other AI assistants that require you to upload files or copy-paste content that gets stored on their servers, Leo works natively in your browser and can seamlessly access your browser tabs with page content and documents without storing that information on external servers.&nbsp; 
 No logs: We don’t log your IP address or keep any server-side records of your Leo usage to retain, analyze, or share. 
 

 Innovative new features: beyond the original roadmap 
<p>Building on this foundation, we’re currently working on new features that transform what a web browser can do:</p>

 Agentic AI…with guardrails 
<p>As the browser evolves with agentic AI features, it will become a more active partner in using the Web. We’re still refining the safety features before releasing our implementation, but it’s plain to see how helpful agentic AI will be, with the browser acting on your behalf to:</p>
 
 Navigate to websites for you while you follow along or work on other projects 
 Execute and refine search queries until you have all the information you need 
 Extract and organize information collected from sources across the Web so you can focus on analysis and decision-making 
 Automate multi-step workflows and tasks that take up too much of your time 
 
<p>While some browsers give their AI access to your data and logged-in webpage sessions (such as your email, calendar, bank accounts, or social media accounts), Brave is working to ensure you retain full control of your AI’s activities. We’re implementing several safeguards and controls such as restrictions on access to extensions, separate storage partitions, and clear warnings and visual indicators while it’s activated. Our implementation will ensure you consent before letting AI act on your behalf.</p>

 Context management 
<p>Browser-based AI can work within your existing workflow when you choose to activate it, without requiring you to copy/paste and explain your intentions as you do with cloud-based or standalone AI chat apps. Brave’s multi-tab context feature lets you ask questions that span resources already open in your browser–PDFs, articles, spreadsheets, and more–whether you’re working on school assignments, company reports, or research projects.</p>
 
 Share context from webpages, PDFs, documents, images, and videos when you want comprehensive analysis 
 Ask questions, identify patterns and find connections between sources you’ve chosen to include 
 Generate summaries that draw insights from all the materials you’ve provided 
 
<p>Soon you’ll be able to add tabs, bookmarks and history as attachments by mentioning them with the “@” symbol, simplifying context management even further.</p>

 Improved context handling 
<p>We have also implemented many enhancements and continue improving the way content is processed to provide the highest quality insights and output:</p>
 
 Better extraction and processing methods for more content types 
 Smart truncation for large contexts and extended conversations 
 Dynamic routing for the most relevant model when in automatic mode 
 

 Vision support 
<p>Leo now understands and analyzes images, bringing multi-modal capabilities to your browsing experience:</p>
 
 Ask questions about images on webpages and in PDFs 
 Get detailed descriptions of visual content 
 Analyze and extract text and information from images 
 Compare visual elements across different sources by adding multiple images 
 

 Tab organizer 
<p>Developers and business users often find themselves with numerous tabs open in multiple windows across client projects, research, and personal browsing. Rather than hunting manually through this digital mess, they now ask Leo to organize tabs by workflow stage, documentation type, language, or many other custom structures:</p>
 
 Filter and organize open tabs based on topics or themes 
 Group related tabs for better focus 
 Create new windows with filtered tabs for specific tasks 
 
<p><a href="https://support.brave.app/hc/en-us/articles/35200007195917-How-to-use-Tab-Focus-Mode">Learn how to use tab focus mode</a>.</p>

 Looking ahead 
<p>As browsers evolve with more AI capabilities, they become the natural platform for AI to orchestrate your digital activities rather than simply assist with individual tasks. So, in addition to these ongoing improvements and upcoming releases, our near term plans include capabilities like:</p>

 Tasks and scheduling 
<p>Building on the agentic foundations referenced above, we’ll also add a task scheduling system that will let you:</p>
 
 Create recurring tasks and schedule automated workflows 
 Monitor webpages and alert you when something important happens 
 Receive notifications when tasks are complete and results are ready for you 
 
<p>Imagine setting up Leo to check for concert tickets within your price range, monitor GitHub issues that mention you, or collect news on topics you care about—all automatically and on a schedule you define.</p>

 On-device AI 
<p>We’re also exploring ways to expand on Leo’s initial BYOM capabilities for more on-device AI. This includes fully integrated local model support for running models, and enabling offline AI capabilities for tasks with even higher security needs on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>

 Better outputs 
<p>Using the latest models and tools such as the Brave Search API, users will be able to generate higher quality outputs. Product data, sports data, cryptocurrency prices, and richer outputs including images, tables, and other content formats will help you learn more about your personal interests. Audio mode will respond to you with a voice of your choice. You’ll also be able to create more robust and professional documents for work, school, or home.</p>

 Longer term 
<p>With these strong foundations in place, we’re changing the way we operate and deliver AI features in the browser.</p>
<p>We listen closely to what users are asking for. They’re telling us about what models they use, where to integrate them in the browser, and what would help them in their work. They’re telling us how to enable more control over AI.</p>
<p>We’re also our own power users, using AI tools internally to learn faster and achieve more. This experience drives our conviction that AI should work the way you do.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what we’re building: AI that adapts to your workflow, not the other way around, optimized with tools and services that help you learn faster, do more, and make better decisions. We’ll deliver this through a comprehensive AI operating environment, guided by your feedback, our focus on useful tools over flashy features, and our unwavering commitment to user choice and privacy.</p>
 

 Roadmap progress and future direction 
<p>As we reflect on our journey so far, the table below shows what we’ve delivered, what we haven’t completed yet, and how our understanding has evolved as we’ve released features and capabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we shared in our recent roadmap, Leo has evolved from a helpful browsing companion toward a smart, personalized collaborator, adapting to your workflow to help you be more productive. Now you’ll see in the latest release of Brave browser how Leo takes this collaborator approach further, intelligently choosing the right AI models for your specific needs.</p>

 New Automatic mode: Always the best model available 
<p>Leo’s new Automatic mode ensures you’re always using the most capable AI models available to you without having to research, evaluate, or manually switch as new models are released. As the AI landscape rapidly evolves with new and more powerful models, Automatic mode provides access to the best default option whether you are using Leo in the free tier or Leo Premium where the most advanced models are available to subscribers.</p>
<p>The Automatic option in the model selector provides intelligent defaults for convenience while always preserving your ability to manually select any specific model when desired. You’ll always be able to see which model was used, and you can immediately switch to manual selection and choose your preferred model, regenerate with any other model, or set your own default preferences at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we continue improving Automatic mode, it will become even smarter at matching the right model to your specific tasks. It currently routes images to vision-capable models appropriate for your access tier, and we’re adding routing capabilities for more context types like languages, code, and task-specific use cases like organizing browser tabs or conducting deep research.</p>

 Leo’s model evolution: Continuous improvement 
<p>Leo’s model offerings have continuously evolved to provide users with access to the most capable AI available:</p>

Automatic intelligent routing, advanced reasoning



<p>Current Model Lineup:</p>
 
 Llama 3.1 8B: General-purpose chat and content generation 
 Qwen 3 14B: Advanced reasoning, coding, and multilingual support 
 Claude Haiku 3.5: Lightning-fast chat optimized for speed

 DeepSeek R1 (Premium): Complex problem-solving and logic 
 Llama 3.2 Vision: Image understanding and analysis 
 Gemma 3: Multiple image analysis and more languages, to be released soon 
 
<p>With Automatic mode, you get the best of all these models without needing to track their individual strengths or manually switch between them unless you choose to do so.</p>

 Edit, regenerate, and refine 
<p>Building on Leo’s existing capabilities, you can now edit prompts and regenerate responses to get the best output for your needs. This workflow lets you:</p>
 
 Start with Automatic mode to get an intelligent first response using the most capable model 
 Regenerate with different models to compare approaches 
 Edit your original prompt and try again 
 Copy the best results into your projects and workflows 
 

 Complete model control with BYOM 
<p>For users who want ultimate control, Leo’s Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) capability lets you connect your own AI models—whether running locally on your device or hosted remotely. You can use frameworks like Ollama to run models directly on your device and connect them to Leo, keeping all data private. If you wish to use third-party APIs like OpenAI’s GPT-4, BYOM connects to them using your own key.</p>
<p>BYOM works seamlessly with Leo’s conversation UX and browser-native context handling features—you can even set your custom model as the default model for generating responses. Other Leo features will be integrated with BYOM soon, such as response regeneration and tab organization.</p>

 Privacy architecture that enables innovation 
<p>These new features are built on Leo’s unique privacy-first infrastructure:</p>
 
 Our open models in the free tier—Llama, Qwen, and Gemma—run in Brave’s own secure AWS environment, configured to drop conversation data immediately when your session ends.&nbsp; 
 DeepSeek and the Claude models operate through AWS Bedrock with the same zero-retention configuration.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Eliminating third-party data retention: We’ve eliminated the 30-day data retention that previously applied to Claude models under Anthropic’s standard API terms. By migrating Claude models to AWS Bedrock, all models now operate under identical privacy standards.</p>
<p>The result:</p>
 
 No chats in the cloud: Your conversations and chat history are never stored on our servers. All data from query processing is lost after your response is generated, and your chat history exists only on your device in your local storage. Local chats can be temporary, meaning they aren’t kept in your local storage, and chat history can be disabled entirely so conversations don’t exist on your device or anywhere else after you close them. 
 No context in the cloud: Unlike other AI assistants that require you to upload files or copy-paste content that gets stored on their servers, Leo works natively in your browser and can seamlessly access your browser tabs with page content and documents without storing that information on external servers.&nbsp; 
 No logs: We don’t log your IP address or keep any server-side records of your Leo usage to retain, analyze, or share. 
 
<p>This combination of self-hosted and Bedrock-configured models creates privacy guardrails that matter to people who use AI for work, school or their personal workflows. In addition, our independence from any single model provider means we can adopt the best available options without being constrained by vendor lock-in or restrictive terms that limit what others can offer.</p>

 Transparency in automation 
<p>Automation in Leo is designed to respect your intelligence and agency. When Automatic mode selects a model, you see which one and can immediately try alternatives. When you regenerate responses, you can compare how different models approach the same task.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This transparency reflects our broader philosophy that the best personalized AI collaborator isn’t one that makes decisions for you. It’s one that makes you more capable of making your own.</p>

They also dig into where the real bottlenecks lie, not in the tech, but in how companies, products, and people work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Find Anish on X: <a href="https://x.com/illscience">https://x.com/illscience</a></p><p>Find Steven on X: <a href="https://x.com/stevesi">https://x.com/stevesi</a></p><p>Watch Andrej Karpathy’s talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you think: <a href="https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z">https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://x.com/eriktorenberg">https://x.com/eriktorenberg</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

<p>Brave for Android is <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Installing-Brave-on-Android">now available</a> as an F-Droid repository. This new officially-supported repository allows users of the <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid client</a> to install the browser and receive automatic updates without requiring the Google Play app to be installed.</p>
<p>As we are a user-first privacy-focused browser, we understand that many users are seeking an alternative to the Big Tech app stores with all of the tracking and restrictions that come with them. We are excited to make our app available on a <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2022/11/23/why-curation-and-decentralization-is-better-than-millions-of-apps.html">decentralized</a> and <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html">account-free</a> platform. These builds are identical to the ones available via Google Play.</p>
<p>If you are using an Android device without the Google Play Store, or if you just want to try an alternative way to download the browser you love, give it a try and <a href="https://community.brave.com/">let us know what you think</a>.</p>

 Is the F-Droid version of Brave any different from the one on Google Play? 
<p>No. Both are built on Brave’s infrastructure from the same source code.</p>

 Why is Brave using a third-party repository instead of listing in the main F-Droid repository? 
<p>Just like with our official <a>Linux packages</a>, we maintain our own repository as a way for users to integrate Brave onto their operating systems while ensuring that updates are delivered promptly to users and that only fully-supported versions of Brave are available through these repositories.</p>
<p>Repositories like F-Droid, Debian, and Ubuntu that have their own inclusion policies and/or release cadence are free to distribute the Brave Browser under our <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/blob/master/LICENSE">Open Source license</a>, but we do not at this time have the resources available to support them directly.</p>
<p>Can I still find the Brave Android app on the Google Play Store?</p>
<p>Yes, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Brave Android app</a> is available on Google Play Store in addition to Brave’s F-Droid version.</p>

 Can anyone download the Brave app from the F-droid repository, or is any technical expertise required? 
<p>Installing Brave for Android through our F-Droid repository requires a few more steps, but anyone can follow our <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Installing-Brave-on-Android">official instructions</a>.</p>

 Can I use premium features such as Brave VPN + Firewall, Brave Leo or Brave Rewards without a Google account? 
<p>No. At the moment, these features require a Google account on Android.</p>

<p>New stringent regulations are on the horizon for Turkish crypto users. Once enforced, crypto platforms will be forced to collect detailed information on the origin and purpose of every transfer.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/ekonomi/hazine-ve-maliye-bakanligi-suc-gelirlerinin-kripto-islemleriyle-aklanmasini-yeni-hamlelerle-onleyecek/3610692">reports</a> from Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency (AA), the Ministry of Treasury and Finance is driving these stricter regulations as part of efforts to combat money laundering and financial crime. A key component of the new rules will be the mandatory collection of a transaction description of at least 20 characters for each transfer.</p><p>In addition to transaction descriptions, platforms will be required to impose holding periods on crypto withdrawals, especially when the “Travel Rule” does not apply. These include a 48-hour delay for most withdrawals and a more extended 72-hour delay for the first withdrawal from any new&nbsp;account.</p><p>The ministry also plans to introduce daily and monthly limits on stablecoin transfers. These limits, set at $3,000 per day and $50,000 monthly, are designed to prevent the rapid outflow of illicit funds, particularly those linked to illegal betting and fraud. Platforms that fully comply with Travel Rule obligations, which involve collecting comprehensive sender and recipient identity details, may be permitted to apply these limits at double the standard threshold.</p><p>Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek affirmed that the objective of these regulations is to curb criminal misuse of cryptocurrencies without stifling legitimate activity. He stated that “Left-wing space for legitimate crypto asset activities will be maintained.”</p><p>The new rules also come with serious penalties for non-compliance, including administrative fines, criminal sanctions, and potential denial or cancellation of licenses for platforms that fail to adhere to the regulations. However, transfers related to liquidity provision, market making, and arbitrage will be exempt from these limits, provided users can prove the source of funds and the activities are monitored under the platform’s responsibility.</p><p>These proposed regulations are part of Turkey’s broader strategy to align its crypto policies with global frameworks, such as the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. In March, Turkey’s Capital Markets Board (CMB) introduced comprehensive licensing and operational rules for Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs), granting the CMB full regulatory authority over crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and custodians. This includes strict requirements for executive backgrounds, shareholder structures, and minimum capital thresholds, with crypto exchanges needing at least $4.1 million in capital and custodians $13.7&nbsp;million.</p><p>While these measures are expected to enhance investor protection and combat financial crime, they are part of a broader, accelerated crackdown by Turkey’s Ministry of Treasury and Finance, signalling a clear intent to exert greater control over crypto asset service providers and&nbsp;users.</p><p>PIVX.

  Partnering with Delphi: Meet Your Heroes  <p>Dara, Sam and their team are democratizing access to expertise.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/jess-lee/">Jess Lee</a>	 



Published June 24, 2025
  



 
<p>What if you could meet your heroes?</p>



<p>What if you could sit down with the best minds in the world—your favorite author, your childhood hero, the sharpest thinker in your field—and ask them anything? Throughout life, we’re shaped by the people we learn from. But the right guidance is often out of reach. The best coaches are booked. The industry veterans don’t take many meetings. And the people we most wish we could hear from—our grandparents, or the genius whose biography sits on our bookshelf—may no longer be around.</p>



<p>What if that wasn’t the case?</p>



<p>That’s the question at the heart of <a href="https://www.delphi.ai/">Delphi</a>: What if you could create a digital version of someone’s mind—one that thinks like them, speaks like them and can share their expertise, on demand and endlessly patient?</p>



<p>The first time I met Delphi CEO Dara Ladjevardian, this idea sounded equal parts fascinating and science fiction. But the more I saw it in action, the more obvious—and inevitable—it felt.</p>



<p>Delphi began with one person’s desire to reconnect.</p>



<p>Dara had just quit his job as an engineer at C3.ai and was seeking advice on what to do next. In particular, he wanted guidance from his grandfather Akbar, who was a successful entrepreneur in Iran before the revolution and fled to America to create a better life for his family. But Akbar had suffered a stroke that affected his ability to speak, and could no longer hold the conversations Dara longed for.</p>



<p>What Dara did have, though, was his grandfather’s memoir—and a background in AI. So he used the full text of that book to create the first Delphi, an interactive mirror of his grandfather’s teachings.</p>



<p>Later Dara joined OpenStore, where he used the same technology to build an AI chatbot of Nest co-founder Tony Fadell to help give his team product advice. It was there that Dara met his co-founder, Sam Spelsberg. Together they ran a book club and found common ground in their love of learning from great mentorship through books—then went on to co-found Delphi one month before the launch of ChatGPT.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and Delphi is a platform where anyone can build their own “digital mind.” Just connect your existing content—writing, podcasts, interviews, tweets—or sit for an interview, and Delphi handles the rest. The result is an interactive version of your perspective that people can talk to, text or video call—even in languages you don’t speak. The experience feels personal, thoughtful and uncannily true to you.</p>



<p>The diversity of use cases and personas is fascinating, with everyone from PM expert <a href="https://www.delphi.ai/lenny">Lenny Rachitsky</a> to Arnold Schwarzenegger using Delphi to multiply their impact. Coaches like <a href="https://ai.matthewhussey.com/">Matthew Hussey</a> and <a href="https://www.delphi.ai/hadarshemesh/explore">Hadar Shemesh</a> scale themselves to hundreds of clients, doctors like <a href="https://www.delphi.ai/drmarkhyman">Mark Hyman</a> answer patient questions, and professors like entrepreneur/VC <a href="https://www.delphi.ai/bussgang">Jeff Bussgang</a> offer 24/7 access to their Harvard Business School courses and books. Beyond the obvious business applications, there are also parents who want to preserve their knowledge for their kids, foundations of legends like <a href="https://www.delphi.ai/aynrand">Ayn Rand</a> who want to sustain legacy, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@delphi/video/7512637697731824942">people who bring Delphi to their IRL meetings as if it’s their own chief of staff</a>. Delphi lets these experts be everywhere to everyone, all at once.</p>



<p>The excitement is catching on inside Sequoia, too. Growth Partner and HubSpot co-founder <a href="https://www.delphi.ai/bhalligan">Brian Halligan uses his Delphi</a> for founder coaching. Design Partner James Buckhouse <a href="https://www.delphi.ai/buckhouse">created one to consult on design and storytelling</a>—complete with insights from <a href="https://buckhouse.medium.com/my-digital-second-self-c26dc6b904c4">his blog</a>. And Sequoia steward <a href="http://delphi.ai/roelofbotha">Roelof Botha’s Delphi</a>, trained on our Crucible Moments podcast, doesn’t just reflect his knowledge—it even captures his South African accent.</p>



<p>At Sequoia, we’ve seen a familiar pattern with legendary consumer companies: what starts as a niche—cat videos on YouTube, couch surfing on Airbnb, dancing teens on TikTok—can quickly become the new normal. Delphi founders Dara and Sam share the traits we’ve seen in many great consumer founders: clear vision, high conviction, velocity and the ability to win over early believers—including us. We’re proud to lead Delphi’s Series A and support their work toward a future where the world’s best knowledge isn’t locked away—but is instantly accessible to anyone, at any time. A future where you don’t just read about your heroes. You talk to them.</p>
 



We signed the term sheet on Halloween. Dara was Wolverine. I was Han Solo. Sam’s shirt said “Not a Clone.” That’s Delphi for you: built by superhumans, rebels and people who like to keep it real. If that sounds like you, <a href="https://delphi-ai.notion.site/Delphi-Careers-Page-738a1ade6104450886c9de37ba05c999">come join us, we are hiring</a>!

<p>In your opinion, what should a perfect crypto portfolio look like; 100% Bitcoin; a mix of the big 3, stablecoins, and some meme coins? It’s 2025, and I’m convinced your crypto portfolio isn’t complete without a privacy&nbsp;coin.</p><p>The need for financial anonymity in the digital space has never been greater, making privacy coins an essential, non-negotiable component. So, here’s why I think every crypto portfolio needs a privacy&nbsp;coin.</p> 1. Financial Privacy is Important <p>Would you feel comfortable publishing your payslip for the world to see? Ironically, this is what happens on many public blockchains.</p><p>The foundational premise of many cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, is open and auditable ledgers. While this transparency offers undeniable benefits in terms of trust and immutability, it also presents significant drawbacks for individual financial privacy.</p><p>Every transaction, including the sender, receiver, and amount, is publicly viewable. This is where privacy coins step in, offering a crucial layer of anonymity and fungibility that is often overlooked but profoundly important.</p><p>The most immediate and obvious reason to hold a privacy coin is to safeguard your financial privacy. In a world where data is increasingly valuable and often exploited, exposing your entire financial history on a public blockchain can have serious repercussions.</p><p>If your wallet address is linked to your identity (say through an exchange KYC process), malicious actors could track your spending habits, identify your wealth, and even target you for scams, phishing attacks, or physical threats. Privacy coins break this link, making it significantly harder to trace your financial activities back to&nbsp;you.</p><p>Financial privacy is a cornerstone of personal freedom. The ability to transact without constant surveillance is a fundamental right that should extend to the digital realm. Privacy coins empower individuals to maintain control over their financial information, preventing a panopticon-like scenario where every economic decision is scrutinized.</p> 2. Privacy is the new&nbsp;meta <p>I have no intention of getting you all pumped up but privacy appears to be the new meta in crypto. Given the growing level of surveillance and restrictions that will likely follow, privacy coins will top the charts in the coming months and&nbsp;years.</p><p>A few prominent names in the blockchain space are beginning to voice their support for privacy. For instance, Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently published a “Why I support privacy” <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/04/14/privacy.html">article</a>, emphasizing the importance of privacy for the network’s long-term health and decentralization. He eloquently stated: “Privacy is an important guarantor of decentralization: whoever has the information has the power, ergo we need to avoid centralized control over information.”</p><p>His concerns reflect an understanding that unbridled transparency can lead to new forms of centralization through data aggregation and analysis. Ethereum’s ongoing development, particularly with advancements in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), aims to integrate privacy-enhancing technologies directly into the protocol’s layers.</p><p>Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, has also vocalized the necessity of privacy, particularly in the context of stablecoins and broader financial adoption. In May 2025, Hoskinson discussed Cardano’s plans for a private stablecoin, noting, “Maybe people don’t want to have a stablecoin where every time they buy something it’s forever tracked by everyone everywhere.” He argued for “selective disclosure” as a means to balance privacy with regulatory compliance, acknowledging the complex dance between user rights and governmental oversight. Cardano’s “Midnight” protocol, announced in late 2024, is explicitly designed to leverage zero-knowledge proofs to unlock greater privacy for users within the ecosystem.</p> 3. Fungibility: The Cornerstone of Sound&nbsp;Money <p>Fungibility refers to the interchangeability of units of a currency. A dollar bill is fungible because one dollar bill is worth the same as any other dollar bill, regardless of its history. In the context of cryptocurrencies, a lack of privacy can compromise fungibility.</p><p>On public blockchains, if a coin has been previously associated with illicit activities (e.g., ransomware payments, darknet market transactions), it can be “tainted” or blacklisted by exchanges and service providers. This can lead to difficulties in selling or spending such coins, effectively reducing their value and usability.</p><p>As governments and financial institutions increasingly scrutinize cryptocurrency transactions, individuals or entities engaged in activities deemed “risky” (even if legal) could face de-platforming from financial services. Privacy coins offer a layer of protection against such censorship by making it harder to link individuals to specific transactions.</p> 4. Regulatory Risks and Centralization Pressure <p>The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, with increasing pressure for transparency and traceability. While compliance is important, an overemphasis on surveillance can lead to unintended consequences.</p><p>Centralized exchanges, which often hold extensive KYC data, are prime targets for hackers. A data breach could expose your identity and transaction history, making you vulnerable. By utilizing privacy coins for some of your holdings, you reduce the amount of traceable information linked to your identity on centralized platforms.</p><p>The push for transparency can inadvertently lead to greater centralization, as governments and powerful entities gain more control over financial information. Privacy coins, by their very nature, resist this centralization, empowering individuals and promoting a more decentralized financial ecosystem.</p> Top Things to Look for in a Privacy&nbsp;Coin <p>Not all privacy coins are created equal. When considering adding one to your portfolio, research the following:</p>  Privacy Mechanism: Understand how the coin achieves privacy (e.g., Zero-Knowledge Proofs like zk-SNARKs, Ring Signatures, CoinJoin, and stealth addresses). Monero (XMR) and PIVX (ZEC) are leading examples with different approaches.  Community and Development: A strong, active development team and a vibrant community are crucial for the long-term viability and security of the&nbsp;project.  Liquidity and Exchange Support: Ensure the coin is easily tradable on reputable exchanges.  Security Audits: Look for evidence of independent security audits of the codebase.  Decentralization: A truly decentralized privacy coin is less susceptible to single points of failure or external pressure.  <p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>It’s no secret that we are in an era defined by data collection and algorithmic insight. And the concept of a surveillance society is no longer theoretical, but a lived reality impacting everything, especially our financial interactions.</p><p>As the lines between public and private blur, the need for privacy in financial transactions has intensified, moving from a niche concern to a mainstream imperative. We sought expert insight from Eric Stanek, a respected mentor within the PIVX Ambassador Program, to tackle fundamental questions around&nbsp;privacy.</p> 1. In your opinion, what constitutes a “surveillance society?” <p>A surveillance society exists when governments and corporations can monitor every citizen’s activities without justification or oversight. While we already face significant digital surveillance through tech platforms and government data collection, a true surveillance society emerges when this monitoring becomes total and automated. The combination of digital currencies, artificial intelligence, and comprehensive data tracking creates unprecedented control mechanisms that can influence behaviour, restrict freedoms, and undermine democratic principles. This represents a level of societal control that surpasses historical dictatorships in both scope and effectiveness.</p> 2. Why has the concept of privacy in financial transactions become a more pressing issue in recent&nbsp;years? <p>The development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) represents the most significant threat to financial privacy in modern history. CBDCs enable governments to track, control, and restrict every financial transaction in real-time. We’re already seeing implementations in authoritarian regimes where citizens face restrictions on basic necessities based on their social credit scores or political views. The programmable nature of CBDCs allows for automatic enforcement of spending limits, geographic restrictions, and even expiration dates on savings. Financial transactions reveal intimate details about our lives, relationships, and beliefs; information that should remain private in free societies.</p> 3. How do privacy coins specifically address the challenges posed by a surveillance society in terms of financial freedom and individual autonomy? <p>Privacy coins utilize zero-knowledge proofs to completely hide transaction amounts, sender identities, and recipient addresses without relying on breakable encryption. This technology creates the digital equivalent of physical cash transactions as only the parties involved know the details. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies where all transactions are publicly visible, privacy coins ensure that even completely legal activities remain confidential. This protection is essential because financial surveillance can be used to target individuals for their political beliefs, personal relationships, or lifestyle choices, even when no laws are&nbsp;broken.</p> 4. We’ve seen regulators target privacy-centric cryptos. Do you really think there’s a future for such projects? <p>Privacy coins will survive regulatory pressure because the underlying technology cannot be eliminated, and economic incentives will always favour jurisdictions that embrace innovation. Just as governments couldn’t stop the internet despite its threat to traditional control mechanisms, cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow regardless of regulatory hostility. Competition between nations ensures that some will recognize the economic advantages of crypto-friendly policies. The fundamental properties of decentralized networks make them resistant to complete shutdown, and true privacy protocols represent technological advancement that cannot be uninvented.</p> 5. Are privacy coins essential for protecting civil liberties? <p>Privacy is a fundamental human right that forms the foundation of all other freedoms. Without financial privacy, individuals cannot exercise true autonomy in their personal, political, or economic choices. As Edward Snowden noted, “Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” History demonstrates that surveillance powers, once granted, are inevitably expanded and abused. Privacy coins provide a crucial check against governmental overreach and ensure that citizens retain control over their personal information and financial autonomy.</p> 6. Critics often link privacy coins to illicit activities. How do you respond to these concerns? <p>Criminals have always used whatever tools are available — cash, banks, cars, phones, and the internet — yet we don’t ban these technologies because of their misuse. Government agencies and traditional financial institutions, despite extensive AML and KYC regulations, remain involved in the largest financial crimes globally. Privacy coins simply extend the same confidentiality we expect from physical cash to digital transactions. The argument that only criminals need privacy is fundamentally flawed and ignores the legitimate need for financial confidentiality in protecting individuals from theft, coercion, political persecution, and corporate surveillance.</p> 7. Is it possible for privacy coins to exist in a way that balances individual privacy with the need for law enforcement to combat crime? If so,&nbsp;how? <p>The current system already demonstrates that financial surveillance fails to prevent crime while creating significant risks for law-abiding citizens. Public financial information would dramatically increase crimes like kidnapping, extortion, and home invasion by revealing individuals’ wealth. Privacy coins can coexist with law enforcement through targeted investigation methods that don’t require mass surveillance of all citizens. Exchange interfaces and optional transparency features can provide compliance pathways for those who choose them, while preserving the fundamental right to financial privacy for personal transactions.</p> 8. Do you foresee privacy coins becoming mainstream, or will they remain a niche aspect of the cryptocurrency market? <p>Privacy will become the defining issue of the next two years as CBDC implementations reveal their control mechanisms to the general public. Major blockchain projects are already integrating privacy features, which will dramatically increase awareness and adoption. Projects like Cardano’s Midnight are investing heavily in privacy infrastructure and education. As surveillance concerns become more apparent and privacy technology matures, the demand for financial confidentiality will drive mainstream adoption. The principle that “a rising tide lifts all boats” applies directly to the privacy coin ecosystem.</p> 9. If you were advising a government on how to approach privacy coins, what would be your key recommendations? <p>Governments should adopt a hands-off approach: no taxation, tracking, or restrictions on privacy coins. Public officials should use transparent, public blockchains for all government transactions to ensure accountability and eliminate corruption. Private citizens should have access to private transactions to maintain their freedom and autonomy. This approach recognizes that cryptocurrency technology cannot be stopped and will ultimately achieve the separation of money and state. Governments that embrace this reality early will benefit from increased innovation and economic growth, while those that resist will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.</p> 10. Imagine a future where central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are widely adopted and highly programmable. How would privacy coins fit into such a financial landscape? <p>In a CBDC-dominated landscape, privacy coins will likely operate through decentralized exchanges and circular economies, as centralized platforms may be restricted from supporting them. However, the excessive control mechanisms of CBDCs will likely accelerate adoption of privacy alternatives as citizens experience firsthand the limitations of programmable money. Privacy coins will serve as the escape valve for individuals seeking to maintain financial autonomy. The more restrictive CBDCs become, the more valuable privacy coins will appear to users who recognize the importance of financial freedom and personal sovereignty.</p> 11. If you had to design a “perfect” privacy coin, what features would it prioritize, and how would it address current criticisms? <p>A perfect privacy coin must prioritize usability, security, and regulatory compatibility while maintaining true decentralization. PIVX exemplifies this approach as a privacy-focused cryptocurrency dedicated to being private digital cash for the internet. Essential features&nbsp;include:</p>  Near-instant transactions for practical daily use, eliminating the delays that hinder adoption.  Zero-knowledge privacy protocols provide unbreakable transaction confidentiality without relying on potentially vulnerable encryption methods.  Fair launch principles with no ICO or premine ensure equitable distribution and prevent centralized control by early investors or developers.  Near-zero fees make the currency accessible to users worldwide, particularly in developing economies where transaction costs matter&nbsp;most.  FATF/AML/CFT compliance via special ‘Exchange Addresses’ mitigates regulatory concerns while maintaining privacy, demonstrating that privacy and compliance can coexist. Operating without a legal entity structure prevents single points of regulatory failure and government targeting.  Self-funding mechanisms through community governance ensure long-term sustainability without external dependencies.  A community-driven meritocracy ensures decisions benefit all users rather than corporate interests, while environmental sustainability through proof-of-stake consensus addresses climate concerns that plague energy-intensive cryptocurrencies.  Decentralized masternode governance distributes decision-making power across the network, preventing centralized control while maintaining network efficiency and security.  <p>These features collectively create a privacy coin that addresses current criticisms while remaining true to cryptocurrency’s foundational principles of decentralization and individual sovereignty.</p><p>PIVX.

  Partnering with Traversal: Because every engineer remembers their first time … troubleshooting   <p>Anish, Ahmed, Raaz and Raj are bringing AI to troubleshooting—one of the biggest pain points for engineering teams.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a>	 



Published June 18, 2025
  



TEAM TRAVERSAL.



 
<p>We’ve been looking for a company like <a href="https://www.traversal.com/">Traversal</a> for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more than a decade, we at Sequoia have been obsessed with <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-unstoppable-rise-of-the-developer-economy/">“the rise of the developer,”</a> guiding our partnerships with companies that cater to engineers like GitHub, MongoDB and Stripe. And Bogomil has been fascinated with observability for years: shortly after joining Sequoia in 2020, after a friend pointed out to him that “observability is a s***show,” he <a href="https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-future-of-observability-6918caaa021">identified</a> that a new generation of tools would help technical teams care for their systems.</p>



<p>More recently, it became clear that the road to reinventing observability ran through AI. Back in 2023, as GitHub Copilot caught lightning in a bottle, Charlie and our partners Stephanie and Josephine <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-powered-developer-tools/">recognized</a> that founders might apply AI to many problems engineering teams face beyond writing code. One we were excited about in particular was troubleshooting, the painstaking process of finding the root cause of a bug, often using observability data.</p>







<p>All we needed to do was find the right team to work with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Believe it or not, our relationship with Traversal’s team dates back years, too. Traversal’s founder, Anish Agarwal, knew our partner, Shaun Maguire, and former partner Dan Chen through their shared alma mater, Caltech. They remembered him as the star student who somehow managed to triple major, excel on the tennis team and still have a social life. Charlie knew co-founder Ahmed Lone, met the rest of the team and encouraged them to apply to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, our company-building program for Sequoia pre-seed and seed-stage founders.</p>



<p>They were the type of team we were looking for. In our view, AI troubleshooting was first and foremost an AI problem, and an observability problem only second. Traversal’s team of three Ph.D.s from MIT and Berkeley, who’d studied causal ML and reinforcement learning—and one former Citadel Securities quant trader who’d lived this problem firsthand—seemed like the right fit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2024, when we finally all got in one room—Sequoia’s San Francisco space atop a chocolate factory—it was obvious to us as investors what to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Observability is one of the crown jewels of infrastructure and a hotspot for generational companies. Businesses like Splunk, Datadog, Grafana and Cribl help thousands of engineers monitor their systems and generate billions in annual revenue in the process. And still, the job is unfinished. Troubleshooting remains deeply painful.</p>



<p>Picture getting woken up at 3 a.m., gathering with dozens of people in a Slack war room and “dumpster diving” through heaps of observability data to find the proverbial “needle in a haystack” root cause. That’s what engineers today do to troubleshoot. It takes hours, sometimes days, sometimes the needle is never found at all. When there are issues (and every software company has issues), slow troubleshooting costs companies dearly in terms of missed revenue and customer trust. And it costs devops and site reliability engineers (SREs) dearly in terms of lost sleep and missed dates.</p>



<p>Troubleshooting is so painful, in fact, that <a href="https://www.traversal.com/about-us">“Every engineer remembers their first time”</a>—their first production incident, that is—in the words of Traversal (then Interaction Labs) co-founder Ahmed, a former quant trader at Citadel Securities, where troubleshooting is about as high stakes as it gets. Below, he talks about a harrowing experience of troubleshooting, with minutes before the market opened.&nbsp;</p>



AHMED TALKING ABOUT HIS “FIRST TIME”—TROUBLESHOOTING—A HARROWING EXPERIENCE AS A QUANT TRADER, MINUTES BEFORE THE MARKET OPENED.&nbsp;



<p>Traversal automates troubleshooting. Their AI SRE uses a unique mix of LLMs and causal ML to do the dumpster diving, finding root causes automatically. Traversal does the dirty work, so engineers can fix problems ASAP. Companies save money and gain customer trust, and engineers no longer need to pull their hair out in the middle of the night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traversal only got started a year ago, and already they’re showing they can deliver real business ROI to companies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSvKGf2OGak">DigitalOcean</a>, American Express, Cloudways, Eventbrite and more. LLMs aren’t always great troubleshooters out of the box, but Traversal’s team has developed a unique approach: swarms of parallel investigations with proprietary statistical tools make them immediately effective at enterprise scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combine their technical skills and sense of humor with their customer obsession and ability to <a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/traversal">recruit exceptional talent</a>, and you’re starting to get a picture of Traversal’s team. That’s why we’re so excited to be their partners after leading their seed round a year ago, and to support their mission: making life for engineers and engineering teams much, much better.&nbsp;</p>

  Partnering with Crosby: A Law Firm at the Speed of AI  <p>Ryan, John and their team are pairing legal LLMs and bright legal minds to enable companies scaling quickly to execute their contracts faster than ever.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/alfred-lin/">Alfred Lin</a>	 



Published June 17, 2025
  



CROSBY CO-FOUNDERS JOHN SARIHAN AND RYAN DANIELS.<br>



 
<p>In the age of AI, everything from coding to design to sales is moving faster — but contracting remains slow and has become a major impediment, especially for companies that are scaling fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://crosbylegal.com/">Crosby</a> lets the fastest growing companies reach agreement between humans, at the speed of software. They’re bringing together world-class legal and engineering talent to build the world’s first hybrid law firm, one that combines human oversight with AI’s superhuman speed.</p>



<p>Semantics, details and nuance are foundational in law. Crosby co-founders Ryan Daniels and John Sarihan recognized that people are still better than technology at capturing the subtleties of certain clauses and connecting the dots between business context and legal documents. Crosby built their product accordingly, with both people and AI agents playing a vital role. Agents handle initial passes at standard changes, flag common issues and prepare preliminary redlines, allowing Crosby’s attorneys to focus on strategic decisions and complex legal reasoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That MSA you need signed ASAP? Crosby will return a marked-up copy in less than an hour, advising which terms to accept or push back on based on their context about your business. Crosby plugs into your existing deal desk workflow, ingests inbound contracts and order forms and delivers results faster than any human, at a fraction of the cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critical to Crosby’s success is the complex knowledge base they build for each customer, incorporating legal preferences and becoming more bespoke over time. Ultimately, Crosby will enter a negotiation understanding everything about your preferences — and the preferences of the business across the table — so it can suggest the optimal solution. Your contract process is faster and more affordable, without sacrificing trust or quality. Crosby provides your company the same legal resources as a larger enterprise, and frees up your GTM team to do what they do best: closing deals and winning, faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re already seeing this happen for Crosby’s customers, including Cursor, Clay and UnifyGTM. They’re processing sales contracts in two hours or less, saving thousands of dollars and dozens of hours as Crosby turns what once was an expensive, lengthy process into a competitive accelerant.</p>



<p>Like Crosby itself, Ryan and John’s partnership pairs exceptional legal and engineering talent. We at Sequoia already knew John, a phenomenal engineer and product leader, from his days at Ramp. Ryan worked with our general counsel at Cooley after researching legal AI at Stanford Law. The two of them are wonderfully complementary and have incredible chemistry, which has translated to them building a killer team and serving raving customers. We are proud to lead Crosby’s seed round, and to be alongside their <a href="https://crosby.ai/careers">expanding team</a> as they become a trusted partner for fast-growing companies.</p>

<p>I wrote extensively about AI last summer, starting with <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">AI’s $600B Question</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/">The Game Theory of AI CapEx</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-data-center-buildout/">AI is Shovel Ready</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/steel-servers-and-power/">Steel, Servers &amp; Power</a>, and ending with <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-ai-supply-chain-tug-of-war/">AI’s Supply Chain Tug of War</a>.</p>



<p>Reflecting one year later, it’s interesting how little has changed: AI’s $600B Question is now roughly AI’s $840B Question, assuming that Nvidia reaches something like $210B in run-rate data center revenue by year-end 2025. OpenAI remains the lion’s share of AI’s overall revenue, crossing $10B recently, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openais-annualized-revenue-hits-10-billion-up-55-billion-december-2024-2025-06-09/">Reuters</a>. The total revenue in the AI ecosystem still pales in comparison to the dollars that have been put into the ground — if anything, my estimates last year around how much revenue the Big Tech companies were making on AI were probably too high.</p>



<p>There have been three major improvements in AI over the last year: First, coding AI has really taken off. A year ago, the demos for these products were mind-blowing, and today, the coding AI space is generating something like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ai-vibe-coding-startups-burst-onto-scene-with-sky-high-valuations-2025-06-03/#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20AI%20coding,to%20build%20their%20own%20models.">$3B in run-rate revenue</a>. The second change is that reasoning has found product-market fit, and the AI ecosystem has gotten excited about a second scaling law, around inference-time compute. By repeatedly querying these models and by using reinforcement learning, we can get better, more robust results. And finally, there seems to be a <a href="https://x.com/deedydas/status/1932619060057084193">“smile curve”</a> around ChatGPT usage, where this new behavior is really getting ingrained into day-to-day life.</p>



<p>The app layer ecosystem for AI has continued to improve, leveraging cheap compute and integrated workflows to build durable businesses. More abundant compute has been good for the startup ecosystem, and companies like Harvey, Sierra, Abridge, SmarterDx, Perplexity, OpenEvidence, Clay, Sesame and many others have made great strides around packaging this capability for their customers. Our ambition one year ago was to back as many of these companies as possible, and that continues to be our ambition today.</p>



<p>There is one dynamic, however, that has really changed since last year. A year ago, everyone was talking about cluster size and pre-training scaling, and now that seems to have quietly disappeared from the public dialogue. Perhaps this is because new clusters are taking longer to get online, or because as Ilya Sutskever said in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1hdrjvq/ilyas_full_talk_at_neurips_2024_pretraining_as_we/">December</a>, “Pre-training as we know it will end.” By the same token, one year ago we were seeing a consolidation in research labs because of the daunting costs of building a foundation model lab. Microsoft/OpenAI, Amazon/Anthropic, Google, Meta and xAI emerged as five “finalists” in the AI race as others folded, because these companies had reached GPT-4 level models and had sufficient capital to continue scaling. Now, by contrast, a new cohort of players has sprouted up, including SSI, Thinking Machines, and DeepSeek, who claim talent, not raw compute scale, as their primary differentiators.</p>



<p>Whereas one year ago the narrative was around pre-training compute requirements driving consolidation, today the narrative is all about talent advantages being critical in a world of increasing compute abundance. This is especially true for Google and Meta. Google is under siege from a product positioning perspective and is doing everything in their power to reverse this dynamic. Meta’s bold decision to acquire a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/scale-ai-founder-wang-announces-exit-for-meta-part-of-14-billion-deal.html">49% stake in Scale</a> and bring in CEO Alex Wang to lead their new “founder mode” AI lab is an even more clear move in this direction. For both companies — and for the ecosystem at large — the message of 2025 is that large-scale clusters alone are insufficient. Everyone understands that new breakthroughs will be required to jump to the next level in the AI race — whether in reinforcement learning or elsewhere — and talent is the unlock to finding them.</p>



<p>With their obsessive focus on talent, the AI labs are increasingly looking like sports teams: They are each backed by a mega-rich tech company or individual. Star players can command pay packages in the tens of millions, hundreds of millions, or for the most outlier talent, seemingly even billions of dollars. Unlike sports teams where players often have long-term contracts, AI employment agreements are short-term and liquid, which means anyone can be poached at any time. One irony of this is that while the notion of AI race dynamics was originally popularized by the AI safety community as a boogeyman to avoid, this is exactly what has been wrought across two distinct domains: First compute and now talent.</p>



<p>I think this is a function of human nature. When have humans ever seen something wonderful, and then said, “Now we have enough, it’s time to cool off?” It is an intrinsic property of humanity that once critical thresholds are passed, we take things all the way to the extreme. We cannot hold ourselves back. And when the prize is as big as the perceived AI prize is, then any bottleneck that gets in the way of success — especially an illiquid bottleneck like talent — will be pushed to staggering levels.</p>



<p>And yet, even amidst this fierce competition, the broader AI ecosystem also feels calmer today than at any point in the last three years. That’s because for most people, the race itself is now a constant and the market structure feels stable. People are getting comfortable with the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-in-2025/">status quo</a>. The unstable competitive equilibrium is itself stable — for now.</p>

<p>Spain is set to roll out new legislation to tighten the leash on crypto tax reporting. Under the new directive, Spanish authorities will have the power to exchange data on digital assets held on international exchanges and seize cryptos from tax defaulters.</p><p>While proponents highlight the benefits of increased financial accountability, these new measures, which include comprehensive data reporting requirements for crypto exchanges and expanded asset seizure powers for tax authorities, point to the evolving relationship between digital assets and state&nbsp;control.</p><p>Once enforced, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) will be mandated to report extensive transaction data and user holdings directly to the Spanish tax agency. This aligns with the broader European Union’s Directive on Administrative Cooperation on Tax Transparency for Crypto-Assets (DAC8), a continent-wide initiative to address the challenges that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies presents for national tax collection.</p><p>Under DAC8, Spain’s tax authorities will not only receive data from domestic VASPs but also gain access to information on Spanish citizens’ crypto accounts held with exchanges in other EU member states, and potentially in third countries that enter into data-sharing agreements with the EU. This widespread information exchange is projected to bolster tax compliance across the EU significantly, with estimates suggesting billions in additional tax revenue. For Spanish crypto holders, this means a new era of heightened scrutiny regarding their digital asset activities, regardless of where their assets are&nbsp;held.</p><p>Adding another layer to this regulatory shift, the new Spanish law empowers the tax agency to directly seize the cryptocurrency holdings of individuals with outstanding tax debts. This expands the agency’s existing capabilities, which were traditionally limited to conventional bank accounts. The move underscores a clear intent to bring digital assets under the same enforcement umbrella as traditional financial instruments, providing the state with a more comprehensive toolkit for surveillance and debt recovery.</p><p>The EU’s DAC8 directive is set for full enforcement in January 2026, with the first data exchanges scheduled for late&nbsp;2027.</p><p>PIVX.

  Partnering with Aspora: Diaspora Banking Goes Global  <p>Parth and his team are bringing digital banking to immigrants around the world.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/luciana-lixandru/">Luciana Lixandru</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/george-robson/">George Robson</a>, and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/james-flynn/">James Flynn</a>	 



Published June 15, 2025
  



PARTH GARG, FOUNDER OF ASPORA.



 
<p>The day we met Parth Garg, we knew he was special. After an intro over Zoom, we scheduled a 24-hour trip to see him and the Aspora team in-person—and found them crammed into a Dubai hacker house, pushing tirelessly toward a major campaign. When we asked where we should go to discuss a possible partnership, Parth suggested perching on a few armless chairs in the apartment’s tiny, windowless and very active kitchen.</p>



<p>We ended up finding a spot to chat in our hotel that was a bit more comfortable for a three-hour meeting, but that moment reinforced what we already knew and loved about Parth: he was intensely focused on the company. Success in fintech often hinges on building not only in the right order, but also as quickly as possible. Parth is in the 99th percentile on both.</p>



<p>He is also smart, ambitious, decisive—and all the more impressive, self-taught. Born in India but growing up across the Middle East (where he played cricket, acted, participated in Physics Olympiads, and founded an NGO) Parth saw the roadblocks his parents and other non-resident Indians (NRIs) faced to participating in India’s economy. By age 21, he had dropped out of Stanford to solve the problem himself with <a href="https://www.aspora.com/">Aspora</a>.</p>



<p>The Indian diaspora represents one percent of the country’s population, but has a massively outsized impact on its economy. These 15 million NRIs don’t just send money home to their families. They also invest in the booming Indian stock market, take out loans, and account for close to a quarter of the country’s real estate transactions. But opening an NRI account with a legacy bank is still a painful, months-long process of mailing paper forms and even flying back to sign in-person.</p>



<p>This is a problem for Indians abroad, but also for most other immigrant communities.&nbsp;Aspora is bringing diaspora banking into the modern age, with fully digitized services to allow global diasporas to participate in their home countries’ growth stories—starting with non-resident Indians around the world. Parth and his team have already transformed remittances for these customers, streamlining the process of sending money home at half the cost of competing solutions. Next, Aspora will expand to offer a comprehensive neobanking product, with access to local savings, investing and more. And the product is just the beginning of Aspora’s growth: while the NRI market itself is massive, it is just one of many diasporas that want to support the economy at home.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia were privileged to be among Aspora’s first believers when we led their Series A late last year, and in the few short months since, their performance has reached new heights. Like Parth himself, the team around him is relentlessly driven and intent on delighting their customers, delivering constant product improvements and drastically cutting transaction times. Their customers have responded in kind, and total payment volume has increased every month, to approximately $2B today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To stay ahead of that rapid growth, Aspora is ramping up hiring, looking for ambitious, hungry people to help them solve this complex problem. If you are interested in joining this remarkable team, please <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Aspora">reach out</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Parth worked out of Sequoia’s London office in recent months, we’ve had a firsthand view of his leadership. He is a dynamo, with maturity to match his intensity and an ability to go deep on every aspect of the business, and our conviction in him and the high-caliber Aspora team has only grown. We are excited to support them as they scale—and as Aspora expands into the U.S., Canada and Europe—by doubling down and co-leading their Series B.</p>



<p>Aspora’s new HQ here in London is a far cry from that crowded apartment where we first met, but Parth and his team remain fiercely focused on the same mission that drove them back then. We can’t wait to see how they bring digital banking, and new opportunities, to immigrants all over the world.</p>

<p>San Francisco, CA, June 12, 2025 – At AWE USA 2025, XRSI, a global Standards Developing Organization (SDO), announced the launch of the <a href="https://xrsi.org/rdg">Responsible Data Governance (RDG) 2025v1</a>. This first-of-its-kind global standard is designed to help organizations mitigate data exposure risks across AI, cloud, immersive, and traditional environments. RDG offers a structured approach to building trust throughout the entire data lifecycle, encompassing creation and collection, storage, processing, sharing, archiving, and deletion.</p>



<p>RDG applies to any organization that designs, deploys, or operates technologies that interact with real-world user behavior, make algorithmic decisions, handles sensitive or inferred data that spans industries such as healthcare, education, government, and consumer platforms.</p>



<p>“RDG is how we move from aspiration to accountability,” said Kavya Pearlman, Founder and CEO of XRSI, “it gives organizations a clear, certifiable way to demonstrate responsible data use from the moment they begin.”</p>



<p>RDG turns fine-print promises into clear, auditable proof of trust.</p>



<p>From the moment you start your journey with RDG you earn a publicly verifiable Seal to demonstrate your commitment. This is a clear signal to your customer base of your intent to demonstrate your trust. As you go through your assessment and demonstrate adherence to the 7 goals of RDG, your certification is granted.</p>



<p></p>



 RDG – A New Global Baseline for Trustworthy Data Governance 



 
 
<p>The RDG standard is built around seven strategic goals:</p>



 
 Comprehensive Data Lifecycle Management 



 Role-based Accountability 



 Process Standardization 



 Third-Party Data Governance 



 Automated Decision Making &amp; Use of AI Systems 



 Alignment with Regulatory Compliance 



 Continuous Improvement 
 



<p></p>



<p>Certified organizations, through accredited Certifying Bodies (CBs), receive:</p>



 
 A two-year certification with annual check-ins 



 A publicly verifiable Seal of Trust 



 Audit reports and evidence-based validation 



 Sector-specific deployment support and custom integrations 
 
 



 

 
 



 RDG – Independent Certification Administered by Cautelare 



<p><a href="https://cautelare.com/">Cautelare is the Principal Certifying Body</a> responsible for ensuring the quality and long-term integrity of the RDG certification process. Tasked with administering assessments and overseeing compliance, Cautelare plays a critical role in upholding the RDG standard through impartial oversight and mission-aligned governance.</p>



<p>“We’re putting the XRSI RDG standard into practice by working directly with the visionary organizations that recognize its value,” said Kavya Pearlman, Founder and CEO of XRSI. “XRSI created the standard, but we’re choosing to stay actively involved to ensure that the first wave of adopters gets it right with Cautelare.”</p>



<p></p>



 RDG – Globally Aligned, Immediately Actionable 



<p>RDG functions as a flexible overlay to existing compliance regimes, simplifying complexity while providing a measurable path toward governance maturity and regulatory readiness.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



 RDG 2025v1 Release 



<p>The standard is available for reading now at <a href="https://rdg.xrsi.io">https://rdg.xrsi.io</a> <br>and is on its inaugural version (2025v1).</p>

  Partnering with Nominal: Powering the Next Era of Hardware Engineering  <p>Cameron, Jason and Bryce are building the modern software stack that hardware teams have always needed but never had.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/anas-biad/">Anas Biad</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/alfred-lin/">Alfred Lin</a>	 



Published June 12, 2025
  



Jason, Cameron and Bryce.



 
<p>Hardware engineers built the electric grid, put humans on the moon and connected continents with airplanes. They designed the world we live in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hardware manufacturing that enabled those innovations followed a linear process: build a prototype -&gt; test it -&gt; validate it -&gt; move to large-scale production. This process assumed long timelines, rigid production cycles and minimal testing after deployment. It worked in an era when hardware products were shipped every decade, not every year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we are entering a new age of hardware. Reindustrialization, rising defense spending, global competition and the pace set by companies like SpaceX are putting pressure on hardware teams to move fast. Today’s hardware engineers need to continuously test, build and improve their systems, not just once, but throughout the entire development and operations.</p>



<p>This approach of continuous building and testing is not a new concept. It happened in software engineering and defined the cloud era. But, it has mainly remained unachievable in hardware, as we simply didn’t have a modern, purpose-built technology stack for it. Instead, hardware engineers were relying on workarounds, often involving a patchwork of solutions not built for hardware telemetry, and strung together with custom code or working with incumbent hardware testing systems from the 1980s, intended for traditional hardware companies that ship new products every 10 years, not every 10 weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nominal’s three co-founders, Cameron McCord, Jason Hoch and Bryce Strauss, saw these pain points firsthand from their experiences at the U.S. Navy, Lockheed Martin and with Palantir’s customers. They founded Nominal to finally solve this and enable hardware engineers to continuously test and build physical products in the same way software engineers continuously test and build digital products.</p>



<p>Nominal is building a multi-product platform. There are currently two publicly available products, with additional announcements to follow.</p>



 
 <a href="https://nominal.io/">Nominal Core</a> was the first product. It enables engineering teams to manage, monitor, and analyze hardware telemetry data in a single, collaborative environment, from testing to production and operations. 



 <a href="https://nominal.io/connect">Nominal Connect</a> is the second product launched earlier this year. It’s a solution to build hardware-in-the-loop test applications for automation and edge processing. 
 



<p>These software-for-hardware products are already transforming how hardware engineers design and build their products. Nominal’s current customers range from modern hardware startups and scale-ups to very large enterprises, from defense/aerospace to energy and transportation, from the U.S. to Europe, and from the DoD to commercial customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These successes, among <a href="https://nominalinc.substack.com/s/field-notes">others</a>, are just the beginning, and we are excited to lead their Series B and be by their side in creating and defining this new software category that will power the next era of hardware.</p>

<p>Today Stripe is announcing the acquisition of our portfolio company Privy. We originally partnered with Henri Stern and Asta Li in the Seed Round (co-lead with Sequoia) in 2021, and have invested in every round since then (joining Paradigm and Ribbit Capital as they led later rounds). Henri’s reputation as a crisp intellectual and rigorous executor from his days at Protocol Labs made us pay attention when we heard he was going to build a new company, and meeting his co-founder Asta Li gave us the conviction that this was going to be an n of 1 team for the&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Privy started a little over three years ago and, in that short period, has built the preeminent infrastructure for the adoption of crypto wallets, supporting 75 million accounts, over 1,000 developer teams and billions of transactions. Maybe most importantly, Privy is a key enabling fabric for a plethora of crypto rails-based applications. We are ecstatic for the team, and have been in awe of their execution quality, drive and tenacity that powered them through the inevitable dark hours that arise on any entrepreneurial journey.</p><p>While discussing the merits of partnering with Stripe together, Henri said something to us that stuck: “it’s not a finishing line–it’s a starting line” — because Privy has also built a core pillar for the future adoption of stablecoins and the enablement of new financial applications. Teaming up with Stripe and working with the Bridge team, will allow Privy to tap into one of the internet’s largest ecosystems to further execute on their&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Though from the outside it may have looked like an easy ride for Henri and Asta, the truth is much more complicated. They started the company with a seemingly very different mission: to provide an infrastructure for privacy as a service so small to medium-sized companies could operate safely on sensitive user data without having to give up important usability features which rely on PII such as emails &amp; notifications. As user privacy &amp; security is a core part of the founding DNA of Privy, their evolution to providing leading wallet infrastructure was not only in line with their ideals but with the expertise they had already built in technologies such as TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) and safe UX. It was this focus on what is truly good for users that kept Henri and Asta focused through the crypto euphoria of 2021 to the depths of despair in 2022 and to where we are&nbsp;today.</p><p>We can’t wait to see what team Privy continues to build — and why don’t you consider<a href="https://www.privy.io/careers"> joining&nbsp;them</a>.</p>

  Privy and Stripe: Making the Future of Finance Frictionless  <p>Congratulations to Henri, Asta and the entire team.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/shaun-maguire/">Shaun Maguire</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a>	 



Published June 11, 2025
  



 
<p>At Sequoia, we aim to partner with outlier founders who see the future before it’s obvious. Henri and Asta were early to recognize the importance of seamless onchain experiences and helped define embedded wallets as a core category for anyone building on crypto rails. Today, we’re thrilled to share that Privy will be joining forces with Stripe.</p>



<p>Before Privy, Henri had done exceptional work at Protocol Labs and Asta was one of the first incredible engineers at Aurora. Beyond being stars at these Sequoia portfolio companies, Henri was friends with Shaun and Asta with Josephine. These deep relationships gave us strong conviction to be their very first believers, leading Privy’s seed round in 2021.</p>



<p>At the time, Henri and Asta had a bold vision for how to make crypto safer and more usable, even though account abstraction remained a concept and embedded wallets were just a theoretical idea. Over the last two years, crypto adoption in the real world has exploded, particularly in money movement. Wallets are key to unlocking even more growth. Privy’s mission of making it easy for developers to build experiences on crypto rails that are both frictionless and secure is now a pressing need—essential to giving more users worldwide access to the global financial system.</p>



<p>Joining Stripe will allow Privy to serve its existing customers with greater resources, and to empower more developers in changing how value moves through the internet. We have seen the benefits of that partnership with Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge earlier this year, and we believe this is just the beginning of a huge journey for Privy.</p>



<p>We couldn’t be more excited for Henri, Asta and the Privy team. As we wrote in our seed investment memo, Privy is addressing a sea change that will redefine global finance over the next 20 years. That opportunity hasn’t changed, but in joining Stripe, Privy can further catalyze it. Over the past 3 years, the Privy team has done an outstanding job, scaling to serve 75M+ accounts across 1,000+ developer teams. As part of Stripe, the potential ahead for Privy is boundless. We can’t wait to see how this team shapes the future of finance.</p>

<p>“The future of manufacturing is autonomous, powered by AI-based factory operating systems” is hardly a controversial statement. In fact, a glimpse into today’s most advanced factories already reveals a world where robots, not humans, perform many core manufacturing processes. So, one might think this is easy terrain for AI. Think&nbsp;again.</p><p>The reality is that the complexity and uniqueness of industrial use cases, coupled with diverse systems and machinery, legacy software, and entrenched data silos — all within high-stakes production environments — make impactful AI adoption a formidable challenge. Yet the imperative for AI in manufacturing continues to grow. Labour shortages, intense global competition, geopolitical pressures, and the relentless pace of technological advancement have left many industrials struggling to keep&nbsp;up.</p><p>What if there were a way to integrate AI into high-value manufacturing processes in a step-by-step manner, with immediate ROI? And what if these AI agents could be composed together to enable fully autonomous manufacturing?</p><p>Enter Manex AI (formerly Datagon&nbsp;AI)</p><p><a href="https://www.manex.ai/en">Manex AI</a> is currently deploying AI agents into the end-of-line quality assurance processes of Tier 1 manufacturers — including BMW, Stellantis, Rehau Automotive, TDK Electronics, Still, BSH, and Henkel — via its flagship product, Qualitatio. This solution helps reduce warranty costs and boost customer satisfaction by integrating directly with plant systems, including robots, human workflow tools, data sources, and sensor&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>Once embedded, Manex AI begins mapping and learning production processes, gradually expanding the range of use cases and value it delivers. This ease of adoption, combined with high impact, is what truly sets Manex AI&nbsp;apart.</p> Our Thesis <p>Industrial manufacturers are under growing margin pressure and are eager, yet slow, to adopt AI to optimize their operations. Rather than tackling deeply entrenched Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) head-on, Manex AI begins with nimble, high-ROI use cases that encourage quick adoption and build trust. From this entry point, the company can scale horizontally and vertically within each plant — expanding its footprint and progressively taking on more control over the production environment. In doing so, Manex AI becomes a critical enabler of AI adoption in industry.</p><p>Although only 18 months old, the company is already demonstrating strong growth and traction — a testament to the execution capabilities of Nathan Gruber, Andreas Schoch, Fabian Gruber, Philipp Becker, and the entire Manex AI&nbsp;team.</p><p>We are thrilled to support Manex AI in building the fabric layer technology for autonomous manufacturing, alongside Lightspeed, Capmont Technology, and the CDTM Venture Fund.
