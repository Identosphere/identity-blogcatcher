   In December, we opened a Helios poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to elect three members of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee, to decide whether ZIP 1014 should be amended to provide ZCG committee members with a stipend from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and to gather community sentiment […]

<p>In December, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a12e050e-9f1f-11ee-a9a0-6e1a1ab4deb2/view">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to elect three members of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee, to decide whether ZIP 1014 should be amended to provide ZCG committee members with a stipend from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and to gather community sentiment on the question of whether the Dev Fund should be replaced after it expires in late 2024.</p>



<p>The poll closed this morning and the results are in. </p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The results of the ZCG election are as follows: </p>



 
 Jason McGee – 111 votes 



 Michael Harms – 96 votes 



 Amber O’Hearn – 89 votes 



 Roosevelt Gordones – 69 votes 



 Kworks – 45 votes 
 



<p></p>



<p>Congratulations to Jason, Michael and Amber, who are duly reappointed to the ZCG Committee. Thank you also to Roosevelt and Kworks for volunteering to serve the Zcash community. </p>



 ​​Funding ZCG Committee Members’ Stipend 



<p>The poll respondents voted in favour of amending ZIP 1014 to provide a stipend of $115 USD per hour (up to a monthly maximum of $1,725 USD) to be paid in ZEC to ZCG Committee members from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, with 99 votes in favour versus 39 against. </p>



<p>We will therefore draft an appropriate amendment to ZIP 1014. </p>



 Assessing Community Sentiment Regarding the Future of Zcash Ecosystem Funding 



<p>To help obtain more clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem, we put the following question to ZCAP: In principle, would you support the introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>111 respondents voted Yes, and 27 respondents voted No. </p>



<p>We look forward to seeing further discussion and proposals from the community in the coming weeks about what form a new funding mechanism might take. </p>

 Why release a transparency report?&nbsp; 



<p>Electric Coin Co. (ECC)* is committed to openness and transparency — as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital currency, and in support of our mission to empower people with economic freedom. This transparency report details company income, expenses, and use of funds during Q2 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key takeaways</p>



 
 Bootstrap received coins at a value below the ECC operating expense level for Q2 2023. During this time, Bootstrap received coins at an average of $252K a month (at the Q2 average ZEC price, $33, for each of the three months’ distribution dates), and Bootstrap and ECC incurred average monthly expenses of approximately $631K.&nbsp; 



 At the end of Q2 2023, Bootstrap and ECC collectively held approximately $922K in USD and approximately 91.8K ZEC. As of December 21, 2023, the company held approximately $960K in USD and approximately 69K ZEC.&nbsp;

<p>As Ethereum ‘merged’ to its current proof-of-stake consensus model, the steep (for retail) minimum stake of 32 ETH created a serious risk of centralisation through staking delegation to centralised entities. Lido DAO was envisioned to preserve staking decentralisation, while also providing additional value for staked ETH in the form of liquid staking tokens (LST). However, as its market share reached the first threshold of 33%, concerns have started to be voiced regarding Lido’s own risk of centralisation. Through its dual governance model where stakers can veto $LDO voters, and the upcoming implementation of distributed validator technology (DVT) and community staking module (CSM), the Lido DAO aims to preserve staking decentralisation.</p><p>We were joined by Isidoros Passadis, contributor and Master of Validators at Lido DAO, to discuss Ethereum’s current liquid staking landscape, Lido’s governance model and what steps it takes to ensure staking decentralisation.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Isidoros’ background and how he started working at Lido DAO  Lido’s core architecture and how it ensures decentralisation  Transitioning from a curated node operator set to a permisionless model  Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)  Lido’s dual governance model  stETH bridging and use cases in DeFi  How Lido adapts to Ethereum forks &amp; EIPs  Maximum validator effective balance and minimal staking issuance  Ethereum vs. Lido governance  Lido’s approach to MEV  Restaking &amp; Eigenlayer  Expanding Lido to other chains  Lido’s market share and other liquid staking competitors  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/IsdrsP">Isidoros Passadis on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/LidoFinance">Lido on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Through techniques like ZK rollups, multiple transactions are bundled into a single proof, streamlining the verification process. This compact form of verification reduces computational requirements and enhances the network’s overall scalability. By processing larger volumes of transactions more efficiently, zero-knowledge proofs boost blockchain network throughput without compromising security or decentralisation. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic tools that work like magic tricks, allowing one party to prove they know something without revealing the actual details. They maintain confidentiality while confirming specific information and have a key role in web3. This article will explain what they are, how they work, their use cases in web3, and take a deep dive into how zero-knowledge proofs improve blockchain scalability.</p>



<p></p>



 What are zero-knowledge proofs? 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs, often referred to as ZKPs, are a clever way to prove something without revealing any details about it. Imagine being able to show you know a secret password without actually saying what the password is. That’s the magic of ZKPs – they allow one party to confirm they have certain information without giving away the information itself.</p>



<p>In every zero-knowledge proof, there’s a prover and a verifier. The prover wants to show the verifier that they know something without disclosing what it is. They do this by demonstrating knowledge of some facts that only the rightful owner of the information would know. It’s like solving a puzzle without showing the solution.</p>



<p>They can be used for a variety of purposes. Still, their main applications include improving data security, scalability, and privacy in blockchain transactions, safeguarding sensitive information in industries like healthcare and finance, and enabling secure authentication without unnecessary exposure of personal details.</p>



<p></p>



 How zero-knowledge proofs work (in simple terms) 



<p>While relatively simple at the surface, understanding the intricacies of zero-knowledge proofs can be complex. To explain how they work we will use a simple analogy:</p>



<p>A scientist claims to have discovered a complex mathematical proof for a groundbreaking theory. Verifying this proof conventionally requires extensive computational resources and time. Alternatively, using a zero-knowledge proof, the scientist can demonstrate the proof’s validity without divulging the entire process, significantly reducing the time needed for verification while ensuring the credibility of the discovery.</p>



<p>In essence, the zero-knowledge proof is a distilled version of the proof containing only the details necessary to prove its validity. When using zero-knowledge proofs in blockchain for improved scalability and privacy it works in similar ways. To explain how this works, consider the following scenario:<br><br>A validator has verified and put together a block of transactions that produces a certain hash value. To verify this hash (and thus the transactions inside the block), someone could verify this hash by following the exact same energy- and time-consuming process of recreating this block. However, another option would be for the validator to provide a succinct zero-knowledge proof to make it easy to verify the validity of this block without revealing the details. This proof is called a Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument, widely known as a ZK-SNARK.</p>



<p>Similar to the mathematical proof example, the validity of a statement can be verified quickly without revealing the underlying details of the statement.</p>



<p></p>



 Use cases of zero-knowledge proofs in Web3 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs have a variety of use cases within the web3 space, with some of the main ones being:</p>



 
 Enhancing privacy 



 Improving scalability 



 Enabling regulatory compliance 



 Secure authentication&nbsp; 
 



<p>Let’s look at each of these in more detail and how methods using zero-knowledge proofs differ from traditional methods.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can enhance privacy within web3 by concealing transaction details, such as sender addresses, transaction amounts, and contract terms. Unlike traditional blockchain transactions that are transparent and visible to all, zero-knowledge proofs enable confidential transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This heightened level of confidentiality ensures that sensitive data remains protected within decentralised systems. Moreover, zero-knowledge proofs facilitate private interactions, allowing users to engage in transactions and collaborations while maintaining their privacy. This advantage is particularly beneficial in business environments where discretion and confidentiality are paramount.</p>



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs surpass traditional methods by offering a higher level of confidentiality. By concealing transaction details and protecting sensitive data within decentralised systems, zero-knowledge proofs address concerns related to data breaches and unauthorised access. Additionally, their ability to enable private interactions ensures that users can engage securely in web3 environments without compromising their privacy. Another thing that sets them apart from existing privacy solutions is their ability to offer increased privacy with similar levels of security as their non-private counterparts.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for greater scalability 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are increasingly used in layer 2 scaling solutions as well as modern blockchain protocols for their ability to improve blockchain scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They achieve this by optimising data processing and reducing blockchain congestion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared to traditional methods, zero-knowledge proofs offer an optimised approach to data processing, reducing computational overhead and enhancing efficiency. This streamlined verification process improves scalability by enabling the processing of larger transaction volumes without congesting the blockchain network.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for better regulatory compliance 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can be useful in ensuring compliance with data regulations. They provide a more secure way to handle user data while keeping it private. By hiding sensitive bits, zero-knowledge proofs balance showing what’s needed and keeping things secret. This helps decentralised systems follow the rules without giving away personal details. They check data without revealing everything, keeping user info safe from breaches and hacks which happen regularly.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, zero-knowledge proofs are a clever way to aid in sticking to complex privacy rules while still being open. They make sure user data stays safe in decentralised systems, meeting rules and keeping trust and privacy intact in the web3 world.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for secure authentication 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs offer a secure method for verifying identities or approving actions without revealing unnecessary personal information. They function by allowing individuals to prove specific credentials without disclosing the exact details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In scenarios where secure interactions are vital, like proving age without revealing the birthdate or approving a transaction without disclosing account specifics, zero-knowledge proofs enable individuals to authenticate themselves or authorise actions while keeping sensitive information private. Amid B2B collaborations, where confidentiality is paramount, zero-knowledge proofs ensure secure interactions by permitting verifications without unnecessary exposure of private details, establishing trust without compromising confidentiality.</p>



<p>Overall, they serve as a discreet way for parties to validate identities or approve transactions securely. They enable necessary verifications while protecting sensitive information, and ensuring trusted and confidential interactions, particularly vital in B2B environments where secure collaborations rely on maintaining confidentiality.</p>



<p></p>



 Deep dive: Blockchain scalability with ZK Rollups 



<p>Let’s take a deeper dive into one of the most prominent applications of zero-knowledge proofs in web3. Scalability is a challenge as old as blockchain, and with an ever-increasing adoption of blockchain technology, there is also a constant need for increased scalability. ZK Rollups emerged as a potential solution for this challenge.</p>



<p></p>



 How ZK Rollups work 



<p>ZK Rollups function by grouping multiple user transactions off-chain and then submitting these bundled transactions as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Alongside this batched transaction, a succinct proof, derived from zero-knowledge proofs, is added to validate the correctness of these bundled transactions. To be specific, a ZK rollup follows these steps:</p>



 
 Transaction bundling: Initially, numerous individual user transactions occur off-chain, which are grouped or bundled together into a single package. 
 



 
 On-chain submission: This bundled package is then submitted as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Rather than posting each transaction separately on the main chain, ZK Rollups compress these transactions into a single entry. 
 



 
 Accompanying zero-knowledge proof: Alongside this single transaction, a concise proof is included. This proof is derived using zero-knowledge techniques, ensuring that it confirms the validity of all the transactions within the bundle without disclosing the specific details of each individual transaction. 
 



 
 Verification process: On the main chain, validators or smart contracts verify this bundled transaction using the accompanying proof. The proof allows for a swift verification process without unravelling the details of each transaction within the bundle. 
 



 
 Final confirmation: Once verified, the bundled transactions are confirmed on the main chain. The main chain acknowledges the validity of these transactions, thereby updating the blockchain’s state. 
 



<p>This method significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored on the main blockchain. At the same time, it maintains the ability to verify the accuracy and integrity of these transactions. It optimises blockchain scalability by condensing multiple transactions into a single entry and facilitating a more efficient verification process using the accompanying zero-knowledge proof.</p>







<p>To make this even more clear, the above image visualises these steps.</p>



<p></p>



 The benefits of ZK Rollups 



<p>The efficiency of ZK Rollups lies in their ability to maintain security guarantees of the underlying blockchain while vastly improving its scalability. Users benefit from reduced transaction fees and faster transaction finality, making ZK Rollups a promising avenue for scaling Ethereum and other blockchain networks. This technique optimises the blockchain’s capacity to handle a higher volume of transactions, paving the way for broader adoption and enhanced usability of dApps.</p>



<p>As the development and adoption of ZK Rollups continue to evolve, ongoing research and advancements aim to further enhance their efficiency and usability. The synergy between ZK Rollups and zero-knowledge proofs showcases a promising path towards resolving scalability issues faced by blockchain networks. It offers a scalable solution without compromising the foundational principles of security and decentralisation.</p>



<p>In summary, ZK Rollups represent a significant leap forward in addressing the scalability concerns of blockchain networks. By leveraging the power of zero-knowledge proofs, they pave the way for a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem, laying the groundwork for a future where decentralised applications can operate at scale without compromising on security.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are complex mathematical proofs that effectively allow parties to prove information without divulging the details. They can be used in web3 to improve scalability, increase privacy, boost compliance, and allow for better authentication. They are the cornerstone to the future of web3 and will be central in existing and future web3 use cases.</p>

Manwendra brings diversified experience across industries, including as the first marketer for blockchain analytics firm, <a href="https://www.merklescience.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Merkle Science</a>. Before moving to Web3, Manwendra was a marketer at leading cybersecurity firm, <a href="https://www.radware.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Radware</a>(NASDAQ: RDWR).&nbsp;</p><p>Panther plans to further expand its marketing team with two more hires in the coming weeks.</p> R&amp;D Updates  Product Updates <p>In 2023, We made significant product development progress. We started the year with a workshop in Dubai (UAE) to evaluate our progress, examine the market fit of our product, compliance requirements, and institutional perspectives.</p><p>The workshop's goal was to strategically position Panther and our suite of products to align with the anticipated growth and adoption of the DeFi. After the conclusion of the workshop, we recognized that privacy as a feature couldn’t be a differentiator if we can’t enable practical applications of it. And, to achieve this for a DeFi protocol, compliance support is essential. We noted that privacy and compliance should coexist, but it requires more effort and innovation, particularly in leveraging zero-knowledge technology. Additionally, we aimed to enhance the efficiency of our protocol without overwhelming the user experience with an excess of Zero-Knowledge proofs.</p><p>As a result, we revamped our Product Architecture to align with industry needs, incorporating several outcomes from the workshop:&nbsp;</p>  Integrate with third-party compliance providers that can satisfy the new Panther design requirements.  Create a bank account-like on-chain identity ( zAccount) which acts as a link for all transactions users perform. zAccount is further crucial for compliance as it is activated only after a successful KYC completion.&nbsp;  Data Safe mechanism to satisfy AML requirements.&nbsp;  Introduce Zones to allow institutions to become licensed Zone Managers and run a dedicated zone to enable their customers to trade with whitelisted assets and counterparties.&nbsp;  Oshiya (referred to as Panther Miner) for off-chain zero-knowledge proof computation and to reduce the update on every transaction by batching 64 transactions into one. A concept that lets users put their transactions on a “bus queue”.  DeFi adaptors logic to align with the new architecture.  Support interchain communication, scheduled for V2.  <p>After 4-6 months of development, including smart contract development, circuit development, and integrations with PureFi, we began deploying features on the Mumbai test network. This process involved continuous and iterative development of the dApp. We further devised an incentivized testnet plan, organizing the testnet releases into 8 stages.</p><p>Initially, we estimated three weeks of dApp development. However, we encountered internal bugs and external issues during the testing phase, doubling the anticipated duration.</p> Testnet Updates <p>The testnet currently has 400 users and we’ve distributed a total of over 200,000 $ZKP as rewards. The proposed total amount of Testnet rewards is 1.5M $ZKP, with an additional 0.5M $ZKP in reserve to cover any additional rewards, if necessary.</p><p>Have you signed up for our testnet yet?<a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTB8MP6VMtJ2VMERcwLokZ3LLSHZdKn3j32QqLN1FMFRN/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Sign up here</a> to join our community and receive your $ZKP rewards.Here’s a quick recap of our testnet stages.</p><p>Testnet Stage 0</p><p>In July this year, we launched Panther Stage 0. In this Stage, we released the Panther Miner, a specialized miner designed to interact with a blockchain network. This testing stage (and activity in production) is directed towards miners, a key role in the Panther ecosystem, as opposed to DeFi users. Complete announcement <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage0-live/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 1</p><p>After a successful Stage 0, in August this year, we released Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet. In this Stage, testnet users were allowed to test two of Panther’s most anticipated innovations: third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts. Learn more <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 2</p><p>In November, we released the second stage of our testnet. This second phase was designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. More information on Stage 2 <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 3</p><p>Stage 3 development is complete, and internal testing has begun. This third phase will allow users to whitelist test Matic in addition to test ZKPs into Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.</p><p>Further, when it comes to $ZKP, users can now deposit and store $ZKP either as a zAsset ($zZKP) or as a zAccount Gas (Gas $zZKP). At the time of deposit, testnet users will have the flexibility to divide their ZKP deposit amount between the two. The Gas $zZKP can be used to pay protocol fees, relayers, Oshiya, and any external services that enhance protocol services beyond the core.</p><p>Stage 3 is undergoing internal testing at the time of publishing this year-end update and will be released immediately after the tests are completed.</p> V1 Launch Updates <p>We've been working to streamline our development process, make integration testing more efficient, and possibly work on two testnet stages parallelly to ensure we meet the deadline for the V1 release.</p><p>Audits</p><p>The suggested plan is to undergo two sets of audits before the mainnet launch. A pre-audit will be done in January and then a final audit will be done once all stages are released, tested and bugs are resolved. </p><p>V1 Launch and expansion to multiple chains</p><p>V1 is expected to be live after the second Audit. After the successful launch of V1, the plan is to extend V1 to different EVM chains, subject to community voting and approval.&nbsp;</p> Research Initiatives <p>In 2023, we published two research papers in the International Association for Cryptologic Research: (1) A flexible Snark via the monomial basis, and (2) An optimization of the addition gate count in Plonkish circuits.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1255?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">first paper</a> presents a new pairing-based Snark. The principle advantage of which is, in contrast to other Snarks such as Groth16 and Plonk, it allows freedom in the choice of an elliptic curve with the consequential benefit of supporting non-native field arithmetic (a considerable bottle-neck for other Snarks). This research was also presented at the ETH Privacy Conference in Istanbul.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1264?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">second paper</a> proposes a generalization of Plonk’s permutation argument to obtain a protocol on weighted sums which has the benefit of eliminating intermediate gates from high fan-in additions in circuits with Plonkish arithmetization.</p><p>Other research work includes a survey paper (to be completed soon) that focuses on different approaches to Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) clients via snarks.&nbsp;</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that strive to meet regulatory standards and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther’s zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

 📝🔖Lists to bookmark: What to read, watch, play this winter&nbsp; <p>Here are some books (and films, and shows, and games, and apps) that various a16z crypto team members are reading, watching, playing. The resulting list spans everything from magic shows to code-editing apps that integrate LLMs to many must-watch recommendations for your holiday TV queues. </p><p>You can learn a lot about a culture through its perennial passions: For instance, science and science-fiction genres have strong showings on our lists every time. Meanwhile, repeated book recommendations this year include Martha Wells’s The Murderbot Diaries series,&nbsp;and J. Storrs Hall’s investigation of tech stagnation Where Is My Flying Car? Repeats recurring from past lists include Ananyo Bhattacharya’s biography of John von Neumann,&nbsp;The Man from the Future; David Deutsch’s The Beginning of Infinity; Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan quartet; Cixin Liu’s Three Body Problem trilogy; Emily St. John Mandel’s Station Eleven; Andy Weir’s space thriller Project Hail Mary; and Gabrielle Zevin’s novel about love in the time of gaming: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. See the list below for more recommendations -- including links to years past with even more recs for you!</p><p>➡️ <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/listicles/reading-watching-playing-list-winter-2023/">check out the winter 2023 list</a></p><p>In the spirit of sharing <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/what-were-reading">what we're reading</a> (a regular tradition around here, as you can see!), we also just published a list of books we curated for the giveaway library at our second annual a16z crypto Founders Summit. (You can find the inaugural list <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/books-for-crypto-builders-beyond-founder-summit-library-2022/">from 2022 here</a>). This year’s list also includes personal “staff picks” notes for some of the books -- which range from biographies to organizational histories to the process of innovation and creativity.</p><p>➡️ <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/books-for-builders-crypto-tech-beyond-2023/">check out the summit 2023 list</a></p> 📚🎁Knowledge to gift this season: 2 upcoming new books  <p>Here are two books from a16z crypto authors you can order as last-minute holiday gifts, or to help the curious people in your life plan get smarter in the new year… </p><p>The Everything Token: How NFTs and Web3 Will Transform the Way We Buy, Sell, and Create is a must-read for anyone -- whether brand marketer, company leader, entrepreneur, or artist -- who wants to understand all things NFTs. The new book, co-authored by a16z crypto research partner and Harvard Business School professor Scott Kominers, comes out next month (Portfolio, January 23), and demystifies the coming digital revolution around NFTs. Because NFTs aren’t just pictures on the internet, or a fad that’s come and gone -- they’re a new technology for creating digital assets, and providing irrefutable proof of ownership. NFTs open up markets that have never before existed, and are already revolutionizing commerce and brand-building for companies, while transforming people’s online and offline interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>➡️ <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/723505/the-everything-token-by-steve-kaczynski-and-scott-duke-kominers/">order here</a></p><p>Read Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet is a must-read for anyone -- internet users, business leaders, creators, entrepreneurs, the tech-curious -- who wants to understand where we’ve been and where we’re going. It provides a vision for a better internet, a clarion call for anyone looking to navigate or build the future, and a playbook for getting there. Penned by Andreessen Horowitz general partner &amp; a16z crypto founding partner Chris Dixon, the book comes out soon (Random House, January 30 in the U.S.; Cornerstone, February 1 in the U.K.). But if you order now, you can unlock various special offers -- from a unique generative art NFT via special bookmark (plus discount from list price), to a signed copy…&nbsp;</p><p>➡️ <a href="https://800ceoread.com/coupons/redeem/readwriteownpresale">order here for bookmark-NFT</a> / <a href="https://www.mcnallyjackson.com/read-write-own-building-next-era-internet-signed-pre-order">order here for signed copy</a></p> 📹🎧Watch/ listen: On the decentralized web, ground truth, and human rights  <p>For over two decades, Jonathan Dotan has navigated the intersections of media, tech, and policy -- as a tech founder and Emmy-nominated producer, including six seasons as a writer on HBO's Silicon Valley. Dotan is also the founding director of The Starling Lab at Stanford University &amp; USC -- which prototypes tools and principles to bring historians, legal experts, and journalists into the new era of web3 -- and where he leads applied research on the decentralized web and human rights. &nbsp;</p><p>Dotan is also a fellow at Stanford’s Center for Blockchain Research and a lecturer at Stanford’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate School of Business. He recently delivered a short presentation on “hacking authenticity” and the enduring promise of web3 at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDkUlpHQ4kM&amp;list=PLjQ9HCQMu_8zFcJeaphDRBEnsyPgEG-6X">second annual a16z crypto Founders Summit</a>, followed by a discussion with a16z crypto’s Robert Hackett on how cryptographic technologies can help establish ground truth in conflict zones; the history of open source regulation; crises in various regions around the world top of mind right now, plus the role of technology, and more.

      4.2.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of ZEN 4.2.0 to Mainnet later next January 2024.  Pre-release 4.2.0-rc1 will perform a network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1396500, on January 3rd, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated.  IMPORTANT: 4.2.0 is expected to be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will not be possible anymore to unshield funds from private addresses to normal transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen. Unshielding will still be possible to P2SH (multisignature) addresses, but the process to do so will be more involved.  Because of this, we recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses in Sphere by Horizen before February 2024. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.    <p>Main Features (from 4.1.1 to 4.2.0-rc1):&nbsp;</p>Shielded Pool Deprecation:<br>Unshielding RestrictionsPR <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/pull/624">#624</a> is a follow-up in the gradual path of shielded pool deprecation, it introduces a hard fork requiring the unshielding of private funds to target only script addresses. After the hard fork, unshielding to P2PKH addresses or to P2PK addresses will not be allowed. For this reason, the following RPC commands have been (partially) deprecated: z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress (check inline documentation for additional details).<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

<p>Today, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a12e050e-9f1f-11ee-a9a0-6e1a1ab4deb2/view">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), which will run until December 31st. The purpose of this poll is threefold:&nbsp;</p>



 
 to fill three seats on the Zcash Community Grants committee,&nbsp; 



 to solicit feedback from the community on a proposal to pay a stipend to ZCG committee members, and&nbsp; 



 to assess community sentiment on the question of whether a new funding mechanism should be introduced to replace (or extend) the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>Members of the <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) committee are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel, and serve a one year term. Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year. Last month, <a href="https://zfnd.org/opening-nominations-for-the-zcash-community-grants-committee-december-2023/">we invited candidates</a> to express their interest in serving on the committee.</p>



<p>Five candidates are standing for three seats on the committee. Here is the list of candidates, with links to their candidacy announcements on the Zcash community forum:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/jason-mcgee-for-zcg-december-2023/46154">Jason McGee</a> 



 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/michael-brunchtime-harms-for-zcg-december-2023/46160">Michael Harms</a> 



 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/roosevelt-gordones-for-zcg-december-2023/46161">Roosevelt Gordones</a> 



 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/amber-ambimorph-for-zcg-december-2023/46166">Amber O’Hearn</a> 



 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/kworks-for-zcg-december-2023/46168">Kworks</a> 
 



<p></p>



<p>Last Thursday, the candidates took part in a Community Call, during which they introduced themselves and answered questions from the Zcash community. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/KbIM4yNRxts?si=NhncKMnXzd1j4oDq">a recording of the call on Youtube</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-GbVFA1csIgPbvHOR-1ruOlh7YdA-CHvMtd6R8iSdY">ZCAP members</a> should check their mailbox for instructions on how to vote. In the past, Helios emails have sometimes been flagged as spam, so if you can’t find the instructions please check your Spam folder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good luck to all the candidates, and thank you for volunteering to serve on the ZCG committee!&nbsp;</p>



 ​​Funding ZCG Committee Members’ Stipend 



<p>Since its inception, the Zcash Foundation has provided a stipend to members of the Zcash Community Grants committee. Last month, we shared the news that this stipend would be reduced from its current level of $1,725 USD to $650 USD (paid in ZEC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several community members have expressed concerns that this reduction may have a detrimental impact on the Zcash Community Grants program. ZCG committee member GGuy has proposed that the stipend be maintained at its current level by funding it from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, we are putting the following question to ZCAP: Do you support amending ZIP 1014 to provide a stipend of $115 USD per hour (up to a monthly maximum of $1,725 USD) to be paid in ZEC to ZCG Committee members from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forum discussion of this proposal can be found <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">h</a><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">e</a><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">re</a>.</p>



<p>If ZCAP approves this proposal, we will draft an amendment to <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a> to permit for a stipend to be paid from the Major Grants slice, with the hourly rate and cap to be set or changed by ZCAP poll. Note that the text of the amendment will be finalized by the Zcash Foundation after the results of the ZCAP poll are known, and following consultation with legal counsel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If ZCAP approves the stipend, it is expected that any time for which ZCG Committee members claim the stipend would be in furtherance of the stated purpose of the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and the ZCG Committee, as set forth in ZIP 1014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If approved, the stipend will be subject to the same policies that govern similar payments by ZF, and may be subject to veto if the Foundation judges them to violate U.S. law or the ZF’s reporting requirements and other (current or future) obligations under applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS) regulations.</p>



 Assessing Community Sentiment Regarding the Future of Zcash Ecosystem Funding 



<p>Earlier this year, members of the Zcash community began discussing what should happen after the current Dev Fund sunsets in late 2024. In October, we published a <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-future-of-zcash-ecosystem-development-funding/">blog post</a> explaining how the Zcash Foundation will support the Zcash community in debating and deciding whether or not to institute a new ecosystem funding mechanism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During discussions on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/dev-fund-2024-community-poll-discussion-megathread/44527">Zcash Community Forum</a> and community-organized <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1eaKbrNVmmVKX">Twitter Space discussions</a>, some strong opinions have been expressed both for and against the concept of renewing or replacing the current Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help obtain more clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem, we are initiating an advisory poll of ZCAP on this question: In principle, would you support the introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope that the result of this advisory poll (which will be released alongside the results of the ZCG election in early January) will help move discussion about Zcash ecosystem funding forward, and help community members draft more specific proposals in early 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s my great honor to be asked to lead ECC as CEO.</p>



<p>I want to thank Zooko for everything he’s taught me in the six years that I’ve known him. I have deep respect and admiration for Zooko and his contributions to this industry and to mankind. He is a truly remarkable human. There will only ever be one Zooko.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash is a special project. Its purpose to empower economic freedom is wholesome and good. Its legacy is indelible. The innovation within and the talent behind it are undeniable. That it flourishes is vital. All the earth must have access to private, self-sovereign money if we are to be free.</p>



<p>To realize it, we must begin to move into a new season with a different rhythm. Our focus will be to find product-market fit. That will require a continuous and iterative process of observation, hypotheses development, and testing. We will work with you to invent new things.</p>



<p>This will be a time of wide-eyed discovery, experimentation, and pulling our strengths together to make magic happen. We will be one team, in concert with one another, rapidly ideating and iterating, while working collaboratively with many across the Zcash and crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>My near term priorities are threefold:</p>



 
 Remove friction and barriers, at ECC and within the community, that impede our ability to iterate quickly 



 Focus efforts to exponentially increase Zcash utility through user-focused products and continual feedback 



 Secure ECC financial sustainability so we can deliver more, for longer 
 



<p>In support of these priorities, a few changes will immediately take effect:</p>



 
 We will optimize ECC’s organizational structure to support efficiency and improve the likelihood of our success. 



 Internal processes and policies will change to support increased focus, empowerment, and voice. 
 



<p>While I have been asked by ECC to formally help forge a new path ahead, ECC is only one participant in the Zcash community. Realizing a renewed Zcash requires a chorus of voices, both within ECC and across the Zcash community. I look forward to collaborating with you.</p>



<p>I’d like to thank Zooko and the other Bootstrap (ECC parent) Board members, including Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Michelle Lai, and Zaki Manian, for your leadership, and thoughtfulness. This trust is the honor of my professional life.</p>



<p>I’d also like to thank the many of you across the community who have engaged with me in recent weeks on the future of Zcash — ideating, dreaming, encouraging, and collaborating. You know who you are, and you’re invaluable both to me and this legacy we’re collectively building with Zcash. We all need each other, now more than ever. Let’s go!</p>

<p>We are writing to share some significant news regarding the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and our path ahead. We are opening a new chapter in our story, with a new strategic roadmap, under new leadership.</p>



<p>Since 2015, when ECC (then known as the Zcash Company) was formed, Zooko has been our leader — and one of the most important and revered figures in the crypto and blockchain universe. Under his leadership, ECC launched Zcash in 2016 and since then has contributed groundbreaking technology that underpins Zcash — and a majority of respected crypto projects that exist today.</p>



<p>A few highlights:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In Zcash, ECC delivered the first real-world application of zero-knowledge proofs, a novel method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This is one of the most important contributions to blockchain tech since 2008.&nbsp; 



 The Sapling upgrade for Zcash made mobile-wallet shielded transactions possible for the first time, paving the way for broader adoption of private money. 



 Halo, a cryptographic breakthrough, is a zero-knowledge proving system that enables recursion without a trusted setup in an efficient way. Halo on Zcash made trustless, private digital cash payments on mobile phones possible for the first time.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Now, it’s time to start a new chapter. Josh Swihart, formerly SVP of Growth at ECC, will return to ECC and take over the reins from Zooko as CEO. He will be responsible for all strategic and tactical decisions. Zooko will remain in his role as a director on the board of the Bootstrap Project, the parent company of ECC. And first, he will take some much-deserved time off. Together, we will fully support and enable Josh to lead ECC into a new chapter of service to humanity.</p>



<p>Fulfilling our mission of economic freedom requires not just groundbreaking technology, but also great products that bring joy to the people who use them. So today we’re excited to redouble our focus on the Zcash user, and we feel confident in Josh’s leadership — in finding product-market fit, unlocking new partnerships and collaboration, improving Zcash usability, and increasing adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to a vision for ECC and an optimistic passion for Zcash, Josh has a strong entrepreneurial, technical, and product background. He is committed to fostering broad inclusivity within the Zcash community, and he’ll share more on that with you shortly.</p>



<p>We have challenging but exciting days ahead. We’re here for it. Thank you for standing with us.</p>



<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>Modern AI has allowed us to build the world’s first <a href="https://youtu.be/0wIUK0nsyUg?feature=shared&amp;t=1685">creative computers</a>. Fields that once seemed uniquely human — like visual art, writing, music, or even the art of conversation — are now accessible to software in ways we couldn’t previously imagine. For many consumer AI apps, this is an incredible and groundbreaking feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For business applications, though, creativity poses a problem. Lack of reliability in AI systems (i.e., their tendency to say things that might offend customers, violate compliance rules, or otherwise damage the business) is one of the biggest barriers to widespread adoption in the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is probably no closed-form solution to AI reliability. Building perfectly well-behaved applications would defeat the purpose of using AI in the first place (i.e., its creative nature). But it is possible to put bounds around acceptable model outputs, if developers have the right tools and primitives to express their intentions. And it is certainly valuable to at least have a better understanding of whether AI behavior has changed. Building this framework is a massive opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why we’re thrilled to announce our seed investment in <a href="https://distributional.com/">Distributional</a>. Distributional is building a platform for robust and repeatable testing of AI and machine learning models. The company’s core observation is that rigorous testing, as part of the CI/CD process, has been critical to achieving reliable performance in traditional software development. Good software teams don’t push to prod without passing their build tests first.</p>
<p>The Distributional team believes the same approach will work in AI, but that the right tools don’t yet exist. Traditional testing frameworks only provide static checks — confirming that a piece of code produces the same result every time — while most AI/ ML tools are based on bespoke evaluation functions or manual “vibe checks.” In a sense, Distributional combines these approaches. It provides a standard set of tests (e.g., Python functions) designed to run in the CI/CD pipeline, which work natively with dynamic systems (e.g., checking that code produces results within a certain acceptable range, or distribution, with each run).</p>
<p>The Distributional team has met with more than 25 AI leaders from Fortune 100 companies, AI startups, and financial institutions, and has received early validation on its approach. Each leader identified testing as one of the top barriers to AI adoption within their organization, and many even agreed to become early beta customers, provide ongoing product feedback, or support the company in an effort to help solve the problem. It’s easy to see why users are so eager to find a solution, when you consider what’s at stake: One CTO from a Fortune 100 technology company believes a lack of reliability in AI systems costs their company $10 million a day.</p>
<p>We first met Scott Clark, the CEO of Distributional, back in 2016 through our investment in his prior company, SigOpt. SigOpt was an MLops company in the supervised learning era, and was ultimately <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/sigopt-to-scale-ai-productivity-performance.html">acquired by Intel in 2020</a>, where Scott became a VP and GM for AI. He lived the AI-reliability problem every day through the customers he supported at those companies. He’s a zealot for solving hard statistical problems in the real world, and he’s now applying his passion and experience to tackle AI reliability.</p>
<p>We couldn’t be more excited to work again with Scott, Nick Payton, David Rosales, Michael McCourt, and the rest of the team to help make creative computers a bit more well-behaved.</p>

<p>As software has eaten the world, it has become integral to every industry and nearly every endeavor in our society. As a result, the governments around the world have become increasingly interested in the implications and how they might regulate the technology.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen with Internet regulation in the 1990s, high quality regulation can enable an industry to thrive while protecting consumers. However, as we’ve seen with the regulation of nuclear power, misguided and politicized regulation can kill an industry and greatly exacerbate problems like climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that advancing technology is critical for humanity’s future, so we will, for the first time, get involved with politics by supporting candidates who align with our vision and values specifically for technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While “Big Tech” is well represented in Washington D.C., their interests are often at odds with a positive technological future as they are more interested in regulatory capture and preserving their monopolies. As a result, technology startups need a voice.</p>
<p>We are non-partisan, one issue voters: If a candidate supports an optimistic technology-enabled future, we are for them. If they want to choke off important technologies, we are against them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, we believe:</p>
 
 America’s best days are ahead if we retain our global technology leadership. The primary thing that can undermine that is misguided regulatory policy. 
 Artificial Intelligence has the potential to uplift all of humanity to an unprecedented quality of living and must not be choked off in its infancy. We can do this by requiring that AI behaves within the law and rules of our society without regulating math, FLOPs, methods of R&amp;D, and other misguided ideas. 
 Decentralized technologies from the blockchain/crypto/web3 ecosystem will create a fairer, more inclusive economy than the centralized, monopoly-enabling technologies of web 2 and the industrial-era financial system. Still, we need clear regulation to eliminate bad actors exploiting the technology for nefarious purposes. 
 We are entering the golden era of biological research. AI is maturing at a time when life sciences and healthcare are also transforming into data-driven disciplines, with both industries increasingly driven by AI and engineering, with its power and opportunity to fundamentally change how we diagnose, treat, and manage disease and deliver health. However our regulatory regime and processes are built based on a model of crude industrial revolution era technologies. As a result, we risk harming far more people than we save with our “safety” measures. 
 
<p>Every penny we donate will go to support like-minded candidates and oppose candidates who aim to kill America’s advanced technological future. </p>

<p>While the marketplace business model is evergreen, every new platform changes how and where transactions happen. The Internet took us from classifieds and poster boards to sites like Amazon, eBay, and Craigslist, while mobile enabled apps like DoorDash, Uber, and Instacart.</p>
<p>Now, we believe generative AI promises to revolutionize marketplaces again. It will not only transform how products and services are sold — but also how they are made.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-1-ICONS-1.png"></a></p>
<p>GenAI will shake the foundations of the supply side for marketplaces, while also giving buyers access to unprecedented inventory and creating a much better user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next 3 to 5 years, we expect some existing marketplaces will pivot, some will go out of business, and some will be supercharged with the help of AI. We’ll also see a group of new companies built from the “ground up” around AI, which will likely look more dynamic than anything we’ve seen before.</p>
<p>Here’s where I see the opportunities — and what founders of legacy marketplaces may want to consider.</p>
 Demand Side   
<p>AI’s impact on buyers (the demand side) should be fairly consistent across marketplaces, and almost entirely positive. Both new and existing marketplaces that embrace AI should see key improvements such as:&nbsp;</p>
 New search modalities  
<p>Buyers will no longer have to search for items by an exact title, or meander through complex filters. They can use natural language, images, or even just a vibe to describe what they’re looking for and get results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes will reduce scrolling fatigue and make it more likely for a search to convert into a transaction. If you’ve ever spent 20 minutes or more browsing DoorDash, you understand that closing the gap from “inspiration” to actually finding what you’re looking for is crucial to getting an order placed.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-2.png"></a></p>
 Custom supply creation   
<p>Imagine a marketplace where a searched-for product (e.g., “mittens with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders_mittens_meme">the Bernie Sanders meme</a> printed on them”) doesn’t yet exist. The marketplace can then match the user with a supplier who is able to bring their vision to life — at the quality level and price they are looking for. Think of this as “Etsy on steroids” for every type of product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One example here is Pietra’s AI product design tools. Pietra allows creators and entrepreneurs to make products to sell to their audiences. The company recently launched an AI-first generator that can further customize (using natural language) SKUs that are then brought to life by the company’s marketplace of global manufacturers. CEO Ronak Trivedi<a href="https://twitter.com/therealRoShow/status/1731699885911732541"> has said</a> that 40% of the company’s custom manufacturing requests are already coming from the AI tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To see how it works in action, check out this short demo. For as long as we can, we're making this free to all entrepreneurs, not just Pietra members. <a href="https://t.co/oCKDgp53uu">pic.twitter.com/oCKDgp53uu</a></p>
<p>— Ronak Trivedi (@therealRoShow) <a href="https://twitter.com/therealRoShow/status/1728128003438440598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
 Negotiation and customer service   
<p>LA creative studio Brain recently released a virtual garage sale, where users haggled with AI to get lower prices on real products. While this was a one-time experiment, it opens up intriguing possibilities. Why shouldn’t marketplace buyers have an always-on assistant, trained on supplier data, that can answer questions, play price negotiator, or provide other forms of customer service? This could also be positive for suppliers, reducing time spent on non-core tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-3.png"></a></p>
 Supply Side   
<p>The impact of AI on sellers, or the supply side, is trickier. While the downstream implications might not be entirely positive for legacy marketplaces, they open up space for new marketplaces to emerge or existing marketplaces to pivot towards emerging opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see 2 main ways that AI will impact supply, based on the type of marketplace:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Digital or IRL product/service: Is what you’re selling delivered entirely digitally, or does it require “real world” inventory or infrastructure? </p>
<p>AI can’t fully replace a house on Airbnb…but it can help suppliers on the platform become more efficient, by automating their busywork (e.g. writing listings, answering questions from potential guests) so they can focus solely on the transaction.</p>
<p>In contrast, AI might actually replace “the product” for marketplaces that sell digital goods or services, such as Upwork. For example, why would you hire an online copywriting service if an AI can do similar work for free? Some of these marketplaces may face an existential challenge from AI.</p>
<p>2. Personal or commoditized supply: Is what you’re selling a commodity (price and availability are all that matters), or do users care about the specific SKU / supplier?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buying a logo on a site like Fiverr is, arguably, closer to the “commodity” end of the spectrum. You likely care more about getting a reasonable output for a reasonable price, versus the specific creator. This approach is more susceptible to AI automation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other cases, supply is truly personalized — e.g., buying content from your favorite Patreon creator. AI is less likely to fully replace these suppliers (at least in the near term) and is, instead, more likely to supercharge their work by helping them create content faster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on these 2 vectors, here’s how I predict different types of marketplaces will be impacted by genAI, from most to least disrupted.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-4.png"></a></p>
 Marketplaces selling digital, commodity products   
<p>Marketplaces <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2928076-5c52-43e9-8872-08fda2aa2fcf">like Upwork and Fiverr</a> have already seen a drop in transactions and earnings as buyers churn and generate the “product” themselves via AI tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-5.png"></a></p>
<p>These companies have an interesting decision to make. Do they pivot to focus on AI-native suppliers, who will offer their writing services at much lower prices, and try to make it up in volume? Or, do they train or fine-tune a model that can fully replace their own supply, at the risk of potentially losing buyers who prefer knowing a human did the work, but retaining all of the revenue? In this case, the company would become the one and only supplier.</p>
<p>Canva, which offers an in-platform marketplace of designs from independent creators, provides an interesting example here. The company is training a text-to-design model, but says it <a href="https://www.forbes.com.au/news/innovation/canva-to-indemnify-users-for-what-its-ai-spits-out/">will pay</a> development commissions to creators who contribute their data to the model from a 3-year $200 million creator fund.&nbsp;</p>
 Marketplaces selling digital, personalized products   
<p>Examples include Cameo or Patreon, where users are buying digital content or services, but care about who the specific supplier is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the near term, AI should “supercharge” these suppliers — giving them the ability to make more with less resources.&nbsp; With Cameo, for example, a celebrity could (hypothetically!) use ChatGPT to write scripts, HeyGen to generate a realistic avatar, and ElevenLabs to mimic their voice — completely outsourcing video creation to AI.</p>
 <a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Marketplaces-In-the-Age-of-AI-Inline-6.png"></a><p>If you’ve seen “deepfake Tom Cruise,” you know we’re not far from completely AI-generated Cameo videos!</p> 
<p>In the long run, celebrities may end up competing with deepfakes of themselves (are Cameos less “valuable” if anyone can generate them with AI?), or with other celebrities and influencers who join Cameo because AI makes it easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marketplaces will have to decide where to draw the line. Do they ban AI usage, build AI tools to augment their suppliers, or pivot towards AI-first supply? One option is allowing suppliers to offer a lightweight, AI-powered version of their product / service. On the photography platform <a href="https://imagen-ai.com/">Imagen</a>, users can pay to re-edit their photos in the style of known photographers. This is somewhere in-between a human-generated and AI-generated output, giving users a (likely) lower-cost product, but still with the “touch” of the supplier they care about.&nbsp;</p>
 Marketplaces selling physical, commodity products   
<p>Think Instacart or Uber, where users care about a base level of quality (alongside price and availability), but aren’t set on having a specific shopper, driver, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These marketplaces can use AI to streamline their seller operations. But beyond this, they will be less dramatically impacted.&nbsp;</p>
 Marketplaces selling physical, personalized products   
<p>Think Etsy, eBay, or Whatnot, where users are looking for a specific SKU or seller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would this be the case? The reality is, the Etsys and eBays of the world rely on individual suppliers to stay in business. These suppliers are currently hindered from selling more items by frustrating manual processes, such as uploading item descriptions, setting prices, providing customer service, cross-listing and managing inventory across platforms, and more. AI should be able to extract away all the pain here, making it easier for existing sellers to sell more — and for new sellers to get in the game!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legacy marketplaces like eBay have already started to test AI-powered functionalities. eBay’s new <a href="https://innovation.ebayinc.com/tech/features/magical-listing-tool-harnesses-the-power-of-ai-to-make-selling-on-ebay-faster-easier-and-more-accurate/">Magic Listing tool</a> turns a single photo into a full listing, filling in item traits and even generating a full text description, which are pretty sophisticated! In early testing, 95% of sellers used the AI description.</p>

 
	<a>
				
				
	</a>
     

<p>With more sellers listing items with more detail-filled descriptions, buyers are more likely to find something that fits what they’re looking for, kickstarting a positive flywheel of liquidity and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while we’ve largely talked about physical products, this also applies to services. For example – Incredible Health, a marketplace that connects nurses with health systems, <a href="https://www.incrediblehealth.com/blog/ai-features-nurse-hiring">recently launched</a> a resume generator to help more suppliers (nurses) succeed on the platform. As 30% of nurses start their job search without a quality resume, this “Resume Wizard” helps them create an optimized resume in five minutes.</p>
 The Future   
<p>The future is bright for marketplaces in the AI era. Buyers will have more options than ever, and AI will unlock a much more delightful user experience through natural language search, automated customer service, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the flip side, sellers will be able to do their jobs more efficiently, with the help of an AI assistant that serves as a second (or even third) pair of hands to drive their business. By abstracting away everything that isn’t core to the transaction, they can drive more volume and focus on the parts of the job where their “special touch” matters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end result? AI should drive more liquid and more stable marketplaces — with more listings, higher conversions to transaction, and more repeat purchases than ever before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This post describes work done at Brave by Senior Security Engineer Kyle Den Hartog, Senior Software Engineer Oleg Isupov, Senior Software Engineer iOS Stephen Heaps, and Principal Software Engineer Anthony Tseng. In addition, we would also like to thank the co-authors of EIP-6963 for helping to find an interoperable solution to this long standing issue. In particular, thank you to Pedro Gomes (<a href="https://github.com/pedrouid">@pedrouid</a>), Kosala Hemachandra (<a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke">@kvhnuke</a>), Richard Moore (<a href="https://github.com/ricmoo">@ricmoo</a>), Gregory Markou (<a href="https://github.com/GregTheGreek">@GregTheGreek</a>), Kyle Den Hartog (<a href="https://github.com/kdenhartog">@kdenhartog</a>), Glitch (<a href="https://github.com/glitch-txs">@glitch-txs</a>), Jake Moxey (<a href="https://github.com/jxom">@jxom</a>), Pierre Bertet (<a href="https://github.com/bpierre">@bpierre</a>), Darryl Yeo (<a href="https://github.com/darrylyeo">@darrylyeo</a>), and Yaroslav Sergievsky (<a href="https://github.com/everdimension">@everdimension</a>). Finally, we’d like to thank the participants of the 6963 task force Telegram channel and those who participated in discussions on the AllWalletDevs Discord channel. This post was written by Kyle Den Hartog.</p>
<p>Today, Brave is announcing the launch of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963">EIP-6963</a> support in Brave Wallet on iOS, Android, and Desktop. Together with other digital wallets and connection libraries, this update is the first step to improving the UX onboarding experience shared between DApps and wallets. With the addition of EIP-6963, we’ve worked with various wallets to coordinate and ship a modification to a very specific implementation decision made early on in Metamask—a decision that ended up becoming a de facto standard, and limiting users’ experiences with Web3. In a nutshell, EIP-6963 support makes it easier than ever for users to use many different wallets without hidden workarounds like changing settings or setting up separate browser profiles for each wallet.</p>

 How did we get here? 
<p>When extension-based wallets were first created, there was a pattern established around how DApps communicated with wallets: they used extension scripts to inject a JavaScript object called “window.ethereum”, which DApps then built around in order to communicate with the wallet. Due to the way JavaScript works in the browser, this pattern worked well when there was only a single wallet. However, once people began installing multiple wallets, the pattern created a new and frustrating problem. Wallets had to “fight” over the window.ethereum object by treating prototype pollution as a feature instead of a bug.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this created odd interactions for end users: when they clicked “connect” on the DApp, it had no way to communicate with the wallet the user selected on the page. Worse, the wallet had no way to detect which wallets the user had installed, and so many of the DApps just assumed the user was using MetaMask. This explains why, when you try to use a DApp, clicking MetaMask will actually pop up a different wallet.</p>

 How does EIP-6963 fix this? 
<p>Essentially, we as a group of wallet developers and connection libraries decided in this spec to define a different communication method—one that didn’t require wallets to compete over a single JavaScript object. Instead, wallets could all “announce” themselves individually, providing the DApp a way to simply listen for all of these announcements. Furthermore, the various wallet options could identify themselves more easily and supply an image to the page, thus optimizing the process of selecting a wallet. This was achieved through an event-concurrency loop built on EventListeners and Events.</p>

 What does it look like? 


    
    

    


    



<p>Just like that, you can now utilize many different wallets at the same time with DApps that support EIP-6963.</p>

 What’s possible with this new pattern? 
<p>This work opens new patterns that weren’t previously possible. DApps can even choose to ignore window.ethereum altogether and communicate with multiple wallet providers at the same time. That means, for example, that your favorite DeFi DApp can simultaneously connect your cold wallet with a ledger hardware via Brave Wallet, and your hot wallet in Metamask. You could thus have two addresses connected at the same time, perform a swap, and more seamlessly move your tokens between a hot and a cold wallet. These possibilities only scratch the surface, and over time we should see some new and interesting user experiences (ones we at Brave are excited to support) especially in the form of additional privacy for users.</p>
<p>To conclude, with friendly coordination of leading wallet builders, users should expect to see improved wallet connection experiences across the Web3 DApp landscape, ready for the next major influx of users. To try the new connection experience with Brave Wallet, visit <a href="https://eip6963.org">https://eip6963.org</a> made by the <a href="https://github.com/walletconnect/eip6963/">WalletConnect</a> team. And be sure to let your favorite DApps know they should start supporting EIP-6963 too!</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.5.0.</p>



<p>This release includes a “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP) implementation of shielded scanning, with a new “zebra-scan” crate and behind an experimental “shielded-scan” feature. This marks the first step towards full support for shielded scanning in Zebra and we’re excited to continue building out the functionality. Ongoing development is tracked in issue <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7728">#7728</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Important Security Warning 



<p>This new feature is for experimental use only and has known security issues. We recommend that you do NOT use regular or sensitive viewing keys with Zebra’s experimental scanning feature. You should also NOT use this feature on a shared machine. If you do want to <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan.html">try this out</a>, we suggest that you generate new keys for experimental use.</p>



<p>Also included in this release:</p>



 
 A fix for a panic that was introduced in Zebra v1.4.0, which happens in rare circumstances when reading cached sprout or history trees. 



 Further improvements to how Zebra recovers from network interruptions and prevents potential network hangs. 



 Improvements to limit the ability of synthetic nodes to spread throughout the network through Zebra, to address some of the Ziggurat red team report. 
 



<p><br>As of this release, Zebra requires Rust 1.73 to build. </p>

  Partnering with Tacto: Future-Proof Supply Chains  <p>André, Nico, Johannes and their team are building the modern supplier-management solution millions of businesses need.</p>   
	By Luciana Lixandru, Julien Bek, and Cornelius Menke	 



Published December 11, 2023
  



TACTO CO-FOUNDERS JOHANNES GROLL, NICO BENTENRIEDER AND ANDRÉ PETRY.



 
<p>Sometimes you meet a team and you just know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first learned last year about Tacto co-founders André Petry, Nico Bentenrieder and Johannes Groll and the procurement solution they were building, we already had a keen interest in the category. While businesses have for decades used CRMs (customer relationship management systems) to grow their revenue, where was the SRM (supplier relationship management system)? More attention to the supplier and cost side of the equation was clearly needed, as geopolitical tensions, COVID ripple effects and regulatory changes have created unprecedented supply chain uncertainty and price volatility.</p>



<p>For the world’s largest companies producing physical goods, some supplier relationship tools are available via incumbents. But for millions of mid-sized businesses (SMBs), these options are too cumbersome and too expensive; 90% have no procurement solution at all. Instead, they’re stuck tracking every supplier, certificate and quote manually, in email and Excel. It’s a daunting proposition—especially when you realize that even a company making a seemingly simple product like tape might have hundreds of suppliers and procure tens of thousands of different articles.</p>



<p>Those mid-sized industrial companies are exactly who <a href="https://www.tacto.ai/">Tacto</a> was built to serve, so in late 2022, we reached out to their team to discuss the possibility of a partnership. Unfortunately for us, they’d just finished raising their seed round. But we didn’t want to give up—so we started speaking with customers in the sector, hoping to learn more about the business. What we heard made us even more interested in the product André, Nico, Johannes and their team are building.</p>



<p>Customers told us Tacto had helped them streamline every aspect of the procurement process, from requesting, evaluating and responding to quotes; to tracking suppliers’ regulatory certifications; to analyzing prices and preparing for negotiations. Where their employees once spent hundreds of hours on interviews, questionnaires and data entry, the platform now automatically gathers and standardizes that information—and of course, uses AI to help them make sense of it. Tacto has also dramatically simplified compliance with Germany’s new Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which imposes stricter supplier reporting to every business with at least 1,000 full-time employees. Even better, it’s easy to integrate—no year-long sales cycles or big IT projects—and, thanks to André, Nico and Johannes’s insistence on an elegant, consumer-grade UI, it’s easy to use, as well.</p>



<p>But customers didn’t just sing the praises of Tacto’s product; we also heard amazing things about its team. André, Nico and Johannes have stellar credentials—all three met at the elite Center for Digital Technology and Management in Munich. They started Tacto in early 2020 after seeing the challenges of procurement firsthand, pushed ahead when skeptics in the space told them it wouldn’t work, and now, have stuck with it long enough to prove those skeptics wrong. They are high-energy, thoughtful and relentlessly focused on performance—and, importantly, they have an impressive ability to attract talent. Tacto’s team members deeply understand the problems their customers are facing, and they work quickly to solve them.</p>



<p>After hearing those rave reviews, we knew we had to try again—so we traveled to Munich to meet André face-to-face. We walked out of that first one-hour coffee with a high degree of conviction in Tacto, and a couple of weeks later, flew back to spend the day with the team and offer them a term sheet. Sequoia was far from the only firm vying for Tacto’s attention—but in that high-pressure environment, we saw for ourselves the qualities that make André, Nico and Johannes great leaders. We were thrilled that they chose us to lead their Series A.</p>



<p>Today, the future is bright. Tacto is now serving customers across a wide range of industries, from mechanical engineering to packaging to medical technology, and impressively, they have grown quickly while retaining every one of their happy customers. In the months and years ahead, as supply chain challenges continue and new regulations expand beyond Germany across Europe, André, Nico, Johannes and their team will be there to make life better and easier for even more companies—and we are excited to support them along the way.</p>

<p>The acceleration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology adoption across industries has indicated widespread organisational acceptance of the novel technology. The advent of this new technology has brought more efficient and creative possibilities. However, the use of language models in AI raises concerns about trustworthiness in its training and the output it generates. This leads us to the question: How can we leverage existing technologies to bridge this lack of trust?</p>



<p>This article explores the challenges surrounding trust in AI system inputs and outputs, how blockchain could be the solution to establish trust, and various integration challenges that need to be accounted for.</p>



<p></p>



 Trust challenges of AI systems 



<p>Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, organisations have made enormous strides to implement AI within their technological systems. Enthusiasm for this new technology promising productivity enhancement, has also generated discussions on whether we can trust these systems. Who has been training these AI models? How can we be sure that the information output it generates is reliable and unbiased? </p>



<p></p>



 Transparency of AI language models  



<p>AI systems require a large language model (LLM) to learn and have a basis to create outputs from. However, due to the lack of transparency surrounding what goes into the LLMs, doubts arise on data input authenticity and reliability.</p>



<p>Authenticity: If the origin, quality, and representativeness of the input data are not transparent, it raises concerns about the authenticity and reliability of the model’s understanding.</p>



<p>Reliability: Lack of clarity regarding the source of training data leads to scepticism about the model’s ability to accurately reflect real-world scenarios and diverse perspectives. This creates uncertainty on whether the model’s output can be trusted and used accordingly.</p>



<p>Explainability: There is a lack of self-explanation in AI systems on how a specific outcome is generated when prompted. This poses a significant hurdle to understanding and trusting AI’s outputs. What data did the system pool together to carry out its decision-making process when prompted?</p>



<p></p>



 Ethical standards in AI training 



<p>AI systems often make decisions based on complex algorithms and data that include principles governing the training of AI models. Thus creating the need for a standardised set of ethical guidelines governing the training of AI models.</p>



<p>One primary concern is the ethical framework guiding the selection of data used in training these systems. The opaqueness surrounding the training data raises ethical concerns, particularly related to bias. If the data used to train AI models contain biases, the model may unintentionally perpetuate those biases in its outputs. Without transparency, it becomes challenging to identify and address biases in the training data. Therefore making it difficult to avoid potential negative consequences.</p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. AI output 



<p>Another significant challenge revolves around the ability to distinguish between outputs generated by AI systems and those by human intelligence. Can we reliably identify whether the output presented is a result of human thought or an algorithmic process? </p>



<p>Authentication is particularly crucial in scenarios where information transparency is essential, such as journalism, content creation, or academia. This distinction between human and AI-generated content also carries ethical implications. It prompts discussions on attribution, accountability, and the potential influence these systems might have in shaping public opinion. As AI becomes more integrated into society, different mechanisms are needed to transparently demonstrate the origin of information.</p>



<p></p>



 Output challenges 



<p>When speaking of trust within AI, we must also evaluate the ownership and intellectual property rights of AI-generated output. The challenge lies in determining whether outputs are established through AI’s novel agency or the accumulation of various other sources that warrant intellectual property rights.</p>



<p>The artwork industry can be used to illustrate the debate on whether generative AI should give credit to artists. Since the system draws inspiration from its training model, would the new artwork’s ownership belong to AI? This debate highlights legal and ethical dilemmas, due to a lack of established frameworks that promote fair compensation for contributors. As AI systems evolve, there is a pressing need to redefine traditional notions of ownership. Acknowledgment of the collaborative nature of AI development is needed while safeguarding the rights of those involved in the generative process.</p>



<p></p>



 Role of blockchain in establishing trust 



<p>Based on the trust challenges discussed above, blockchain technology could be the solution as a trust layer for AI. Blockchain’s decentralised design, using transparent and immutable data records, guarantees universal accessibility, enhanced authentication, and verification processes for all users.</p>



<p></p>



 Ensuring transparency in data processes  



<p>One of the fundamental challenges in trusting AI, as discussed, lies in the lack of transparency regarding data input processes. Blockchain can resolve the transparency issue by recording every step of the AI training and data input process. This ensures that the origin and reliability of the data used to train AI models are traceable and verifiable to reflect real-world conditions.</p>



<p>By leveraging blockchain, organisations facilitating AI technology can instil confidence in stakeholders regarding the reliability of its AI-generated outputs. This safeguards against potential misuse and establishes a foundation for accountability in the development and deployment of AI.</p>



<p></p>



 Tracing decision-making processes  



<p>Transparency enabled by blockchain technology can address the inherent explainability challenges associated with AI’s black-box nature. Establishing a transparent trail of the data and model processes integrated enhances the reliability of AI decisions.</p>



<p>The availability of a comprehensible trail can address the lack of confidence and scepticism present in generative AI. Traceability encourages independent evaluation, empowering users to revisit and assess AI’s decision-making steps, thereby contributing to a more accountable and trustworthy AI environment.</p>



<p></p>



 Leveraging immutability to validate data input reliability 



<p>The immutable nature of blockchain technology contributes to providing security to data records and data transactions. Every piece of information entered into the blockchain is time-stamped and linked to previous data blocks, creating an unbroken chain of custody. This not only enhances the accountability of data sources but also enables stakeholders to verify the authenticity of inputs. As a result, users can confidently rely on the integrity of the data feeding into AI algorithms, knowing that any attempt to manipulate or compromise the information would be immediately detectable. On the other hand, blockchain can be used to drive sustainability goals for successful operations in the long run. For further understanding of how blockchain can sustain long-term ESG goals for organisations, refer to this ebook on <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">using blockchain for sustainability.</a></p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. machine contributions 



<p>Distinguishing between outputs generated by human intelligence and those crafted by AI is critical. The widespread use of AI in optimising many of our daily processes is bound to be used in other various domains, such as work-related situations and advisory roles.  This has caused increasing evaluation on whether information distributed is completely human or contains traces of AI contribution. </p>



WorldID is used as a global digital identity to anonymously prove a person’s unique identity.



<p>Thus the use of smart contracts in the blockchain ecosystem provides a mechanism for creating verifiable identities for both human and machine contributors.  OpenAI’s <a href="https://worldcoin.org/world-id">WorldID</a> initiative is an example of how smart contracts can be employed to authenticate the origin of contributions. Its application will enable a clear distinction between human and AI-generated outputs. Their initiative could address future concerns about accountability and ethical considerations in various domains such as authentic journalism and recognition.</p>



<p></p>



 Establishing auditable trails for tracing errors 



<p>In the complex landscape of AI, errors and biases in outputs can have significant consequences for end users. Blockchain-based systems can offer the solution of an auditable trail that records every transaction and interaction within the AI ecosystem. In the event of errors or biases in AI outputs, this auditable trail provides a comprehensive analysis of the training data and its parameters, facilitating the identification and rectification of issues. This auditable trail also serves as a critical tool for post hoc analysis, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of AI algorithms to meet evolving ethical and performance standards.</p>



<p></p>



 Challenges between AI and blockchain integration 



<p>The integration of AI and blockchain technology may provide us with a starting point in establishing trust, however, there are still potential challenges that experts should address when considering this integration.</p>



<p></p>



 Scalability 



<p>One prominent concern is the scale and scope of AI applications. AI systems often work with massive datasets, and to fully integrate them with blockchain, a highly efficient, low-cost network is essential. However, the transactional and resource costs associated with blockchain networks remain a significant hurdle.</p>



<p></p>



 Cost efficiency 



<p>Initial setup costs can involve acquiring the necessary hardware, software, and infrastructure to support both AI algorithms and blockchain networks. Maintenance costs also arise as ongoing updates and improvements are essential to keep both technologies optimised and secure. Transaction costs associated with blockchain networks, such as fees for data storage and processing, can accumulate. Particularly when dealing with large-scale AI applications that require frequent interactions with the blockchain. Lastly, organisations will need to invest in skilled professionals who can navigate the complexities of integrating AI and blockchain, adding to the overall human resource expenses.</p>



<p></p>



 Interoperability 



<p>There are various blockchain platforms available, and achieving interoperability between them poses a challenge since smart contracts and AI applications might need to interact across different blockchain networks. AI models and algorithms may be developed using different frameworks and technologies. Therefore, ensuring a seamless integration with blockchain platforms can be a complicated process. </p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Compliance 



<p>The topic of interoperability across both technologies also highlights regulatory challenges on two fronts. The decentralised and global nature of blockchain introduces uncertainty, as compliance requirements vary across jurisdictions. Simultaneously, the use of AI, particularly in sensitive domains, is subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny with a focus on data privacy, transparency, and accountability. Combining these technologies requires a dual compliance effort of addressing regulations specific to each domain and staying up to date with technical developments, to develop a standardised process for compliance.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The widespread integration of AI technology has prompted critical discussions surrounding transparency, authentication and ethical standards in AI language models. Blockchain, through its transparent and immutable nature, emerges as a promising solution to address these concerns. It offers transparency in data processes, traceability of decision-making, and validation of data input reliability. However, the integration of AI and blockchain presents a set of challenges, such as scalability, interoperability, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. Thus, when leveraging this integration, a balance is needed between innovation, and ethical considerations. AI developers should ensure that the collaborative development of AI is transparent, accountable, and trustworthy for the benefit of its users.</p>

 TL;DR 



<p>As Electric Coin Co. (ECC) and the Zcash community prepare for public retrospectives of zcashd Network Upgrade 5 (NU5) and what has become known as the sandblasting attack, this blog post details ECC’s motivations, challenges, and accomplishments with regard to each.&nbsp;</p>



 
 The NU5 upgrade was an ambitious undertaking to eliminate the need for trusted setups, increase user confidence, and enhance Zcash’s security and scalability. 



 The implementation of Halo, a cryptographic breakthrough, on Zcash made possible trustless, private, digital-cash transactions for the first time on mobile phones. 



 A malicious attack following the upgrade led to significant wallet performance issues, prompting ECC to enter Emergency Mode. Our response involved multiple technical updates, performance improvements, and the release of new mobile-wallet SDKs. 



 Despite the challenges and delays, ECC succeeded in improving the security and resiliency of Zcash. 
 



 



 



<p><a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86440711631">Public retrospective: Wednesday, Dec. 13 at 22:00 UTC/17:00 EST</a></p>



 



 



 What the FUD? 



<p>ECC’s mission is to empower economic freedom, and most organizations that work on Zcash-related projects, like the Zcash Foundation (ZF) and Zcash Community Grants (ZCG), have similar community-minded objectives for the betterment of humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, since Zcash came into the world in 2016 a stream of misinformation (and some coordinated propaganda) has been circulated on social media, forums, and other community platforms meant to incite FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).</p>



<p>The rumors claimed that Zcash was compromised, or that it was vulnerable to counterfeiting, or that there was a backdoor that would allow third parties to access a user’s transaction information without their consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And unfortunately, until NU5 was released, there was a major obstacle in confronting these attacks: the trusted setup. When Zcash launched, its zero-knowledge proofs required a <a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony">Ceremony</a>, or trusted setup phase, to produce public parameters that allowed users to construct and verify private transactions.</p>



<p>This technique was pioneered by ECC, and it required multiple parties in different locations using complex security measures.</p>



<p>Regardless of the extra-careful planning and execution plus redundant security, Zcash users and observers had to trust the historical fact that the ceremony participants weren’t conspiring to deceive the public. Trusted setups don’t allow for a mathematically verifiable supply, and as long as these complicated procedures were required for major Zcash upgrades, there would always be doubters and detractors. And the doubters would have a point — mathematics is verifiable, but history isn’t. The reputation and integrity of Zcash was being challenged, and in ECC’s view, this was an issue the community couldn’t afford to ignore.</p>



 NU5: A call to action 



<p>In 2019, ECC engineers Sean Bowe, Daira Emma Hopwood, and Jack Grigg had been working on scalability design and experimenting with a solution for efficient recursion when Bowe made a discovery.</p>



<p>“I just stumbled upon a technique to do this zero-knowledge proof construction on completely ordinary elliptic curves,” Bowe said. “And so over the course of maybe 24 hours, it went from, ‘Ooh, that’s really exciting, that’ll be neat if we can do that’ to ‘Holy crap, now that we don’t have trusted setups or anything, it’s all really simple. It was a series of steps that turned from a nice insight into a complete paradigm shift.”</p>



<p>Halo, as it would come to be known, is a zero-knowledge proving system that enables recursion without a trusted setup in an efficient way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bowe’s discovery was a cryptographic breakthrough heralded by the industry, and in 2021 ECC committed to implementing Halo in Zcash.</p>



<p>Halo on Zcash would make trustless, private, digital-cash transactions possible for the first time on mobile phones. It would serve as a catalyst for Zcash user confidence and provide a path to much greater scalability, while making the protocol more attractive, faster, and less expensive for others to build on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the ECC blog:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Halo on Zcash would enable circuit upgrades without the need for trusted setups, making the Zcash shielded protocol more agile for future improvements, such as supporting additional assets like [Zcash Shielded Assets, or ZSAs]. We want to make it easy for other projects and tokens to benefit from Zcash features, such as privacy through encryption. Trusted setup will become a remnant of the past.</p>



<p>In addition, this upgrade would pave the way for shielded Zcash scale through proof aggregation and blockchain succinctness, two scalability improvements. This would improve the user experience by eliminating frustrating synchronization time that plagues all blockchains today, reducing the traditional blockchain bloat, and allowing for non-escalating fees as usage increases. In conversations with large social platforms who expressed interest in native Zcash support, a viable path to scalability was given as a requisite near-term consideration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In January 2021, after more than a year of Halo R&amp;D, ECC concluded that the benefits of Halo on Zcash outweighed other protocol priorities, and we proposed implementing it in NU5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/8qSA29vWWds?si=6hvbieHC23DzuvmX">Zcash Media video</a> about the original Ceremony, its participants (including Edward Snowden), and how Halo makes trusted setups obsolete.</p>



 NU5 objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our NU5 goals from the outset were to (1) make Zcash more secure, (2) give Zcash users confidence by making the supply mathematically verifiable, (3) make future upgrades easier, and (4) enable future upgrades to benefit from recursive proofs for scalability and programmability improvements.</p>



<p>Our original estimate of 6-7 months turned out to be overly optimistic — as new discoveries were made, opportunities were revealed in the process, and technical complexities arose — and in the end the journey took almost a year and a half.</p>



<p>Along the way, we confronted a number of technical challenges. For example, the complexity of including Orchard support in the zcashd embedded wallet was not properly accounted for in the original estimates for the NU5 timeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ECC faced time-consuming engineering hurdles, like building a complicated circuit for Halo-plus-Orchard to make it work on mobile devices. And midstream, we made the decision to implement <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/unified-addresses-in-zcash-explained/">unified addresses</a> (UAs) to enable shielded by default in supporting wallets. The design and build-out of UAs were difficult, and if ECC had been practicing product-driven planning and development at the time (like we are now) we believe we would have identified the need for UAs sooner and their implementation would have been smoother.</p>



<p>In addition to battling technical obstacles like these, plus a few <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-4-5-1/">surprise bugs</a>, ECC spent significant time and resources advocating for and defending our roadmap decisions against criticism for: our rationale (getting rid of trusted setup wasn’t worth the time and effort, ZSAs were more important), our planning (we kicked off the discussion publicly before planning enough -and- we planned too much before starting the work), the decision to license Orchard under the Bootstrap Open Source Licence (BOSL), the decision to implement Unified Addresses (UAs), and our overall approach to network upgrades (our priorities were arbitrary and out of touch).</p>



<p>It’s important to acknowledge that we had significant community support during the process, too. Overall, community sentiment was positive. We received valuable insight and feedback from our <a href="https://electriccoin.co/team/">Scientific Advisory Board</a> and crucial security audits from <a href="https://hackmd.io/@qedit/zcash-nu5-audit">Qedit</a> and <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/11/02/public-report-zcash-nu5-cryptography-review/">NCC group</a>.</p>



 NU5 timeline and accomplishments 



<p>Not including the pre-implementation research and development, NU5 was a 17-month endeavor that delivered novel technology and improved Zcash user experience.&nbsp;</p>



 Timeline 



 
 September 2019: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-recursive-proof-composition-without-a-trusted-setup/">Discovery of Halo</a> announced 



 January 2021: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/announcing-zip-224-bringing-halo-2-to-zcash/">ZIP 224 proposes</a> the Orchard shielded protocol, which defines a new shielded pool with spending keys and payment addresses that are amenable to future scalability improvements (In January, we <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/announcing-zip-224-bringing-halo-2-to-zcash/">hoped</a> to release NU5 in summer of 2021) 



 February 2021: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/network-upgrade-pipeline-2-0/">Original timeline</a> slated NU5 (with Halo) for release in October 2021 



 March 2021: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-proposed-features/">NU5 proposed features</a> were published 



 April 2021: The NU5 release date was <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-arc-for-zcash-proposed-for-release-later-this-year/">pushed to January 2022</a> because of new discoveries that would facilitate better interoperability and to allocate additional time for our third-party implementation audit cycle 



 April 2021: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/unified-addresses-in-zcash-explained/">Unified addresses introduced</a> 



 August 2021: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-to-help-enable-zcash-shielded-by-default/">Shielded by Default introduced</a> 



 September 2021: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-4-5-1/">Bugs fixed by 4.5.1</a> 



 November 2021:&nbsp; <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-security-assessments-complete/">Security assessments were completed</a> 



 December 2021: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-and-halo-arc-timeline-update/">NU5 release date pushed</a> to April 2022 for additional development and to focus on ecosystem outreach and preparations 



 March 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activation-and-halo-arc-release-delayed-for-remediation-of-consensus-bug/">NU5 activation and Halo Arc release delayed </a>until May 2022 for remediation of consensus bug in testnet 



 May 31, 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash/">NU5 activates on mainnet</a>, eliminating trusted setup for the new Orchard pool and launching a new era for Zcash 
 



<p>When Zcash NU5 activated on mainnet May 31, 2022, it was one of the most important milestones for Zcash since the cryptocurrency launched in 2016. As ECC CEO Zooko Wilcox put it, “an historic step forward for human society.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In launching the Orchard shielded payment protocol utilizing Halo, we eliminated the trusted setup to improve Zcash security and sustainability, made the supply mathematically verifiable, improved scalability because future network upgrades won’t require a complicated setup ceremony, paved the way for increased interoperability by providing a system that could unlock private cross-chain proofs at scale, and introduced BOSL which has returned value to the Zcash community (e.g., Filecoin Foundation and Ethereum Foundation grants to Brave and Edge).</p>



<p>It was a massive effort, and after almost a year and a half of building and wrestling with the technical challenges of NU5, the ECC Core team was ready for some rest. But almost right away, Zcash was hit with another issue we couldn’t ignore.</p>



 



 The sandblasting attack 



<p>In June 2022, almost immediately after ECC launched NU5, a serious problem emerged. The Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction size and activity. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented some wallets (Nighthawk, Edge, and Unstoppable) from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. Wallets weren’t syncing and some users weren’t able to access their funds.</p>



<p>This was a problem that ECC, as the primary maintainer of zcashd and supplier of mobile-wallet SDKs, was best-positioned to confront.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: A call to action 



<p>Some parties at ECC did not initially want to make the assumption that this unusual transaction load was the work of a malicious actor. Eventually however, the evidence that it was a malicious actor became overwhelming — and we have reason to believe it may even have been coordinated by the same actor or group of actors who spread Zcash FUD, and that they may have been paid to do so.</p>



<p>But solving that mystery was less important than fixing the problem.&nbsp;</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could regain access to and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world, private digital cash.</p>



<p>As an initial line of defense, we released&nbsp; performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80%. We also began working on performance upgrades to our mobile wallet SDKs.</p>



<p>In August 2022, with lots of work left to solve these wallet performance issues, ECC went into Emergency Mode. This was our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>The wallet performance issues presented a complicated series of challenges to address, and they required developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that would give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. The solution required changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>



<p>Internally, fee changes were debated from the get-go, but for the first few months, the ECC team focused on additional performance improvements and worked to resolve the issue without fee changes. Later, we decided to implement fee changes to throttle the spam attack.</p>



<p>As users became frustrated with their user experience, some community members became vocal and publicly criticized ECC for not being prepared for the attack and slow to respond.</p>



<p>In February 2023, we were notified by blockchain security firm Halborn of <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">vulnerabilities</a> inherited from Bitcoin Core that may have affected more than 280 chains, including Zcash. This was another all-hands-on-deck emergency on top of the wallet performance issues, and as ECC was the only team notified of the vulnerability, we were the only ones who could make the necessary fixes. The coordination of the disclosure and remediation consumed approximately a month of our time.</p>



<p>To make matters worse, ECC as an engineering organization was attempting to do too many things at once: core node maintenance, supporting CEXes like Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini, backports from Bitcoin, mobile SDKs, mobile wallet applications, and future protocol improvements. ECC <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">restructured</a> in May 2023, which further strained resources temporarily.</p>



 Additional challenges 



 
 At the time, ECC internal communication and project management practices weren’t organized for an Emergency Mode situation. This affected our understanding of priorities and workflow across teams. 



 Before the attack, ECC product strategy focused on adoption first, instead of performance and scalability. Users want new features, and working on improving performance slows feature releases. But the attack took Zcash UX to the limits immediately. 



 Technical debt: We had implemented previous network upgrades with only limited performance improvements. 



 ECC vastly underestimated how long it would take to fix outstanding wallet performance issues. 



 Other technical issues arose that caused delays, such as when speed.z.cash bitrotted and then got deleted while ECC was without a devops manager.&nbsp; 



 The ECC Core team had three different managers during Emergency Mode. 



 Emergency Mode slowed development of our planned wallet product, now known as Zashi. However, we were able to leverage the prototype internally to validate and test SDK improvements. 
 



<p>ECC was lucky to have proactive wallet partners — Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable — who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Timeline and accomplishments 



<p>In all, ECC’s sandblasting response and implementation by third-party wallets consumed about 16 months. By November 2023, Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable were working again (better than ever), and we announced an end to Emergency Mode.</p>



 Timeline 



 
 June 2022: Network spamming began; shielded outputs jumped from a monthly average of 42,600 to 21,622,590 in June alone 



 July 2022: Implemented performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80% and began working on performance improvements to our mobile wallet SDKs 



 August 2022: ECC officially entered <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860">Emergency Mode</a>, although we didn’t use that term in public written communications until March 2023; started researching Spend Before Sync 



 September 2022: While working on zcashd and improved mobile sync experience, re-opened research into possible fee change mechanisms (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317">ZIP 317</a>) and syncing efficiencies (<a href="https://hackmd.io/@str4d/dagsync-graph-aware-zcash-wallets">DAGSync</a>/Spend Before Sync) 



 October 2022: Released zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-3-0/">5.3.0</a> with additional performance improvements to reduce concurrent memory utilization during scanning among other memory and performance related optimisations in the zcashd node 



 October 2022: Reaffirmed our immediate objectives regarding syncing issues with our wallet SDKs and <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/29">communicated our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode</a> 



 October 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-thirty-year-vision/">Communicated our intent </a>to have wallet performance issues resolved by the end of February 2023 



 October 2022: Changes to zcashd increased its robustness against the attack 



 November 2022: Identified and fixed the last known bugs that were blocking the first phase of SDK releases, continued progress on Spend Before Sync, and began prepping both zcashd and mobile wallets for ZIP 317; squashed the last known librustzcash bugs that were blocking wallet release and completed Android &amp; iOS SDK integration 



 December 2022: Completed the implementation of zcashd optimizations expected to save memory and to reduce orphan rates for miners 



 February 2023: Released zcashd<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-4-0/"> 5.4.0</a> to introduce a number of performance improvements, an update to correct supply reporting, and a clean up of legacy features and support functionality to improve ongoing maintenance of the codebase 



 March 2023: Published an <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/update-addressing-zcash-wallet-performance-issues/">update and release schedule</a> calling for an end to Emergency Mode by the end of May 



 April 2023: ECC released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-5-0/">5.5.0</a> with the completed transaction-fee-structure change (ZIP 317) and infrastructure improvements that laid the groundwork for 5.6.0. 



 May 2023: (Restructuring at ECC) Pushed the release date for zcashd 5.6.0, lightwalletd, and SDKs to mid-June. As zcashd 5.5.0 began to be adopted by miners on the network, the fee structure changes began to blunt the efficacy of the sandblasting attack, reducing the rate of blockchain growth and wallet scanning load. 



 June 2023: Released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-6-0/">zcashd 5.6.0</a>, introducing the functionality necessary for light wallets to access spendable funds without fully scanning the blockchain; included updates to address issues related to the ZIP-317 implementation and privacy policy features. 



 July 2023: Lightwalletd 0.4.14 was released, which meant the mobile wallet SDK was the only outstanding piece in ECC’s plan to resolve wallet performance issues and exit Emergency Mode. At this point, we had hoped to release the SDKs in mid-July. 



 August 2023: By the end of July, the adoption of zcashd 5.5.0 by the network was complete, and network transaction load had returned to pre-NU5 levels. However, the accumulated chain data to this point still presented a problem for wallet scanning, and so to mitigate this issue ECC announced the pre-release availability of the Spend before Sync capability in our mobile SDKs and made this functionality available to wallet developers for testing. Several bugs and UX issues were discovered. Timeline for the SDK releases was shifted to mid-September. 



 September 2023: New bugs, UX issues, and dependencies arose that pushed the SDKs release date out to the end of September. 



 Sept. 26, 2023: ECC <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/162">released the updated mobile SDK 2.0</a> for both iOS and Android developers. This was the final deliverable for exiting Emergency Mode. 



 Nov. 1, 2023: After a month in production, no related, major wallet issues were reported and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/wallet-performance-issues-resolved-ecc-exiting-emergency-mode/">ECC declared an exit from Emergency Mode</a>. 
 



<p>The culmination of our sandblasting response was that third-party Zcash wallets were working again, and future attackers were further disadvantaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



 



 The work continues 



<p>NU5 and the sandblasting attack consumed nearly three years. But faced with organized adversity, competing emergencies, and community criticism (some of it warranted), ECC did not stray from our commitment to build. With allies along the way, the community overcame unprecedented technical challenges and resource constraints to make Zcash more resilient, reliable, and safe.</p>



<p>We learned a lot, and although we’d love to step back and take a break, we know the work is more important now than ever. We look forward to distilling the lessons from these experiences in the upcoming retrospective, and we’re honored to continue the effort to build for economic freedom and a world-class Zcash user experience.</p>

  Black Holes and the Intelligence Explosion  <p>Extreme scenarios of AI focus on what is logically possible rather than what is physically possible. What does physics have to say about AI risk?</p>   
	By Dan Roberts	 



Published December 7, 2023
  



 
<p>For better or for worse, physicists will try to understand things that are not obviously physics, with physics. As a <a href="https://danintheory.com/">physicist-turned-AI-founder-and-researcher</a>, I liked to imagine black holes as computers. (In some sense, they’re the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound">largest</a> and maybe the <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v9/49">fastest</a> kind.) In this essay, we consider whether some very special computers will become black holes before they become gods.</p>



 Rising machines 



<p>Artificial intelligence has been a part of speculative fiction long before there was a specific genre called science fiction. AI has also been a part of computer science (though not exclusively so) for (almost) as long as there have been computers. In 1956, the Dartmouth Workshop coined the name “artificial intelligence” for the study of machines that think like humans, and set out to solve the task in a <a href="https://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart564props.pdf">single summer</a>.1 &nbsp;That didn’t really work out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">as planned</a>.</p>



<p>One peculiar thing about progress in artificial intelligence is that the science is far outpaced by the technology: AI is still a “black box” that produces magical results such as winning Go moves, poker bluffs, emotional poems, compelling stories and stunning images. It’s easy to read about how to build such a system—though good luck actually doing so without a huge amount of capital and engineering talent—but nobody knows why, for example, a chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT produces this sentence and not that sentence when given a particular prompt.</p>



<p>But if AI is magic, then it can literally do anything … within the realm of logical possibility. Such possibilities include, according to some whose views are becoming <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">increasingly</a> <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">mainstream</a>, eliminating all biological life on earth.</p>



<p>How can we possibly evaluate these claims? If AI is a black box, how do we know what’s possible? <a href="https://kotaku.com/president-joe-biden-mission-impossible-ai-tech-order-1850980643">How do we separate sci-fi trope from scientific truth?</a></p>



 
 <p>No, seriously, in their above-linked proposal, they say, “We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems [of how to make machines think like humans] if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.”</p>   
 



 Simulated in our universe 



<p>To start, I think that AI systems are not black boxes and can be understood in the same way that we understand any other physical system—through physics!</p>



<p>Okaaaay, you say, what does the abstract AI model that implements ChatGPT have to do with, say, the thermodynamics of the gas inside a room?</p>



<p>(It’s really funny and great that you picked that particular comparison to physics, I’d say!2)</p>



<p>To determine the properties of the collective gas in the room—its thermodynamics—from the underlying motion of the ~1025 or so gas molecules—their statistical mechanics—we needed physical intuition and a set of mathematical tools. Together, these let us zoom out of the microscopic perspective—where we keep track of their individual positions and velocities—to derive macroscopic features—like temperature, volume and entropy.</p>



<p>Another type of microscopically complicated system is the deep neural network (DNN) architecture that underlies recent successful AI models. These models are built from taking a simple but programmable mathematical operation—the artificial neuron—arranging them in layers to perform many such operations in parallel—and then stacking many layers in series to get a complicated function that can, if asked, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">write a play</a> proving the infinitude of primes in the style of Shakespeare. In this case, the microscopic description of the DNN is the literal code that the AI programmer writes, specifying how input is transformed to output.</p>



<p>For a language model, the text is broken up into pieces called tokens that loosely correspond to words; each token is mapped into a high-dimensional vector; the sequence of high-dimensional vectors are mixed up, re-weighted and biased in various ways according to the precise numerical values of the model’s parameters that are learned over the course of a training process; and finally, the model determines a probability distribution over all possible next words given the input and can generate a new word by sampling from that distribution. However, that code is the answer to the how question—how is an output computed from this input—but not the why question—why this output and not another for this input?</p>



<p>This description of how a chatbot works is like the following (microscopic) way of thinking about the pressure exerted by a gas: pressure is force per area; each individual gas molecule imparts a force on the wall every time it randomly collides with the wall; so, we can understand pressure by tracking the position and velocity of every gas molecule in the room, track their collisions with the walls, and add up all the forces. Analogously, this answers the how question for the gas—how does pressure arise—but not the why question—why does pressure rise when the temperature increases?</p>



<p>To answer the why questions, what we found—and, to be clear, by we here I mean historical physicists—is that for some types of microscopically complicated systems, simple macro-level descriptions emerge as the number of the elementary components of the system grows very large. (For example, we can derive the ideal gas law and show pressure is proportional to temperature by studying the distribution of velocities of the gas.) Moreover, we historical physicists were then able to find iterative refinements to these simple descriptions to understand how changing the size of these systems changes their behavior.3 (In this way, we can systematically model deviations from the ideal gas law.) It turns out, that as a complicated system with a large number of elementary components, deep neural networks also have precisely the right properties that enable such a physics-inspired approach to help us understand why they work as they do.4</p>



<p>But this is just an analogy to physics. There also is an explicit reason why physics matters for simulating an AI on a supercomputer.</p>



<p>To see why, consider that when we—and by we here I mean <a href="https://x.com/miramurati/status/1726542556203483392?s=20">the people of OpenAI</a>—build ChatGPT, we need a physical object to contain ChatGPT’s parameters—the weights and biases that control the behavior of the artificial neurons in the network and thus define and implement ChatGPT—and make them available to process input prompts. This object is (vestigially) called a graphics processing unit—a GPU—and each GPU has a fixed amount of internal memory for storing the parameters of AI models.</p>



<p>To train and then run frontier AI systems like ChatGPT, you must leverage not one, but many such GPUs, organized together into a kind of supercomputer: groups of eight GPUs are assembled and connected together in a type of box called a GPU node so they can communicate at high speeds, and then GPU nodes are further stacked and connected together in a GPU cluster inside of a room known as a data center.</p>



<p>At the risk of being pedantic, let’s <a href="https://labs.openai.com/s/4VjlheyWjFRHi4yxu06nenOa">imagine</a> that that room—the data center that contains the supercomputer running ChatGPT—also contains the gas whose thermodynamics we were just discussing. As anyone who is old enough to have bought a GPU for its original purpose—gaming—knows, GPUs come with fans because they generate a lot of heat. Needless to say, thermodynamics of the gas inside a data center is very much impacted by running ChatGPT!</p>



<p>In other words, AI systems are physical objects, and AI inference plays out in physical space. As such, all purported superintelligences are ultimately subject to the physical limits of computation. That’s the main point of this essay.</p>



 
 One could say that the proverbial “black box” was originally just a (black) box of gas… 



 In physics, this goes by the name of the renormalization group, which is a kind of physical refinement and extension of the central limit theorem in math/statistics. 



 For some details, check out this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00008">essay,</a> and for a full blueprint of this approach, check out this <a href="https://deeplearningtheory.com/">book.</a>   
 
 







 
 Collapse into a black hole 



<p>To see why this matters, I want you to now take a moment and imagine an AGI with access to unbounded computational resources. To those worried about the risk such systems may pose to humankind, this thought experiment is often tantamount to imagining an all-powerful <a href="https://ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2">god</a> that can do anything. For instance:</p>



 
 It could be an information oracle—the ultimate successor to Google—as it would encapsulate and reason about the sum total of human knowledge.5 



 It could be used to “solve” science and create new technologies that we can hardly imagine. 



 It could escape the confines of your laptop by using the internet to synthesize artificial life.6 



 It could capture you inside the confines of your laptop by simulating you so accurately that you’d have no objective way of knowing whether you’re the physical you or the simulated you… and then torture that simulation to make you do its bidding. Maybe it creates one billion such simulations, making it near certain that the you having subjective conscious experiences is being simulated?7&nbsp; 



 (I’ll patiently wait here while you ask ChatGPT for a continuation.) 
 



<p>Where did this list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark">jump the shark</a> for you? As for me, rather than enumerating the possibilities of god, I started by imagining a black hole.</p>



<p>Lurking at the very extreme of any physical system lie black holes. Try to pack too much stuff—matter or energy—into any fixed volume, and you’ll find yourself a black hole; try to gather a large enough collection of identical objects together, and you’ll also find yourself a black hole. Although it may not be intuitive, this also places a limit on the amount of computation you can put together in any region of space.</p>



<p>To see why, consider what would have to happen if we scaled up our AGI system towards unbounded computation: as our hypothetical AGI becomes larger, we’ll need more and more GPUs to physically run it. This means constructing more and more GPU nodes, and networking them together in increasingly bigger GPU clusters.</p>



<p>So, how big of a GPU supercomputer can we—and by we here I mean literally anyone, whether humanly or artificially intelligent—actually make?</p>



 
 And it would not hallucinate facts or sources when providing responses. 



 Example from Yudkowsky’s recent Time <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">essay,</a> where he suggests that “to visualize a hostile superhuman AI …[v]isualize an entire alien civilization, thinking at millions of times human speeds …allowing an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms or bootstrap straight to postbiological molecular manufacturing.” 



 See e.g. this short <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/c5GHf2kMGhA4Tsj4g/the-ai-in-a-box-boxes-you">post</a> by Stuart Armstrong, or perhaps watch some <a href="https://streamberry.tv/">Streamberry.</a> 
 



 Bounding computation 



<p>Untangling various network cables and contemplating a bound, let’s consider the interplay of economic limitations, technological limitations and, finally, physical limitations.</p>



<p>As anyone working in AI right now knows, procuring GPUs is extremely difficult, so even an order for only a finite number of GPUs will still take an undefined amount of time to materialize. These supply issues are of course not fundamental obstructions to building, but they do point to the heart of economic issues in scaling: how much of the world’s resources can actually be put to training a single AI model?</p>



<p>Estimates for the cost of supercomputers capable of training the current state-of-the-art LLMs are of order $100M. If the next-generation cluster <a href="https://twitter.com/pfau/status/1644741636172251137?s=20">costs $1B</a>, how many more generations remain? Sure, some very big (as in tech) corporations will be able to spend $10B, though beyond that, there are only ~150 companies globally with a market cap above $100B, and today’s biggest company, Apple, has a market cap of (only) ~$3T. Beyond even that, while the U.S. government can command more resources than an Elon Musk—though let us ignore the near-impossible amount of coordination it would take to incorporate frontier AI efforts into a functioning government institution—$100B–$1T is a likely overall U.S. maximum.8 Even so, imagine that we—and by we here I mean literally everyone—band together and devote all economic productivity towards building the biggest computer, there’s still not much room until we surpass the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD">gross world product </a>(which itself just crossed $100T in 2022). Altogether, this points to roughly 2-3 non-government iterations left (e.g., OpenAI can release GPT-6 or 7), or 5 all-in-world iterations left, before the end of economic scaling.</p>



<p>Ignoring the economics for the moment, couldn’t we in principle just keep making our supercomputers faster? Following the current gradient of innovation, we can see this strategy at work both at the level of the GPU—where we’ve been squeezing more and more transistors together on the same chip—and at the level of the cluster—where we’ve been networking together more and more GPUs in increasingly larger data centers.9 However, trends of smaller transistors and larger clusters are powered by breakthroughs in technology—stacks of innovations that enable us to engineer smaller transistors or efficiently power and connect clusters of GPUs—that are increasingly on a collision course with fundamental limits of physics.</p>



<p>While it’s more difficult to do in-context napkin-math as we did two paragraphs ago, we can give some intuition. The driving inspiration for faster GPUs is Moore’s law, one version of which—the empirical observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles roughly every two years—has held since its first observation in 1965.10 Unfortunately, such observations are likely to be discontinued: <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">estimates</a> predict that transistors made of silicon can be shrunk only by an additional factor of four before the hot environment of the GPU will begin to create computational errors.11</p>



<p>Moore’s-over, making bigger clusters is more than simply stacking server racks in bigger and bigger buildings: each node needs to be properly powered and cooled and networked.12 The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/06/what-is-nvidia-nvlink/">interconnections</a> between GPUs are an essential technology of the supercomputer, since each GPU needs to communicate with every other GPU for a supercomputer-sized AI model to function. Note though that as the earthly footprint of any cluster grows, the typical distance between GPUs is growing with the square-root of that footprint (e.g. the typical linear dimension of the data center): thus, regardless of how good interconnect technology becomes, “<a href="https://www.wired.com/1996/08/id/">the speed of light sucks,</a>” and latency is unavoidable in any superbrain.</p>



<p>So at some point (soon) we’ll reach a bound of how transformer-dense a chip can be, and putting more transformer-dense material together in the same room may not help us because the different parts of that material will be increasingly separated in space, making it harder and harder for it to communicate internally. Perhaps we can account for the former limitation by replacing transistors—e.g., move from electronics to photonics—or maybe we can somehow address the latter constraint by inventing better distributed computing algorithms? Now as computational optimists, let’s say we—and by we here I mean … you know what, I suppose that by we here I mean an actual superintelligent AGI—redirected our entire economy to further scaling the AI, converted all of our natural resources—perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence">literally the planet</a>—into GPUs, and remedied the technical limitations above. What then?</p>



<p>Unfortunately there’s still a terminal point to this kind of scaling due to a more fundamental kind of physics: if you put enough GPUs together, eventually something very surprising is going to happen; they’re going to collapse into a black hole!13 &nbsp;The gravitational attraction of each of the GPU servers to one another is outrageously tiny, but, if you stick roughly 1037 of them together, they will eventually matter in a very serious way.14</p>



 
 As a point of comparison, the entire U.S. Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3326875/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-defense-budget">budget</a> for 2024 is (only) $842B. 



 N.B. there are also gradient-free, if you will, <a href="https://lightmatter.co/">innovations</a> to pay attention to. 



 An alternate version of Moore’s law—which observes that every two years the number of transistors doubles at the lowest price per transistor—has already <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">broken down.</a> 



 In technical terms, this is the scale at which <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/106/19/193503/27706/The-fundamental-downscaling-limit-of-field-effect">thermodynamic fluctuations</a> will begin to dominate. 



 Okay here’s some in-footnote napkin-math: a state-of-the-art GPU node (Nvidia’s DGX H100) uses about <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">10 kilowatts</a> of power; ignoring all the other power needs of the data center—e.g., cooling—a cluster of a million such nodes (8,000,000 GPUs)—roughly ~360x larger than the largest <a href="https://inflection.ai/inflection-ai-announces-1-3-billion-of-funding">publicly known</a> AI cluster and a naive sticker price of ~$500B—would require the amount of power needed at peak by all of NYC in the summer. (See, e.g., Table I-3a, Zone J, <a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/2226333/2022-Gold-Book-Final-Public.pdf/cd2fb218-fd1e-8428-7f19-df3e0cf4df3e">here.</a>) Generating and delivering even that lower-bounded amount of power would be extremely nontrivial. 



 More in-footnote napkin-math: one of Nvidia’s <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">DGX H100 servers</a> contains 8 GPUs, has a volume of 0.15 m3, and weighs 130 kg. Meanwhile, the Schwarzschild radius Rs = 2GNM relates the mass of a black hole to its radius, where Rs is the Schwarzschild radius, M is the mass, and GN = 6.67 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 is Newton’s gravitational constant. If you try to pack enough mass into a small enough region with linear dimensions R such that R/M = 2GN, you will form a black hole. For any collection of N objects of constant density, the mass of the collection scales like N, but the radius of the collection scales like N1/3. Thus, R/M ~N−2/3, and you will always eventually form a black hole by increasing the number of objects in your collection.&nbsp; 



 For comparison, GPT-4 was trained on an order of only 104 GPUs. I hope it’s obvious, but not even the biggest AGI <a href="https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets">accelerationist</a> is likely to bet on the actual existence of 1037 GPUs. 
 



 Practically speaking 



<p>1037 GPUs is a lot. So is 1036. (And so is 101, if you’re a startup, and 100 if you’re just a person. GPUs are expensive.) So what?</p>



<p>Is there anything on our list of unbounded-compute god-like AGI powers above that we expect is limited at 1036 GPUs but permitted at 1037 GPUs?</p>



<p>Items (i) and (ii) are the entire point of investing in AI today. It would be a tragedy if they were not possible. LLMs with the right guardrails and retrieval abilities already are information oracles. Given that humans can reason and do science—some of us without even any GPUs(!)—it’s not clear that a scaling bound from physics will limit AI.15</p>



<p>The <a href="https://intelligence.org/ie-faq/">original AI doomer concern</a> is born out of the idea of an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808604180">intelligence explosion</a>: future AGI systems will have a general intelligence that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems…</p>



<p>This idea is sometimes called <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/recursive-self-improvement">recursive self-improvement</a>; it’s really just the basic idea that investments—in this case, in intelligence—compound exponentially.</p>



<p>The point of this discussion is really just to illustrate the point that there’s no such thing as unbounded computation. This cycle will stop. All aspiring AGIs and their companies are first subject to practical constraints on computation—such as raising an enormous amount of capital to build or access a supercomputer—but even if those “prosaic” limitations are overcome, any derived AGI systems are ultimately subject to a variety of fundamental physical constraints.16</p>



<p>So, does a physical limit of computation perspective on AI matter in practice?</p>



 
 If your conception of AI is as new technology—perhaps even the most incredibly transformative technology—then, I think, likely no. 



 If your conception of AI is creating an infinitely powerful god (or maybe summoning a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzb_CSRO-0g">demon)</a>—a technology that may as well be unbounded magic—then, I think, likely yes. 
 



 
 For items (iii) and (iv), I really don’t know. We—you and me(!?)—should do some physics calculations and find out! 



 Not to mention any <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">“artificial” compute bounds</a> that may be put in place. 
 



 Cutting tails 



<p>By discussing a limit and embedding it in physics, I hope to differentiate between AI—the technology—from AI—the religion. Of course, if you are worried about an infinitely-powerful AGI god, then (self-consistent) fiction shapes your thinking about AI: anything permitted by logic raises a valid concern. My point is that that’s far too broad: thoughtful applications of physical constraints can cut off the very long tail of AI risk and restrict us to a more limited set of outcomes.17&nbsp;</p>



<p>Limited, but not any less crucial. For this reason, I think we should focus on the costs and benefits of AI as we would other revolutionary technologies, rather than treating it as something mythical. Demoting AI from god to tech, from religion to science, still leaves us the ability to accelerate both technology and science—right up to the limits imposed by the laws of physics. In other words, the really exciting outcome from our list of (i)-(v) above is the one where we build a toolfor scientific reasoning.</p>



<p>To get there, we’ll need new ideas that go beyond <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361">pure compute scaling</a>. For researchers, for engineers, and for founders, that’s a (scientific) reason to be optimistic.</p>



 
 Just so we are clear, we are not claiming that a superintelligent AI would, as a cartoon villain set on world domination, choose to ignore the laws of physics and hubristically find itself confined in a black hole. On the one hand, this would certainly be very funny and a hilarious failure mode for any AI that aspires to commit malfeasance via item (iii) above. On the other hand, if you attempted item (v), as I did, you might have noticed that nowhere among ChatGPT’s very imaginatively-boring answers does it make this point; the current AI is blissfully unaware that its successors may be limited by physics. On our third hand, at the very least we may assume that some future chatbots may read this essay…

 🔦Resource: State of Crypto - Policy spotlight  <p>The internet is one of the most important innovations, and engines of progress, in human history — yet it is failing the people who rely on it most: consumers, creators, developers, and small businesses. Control (over decisions, data, and much more) is consolidated among a handful of big platforms, which unilaterally make decisions on behalf of their users; or change the rules suddenly on developers and other builders; and extract prohibitive fees from creators… and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>Blockchains have not only emerged as a credible solution, they also represent an important new computing movement that opens up new opportunities and use-cases well beyond web3. But despite the potential of this industry, critical regulatory guidance has been lacking.&nbsp;</p><p>To share what’s at stake — and provide a resource for anyone seeking to understand, or share more on blockchains &amp; crypto with others more — we put together a quick spotlight deck. It sets context for the why, what, and how of web3; and shares relevant data from our State of Crypto report that you can share with others more broadly. The deck also offers guiding principles to help U.S. policymakers meet their goals of protecting consumers, providing a path to compliance, and ensuring innovation.</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/spotlight-on-crypto-policy/">check out the report here</a> [time: 10 minutes]&nbsp;<br>share: on <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1727371567305470066">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/a16zcrypto_state-of-crypto-2023-spotlight-on-crypto-activity-7133137315786330113-wtfW">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x48fdad58">Farcaster</a></p> 🎨Feature: A creator's journey to self-sovereignty: ‘The why is in the who’ <p>Singer-songwriter, rapper, producer, and performance artist Latashá shares her journey through art, technology (including crypto), NFTs, and “self-sovereignty” in this talk delivered at our second annual Founders Summit a few weeks ago.

Democratizing technology is ‘actually super-hard to do,’ says Andrew B. Hall, a professor of political economy at Stanford Graduate School of Business… Some big-name companies have responded to those concerns by looking for ways to give users more power to decide what guardrails are being put around their products… OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is funding experiments in setting up a democratic process for deciding what rules its artificial intelligence systems should follow…</p><p>Hall says there may be an answer for boosting participation in online democracy — providing rewards to users who get (and stay) involved. In a new paper co-authored with Eliza R. Oak, a PhD candidate at Yale University, Hall studied the governance of Optimism, a startup that creates applications that improve the efficiency of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain platform… In what Hall and Oak believe to be the first study of its kind, they approach the project as ‘a novel laboratory for studying governance.’”&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/inside-government-where-people-are-paid-vote">read more</a> in “Insights by Stanford Business” [time: 5 minutes]</p>  <p><a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/what-kinds-incentives-encourage-participation-democracy-evidence">download the full paper</a>, “What Kinds of Incentives Encourage Participation in Democracy?

Here’s a deep dive into stage 3 development:&nbsp;</p> Circuits <p>The main transaction circuit is ready for Stage 3. We’ve also upgraded our circuits to improve overall protocol security. We have further completed the testing for Rewards Extended Circuit and Balance Checker.</p> Contracts <p>The Vault V1 contract has been delivered. Further, the main transaction function of the Pool contract which is the foundation for the stage 3 development has been implemented. We’ve also successfully completed all unit tests. We expect to complete integration testing by this week.&nbsp;</p> dApp <p>We made significant progress on our dApp in November. Key achievements include the implementation of transaction tracking in the Wallet Engine and the development of a logic for Know Your Transactions (KYT) attestation for both native tokens and $ZKP tokens on the selected chain.</p><p>We have also introduced Commitment Message Encryption to handle sent and received UTXO's commitment hashes, which are critical for rebuilding past transaction history. Our team is further on track to complete updates for Stages 1 and Stage 2 by December 6th, enhancing our dApp's functionality and user experience.</p><p>UI/UX DesignThe community should expect a brand new design work to be released as part of Stage 3.</p> Roadmap for December&nbsp; <p>We’re looking to launch Stage 3 and Stage 4 in December.

  On November 30, 2023, Circle Research presented and published this idea as part of the DeFi Security track at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security held in Copenhagen.&nbsp;  
  It is recommended for the reader to familiarize themselves with the research from our recent post on recoverability, which can be found <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/a-configurable-and-programmable-wrapper-mechanism-for-recovering-erc-20-tokens">here</a>.  
  
<p>Previously, we introduced recoverable wrapper tokens as a configurable, programmable mechanism to add recoverability features that can help protect developers and users from theft and illicit finance. Different configuration sets suit different contexts and use cases. These sets can range from a general recoverable asset for consumers to a wrapper issued and arbitrated by DeFi protocols to protect their locked funds.&nbsp;</p>

 Digital wallets are essential to the Web3 ecosystem, providing a way for users to store and send digital currencies and serving as a hub to interact with applications. But digital wallets can be difficult for everyday users to set up and keep secure. Many wallets exist as independent products that can’t be easily integrated into existing payments platforms or applications.

 The integration is supported by an automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, that enables simple yield opportunities on day one for all users on EON. &nbsp; 



<p>The Horizen ecosystem is excited to announce its integration with <a href="https://docs.ascent.exchange/">Ascent Exchange</a> with simple yield opportunities via <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vault</a>. This integration is set to significantly enhance the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> platform’s capabilities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, bringing a new level of innovation and efficiency to the industry.</p>



 A New Chapter in DeFi: Horizen EON Meets Ascent Exchange 



<p>This integration represents a major step forward for the Horizen EON ecosystem. By joining forces with Ascent Exchange, Horizen EON leverages Ascent’s expertise in decentralized exchange operations, propelling our platform to new heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Moreover, this integration underlines a shared vision for a unified and interoperable digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can flourish across various platforms.</p>



<a href="https://ascent.exchange"></a>



<blockquote>
<p></p>



<p>“Our integration with Ascent Exchange is a testament to Horizen EON’s commitment to interoperability and resilience in the blockchain ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent’s expertise, coupled with Horizen’s EVM-compatible platform, marks a significant milestone towards creating a more interconnected and robust DeFi ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent Exchange’s early adoption of the Horizen EON platform is set to redefine the DeFi trading space.”&nbsp;</p>
– Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs.</blockquote>



 Simple Yield Opportunities on Ascent Exchange via ICHI Vaults 



  
<p>Ascent Exchange was launched on day one with the support of an automated liquidity management protocol called <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vaults</a>. </p>



<p>This will enable liquidity providers to earn yield with their favorite tokens on Ascent Exchange. Each ICHI Vault allows a depositor to deposit a single token which will then be used as liquidity in an underlying liquidity pool. The Vault prioritizes deposit token yield while protecting from impermanent loss. ICHI Vaults will be launched for a wide range of assets supported by Ascent Exchange.</p>
 <a href="https://ichi.org/"></a> 



 The Ascent Exchange Impact on Horizen EON 



<p>The integration of Ascent Exchange into the Horizen EON ecosystem is expected to bring numerous benefits. As the first decentralized exchange with ve(3,3) tokenomics on Horizen EON, Ascent Exchange is poised to establish a new benchmark in DeFi trading. This strategic move by Ascent Exchange is anticipated to attract a substantial volume of trading activities and users, thereby reinforcing Horizen EON’s position as a leading platform for developers and DeFi enthusiasts.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“As Ascent Exchange embarks on its journey with Horizen EON. We are positioned at the forefront of decentralized exchanges, leveraging a first-mover advantage that sets the stage for unparalleled innovation. </p>



<p>Horizen EON’s exceptional scalability and efficiency empower us to process an increased volume of transactions swiftly and cost-effectively, revolutionizing our operational capabilities. Fundamental to our ethos, the robust security protocols of Horizen EON ensure an unwaveringly secure and trustworthy environment for our users. Embracing the shared values of decentralization and innovation, we join hands with the vibrant Horizen community, further enriching our community-centric approach. </p>



<p>This pivotal shift not only reflects our evolution but also embodies our commitment to exploring new horizons in decentralized finance, inviting our community to be a part of this exciting journey.”</p>
-Bones, Founding member of Ascent Exchange</blockquote>

  Partnering with Squint: Instructions for the Real World  <p>Devin and his team are bringing cutting-edge AR to the factory floor.</p>   
	By Jess Lee	 



Published November 29, 2023
  



Team Squint



 
<p>Every once in a while, technology brings us a magical moment of delight. I remember the first time I used an Apple AirTag. The navigational arrows, haptic feedback and “10 ft away” message created a simple, intuitive way to find my erstwhile keys—and effectively bridged the gap between my mobile device and the real world.&nbsp;</p>



Magic



<p>Squint brings that same Apple-like magic to industrial work. Much in the same way an AirTag can help you find your keys, Squint is a mobile app for the industrial floor—that shows workers step-by-step instructions for how to use machinery.</p>



More magic, on the factory floor



<p>Imagine you’re a worker in a high-stakes industrial setting, navigating a maze of complex equipment on a factory floor. You’ve just been asked to switch production lines because the factory is understaffed, but you’re not familiar with the new machine you need to use. Your options are: a) ask the worker who’s been at the factory for 10 years and knows how to use everything—but they’re super busy, b) read the paper manual—but it’s buried in a binder in the storage room and difficult to find, or c) just wing it—but that could be dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Squint, you have a better option: simply point your mobile device at the equipment to get instant help. Teams can document and record every step of an important procedure, then the app guides workers through it in the real world, augmented with video and all the institutional knowledge they need to do their jobs effectively and safely. You can even use it to check logs, leave notes for the next shift and report maintenance issues. It’s the digital equivalent of the person who’s been at the factory for 10 years, hovering over your shoulder, helping you out.</p>







<p>As America faces an industrial labor shortage, Squint also offers a sorely needed boost in manufacturing productivity and worker retention. Manufacturing is the nation’s fifth largest employment category and growing, as more companies move operations to the U.S. from Asia. However, a quarter of industrial workers are older than 55 and will soon retire, leaving a widening skill gap behind. To bridge it, companies including Colgate-Palmolive, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Michelin, JTEKT, Siemens and Volvo are using Squint to train and retain employees, increase productivity and ensure safety. Colgate-Palmolive, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhGSvkapruc">found</a> procedures were completed 50% faster with Squint—regardless of a worker’s experience level with the equipment. They also saw greater accuracy and reduced training times, and unlocked new insights through Squint’s built-in analytics.</p>



<p>When I first met Squint founder and CEO Devin Bhushan in 2015, he was a 23-year-old software engineer at Yahoo, tasked with writing the Flurry mobile app all by himself. Despite having no prior iOS experience, he did just that—and helped Yahoo’s customers understand their product analytics. He later joined Splunk, where he led the mobile AR team that made data visible for industrial companies. There, he was inundated by requests from customers to see not just their Splunk data, but all their data—and thus Squint was born. Devin’s experience across mobile, AR and product analytics makes him uniquely suited to lead Squint and pioneer this new category of software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia had the privilege of leading Squint’s $3.5M seed round earlier this year, and we got a front-row seat to the team’s incredible pace of progress when Devin and founding PM Dylan Conway joined us for Sequoia <a href="http://arc.sequoiacap.com">Arc</a>, our catalyst for pre-seed and seed-stage companies. Over the last six months, Squint’s tremendous market pull gave us the conviction to lean in and lead the Series A.</p>



Squint Founding PM Dylan Conway and Founder and CEO Devin Bhushan at Sequoia Arc



<p>We’re thrilled to be in business with Devin and his team, and excited for the possibilities they’ll continue to unlock with AR and AI. While today Squint is focused on industrial use cases, we can imagine the app someday becoming the instruction manual for any device or place—from your new coffee maker or camera to your Airbnb stay. This is only the beginning for Squint, and we’re excited to be their partners for the journey ahead.</p>

<p>Multi-signature structures have been around for a while and are securing billions of euros in digital assets. But how do they work? And what are the main differences with a simple single-signature structure?</p>



<p>In this article we will discuss what multi-signature structures are, the use cases of multi-signature structures, and how multi-signature structures work.</p>



 What is a multi-signature structure? 



<p>In essence, a multi-signature structure is a key security feature employed within the blockchain ecosystem to ensure that specific actions require the approval and cooperation of multiple parties before they can be executed. Unlike signatures in the physical world, signatures on a blockchain are performed using digital keys belonging to a certain party.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on a single digital signature, a multi-signature structure mandates that a predefined number of authorised signatures need to happen before a transaction can be executed.</p>



<p>It is important to note that in certain cases a multi-signature structure may also refer to a structure in which an action may require only one signature but has multiple parties that can authorise this action.</p>



 Why multi-signature structures are essential 



<p>But why would anyone use a multi-signature structure in the first place? The answer is simple: security. In a digital ecosystem in which certain actions can not be undone, it is crucial that the integrity and security of these transactions is guaranteed. A multi-signature structure adds an additional security layer to the blockchain ecosystem and addresses some of the security risks of single-signature structures.</p>



 Security risks of single-signature structures 



<p>Single-signature structures, where a single key holder can perform certain actions, are susceptible to various security risks and challenges, such as:</p>



 
 Single point of failure: A single compromised key, whether due to theft, hacking, or human error, can lead to unauthorised access and the loss of digital assets. High-profile hacks and cryptocurrency thefts, such as the infamous Mt. Gox hack in 2014, have often resulted from this single point of failure, putting significant amounts of wealth at risk. 



 Lack of accountability: In a single-signature system, the responsibility and accountability for transactions and decisions rest solely on the key holder. This setup can lead to abuse of power, lack of transparency, and difficulties in tracing fraudulent or unauthorised activities. 



 Loss of keys: The loss of a single private key can result in permanent loss of access to digital assets, which is a common and irreversible issue in the cryptocurrency space. A multi-signature structure can help prevent this while also increasing security. 
 



 Use cases of multi-signature structures 



<p>As is clear from the above, single-signature structures are simple and convenient but can carry significant security risks. Multi-signature structures can address some of these risks in the following ways in various domains:</p>



 
 Secure transactions: Multi-signature structures in wallets, accounts, or smart contracts are used to secure cryptocurrency transactions, requiring the approval of multiple key holders. This approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised or fraudulent transactions. 



 Governance: In corporate environments, multi-signature structures can ensure checks and balances by requiring multiple key holders to approve important actions like financial transactions, board resolutions, or contract agreements. Furthermore, they can be useful for any decentralised multi-party decision-making, such as in DAOs or for blockchain governance. 



 Escrow services: Multi-signature escrow accounts keep financial transactions safe, especially in complex deals. Funds are only released when certain conditions are met. Several key holders must agree, ensuring that the deal terms are followed. This adds an extra layer of security and trust in financial transactions, reducing the chances of disputes and fraud. 



 Custody services: Cryptocurrency custodians and exchanges use multi-signature structures to protect customer assets from threats, including insiders and hackers. With multi-signature wallets, access to assets is controlled by a group of key holders (and often third parties for added security). This makes it tough for a single person to access or manipulate the assets without approval. 



 Legal and compliance: Multi-signature structures are important for legal and compliance processes in the digital world. They ensure that multiple parties must agree on actions like signing contracts or complying with regulations. This reduces legal risks and makes sure these procedures are done correctly. Multi-signature structures promote transparency and security in legal and regulatory matters. 



 Emergency recovery: Multi-signature wallets can act as an emergency recovery mechanism, allowing access to digital assets in case of the loss of one key holder, enhancing the security of digital holdings. 
 



 Why is blockchain needed? 



<p>However, why wouldn’t you use more traditional signature-collection methods? In comparison to traditional methods like multiple Docusign signatures, blockchain offers distinct advantages, particularly in transparency, execution speed, and versatility. Docusign, while efficient for collecting signatures, lacks transparency and doesn’t tie actions directly to signing. It merely signifies approval without immediate execution.</p>



<p>Contrastingly, blockchain’s strength lies in its inherent transparency; each approval is linked to an immediate and irreversible execution of the proposed action. Whether it’s a transaction or a governance proposal, blockchain ensures swift and transparent execution, fostering trust among parties involved. Moreover, Docusign doesn’t provide flexibility in assigning different weights or thresholds for signing. Blockchain, on the other hand, offers versatile permission settings, enabling the establishment of varying levels of authorization. This flexibility extends beyond simple signature collection, making blockchain an invaluable tool for diverse transactional and governance needs within enterprises and across various industries.</p>



 How multi-signature structures work 



<p>Multi-signature structures can be created in multiple ways, such as via account systems, smart contracts, and wallets. While the set-up process for each of these ways can differ, these multi-signature structures all function in a similar way. In order to explain how multi-signature structures work, we will explain multi-signature structures using an account system that can be found on popular blockchains such as <a href="https://eosnetwork.com/">EOS</a>, <a href="https://www.wax.io/">WAX</a>, and <a href="https://xprnetwork.org/">XPR</a>.</p>



 Understanding account systems 



<p>Unlike blockchains like Bitcoin or Ripple which use a single keypair for all transactions, an account system has two different permissions. Permissions can be seen as requirements that need to be fulfilled in order for a transaction to go through. Each permission has certain actions associated with it. A default account has 2 native permissions, namely:</p>



 
 Owner: Shows ownership of the account and is needed to make any changes to the ownership of the account. 



 Active: Used for transferring funds, voting for validators, and making other high-level account changes. 
 



<p>Each permission has one or more key(s) associated with it. Each key associated with a permission has a certain weight, and each permission has a certain weight threshold which needs to be met before a transaction requiring that permission is accepted. This is how an account system works.</p>



 Single-signature structure 



<p>The default structure for these accounts is always a single signature structure. But what does that mean?</p>







<p>As can be seen in the image above, the owner permission has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. The same goes for the active permission which has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. This means that only the (private) key associated with the owner or active permission is required to perform any transaction requiring the owner or active permission, respectively.</p>



<p>In essence, similar to a Bitcoin address, only 1 signature is required to perform any action on this account. This is a single-signature structure.</p>



 Multi-signature structure 



<p>Multi-signature accounts function similarly to default accounts, the main difference between the two is the permissions structure. In a default account all permissions have a threshold of 1 and only have 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it, whereas the permissions in a multi-signature account have a threshold of 2 or higher and have multiple keys or permissions of other accounts with (possibly) varying weights associated with them. This also means that multiple keys or account permissions will have to sign any transaction from the multi-signature account.</p>







<p>An example of a possible permissions structure in a multi-signature account can be seen in the image above. Just like the default account described earlier, this account has both the owner and active permission.</p>



<p>However, the owner permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 3 and has 3 keys associated with it: The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 2, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the owner permission, both John’s active key and either Bob’s or Stacy’s active key would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>The active permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 2 and has 3 keys associated with it. The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 1, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the active permission (any combination) of 2 of the active keys would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>Multi-signature structures like these can be configured in any way, with as many participants as needed, for any goal, ranging from security to governance.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is important to note that in these account systems, or smart contracts, custom permissions can be created for certain actions, such as voting, staking, etc. In order to keep the other permissions separate and secure.</p>



 Getting started with multi-signature structures

<p>Homo- (Greek prefix meaning ‘same’); -morphic (Greek suffix meaning ‘having a specific shape/form’)<br>Intuitively, one could deduct that homomorphic encryption indicates that the initial data and the encrypted result (cipher) could share the same form. Based on this property, it can be inferred that computation can be performed on the encrypted data, without prior decryption. By decrypting the result, you get the same output as the computation performed on the unencrypted data. While homomorphic encryption can be either additive or multiplicative, fully homomorphic encryption supports both types of operations. Unlike ZKPs, which are proofs of computational integrity, fully homomorphic encryption allows for encrypted data computation, without revealing additional information about the original data. This could provide the missing link for ensuring private transactions on blockchains’ public ledgers.</p><p>We were joined by Rand Hindi, CEO of Zama, to discuss fully homomorphic encryption solutions, how they differ from ZKPs &amp; MPC, and how they can be leveraged to ensure compliant programmable privacy.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Rand’s background and his interest in privacy  Meeting Pascal and founding Zama  Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)  Zero knowledge proofs vs. Multi-party computation vs. Fully homomorphic encryption  Taking fully homomorphic encryption 'mainstream'  Zama’s products  fhEVM  How multi-party computation would secure fhEVM  Multi-key homomorphic encryption &amp; functional encryption  Deploying an FHE rollup  FHE use cases  Privacy  Zama’s business model  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/randhindi">Rand Hindi on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zama_fhe">Zama on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FhenixIO">Fhenix on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  dYdX Foundation: The recently launched dYdX chain features new governance and token economics, that empower stakers and promote validator decentralisation.

 ZenIP 42206 is open for voting. All ZEN holders have until 11/23/2023 00:00 AM UTC (11/22/2023 7:00 PM ET) to cast their vote via <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xc4bc560e7a88348b98ab5c4aa57f847169713cf9280ff164d72302b78d1ae4f2">Snapshot</a>. 
<br>
<p>We’ve noticed that regardless of the voting instructions and documentation that have been provided and positive sentiment towards this proposal, some of the community members may be still experiencing technical difficulties in the voting process. </p>
<p>We have identified four blockers that may be preventing some community members from being able to vote easily. </p>
<p>Here are the solutions for each of these blockers:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 1) Voting from a multi-sig wallet 
<p>If you have ZEN on a multi-sig wallet, you are not able to link it to Horizen EON as this is currently not supported. Multi-sig wallet users can still vote by proving the ownership of their wallet that contains ZEN. Follow these steps:</p>
<br>
 
 You have until the last block before 11/22/2023 08:00 PM UTC (11/22/2023 3:00 PM ET) to send a transaction of 100 zatoshi (0.00001 $ZEN) to this address znmJjX4QyLeZJFawTCP35T7tqfdhNQMNZEJ (Horizen faucet) with the multisignature address you’d like to link. 
 <a href="https://forms.gle/fC24DFkMjPZiZu3dA">Submit this form </a>to claim your multi-sig wallet address before 11/22/2023 09:00PM UTC (11/22/2023 4:00PM ET). 
 Right after that, we will collect, share and apply the allowlist of multi-sig wallets eligible to vote. 
 







 2) Voting from a non-Sphere wallet 



<p>If you have your ZEN in a wallet other than Sphere, such as Arizen or a hard wallet, you can sign a message right from the application/hardware wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your wallet doesn’t support signing custom messages, you can paste your private key at <a href="https://getzen.cash/sign/">https://getzen.cash/sign/</a>, and produce the signature. The procedure is the following:</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your private key making sure you are in a private location.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your EON wallet address, and press on “Sign”.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Copy the signature you have generated.</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a>.</p>



<p>NOTE: Make sure no one can look at your screen, you may expose your private key. Do it at your own risk.</p>



 3) Voting with ZEN staked on a Horizen Node 



<p>If you have ZEN staked on a Horizen node, you can just sign the message with the command:</p>



<p>zen-cli signmessage %ZEN_ADDRESS% “%YOUR_EON_ACCOUNT%”</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a></p>



 4) Voting with ZEN stored on an exchange&nbsp; 



<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to vote using a ZEN balance that is stored on an exchange at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NOTE: miners may experience a discrepancy between the balance available on the explorer and the one available as voting power. That’s because the new Coinbase output is not seen until it’s involved in the first transaction.</p>

<p></p><p>London, 20th November 2023 – The GBBC Digital Finance (GDF) team led engagements around the world last week. Whilst our policy team and Chair of the Board soft-launched GDF’s Digital Finance All-Party Parliamentary Group in London at Digital Assets Week, GDF CEO, Emma Joyce and GDF Head of Community, Madeleine Boys, made their way to Asia to join many industry leaders, regulators, and policymakers at Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF).</p>
<p>As a prelude to the Festival, Elevandi – a not-for-profit organisation set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) – curated and hosted Elevandi Insights, a day of thoughtful roundtable discussions focused on digital finance. AI and Financial Inclusion were both important themes of the day, alongside tokenisation, payments, and digital financial market infrastructure as prevailing discussion topics which set the tone for SFF.</p>
<p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and tokenised money took the centre stage for the Festival’s payments discussions. Several panels mentioned the crucial role of interoperability in the evolution of CBDCs. Speakers also emphasised its broader application in asset tokenisation, which was highlighted from both the public and private sector – find out more from MAS’ recent <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/guardian/interlinking-networks-technical-paper-vfinal.pdf">“Interlinking Networks Technical Whitepaper</a>”.<br><br>Central banks examined the role of CBDCs as drivers of financial inclusion and vehicles to minimise prudential risks once the onset technological risks are overcome. Large financial institutions and private sector representatives highlighted the importance of tokenised money – whether it be in the form of a CBDC or other forms of tokenised money – as the key to settlement as well as the broader scalability of the industry.</p>
<p>Building on these discussions, MAS published the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/project-orchid/orchid-blueprint-final.pdf">Orchid Blueprint</a> outlining the necessary technological infrastructure for future digital currency transactions in Singapore. This blueprint, derived from insights gained during the Project Orchid industry trials, identifies four essential building blocks to support the effective use of digital money in Singapore:</p>
 
 Settlement Ledger: This component is designed to record digital money transfers, featuring native programmability and the atomic settlement of digital tokens. 
 Tokenisation Bridge: Serving as a vital link, this bridge connects existing account-based settlement systems with ledgers that are compatible with tokenised forms of digital money. 
 Programmability Protocol: The blueprint proposes a common protocol, known as Purpose Bound Money (PBM), enabling the specification of conditions for the use of digital money. 
 Name Service: To enhance accessibility and verification, a Name Service is recommended, translating between complex wallet addresses and alternative name identifiers that are readable and meaningful. 
 
<p>The importance of resilient digital Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI) emerged as another theme in these discussions, emphasising its role as a key enabler to the broad adoption and growth of digital assets. The value of open and interoperable networks among global banks and regulators cannot be understated, and the SFF set the scene for another major announcement in this area.</p>
<p>MAS also unveiled a significant expansion of <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiativeshttps:/www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiatives">Project Guardian</a>, which will delve into promising use cases of asset tokenisation on a public blockchain. The most significant aspect is the introduction of new initiative called Global Layer One (GL1), conceived as an open, digital infrastructure fostering cross-border transactions and global liquidity pools. Major institutions such as BNY Mellon, JP Morgan, DBS, and MUFG will participate. This marks a pivotal step toward integration across the entire capital markets value chain, encompassing listing, distribution, trading, settlement, and asset servicing. Key highlights include:</p>
 
 J.P. Morgan and Apollo are collaborating on leveraging digital assets to facilitate more seamless investment and management of discretionary portfolios and alternative assets. The collaboration also involves automated portfolio rebalancing and customization at scale, promising time savings and a reduction in manual processes related to asset servicing. 
 BNY Mellon and OCBC are engaged in a trial for a cross-border FX payment solution, aiming to facilitate secure and interoperable payment solutions across diverse networks. 
 
<p>GDF convened its members its members together on two distinct occasions, both characterised by the same positive atmosphere that resonated with the overall optimistic outlook of SFF.</p>
<p>Our dinner, which we hosted in partnership with Hogan Lovells, focused on the challenges to building digital trust, and facilitating tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs), and the role regulators and policymakers have to play in balancing innovation with safe regulatory frameworks. Ken Coghill from the DFSA and Danny Russell from the Bank of England joined us and shared some opening remarks on behalf of their agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our lunch, which we hosted in partnership with Clifford Chance, brought together technologists and policy experts for a comprehensive discussion on challenges and essential components for institutionalising digital assets, emphasising ongoing technical efforts to enable financial institutions to leverage public blockchain technology. Malcolm Wright, OKX and former VARA regulator, and John Ho, Standard Chartered, opened the lunch with some optimistic remarks about the&nbsp;direction of travel for industry, with a keen focus on the APAC region.</p>
<p>We could not be more grateful for the continued support of our association’s mission to promote best standards of practice for the digital asset ecosystem, and look forward to continuing to bring together and building our community in the APAC region.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Basic Attention Token announces the ‘Sage Burn’, the final mint phase of the BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT collection, set for December 7th, 2023. NFT holders can join this event on Bandit Network, exchanging three NFTs for a rare Sage NFT. This event kicks off a series of exciting BAT NFT collaborations with Bandit.</p>
<p>December 5th, 2023—Basic Attention Token (BAT) is thrilled to announce the “Sage Burn,” the concluding mint phase of the <a>BAT x Adam Ape Brave NFT collection, first launched in November 2022</a> on Solana. Starting on Thursday, December 7th, 2023, we invite holders of BAT x Adam Ape NFTs to participate in the Sage Burn event by <a>“burning”</a> a set of three specific NFTs—Curious, Dabbler, and Degen—to receive one of the highly exclusive Sage NFTs, featuring bespoke artwork from <a href="https://twitter.com/adam_ape_">Adam Ape</a>, and limited to just 300 pieces.</p>

The Sage</p>
<p>Bandit Network, a Web3 platform focused on developing multi-blockchain NFT minting and quests, is hosting the Sage Burn event. With their expertise in crafting engaging and accessible NFT experiences across the many networks supported in Brave Wallet, Bandit brings a fresh perspective to this project. We look forward to this being the first of many BAT NFT collaborations with Bandit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the outset, the goal of the BAT x Adam Ape NFT project has been to showcase BAT/NFT capabilities within the Solana ecosystem. During the premiere mint on November 9th, 2022, fans could purchase BAT x Adam Ape NFTs using <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">Solana-wrapped BAT</a> in addition to SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. The BAT and Solana NFT communities launched the mint with tremendous success, with all 2500 NFTs from the first three tiers minting within three hours.</p>
<p>For collectors and enthusiasts of Brave and Basic Attention Token, owning a Sage NFT is akin to possessing a piece of digital history. These NFTs symbolize the culmination of the first-ever cross-chain BAT NFT mint, and the inaugural BAT NFT collection launch on Solana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For existing BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT owners, access to our exclusive #holders-chat and #holders-giveaways channels is available upon verification.</p>

 What does ‘burning an NFT’ entail, and is it reversible? 
<p>‘Burning an NFT’ refers to the irreversible process of permanently destroying it by transferring it to an address from which it cannot be retrieved. In the Sage Burn event, you’ll encounter several prompts to confirm your decision, emphasizing the irreversible nature of burning your NFTs. Once an NFT is burned, the action cannot be reversed.</p>


    
    

    




    
    


 Who can join the Sage Burn, and is it limited to certain regions? 
<p>Anyone worldwide can participate in the Sage Burn, as long as they possess the requisite set of NFTs.&nbsp;</p>

 Which specific NFTs are required to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>You must possess at least one NFT from each of the three tiers: Curious, Dabbler, and Degen. The NFTs can be purchased separately on secondary marketplaces. (See below.)&nbsp;</p>

 I missed the first phase of the mint. Can I still join the Sage Burn? 
<p>Absolutely! You can purchase BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFTs on secondary marketplaces using Solana (SOL). These marketplaces include <a href="https://magiceden.io/marketplace/bat">Magic Eden</a>, <a href="https://hyperspace.xyz/collection/batxadamape">Hyperspace</a>, and <a href="https://www.tensor.trade/trade/bat">Tensor</a>. Acquiring a set containing a Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFT enables you to participate in the Sage Burn event.</p>

 What do the numbers on my BAT x Adam Ape NFTs signify, and do they impact my participation in the Sage Burn? 
<p>The number on each BAT x Adam Ape NFT indicates its minting order within the collection. For instance, an NFT numbered #139 signifies it was the 139th to be minted. These numbers do not influence your eligibility for the Sage Burn. To participate, you must possess at least one NFT from each of the three tiers—Curious, Dabbler, and Degen – in your connected wallet at the time of the Burn.</p>

 Is it possible to burn multiple sets of Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs to acquire several Sage NFTs? 
<p>Certainly. You have the option to burn any number of Curious, Dabbler, and Degen sets that you possess. If you own multiple NFTs from each tier, you can decide to burn only some of the sets. The choice is yours!</p>

 What if I choose not to burn my Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs? 
<p>That’s completely fine! Holding onto your Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs is entirely your choice. Participation in the Sage Burn is optional, and you are free to decide whether or not to take part.</p>

 Is it possible to get a Sage NFT without participating in the Sage Burn? 
<p>Certainly! After the Sage Burn event, Sage NFTs will be available for purchase on secondary NFT marketplaces.</p>

 What happens if not all 300 Sage NFTs are minted? 
<p>In the event that not all 300 Sage NFTs are minted, the outcome is a smaller circulation of these NFTs. This limited availability inherently increases the rarity of the existing Sage NFTs.</p>

 What is the total supply for each tier in the collection? 
<p>The BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT collection is distributed across four tiers:</p>
 
 The Curious: 1400 NFTs 
 The Dabbler: 800 NFTs 
 The Degen: 300 NFTs 
 The Sage: 300 NFTs maximum*&nbsp; 
 

 What Web3 wallet is needed to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>To join the Sage Burn, you can use your Brave Wallet or any other Solana DApp-compatible wallet, such as Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, and more. You can also use a hardware wallet, such as a Ledger or Trezor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please ensure that all the BAT x Adam Ape NFTs you plan to burn are consolidated in the same wallet. This wallet should be connected to Bandit Network at the time of the Burn.</p>

 Do my BAT x Adam Ape NFTs need to be in the same wallet? 
<p>All NFTs you plan to burn for the Sage Burn event must be in a single Web3 wallet. This wallet should be the one you connect to Bandit Network for participation in the Burn.</p>

 Can I use the Brave Wallet in my Brave mobile app to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>Absolutely. To participate, visit Bandit Network and connect using your Brave Wallet when prompted.</p>

 How can I see my NFTs in the Brave Wallet? 
<p>To view your NFTs, simply go to the NFTs tab in your Brave Wallet.</p>

 I want to sell, trade, or transfer my NFTs. Where can I do this? 
 
 To transfer an NFT: In your Brave Wallet, select the NFT you wish to transfer, click on ‘Send,’ and enter the recipient’s address. 
 To sell or trade: Visit platforms like <a href="https://magiceden.io/marketplace/bat">Magic Eden</a>, <a href="https://hyperspace.xyz/collection/batxadamape">Hyperspace</a>, or <a href="https://www.tensor.trade/trade/bat">Tensor</a>. Connect your Brave Wallet or another Solana DApp wallet to carry out the transaction. 
 

 What are wrapped tokens and what is sBAT (Solana-Wrapped BAT)? 
<p>Wrapped tokens facilitate the use of assets across different blockchains, improving functionality and interoperability. This process locks the original tokens on their native blockchain and creates an equal number of wrapped tokens on a smart-contract blockchain such as Ethereum</p>
<p>sBAT is an example of this. There are several ways to buy or bridge BAT on Solana:</p>
 
 Purchase wBAT directly in the Brave Wallet using Ramp’s fiat-to-crypto service or convert existing SOL to wBAT. 
 Bridge BAT from Ethereum to Solana using the Wormhole Bridge. 
 

 Where can I purchase SOL? 
<p>You can purchase SOL, the Solana network’s cryptocurrency, directly in the Brave Wallet using fiat or crypto via Coinbase Pay, Link by Stripe, Ramp, or other available options. Alternatively, SOL is also available on any cryptocurrency exchange that supports Solana.</p>

 When will you reveal utility for the Sage? 
<p>While there is no guarantee of added utility for the Sage at the time of the Burn, we are collaboratively exploring future options with the BAT Community. Join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/batbrigade">BAT Brigade Discord</a> and Tuesday <a href="https://talk.brave.com/this--is--your--weekly--bat-community--call">BAT Community Calls</a> at 2pm PST/5pm EST to contribute to this ongoing process.</p>

<p>As of November 2023, USDC is issued and circulating natively on 15 blockchains – 7 more than last year – and yet it is also clear to Circle and the broader community that many more blockchains may emerge and rise to prominence over the next several years.

This was made possible due to the successful approval of PIP-19 and the commendable efforts of our <a href="https://github.com/pantherprotocol/panther-core/pull/12/commits/eb1a943766befac076922ffd5f7d1d1ceac616fa?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">community members</a> for updating related smart contracts and deploying a new frontend on IPFS. You can learn more about how to stake your $ZKP <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/staking/advanced-staking-v0.5?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol’s CEO, Oliver Gale, at the European Blockchain Convention <p>Panther Protocol’s Co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, joined a panel discussion on web3 privacy along with leaders from Secret Network and Zama at the European Blockchain Convention. This panel was part of the Secret Soiree side event on the final day of the convention. You can watch a recording of the session below.</p> Product Updates  Stage 2 Developments  Recharge Functionality <p>Making further advancements on Stage 2 of the protocol, the development of recharge functionality for Protocol Rewards has been completed and will be announced separately once the vesting of $tZKP is configured. The Recharge function is the cornerstone of the protocol’s reward system and allows protocol rewards vested on Mainnet to be injected into the reward distribution process on Polygon (viz the one-sided AMM launched in Stage 2). This dynamic interplay with the AMM pool through the Recharge function fosters active user participation while maintaining a responsive and adaptive reward structure within the protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>You can learn more about our reward structure <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a></p> Stage 3 Developments  Circuits <p>The main transaction circuit is ready for Stage 3 and the team will perform the unit testing of the Rewards Extended Circuit and Balance Checker this week. Panther Core dApp user interface is dependent on the smart contract interactions and the circuits designed for these interactions. The design of these circuits is planned in stages to cover basic scenarios first and then move to more complex handling of input parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Contracts <p>The main transaction function of the Pool contract which is the foundation for the stage 3 development has been implemented. We expect to complete integration testing by this week. The Vault V1 contract was delivered earlier and is in review now.&nbsp;</p> UI/UX Design <p>A new version of Panther V1 Design is being worked on and the community should expect a brand new design work to be released as part of Stage 3.</p> Community Questions <p>When will the team publish the updated roadmap?</p><p>The team plans to release an updated product roadmap this week. </p>  About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

      The Next Billion Developers         
	By David Cahn	 





Published November 15, 2023
        The developer revolution will be as important as the AI revolution.      



 
<p>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is Silicon Valley’s latest obsession. Brilliant minds like <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/elon-musk-reveals-xai-efforts-predicts-full-agi-by-2029/">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">Sam Altman</a> believe achieving AGI is not just likely, but inevitable. Others disagree. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_i-think-the-phrase-agi-should-be-retired-activity-6889610518529613824-gl2F/">Yann LeCun</a>, one of the godfathers of machine learning, has said “there is no such thing as AGI.” <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23779413/silicon-valleys-ai-religion-transhumanism-longtermism-ea">Jack Clark</a> of Anthropic has described the “breathless enthusiasm” for AGI as a “misplaced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M2DaQxTihc">religious impulse</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a lightning rod, AGI captures our imagination. AGI promises <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sam-altman-on-the-a-i-revolution-trillionaires/id1548604447?i=1000525043188">free education and housing</a>, the eradication of poverty with universal basic income, and a reallocation of human capital to science and art. These are worthwhile objectives.</p>



<p>But what if AGI is a distraction? What if there’s another path to this same future—one that does not require a technological leap of faith and is already underway?</p>



<p>There are more developers today than ever before. And the population is starting to snowball. Our thesis is that bringing 1B developers into the software economy could rival AGI in terms of its economic impact.1</p>



<p>Software engineering is one of the most powerful tools that humans have ever invented. If we can make it even more widely available—assisted and accelerated by AI—it could result in the automation of many non-tech industries, creating an economic surplus.</p>



<p>But is this target of 1B developers really achievable? Isn’t software engineering too hard to teach to so many people? And what would we do with all those developers?</p>



<p>Let’s start with the goal of 1B developers. This year, the developer population crossed <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">100M</a>, up from 24M when Github first started reporting the metric in 2017.2 In Github’s recently published <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">State of the Octoverse</a> report, they shared that the global developer population grew 26% in the last year. Github added 21M new accounts in 2022.</p>



<p>We have three reasons to believe hypergrowth in the developer population will persist.<br></p>



<p>First, it’s been getting much easier to become a developer, and we expect this flywheel to continue. In just the last decade, Cloud abstracted away the server. Databases like MongoDB and Postgres simplified the back-end. Vercel and React reshaped the front-end. The best software engineers continue to focus on improving the discipline itself. By iteratively building better and better abstractions, software engineers have created a flywheel that reduces complexity while increasing potency. As a result, a 12 year-old in India can now build a web app in a matter of days, something that would have taken a professional developer weeks before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, market forces continue to attract more and more young people to become software engineers. Already, the best and brightest are disproportionately learning to code. Rather than dampening as more talent has entered the field, the economic returns to software engineering only seem to be expanding. What this means is that the productivity of software engineers, and the applicability of their skills, is expanding faster than the supply.</p>



<p>Third, AI has been an unanticipated accelerator. Today, <a href="https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-for-business-is-now-available/">Github Copilot</a> is writing 46% of users’ code. <a href="https://zapier.com/ai">Zapier</a> enables developers to build automations with text descriptions. <a href="https://openinterpreter.com/">Open Interpreter</a> is turning the command line into a chat interface. With AI copilots, we may eventually be able to program computers using natural language alone.</p>



<p>Growth in the developer population enables the software economy to broaden its scope and impact. For example, companies like Stripe, Twilio and Plaid have created essential building blocks for payments, telecommunications and banking. Traditional companies in mature industries are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/18/despite-mass-layoffs-led-by-meta-its-still-hard-to-fill-tech-jobs.html">bringing on</a> more and more software engineers to drive internal digitization. Newer startups are also taking software and AI and applying these technologies to sectors like mining, robotics, construction, accounting and legal. The opportunity with 1B developers is to drive automation not just in the digital economy, but in the physical economy as well.</p>



<p>Unlike AGI, the promise of 1B developers is not about eliminating work altogether. Rather, it is about taking our resources—human resources—and leveraging them to have more and more impact. Thus, the story of the coming decades may be about the increased power of AI. But more quietly, the methodical march of the developer revolution will continue.&nbsp;</p>

      Finding Her Place in the Sun         
	By Harry Spitzer	 



Published November 14, 2023
        Lynn Jurich’s unwavering determination to unlock cleaner, greener energy powered the rise of Sunrun.      



 
<p>In March 2023, solar entrepreneur Lynn Jurich took the stage for the Stanford Graduate School of Business’s Climate, Business &amp; Innovation Summit. In the 15 years that had passed since she had attended the school herself, solar energy had come of age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time in history, the cost of solar energy has fallen below that of fossil fuels, and Sunrun, which Jurich co-founded in 2007, is now the largest installer of residential solar panels in the U.S., with more than 800,000 customers in 20 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico. Her unwavering determination to change energy infrastructure (and the world) is what brought Jurich back to GSB that day. But these achievements, and the survival of her company, were never a given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich took her audience back to Sunrun’s early days, to a time when consumer solar was still the wheelhouse of “hippies and hobbyists,” and installation and hardware were expensive. Back then, Jurich and her co-founders had waded through the complexities of the green energy space without a clear sense for how to make their business model, much less the world, sustainable. And they were perilously close to burning through their venture capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our initial vision was that we would be pretty asset-light,” Jurich told the audience. “The existing solar installers out there would be doing the construction and selling to homeowners. We would raise the capital, and own and monitor the systems. So we’d only need a few employees. But we were wrong. Very, very wrong.”</p>



 



<p>The sun had already set, but the teenage Jurich refused to go back inside without sinking a few more shots. She wouldn’t feel content calling it a day until she was, according to her sister Tracy, “basically shooting NBA free-throw percentages.” Focus, which in this case earned Jurich a spot on the Pac-10 recruiting list for basketball by 8th grade, had been Jurich’s speciality since kindergarten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At five years old, Jurich had started writing to-do lists. “My list would be like, ‘invent something.’ Or, ‘make a scientific discovery,’” she remembers. At age six, reading biographies became her pastime of choice, an activity that suited her introverted nature. She’d go to the public library in her neighborhood near Point Defiance, a lush peninsula jutting into the Puget Sound, and work her way through their nonfiction section. She had lots of things she wanted to accomplish, and was looking for proofs of concept. “I was always attracted to people who mastered their craft,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her early favorites centered on strong women: Florence Nightingale, Betsy Ross, Anne Frank. But fittingly, no biography captivated her more than that of Thomas Edison, inventor of the lightbulb (and 1,000 or so other things). In a prescient 1931 exchange between Edison and Henry Ford, Edison notes, “We should be using nature’s inexhaustible sources of energy—sun, wind and tide.” (According to recent sources, the sun produces enough sunlight to power Earth’s electricity needs for a year every hour.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But truly mastering one’s craft was no easy feat—Jurich had internalized this from her biography obsession. It required resolve and concentration, which Jurich maintained through high school and then college at Stanford, where she earned top honors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After graduating, Jurich landed a competitive role at a prestigious private equity firm. Her job was to get in front of entrepreneurs by any means necessary—cold-calling, attending the same conferences as them, befriending their assistants so that she could sit next to them on a plane—and evaluate them for potential investment opportunities. This was daunting for the self-described “strong introvert,” but once she worked up the nerve she found that pushing herself had an important upside. Like her biography kick on steroids, she got to observe dozens of highly accomplished individuals modeling potential paths to success, an experience that made it clear to her that “if there’s a good company out there, it’s going to get funded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After three years working on the investor side, she needed no further proof of concept. “It was just very clear to me that I wanted to be on the entrepreneur side,” says Jurich. This hard-earned clarity led her to return to Stanford for business school.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“How do we get people to give solar a shot?” It was January 2007, and this was the question Jurich, Ed Fenster, a Stanford GSB classmate, and Nat Kreamer, a childhood friend of Fenster’s, had been debating for weeks over pizza and Diet Coke in the living room of Fenster’s San Francisco apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’d filed the paperwork for their company Sunrun just a few days earlier, officially making this question of particular interest for the group. Jurich was fresh off a summer banking internship in Shanghai, where she had been struck by the density of construction and urban energy infrastructure. She couldn’t stop thinking about clean energy and how to make continued infrastructure development more sustainable. Kreamer was recently back from a tour in Afghanistan and motivated to seek energy independence after fighting in a war he’d concluded was mostly about fossil fuels. Fenster had connected the dots, uniting the team in his apartment to solve the challenge of solar expansion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fueled by cheesy carbohydrates and artificial sweetener, they concluded that the real opportunity lay not in developing cleantech, but in deploying it. “We saw that VC money was already being put toward making solar panels cheaper. We were quite certain that innovation was going to happen,” says Jurich. “So we thought, ‘Why don’t we solve the problem of convincing people to give solar panels a shot, and figuring out how to interface with the electric grid?’ That was gonna be the bigger challenge and the bigger area to add value.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer they settled on was to lower the barrier to solar adoption as much as possible for homeowners. Sunrun would offer ‘solar-as-a-service,’ leasing solar panels with a small upfront cost at a time when owning and installing one’s own solar panels was still logistically challenging, and prohibitively expensive for many. “The business model innovation was that we would put solar panels on your rooftop for very little money, and you would sign a 20-year contract to buy the electricity from us for X cents per kilowatt hour,” says Jurich. “So it was a long-term contract for us, the customer didn’t have to spend the money up front, and they could get cheaper power. Win-win all the way around.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going the consumer route, as opposed to leasing solar panels to corporations, was an added challenge, however. It meant figuring out how to install and operate panels on houses of all shapes and sizes in varying conditions around the country. But if they could manage all of that, Jurich believed this approach would ultimately make a more defensible business. “We believed costs would hit grid parity first at the consumer level because consumers pay the most money for power,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By narrowing their focus to homeowners, the founders were actually thinking bigger—not only would they be spreading clean energy, they could reduce inefficiencies in energy infrastructure. “What’s really innovative about solar is you can use an existing roof,” says Jurich. “You don’t have to acquire land. You don’t have to build big transmission lines. You don’t have to interrupt the ecosystem.” The value prop and climate impact seemed undeniable. They’d soon find out it wasn’t such an easy sell.&nbsp;</p>
 







 
<p>Jurich’s voice was hoarse from hollering at passersby. This was her third county fair in as many days, dusty and hot, and a far cry from her time in private equity traveling on private jets (which, at least on an environmental level, felt like karmic justice). Again, Jurich had found herself in the challenging situation of having to talk to strangers. This time, Jurich was donning her company swag (an oversized white tee that read, “A penny for your watts?”) and standing next to an oversized pumpkin. She was desperate to make a sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fenster, they decided early on, would take the role of CEO and focus on raising capital; Kreamer, as president, would take on installations, billing, and system monitoring; and it was up to Jurich as COO to build out their business pipeline (read: sales). She had deduced that the quickest way to sell consumers on solar panels was to go straight to the source. “This was 2007. There weren’t a lot of people online searching, you know, ‘I want a solar energy system,’” says Jurich. “So we were like, ‘Where do you find a homeowner who would be interested in Sunrun?’ I decided to go to places with lots of homes and lots of sun.”</p>



<p>From the rare fair-goer who agreed to chat, Jurich gleaned that “going green” still wasn’t enough—they were willing to consider solar only if it saved them money. Even after Sunrun’s upfront costs (initially about $10,000 for installs, still well below the cost of buying and installing one’s own panels), Sunrun would save them money, but only over the course of years—a commitment most consumers weren’t willing to make with a startup that had existed for just a few months. “What I always told them was, ‘If someone came to your house and said they would install a gasoline tank, and you could buy gas for $1 per gallon for the next 20 years, would you do it? That’s what we’re offering: Electricity at a fixed price for 20 years and it’s cheaper,’” says Jurich. “People thought it was too good to be true.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After dozens of refusals, Jurich finally caught the attention of a woman named Sue who ran a trucking company. Jurich made her pitch, highlighting the fixed, long-term rate, which was much lower than traditional electrical costs. She told Sue that Sunrun would own, operate and maintain the solar panels on her roof, but that they outsourced sales and installation to existing solar installers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sue, excited to bet on a young female entrepreneur, was convinced. And Jurich, after months in the summer heat hawking her solar wares, made her third sale (Sunrun’s first sale was to Fenster, and the second was to his therapist). “Seeing that there was actually consumer interest in this helped me so much,” says Jurich, “It gave me the conviction that this was gonna work, that all the hustle was worth it. That conviction can get you through some pretty hard times.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hard times turned out to be just around the corner, and she’d need all the conviction she could muster.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“We’re done for,” Jurich thought as she read the headlines announcing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Bank. It was September 2008, and Sunrun was desperately in need of funding—money that suddenly seemed entirely unattainable.</p>



<p>Sunrun’s early sales had put its business model to the test. Since the company was covering most of the upfront purchase and installation costs, its ability to sell was contingent upon its ability to raise money. But banks wanted proof of sales before lending. “We had a chicken and an egg problem,” says Jurich. The co-founders were forced to use their seed money—a few million they’d managed to raise from contacts in private equity and banking—to finance their earliest installs. But with dwindling funds and no guarantee that they could secure investments to stay afloat, “it made for an extremely stressful time,” Jurich says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They had finally managed to raise $12 million in June 2008, a lifeline as sales were starting to take off—but nothing close to what they needed to scale. Just as new term sheets began to come their way, Lehman Brothers went under, signaling a complete collapse of the financing ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every day, another bank pulled out of negotiations. Sunrun’s point of contact would be fired, or the entire financial institution would dissolve. But then, in November 2008, there came a flicker of hope. The Sunrun founders received a callback from U.S. Bank, the rare financial institution that hadn’t been decimated by the collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing this was likely their only shot, the founders negotiated a deal they hoped would be hard to refuse. “We were panicking,” Jurich says. “But at the same time, we were like ‘We are going to close this deal because we have no choice.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2008, Sunrun closed a $40 million debt financing round from U.S. Bank. “Looking back, we call this moment our big awakening,” Jurich says. Fenster agrees. “Had we not gotten that deal,” he says, “the company might not have made it another four months.”</p>



 



<p>Six years after bringing Sunrun back from the brink, Jurich’s sense of solar inevitability was feeling like less of a moonshot with every passing day. For one, Sequoia became a believer (and led Sunrun’s Series C), as did traditional energy giant, PG&amp;E, who had invested an additional $100 million to finance installations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which isn’t to say things were entirely sunny. Solar gaining traction threatened most other incumbent utilities, who did all they could to block Sunrun’s growth through lobbying. And then there were the government subsidies—hugely positive in the ways they pushed growth in a sustainable direction, but wildly destabilizing from a business perspective, with one subsidy or regulation unlocking a market one month, and an expiring subsidy making another disappear the next.</p>



<p>In 2009, the Obama stimulus package extended a solar tax credit to homeowners who bought their own system. This lowered the purchase price of solar panels overall, which made it harder for Sunrun to convince homeowners to buy into their leasing model, in particular paying for the company’s upfront installation costs. “That blew up our whole transaction model,” says Fenster. Jurich and Fenster, by then co-CEOs (Kreamer left the company in 2009), decided they needed to eliminate upfront costs entirely in order to remain competitive. To compensate, they increased their new customers’ monthly payments while still managing to stay below traditional utility rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their new no-upfront pricing structure made it easier than ever for homeowners to give solar a shot, but not enough to edge out their competition. Elon Musk’s SolarCity had just gone public and was starting to outpace Sunrun. And SolarCity had something crucial that Sunrun lacked: their own operations and installation capabilities. Seven years in, Sunrun was still essentially operating as a management and financing company, relying on third parties for construction, installation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they wanted to scale, Sunrun would have to take over the third-party labor themselves. This, of course, required a huge amount of capital that Sunrun didn’t have. But, no stranger to complex negotiations, Jurich and Fenster managed to secure a massive acquisition of their largest installations partner, REC Solar’s Residential Division (AEE Solar and SnapNrack), in an all-equity deal as a workaround. Overnight, Sunrun grew from 150 employees to 550. That same year, signaling just how much Jurich had grown as a leader since her days of reluctant cold-calling, Fenster stepped down as co-CEO of Sunrun, and Jurich stepped into the role. “Lynn was a better head for the company than I was,” he says. “There are really smart people who are excellent at making decisions but who aren’t great at managing people. Lynn’s unique in that she can do both.”</p>



<p>Poised for expansion, and in the wake of SolarCity’s IPO, the pressure was on for Sunrun to follow suit. “I knew we needed to go public,” Jurich says. “There were a handful of solar IPOs that had just happened that we didn’t believe in, and we thought they were gonna spook the market. So I didn’t really feel that I had the luxury to slow down at any point in the process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not even when she learned she was pregnant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich’s daughter Blythe was born just a few weeks before Sunrun’s IPO on August 5, 2015, and was in Jurich’s arms when she rang the Nasdaq bell. “I got on a conference call the day I got home from the hospital, and my mom moved in and helped me,” says Jurich. (While Jurich, who had her second child in 2018, didn’t take maternity leave, she expanded maternity leave benefits for the rest of the company, signaling that she didn’t expect others to make the same choice that she had.)</p>



<p>Sunrun’s share price dropped roughly 20% on its first day of trading, which only fed Jurich’s resolve to be as present at the company as possible. She started her investor roadshow when Blythe was just five weeks old, bringing her mother and a nurse along for support. “I was constantly pumping and shuttling milk back and forth between hotels and hedge fund offices,” Jurich says. “It was exhausting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2017, Sunrun had rebounded from its post-IPO dip to become the largest publicly traded rooftop solar company in the U.S. following Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity. After years of fundraising, surviving a recession, battling incumbent utilities, navigating company altering climate legislation, IPOing and becoming a mother, Jurich felt like things were finally in a good place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s when the Wall Street Journal article came out.</p>

<p>In the May 2017 piece, former Sunrun employees claimed the company hadn’t reported order cancellations that may have affected sales data in financial disclosures leading up to the IPO. Jurich denied all wrongdoing, claiming the journalism was “not representative of the company and suspect.” Despite Sunrun’s assurances, the article triggered a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) of Sunrun and its competitor, SolarCity. Sunrun’s stock bottomed out. And shareholders filed a class action suit against Sunrun.</p>



<p>Jurich remembers this time, as her company’s reputation and her own integrity were called into question, as one dominated by a profound sense of grief and powerlessness. Ever since her days of writing her first to-do lists, she’d been laser focused on success. But suddenly, no amount of resolve, no degree of hustle could change the way the world perceived her and her company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, months after the initial article broke, Sunrun released a statement saying that after conducting an internal audit, the SEC didn’t find any evidence of manipulated sales data. Still, the company ended up making a $30 million settlement with shareholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Sunrun’s name had technically been cleared, in the weeks following, Jurich continued to struggle emotionally from the toll the probe had taken. For the woman who had defined so much of her life by her achievements, this failure—which she certainly saw it as—felt existential. She faced a choice: “Your options are either to crumble because you can’t deal with it, or to figure out how to keep going and operate at a higher level,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time, she decided that “higher level” didn’t mean working harder. It meant “reflecting on my values, starting a meditation practice, keeping my fitness going, and not caring too much about what other people think,” says Jurich. She was able to let go, minding public perceptions less as her company slowly but surely regained its footing and earned back consumer trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, from their all-time low in share prices, something surprising happened. “The WSJ article was an interesting inflection point for the company,” says Fenster, “because after it caused the stock to bottom, momentum started to come back.” Over the next two years, Sunrun’s stock rose roughly 400%, signaling to the world that Sunrun had staying power.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Just before Thomas Edison’s death, in that same 1931 conversation with Henry Ford, he said, “I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.” Today, Jurich feels closer than ever to paying out her hero’s bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2007, Sunrun has deployed 5.7 gigawatts of total solar capacity, making it one of the world’s largest sources of networked solar energy. In 2019, Sunrun overtook Tesla’s SolarCity as the leading installer of residential rooftop solar panels in the U.S. “We’re at this inflection point where consumers have wrapped their minds around solar power, and they accept it,” says Jurich, who stepped down as CEO of Sunrun in 2021, but remains the company’s Co-Executive Chair.</p>



<p>Part of that acceptance comes from a greater understanding of climate urgency. It comes from legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other clean energy initiatives, reinstates generous tax credits for homeowners who install solar panels. And it comes from increasingly affordable solar hardware, a trend the founders predicted at Sunrun’s outset (today, solar panel prices are down nine times since 2006). An additional factor is technological advancement: “One of the challenges with solar was always that you couldn’t store it,” says Jurich, “but now, batteries have completely changed that. You can generate, store and distribute energy to the grid without building new plants, or even solar farms. You can just use existing roofs!” To that end, in 2020 Sunrun funded and helped found Lunar Energy, an independent company focused on building the next-generation home battery system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade and a half working in clean energy has made Jurich a realist about the magnitude of her company’s undertakings. Which is why, more than ever, she’s looking to others to share the burden, and in part why she returned to her alma mater in March 2023. This was a chance to speak to a new generation of potential clean energy leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do worry that the United States broadly has lost the skillset to develop large-scale infrastructure,” Jurich said toward the end of her keynote. “But I encourage all of you to help. I’ve already talked to a couple of you who have great business ideas around trying to make labor more efficient, making large-scale construction more efficient. And I do think we will get there.”</p>



<p>By “there,” Jurich means a sustainable future of clean energy abundance. And on a personal level, she hopes for a future with more balance, filled with more of the hard-earned equanimity on display at the GSB climate summit. “One of the things I’ve come to appreciate in life is that in order to be most effective, you need periods of both intensity and periods of rest and renewal,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rest, as always with Jurich, is a relative concept. She’s Co-Executive Chair of Sunrun, Chair of Lunar Energy, and she’s launching a women’s health institute and writing a novel—imagining different worlds while working to improve our own. But at the very least, “I’m no longer trying to do it all at once,” she says. That simply wouldn’t be sustainable.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year (Amber O’Hearn, Michael Harms and Jason McGee). Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in December. </p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">ZCG Elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining why they believe they should be elected to the ZCG Committee. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly by replying to their individual posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Monday 4th December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>In mid-December the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select three candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2024.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The three candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2024. </p>



<p>Prospective candidates should beaware of the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications, in accordance with the strictures and guidelines set forth in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a>. Currently, formal Committee meetings are held every two weeks, and the Committee meets informally for brainstorming sessions on a weekly basis. </p>



<p>From January, Committee members will receive a nominal stipend of $650 per calendar month from ZF (paid as shielded ZEC). This stipend may be subject to review, given the budgetary constraints that ZF currently faces.</p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Zcash Foundation is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement, and is obligated to have an appropriate policy and processes in place to ensure that actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed appropriately, in order to avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial authority.. </p>



<p>Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members are required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following policies also apply in relation to ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p></p>



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to this topic on the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

 The Horizen DAO increases community involvement in decision-making for improvements to the protocol and ecosystem. 



<p>The Horizen community is excited to announce the Horizen DAO is now open for all $ZEN holders to participate in governance and take an active role in the direction of the project!</p>



<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. A strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is informed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on the <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/guiding_values">Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 How to Participate in Voting 



<p>Voting for the Horizen DAO is done on Horizen EON, an EVM-compatible sidechain on Horizen. The Horizen DAO uses <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a> and <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a> for governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain including the $ZEN you have staked with the Horizen EON validators. Therefore, the more $ZEN you hold,&nbsp; the more voting power you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.jpg"></a> 


<p></p>



<p>The voting period for any given proposal will have a specified start and end date and will last 72 hours. For more information about the process of voting, please start <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Introducing the Horizen DAO Special Council 



<p>What is the Horizen DAO Special Council?</p>

<p>This post describes work done by Principal Engineer Anthony Tseng and Staff Engineer Anirudha Bose. We also thank Anxo Rodriguez from the CoW Swap team for his code-review on our work done for CoW Swap.</p>
<p>Written by Anirudha Bose.</p>

 Summary 
<p>With our recent Brave browser release version 1.60, we are excited to introduce two powerful features for the Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) gets a major overhaul, with first-class support for parsing ERC-4361 messages, and a brand new UX. We also extend our redesigned signing experience for Brave Swap to CoW Swap orders. Both these features enhance the security and UX of signing messages in Brave Wallet.</p>

 Sign-In With Ethereum 

 What is Sign-In With Ethereum? 
<p>Sign-In With Ethereum (or SIWE for short) replaces traditional login credentials with wallet-based sign-in functionality. Imagine a world where your wallet can help you login stamped with the indelible ink of an Ethereum wallet address of your choosing. This functionality shifts the role of authentication away from large centralized identity providers, into the hands of the individual.</p>
<p>The Sign-In With Ethereum protocol defines a method by which Ethereum accounts can sign in to external services by signing a standard message format as defined in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361">ERC-4361</a>.&nbsp; Thanks to this standard, you get the power of self-custodial identity while remaining portable across wallet implementations.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Next-level SIWE 
<p>Brave Wallet always had basic support for SIWE. Since SIWE uses <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191">ERC-191</a> (Signed Data Standard), we’ve been able to display SIWE prompts as human-readable plaintext messages, but without any validation by the wallet.</p>
<p>In this latest update, we’re introducing a significant improvement to Sign-In With Ethereum support with our implementation of an <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/19443">ABNF parser</a> for ERC-4361 conformant messages. This allows us to not only interpret SIWE messages and present them with a better look and feel, but also to improve the safety of signing into third-party apps and services. However, since there may still be cases where the SIWE message does not conform with these specifications, we fallback to legacy ERC-191 signing for maximum interoperability.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Safety features 
<p>Once a SIWE message is successfully parsed, we verify the message for binding of domain, account, and chain ID fields, and display an appropriate error message if there’s a mismatch. This measure is designed to prevent phishing attacks, where a malicious actor may obtain a valid authorization to a legitimate third-party service. This is particularly important for SIWE, since the sign-in action is basically producing a signature for a message, which is susceptible to spoofing by a motivated attacker.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 CoW Swap 

 What is CoW Swap? 
<p>Coincidence of Wants (CoW) is a concept from the field of economics, particularly related to the barter system. It describes a situation where two parties each hold an item the other wants, so they agree to trade these items directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://swap.cow.fi">CoW Swap</a> leverages this idea for trading on-chain assets. It is an interface built on top of the CoW Protocol—a fully permissionless trading protocol that leverages batch auctions as its price finding mechanism. CoW Protocol enables batch auctions to maximize liquidity via CoWs in addition to tapping all available on-chain liquidity whenever needed. Users express off-chain intents as signed <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712">EIP-712</a> typed messages through the CoW Swap interface. The CoW Protocol gathers these intents into a batch auction, to be settled by solvers that compete to find the most optimal CoW. The winning solver then executes all intents in a single on-chain transaction, maximizing trade surplus and saving on network fees.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>A CoW settlement transaction</p>

 The dangers of off-chain messages 
<p>Signing off-chain messages, such as CoW orders, is unfortunately not the most friendly UX on any wallet. While off-chain messages significantly improve usability by providing a reliable way to exchange data through a gasless experience, such messages are largely opaque and unreadable to users. This is very similar to blind-signing of transaction calldata (which we have discussed in depth in a <a>previous blog post</a>). Because signing off-chain messages does not incur a gas fee, users are very likely to blindly approve a signing request without verifying the details. A maliciously crafted message is more than capable of draining assets from users’ wallets, without raising any suspicion because of its verbosity.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1604074440941506560">December 2022</a>, a scammer stole 14 <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">BAYCs</a> worth over 852 ETH ($1.07 million USD) at the time, through a sophisticated, month-long social engineering scam. The victim was tricked into signing a gasless <a href="https://docs.opensea.io/reference/seaport-overview">Seaport</a> message, which actually created a private bundle listing all of his BAYCs to the scammer for 0.00000001 ETH. Such attacks are becoming increasingly common due to the massive adoption of off-chain messages in NFT marketplaces, DEXs, etc.</p>

 EIP-712 to the rescue 
<p>EIP-712 proposed a standard for signing typed structured data as opposed to bytestrings. While typed messages are easier for machines to read, they are still not user-friendly enough for most people. For users to be able to confidently approve signing requests for CoW orders, they need to clearly see all the order details such as formatted amounts, token symbols, logos, etc.</p>
<p>We conceived the idea to solve this problem at <a href="https://www.dappcon.io">DappCon 2023</a> in Berlin where we met CoW Swap’s engineering team. After brainstorming together, we came up with the <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/20203">solution</a> to implement a message parser for CoW orders, to be able to extract the relevant parameters, and render them in a familiar way that’s easy to understand. The parser is tied to the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#rationale-for-typehash">type hash</a> of the specific order struct used by CoW Swap, to prevent the parser from being used on non-CoW messages. We’ve also implemented calldata parsers for cases where the swap involves an on-chain transaction like, for example, when the user is swapping a native asset (such as ETH, or XDAI). Here’s what the final result looks like:</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Conclusion 
<p>In the 1.60 release of the Brave browser, we have completely revamped the experience of Sign-In With Ethereum using Brave Wallet. We’ve added safety features and UX improvements that make the SIWE experience comparable to signing in on websites with traditional login credentials. You can try it out at <a href="https://login.xyz">https://login.xyz</a>, which also has developer documentation for supporting SIWE on your websites.</p>
<p>We have extended similar improvements to the signing of CoW Swap orders, turning the unreadable off-chain messages into something that users can easily audit. You can try it out at <a href="https://swap.cow.fi">https://swap.cow.fi</a> on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.</p>
<p>We intend to bring similar improvements to the signing experience in Brave Wallet, in order to protect users from inadvertently signing malicious messages and transactions. Stay tuned for major updates on these improvements coming soon to Brave Wallet.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.4.0.</p>



<p>This release includes support for mining RPC methods in all release builds, bundles the Zcash verification parameters into the zebrad binary, and updates Rust dependencies to match the zcashd 5.7.0 release.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some notable improvements from our previous release include <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7772">better recovery from brief network interruptions</a>, and mitigation of potential network and verification denial of service and performance issues. We have restored our macOS tests in CI, and now support macOS on a best-effort basis.</p>



<p>We have also changed our documentation website URL, and are considering deprecating some Docker image tags from release 1.5.0 onwards.</p>



 Mining RPCs in Production Builds 



<p>Since the 1.4.0 release, Zebra’s mining RPCs are <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7740">available in release builds</a> so that any Zebra instance can be used by a solo miner or mining pool. With this release, we are providing production level support to 12 mining related RPCs, including getblocktemplate,&nbsp; submitblock, getmininginfo, getnetworksolps, [z_]validateaddress and getblocksubsidy. Do <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">let us know</a> if your mining pool requires any extra RPC methods or fields!</p>



 Zcash Parameters in zebrad Binary 



<p>zebrad now bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly into its binary. This increases the binary size by a few megabytes, but reduces the size of the Docker image by around 600 MB because the parameters don’t contain the Sprout proving key anymore. We have also removed the “zebrad download” command as it is no longer necessary. If you have upgraded zebrad to 1.4.0 or later, and zcashd to 5.7.0 or later, you can delete the zk-SNARK parameter files to save approximately 700 MB disk space. For more details, please check out our <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.4.0">release notes</a>.</p>



 macOS Support 



<p>We have restored support for macOS x86_64 on a best-effort basis. macOS builds and some tests run in Zebra’s CI. You can check out the list of Zebra <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/supported-platforms.html">supported platforms</a> for more details on the different tiers of support we provide for the listed platforms.&nbsp;</p>



 Deprecation Warnings 



<p>In an effort to remove redundancies and simplify things, we would like to share the following deprecation warnings.</p>



 DockerHub Image Tags 



<p>Zebra currently publishes 11 DockerHub tags for each new release. We want to reduce the number of DockerHub tags we publish in a future minor Zebra release. Based on usage and user feedback, in release 1.5.0 we could stop publishing:</p>



 
 The 1 tag, which updates each release until NU6 



 The 1.x tag, which updates each patch release until the next minor release 



 The 1.x.y tag, which is the same as v1.x.y 



 The sha-xxxxxxx tag, which is the same as v1.x.y (for production releases) 
 



<p>We also want to standardise experimental image tags to -experimental, rather than .experimental.</p>



<p>This means that, for release 1.5.0 onwards, we are considering only publishing the following tags:</p>



 
 latest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 latest-experimental (a new tag) 



 V1.5.0 



 v1.5.0-experimental 
 



<p>Please let us know if you need any other tags by <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">opening a GitHub ticket</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend using the “latest” tag to always get the most recent Zebra release.</p>



 Documentation Website URL Change 



<p>We have replaced the API documentation which was previously available on the doc.zebra.zfnd.org website with <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>. Zebra’s API documentation can now be found on:<br></p>



 
 <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>, which renders documentation for the public API of the latest crate releases; 



 <a href="https://doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org/zebrad/">doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org</a>, which renders documentation for the internal API on the main branch. 
 



<p>This API documentation is in addition to the <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/">Zebra Book</a> user documentation, which is still available as usual.</p>

<p>Bootstrap Org, the nonprofit parent organization of Electric Coin Co., has added long-time Zcash community contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/michlai007">Michelle Lai</a> to its Board of Directors. Michelle joins members Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Zaki Manian, and Zooko Wilcox.</p>



<p>“Michelle has worked hard to support Zcash and the cause of financial freedom for years,” Fairless said. “We love her insight and imagination on tech product use cases.”</p>



<p>A graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (2007), Michelle has spent half her career in crypto and half in financial services, including stints at Anchorage Digital, Bitpay, Credit Suisse, a private equity buyout fund, and as a consultant to CEOs of large financial services companies. She’s performed a wide range of roles, including COO, BD and product roles, and says she most enjoys solving tricky business problems and managing high-stakes negotiations.</p>



<p>She is passionate about crypto-related technology as “a means of achieving a fairer and freer world.”</p>



<p>In Michelle’s words:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My journey with Zcash started in 2018 when I worked at a crypto asset custodian and we were looking to support $ZEC. Since then, I’ve fallen further down the privacy money rabbit hole, becoming a member of the first grant organization in 2021 (the Zcash Open Major Grants committee) and then staying involved as someone who actively advocates for privacy and freedom applications in crypto.</p>



<p>My vision of tomorrow’s Zcash is one that earns its place back as a leader of privacy tech in crypto so that we can keep supporting the universal values of privacy and freedom. We did it once with the best talent in ZK and engineering, and we can do it again.</p>



<p>Today, as the crypto privacy community faces several challenges, including market sentiment and regulatory onslaught, I join the Bootstrap team to navigate the turbulent waters we find ourselves in. I have had professional experience in turnaround situations and hope to bring that to bear in this new role on the board of Bootstrap.</p>



<p>The road ahead is strewn with both extremely difficult questions and compelling opportunities for all ZK and privacy projects, including us. It will take a grand effort for us to arrive at a new horizon, but this is the moment where we dig in, gear up, and keep marching on in service of humanity.</p>



<p>If you have ideas and opinions from anywhere in the crypto community, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.</p>

<p>The very nature of Ethereum addresses, expressed as random hexadecimal character strings, represents a big hurdle for mass adoption, as they are not human-readable. ENS domains were envisioned to not only solve this and provide a seamless UX, but to also be the cornerstone of on-chain identities. However, in the current multichain landscape, a plethora of decentralised naming services arose, which led to a heterogeneous domain name pool. As a result, ENS aims to expand to L2s and non-EVM chains, attempting to provide consistency, in order to further reduce user friction and limit conflicting domain names.</p><p>We were joined by Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, to discuss the current state of decentralised naming services from a multichain and L2 perspective, and how these ultimately tie into decentralised identities.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Nick’s background and ENS history  The plethora of decentralised naming services  ENS use cases  Interacting with Web2 DNS  L2 compatibility for ENS via CCIP Read  ENS wrapper and subdomains  CCIP Read  Bridging ENS to non-EVM L2s  Coinbase’s cb.id  ENS and on-chain privacy OPSEC  Account abstraction  The future of ENS  Governance   <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick Johnson on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ensdomains">ENS on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture.

<p>A busy month just went by! Here’s everything we did and what’s on the horizon for Panther.</p><p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>October has been a productive month for us, and we’re excited to share our progress in many areas as we work towards Panther v1. <br>Without further ado, let’s dive in.</p> Tech Updates  Stage 2 <p>The latest development sprints were focused on solving a bug related to an external library used for Stage 2, an external factor that has caused a delay. <br><br>Our Incentivized <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Testnet Stage 2 </a>is now officially underway, bringing a wave of features and rewards to the Panther community. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Stage 2</a> is critical as it puts our user interaction and reward mechanisms to the test, laying the groundwork for Panther Protocol’s privacy-preserving features. Our protocol’s privacy is intricately tied to unique game-theoretical features that encourage active user participation, making this stage a pivotal moment for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Stage 2 includes creating and activating your Panther Account, finding your onboarding bonuses, and claiming your vouchers. <br>Your participation and feedback are crucial as we move closer to our v1 release. Thank you for being a part of Testnet Stage 2, and don't hesitate to share your thoughts through our community channels!</p> V1 redesign <p>Over the past weeks, we have done some UX refinements too. The focus was reviewing what we have learned from the previous design iterations and expanding on it further while also elevating the user experience. Another objective was to revamp and update the onboarding process for more seamless account setup.</p><p>You can take a look at a quick preview below:</p> Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi Protocol <p>Just in case you missed our last update, on October 2nd we hosted <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1zqKVqmnqaaxB?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a great conversation via Twitter Spaces</a> with our partners at PureFi.

<p>Now and through the end of January 2024, Electric Coin Co. (ECC) objectives center on delivering an improved ZEC user experience, primarily through the Zashi wallet. Across teams — Product; Engineering; PeopleOps; and Communications and Advocacy — ECC employees are focused on work that either directly contributes to the wallet or in some way makes ZEC and Zashi adoption more viable.</p>



<p>Background: ECC uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR process</a> for prioritizing and delivering measurable work on four-month cycles. In October, teams met and finalized planning for T3 2023-24 (October-January).</p>



<p>Priorities were developed to accomplish or make meaningful progress on the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Release the next version of the Zashi app including a new UX and UI 



 Transition more responsibilities to the wider Zcash community so ECC can focus on building Zashi, starting with the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/decentralizing-zcash-digital/45349">Decentralizing Zcash Digital</a> effort.&nbsp; 



 Take meaningful steps in the effort to transition Zcash from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), Zashi’s eventual consensus mechanism, by publishing a design with security arguments, and a protocol simulator. 



 Maintain policy efforts to ensure Zashi and Zcash are (1) accessible and usable by people in the United States and (2) considered socially beneficial. Continue hosting notable policy events and publishing episodes of the PGP for Crypto Podcast. 



 Support select ecosystem teams and projects that directly benefit Zashi users
 
 Support Brave’s integration of Zcash and encrypted media/files. 



 Support Edge, Unstoppable, and Nighthawk’s use of the ECC mobile wallet SDKs. 



 Build and/or improve Zashi features (e.g., implementing ZIP-317 and Orchard). 
 
 
 



<p>Each ECC team has built their OKRs to support these company objectives.</p>

 Intro <p>Panther community,</p><p>As we conclude Testnet Stage 1 with a number of learnings and upgrades, we are thrilled to announce the commencement of Stage 2 of our Testnet.</p><p>This second phase is designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. As Panther’s privacy is built upon unique game-theoretical features fostering user activity, Stage 2 is key for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at Stage 2. It comprises three main categories of reward mechanisms: Rewards, Recharge pool, and Vouchers.</p> 1. Rewards <p>Rewards or protocol reward points (PRPs) are created as an incentive for users to join and continuously use Panther Protocol. This implies converting the ‘Available PRP’ to ZKP which is accomplished via a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps/single-side-automated-market-maker?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">single-sided AMM</a> (automated market maker) pool. It is one-sided because users can only convert their PRP to ZKP and not vice versa. The exchange rate of this conversion is dynamic in nature and depends on several factors, including the amount of ZKP in the pool and the total available PRP held by users at any given point in time, among other factors. For details on how Panther Rewards works, please see <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p><p>There are two types of PRPs:</p>  Available PRPs which can be exchanged to zZKP (ZKP within the MASP) immediately.  Pending PRP is the accrued rewards that are not realized yet because a user has not spent those UTXOs. To make it available, the UTXO's should be included in transactions that a user performs within Panther.<br>   2. Recharge Pool  <p>The Recharge function is the cornerstone of the protocol’s reward system and allows protocol rewards vested on Mainnet to be injected into the reward distribution process on Polygon (viz the one-sided AMM launched in Stage 2). This dynamic interplay with the AMM pool through the Recharge function fosters active user participation while maintaining a responsive and adaptive reward structure within the protocol. </p> 3. Vouchers <p>Vouchers are a reward mechanism that can be used by the Protocol to incentivize certain functions that have to be triggered by Users. We refer to them as Admin functions. Those could include but are not limited to functions such as:</p>  Recharging Reward Pool  Trigger conversion of token&nbsp;  <p>Note: the onboarding reward voucher issued atThe voucher this Stage is only for testing purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When a new account is created and activated successfully, a user gets (a) 100 zZKP onto his zAccount and (b) 1 voucher which is worth 500 PRP. This is valid for all new users and the users who have created accounts during Stage 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: it can take up to a minute to get the voucher screen updated to let a user find his onboarding voucher.</p><p>The voucher has a stable predefined value which can be different depending on the type of performed action (onboarding = PRP 500, triggering recharge the reward pool = PRP 100). The voucher is nominated in PRP.&nbsp; To get those PRP, one should claim a voucher - it is about submitting a transaction “burn a voucher - get the corresponding PRP”.&nbsp;</p><p>Vouchers are grouped per type of action performed. Stage 2 will have two such groups - (1) Onboarding bonus voucher and (2) Recharge bonus voucher. Vouchers can be claimed by group only, which means a user gets the total PRP for all vouchers in a given group. When claiming is completed successfully, a user will see an updated balance on his (a) Dashboard → Panther Rewards Points section → Available PRP amount and (b) Rewards page → Redeem PRP screen → Available PRP section. &nbsp;</p> STAGE 2 TESTING <p>As we progress through our Testnet stages, we want to express our gratitude for your continued support, feedback, and enthusiasm. To start testing Stage 2, please visit Panther docs <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> to get the most updated test link and follow the steps:</p>  New user creates and activates Panther Account (existing users go through the same step but the onboarding process bypasses the KYC verification) - see <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">the Stage 1 functionality and instructions</a>.&nbsp;  <p>Note 1.1: both (a) new accounts and (b) previously created during Stage 1 Panther accounts both are valid.&nbsp;</p><p>When your account is successfully created, you will find a success screen:</p>  Find the first part of your onboarding bonus on your dashboard. This bonus is in the form of Panther Account zZKP which is expected to fuel all types of transactions within Panther such as paying Protocol fees, paying to Relayer for gasless transactions, paying Miner’s fee etc. Users are expected to maintain a sufficient balance of this account in zZKP using transfer functions available in later stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Find the second part of your onboarding bonus - an onboarding voucher,, which equals 500 PRPs. The voucher should be claimed to get the PRPs into your account. To find the second part, please follow the Rewards menu item =&gt; Vouchers screen =&gt; Onboarding Reward Vouchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Note 3.1: It takes time to detect and reflect the corresponding group of vouchers so there can be a case when the screen is empty before the data is updated:</p><p>Note 3.2: It takes time to make your voucher available for claiming, as the zAccount UTXO must be mined in advance. The UI will reflect your bonus voucher. Please be aware that claiming the voucher may take a few minutes in the test environment (due to lower mining activity which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The claim button is disabled until claiming is available.&nbsp;</p>  Claim your voucher via the Vouchers screen functionality. After Voucher is claimed successfully (Voucher screen will go back to the state mentioned in Note 3.1 upon a successfully claimed transaction), you can find the corresponding amount of PRP on the Redeem PRP screen, Available PRP field&nbsp;  <p>Note 4.1: Sometimes, it may take a few minutes to display the PRP available for redeeming (due to lower mining activity in the test environment, which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The button is disabled until Redeem is successful.&nbsp;</p>  Redeem your PRP from the Redeem PRP screen to get your zZKP. This zZKP will now be available in your Private zAssets section and zAssets Summary section balance in the Dashboard screen.  <p>6. Recharge the reward pool of PRP/zZKP AMM:</p><p>Step 1: Go to the Rewards page and click on recharge pool.</p><p>Step 2: Switch to the Goerli network. The recharge triggers the Vesting contract on the Goerli testnet (Ethereum on production). This requires users to switch networks if they are not on Goerli. This can be done using either in-dApp functionality (Switch Network option) or via Network Management modal (when you are already connected to the product), or via MetaMask functionality. </p><p>Step 3: Check available $ZKP for recharge. Checking that there is enough $ZKP for recharge helps make the decision to trigger the function. The Recharge button will be active only when the ‘Recharge size’ field is non-zero, however, it is not recommended to trigger this function for a smaller recharge amount. </p><p>Also, a zero or a low ‘Recharge size’ means that the recharge was done by other users.&nbsp;</p><p>Step 4: Check and top-up your Goerli ETH balance - this is required to pay for gas to trigger this functionality. To get a test Goerli ETH use the faucet e.g. <a href="https://beyondfaucet.com/goerli/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://beyondfaucet.com/goerli/</a>.<br></p><p>Step 5: Complete the recharge-triggering transaction on the Goerli side by pushing the Recharge Reward Pool button.</p><p>Note 6.1: The recharge executes through bridging functionality which moves $tZKP from Goerli (Ethereum) to Mumbai (Polygon). This operation is dependent on the bridge and may take up to 20 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Step 6: Check the updated current recharge ratio field. Recharging the pool means injecting more rewards into the Reward AMM, hence, it impacts the ZKP:PRP ratio. The new ratio can be viewed here: </p><p>Note 6.2: Smaller recharge size value will make an insignificant impact on the rate. Testnet allows for multiple recharge to test functionality and bridging. However, it is advised to propose a maximum of once per day recharge in production which will also have a positive impact on the rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Step 7: Check the Vouchers screen. The protocol rewards users for performing the recharge function. Switch to the Mumbai network to view and claim your Recharge Reward Voucher.</p><p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks not just an advancement in the protocol's capabilities, but gets us a step closer to our v1 release.

  Partnering with Factory: Autonomous AI for All  <p>Matan and Eno are building fully-autonomous programming “Droids” to unlock creativity within and beyond engineering teams.</p>   
	By Shaun Maguire	 



Published November 2, 2023
  



 
<p>Like any VC partner, I get a lot of cold emails. But when Matan Grinberg’s note appeared in my inbox in March, it got my attention right away. Just from the subject line—”Chat with a fellow former hep-th physicist”—I knew we shared a background in the same tiny sub-field of high-energy physics theory. And as I read on and Googled a bit, I discovered that what he humbly described as having “worked with Juan” actually referred to co-authoring a paper with Juan Maldacena—a professor at the elite Institute for Advanced Study and arguably the world’s best-known living physicist—when Matan was still an undergrad.</p>



<p>I wrote back in less than an hour.</p>



<p>A few days later, Matan and I went for a walk. He’d been working at the intersection of physics and AI at Berkeley and pursuing a PhD, but was considering a transition from academia to a start-up—and though he hadn’t yet settled on a specific idea, it was clear that he wanted to build a company. It was also clear that he had a high EQ to match his exceptional background. I encouraged him to take the leap.</p>



<p>He started iterating, and within a week was working on the autonomous coding project&nbsp; that would become <a href="https://www.factory.ai/">Factory</a>—and working with a co-founder who, as it turned out, was in Sequoia’s orbit as well.</p>



<p>Eno Reyes, who grew up in Atlanta and first met Matan at Princeton, had recently accepted a job as an ML engineer at Hugging Face and moved to San Francisco’s Mission District—just a block from where his grandparents had settled down and set up a restaurant after immigrating from Puebla, Mexico. Shortly before he and Matan reunited at a hackathon and started building Factory, the Sequoia team met Eno at AI Ascent, a small gathering of the leading minds in AI that we held in March. Just a year out of college and a few months into his new role, he had already impressed enough to join CEO Clem Delangue at the event.</p>



<p>Matan and Eno’s idea was to build on the historic momentum in AI and unlock even more creativity in software development—and not just among engineers. In the face of a persistent tech talent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/cracking-the-code-on-digital-talent">shortage</a>, with many Fortune 500 companies still running infrastructure built decades ago simply because they don’t have enough people to update it, these two co-founders understood that handing off time-consuming tasks like code review, documentation, testing, project management and debugging to fully autonomous “Droids,” or agents, would indeed be a game-changer for engineering teams. But they also understood that for every software developer, there are another 100 people who don’t have highly technical backgrounds—but do have great ideas that software could bring to life.</p>



<p>It is a next-generation vision for AI, and just a year ago, it would have been too ambitious. But Matan and Eno’s timing is perfect—and they are perfectly suited to the task, not only because of their deep domain expertise in ML, AI and physics, but also because they move at lightning speed. Once they’d landed on an idea, it took them a day to sign a term sheet, incorporate the company and start to build.</p>



<p>Six months later, Factory is delivering value to early customers that include two public companies and two decacorns. Meanwhile, Matan and Eno have more complex functionality on the roadmap, and they are <a href="https://www.factory.ai/careers">growing</a> an amazing team to build it. It has been a joy to welcome them to the Sequoia community, and we look forward to supporting them over the months and years to come as they work toward a world where programming capacity no longer limits our collective creativity.</p>

<p>Brave is also introducing Leo Premium, a paid plan featuring Anthropic’s Claude Instant with faster response times</p>
<p>Three months ago, Brave previewed <a>Leo—the browser-native AI assistant</a>—on its Nightly channel for developers and testers. Since then we’ve seen great adoption, with tens of thousands of users globally. With user feedback, we’ve been able to improve much faster than we’d hoped—on response-times, the quality of responses, even the product UI. Today, we’re excited to announce that Brave Leo is ready for all Brave users, available in desktop release 1.60.</p>
<p>With that testing, we also received requests for new features. The most common one has been to add different AI language models in Leo. To that end, we’re bringing our users advanced conversational AI experiences through <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">Brave Leo Premium</a>—our new paid option featuring Claude Instant, Anthropic’s state-of-the-art AI assistant.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 What is Brave Leo? 
<p>Leo, Brave’s browser AI assistant, can help with all sorts of tasks. It can create real-time summaries of webpages or videos. It can answer questions about content, or generate new content. It can even translate pages, analyze them, rewrite them, and more. Whether you’re looking for information, trying to solve a problem, or creating content, Leo can help.</p>
<p>Leo combines this easy, free access to AI with the privacy focus of Brave. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. With cutting-edge technology and privacy, Brave Leo pushes the boundaries of typical AI chatbot services.</p>
<p>“It is increasingly common today to use AI to ask questions and get assistance. AI can be a powerful tool but it can also present growing concerns for data privacy and there’s a need for a privacy-first solution,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave. “Brave is committed to pairing AI with user privacy, and will provide our users with secure and personalized AI assistance where they already spend their time online. We’re also thrilled to work with Anthropic to bring Claude’s exceptional conversational abilities to the millions of Brave users worldwide.”</p>

 Introducing Leo Premium 
<p>By default, Brave Leo is free for all users, with easy access to the Llama 2 large language model from Meta. For users who want additional models, Brave is also releasing a premium version of Leo for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$15/month</a>. Leo Premium subscribers will get access to Claude Instant, Anthropic’s faster and lighter model that excels at logical reasoning and coding. The current version of Claude produces longer, more structured responses, follows instructions better than previous versions of Instant, and shows improvements in math, coding, multilingual abilities, and question answering. Additional models will be available to Leo Premium users, as well as access to higher rate limits, higher-quality conversations, priority queuing during periods of peak usage, and early access to new features and improvements.</p>
<p>This integration represents a milestone in delivering sophisticated natural language conversations powered by AI directly within the browser environment. With Claude’s advanced capabilities and Brave’s focus on user privacy and control, we hope to set a new standard for helpful, responsible, and context sensitive AI interactions. Anthropic used <a>Brave’s Search API</a> to train their latest model, Claude 2, on high-quality data to help optimize Claude’s outputs for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) queries.</p>
<p>“We’re excited that Brave is going to bring our state-of-the-art large language model Claude Instant directly into their browser. Integrating access to Claude seamlessly within Brave gives users assistance whenever they need it, right in the context of the page they are on,” says Matt Bell, Head of Product Research at Anthropic. “Whether Brave users are analyzing text, editing documents, or writing code, they can now benefit from having personalized help from Claude at any time. This integration unlocks the potential for AI to enhance people’s browsing and productivity in an intuitive, contextual way.”</p>

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo is no different:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymized server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Immediate discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 Accessing Brave Leo 
<p>Leo is now available to Brave desktop users with version 1.60. It will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today. It will be available on mobile (Android and iOS) in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more at <a>brave.com/leo</a>, and see details about Leo’s roadmap <a>here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get started with Brave Leo because it is built right into the Brave desktop browser, and no extra apps or extensions are required. It provides seamless access to AI experiences via the browser address bar, or also as a sidebar, a chat-like interface positioned beside any webpage.</p>
<p>To access Leo, existing Brave users can simply ask a question in the address bar and click  “Ask Leo”, or click  in Brave Sidebar.</p>

<p>A journey that began in the late summer of 2022, has finally come to a joyful end. Third-party Zcash wallets are working again, and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) is exiting Emergency Mode.</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



<p>Before going further, we need to give the hugest THANK YOU to our wallet partners Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



<p>The ECC engineers deserve special recognition —&nbsp;and possibly a vacation — after putting in long hours over many months on complicated discovery and development. Working through the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">ECC restructure</a> and battling tough deadlines, while tackling other crucial emergencies like the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">Halborn disclosure</a>, they delivered groundbreaking technology that elevates ZEC user experience.</p>



 Background 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. These three wallets rely on ECC’s mobile SDKs.</p>



<p>Wallet syncing processes required scanning the entire blockchain before funds were available to be spent. And when the wallets wouldn’t sync, users couldn’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2022, ECC went into Emergency Mode and put aside all other roadmap priorities. From our blog in March 2023:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>
</blockquote>



 Emergency Mode exit criteria 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, and these were our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>With the release of new mobile wallet SDKs 2.0 in September, ECC delivered the final piece in our efforts to mitigate third-party wallet performance issues. Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable quickly implemented the SDKs, and as of today, we are pleased to report that the criteria above have been met.</p>



 What is Spend Before Sync and why is it important? 



<p>Available now in Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable, Spend Before Sync (SBS) introduces non-linear sync, which allows wallets to scan chunks of the blockchain out of order and/or in parallel. This makes it possible for users to spend their existing funds without requiring the wallet to fully sync the entire blockchain.</p>



<p>Separately, but also important, the data structures that enable SBS substantially improve the performance of note commitment tree updates. As an example, Zingo! didn’t adopt SBS, but just by using the updated data structure that wallet got a better than 10x improvement in linear scanning speed.</p>



<p>Aditya Bharadwaj, better known as Adi, founder of Nighthawk, called SBS “a groundbreaking advancement that promises to revolutionize Zcash’s peer-to-peer usage for payments and shielded app interactions.”</p>



 What we learned during Emergency Mode 



 
 Our mobile SDK code did not meet the needs of a typical Zcash user. The syncing UX was confusing and the API design precluded wallets from spending funds until the wallet had fully synced the chain. 



 Before Emergency Mode, and to some extent before the ECC restructure, our team was spread too thin and trying to focus on too many things, which allowed issues like transaction load impact to surface. 



 We knew long ago that a transaction-load issue was possible, but we prioritized other Zcash features and improvements. This challenge of prioritizing new feature improvements versus making the existing system more resilient or robust is always present. In this case we underestimated the likelihood of this problem and the amount of effort it would take to mitigate it. 



 We chose to address the issue in the most thorough manner by making wallets function during high transaction load, rather than the expedient of short-term interventions to lessen the transaction load. We believed those short-term interventions would lead to more complexity without fully resolving the issue in the long run. We still believe our approach was best for the long-term robustness of the Zcash ecosystem, yet we underestimated the time and effort and the overall disruption to Zcash users in the interim. 



 We also learned about comms. It took us too long to define Emergency Mode and communicate a concise explanation and plan, both internally and externally. 



 Having our own wallet in development (Zashi), which uses our SDKs, was key to speeding up the process because it allowed us to test our solutions before deploying and/or sharing with third-party wallets. 
 



<p>With Emergency Mode complete, ECC is turning its attention to our main focus areas: proof-of-stake Zcash, development of the Zashi wallet, continued improvements to SDKs and Zcash Core Libraries, and US Policy work.</p>

      Battling the Trojan Horse in Open Source         
	By Ananya Menon	 



Published November 1, 2023
        Chainguard’s Dan Lorenc is taking on software supply chain security.      



 
<p>Dan Lorenc was at a restaurant in downtown Austin with friends when he received an unusual text. It was the summer of 2021, and the message was from his former coworker, Matt Moore. Lorenc was a software engineer at Google, and he and Moore had worked together on its cyber-security team. The past year had been especially challenging, as the security industry as a whole had faced a reckoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2020, SolarWinds reported that its network monitoring platform had been hacked by operatives suspected of working for Russian intelligence. The attackers had planted malware in SolarWinds’ code, which allowed them to access the data of thousands of SolarWinds’ clients, from Microsoft to the U.S. government. The hack exposed a critical flaw in the security of software supply chains. Just as in real-world manufacturing, software is assembled from components created by developers all over the world. At some point during SolarWinds’ development process, malicious actors inserted malware into two software updates, which were then installed by customers all around the world. SolarWinds’ data breach was a wake-up call. Without verifying the integrity of software at every stage of its lifespan this type of hack could and would happen again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore had left Google earlier in the year, and Lorenc had called him every month since, hoping to convince him to return. Moore was one of the finest software engineers Lorenc knew, and if anyone could find a solution to supply chain security, it was him. That night, Moore’s text to Lorenc said he was ready to get back to work—but not at Google. “Let’s start a new company,” Moore texted. Lorenc didn’t need to think twice. He was in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next day, Lorenc put in notice at Google, bought a new laptop and began work on Chainguard, a company focused on software supply chain security. Although technically the company was born that night in Austin, Lorenc had been preparing for this moment for years.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>The late 2000s ushered in a fundamental shift in the way tech companies approached security, as alarm around new types of digital threats grew. In what became known as Operation Aurora in 2009, Chinese hackers attempted to access and change source code in a series of attacks against companies like Google and Adobe. In the Snowden leaks in 2013, a contracted employee for the NSA hacked its database and leaked classified documents.</p>



<p>Lorenc joined Google in 2012, working on the company’s efforts to secure its own code and protect its databases from external or internal attackers. In 2016, after he and his team had implemented Google’s new, refined security system, Lorenc shifted focus to work on Minikube, a tool for open-source Kubernetes container management. This was Lorenc’s first time working predominantly with open-source code—code that’s freely available for anyone to download, modify and exchange. As Lorenc was building and shipping Minikube to users all over the world, he realized he could have easily slipped malware into the software. The container’s label would read “Minikube,” but few would take time to comb through the thousands of lines of code in every directory of the program to determine exactly what was inside. Proper verification was something that would take an engineer days, weeks or even months to complete—bandwidth they almost certainly didn’t have, and therefore a task that would fall by the wayside.</p>



<p>Lorenc was terrified. Wasn’t it just a matter of time before someone packaged up open-source software that secretly contained code that could put an entire company and its community at risk? “I realized how much damage I myself could do, and how easily,” Lorenc says. “And if I could do that, so could anyone.”</p>



<p>The concern over how to protect software from hidden malware isn’t a new one. In 1984, an engineer named Ken Thompson wrote an article called “Reflections on Trusting Trust” that demonstrated how easy it was to hide Trojan horse viruses in a computer program. Thompson’s point was that you could never fully trust any code you hadn’t written yourself. According to Lorenc, 90-98% of code used today is open source. Most companies focus resources on making sure the tiny amount of code they write themselves is secure, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. “The 2% of proprietary code is the only part you see over the water, but beneath that is the 98% of code you’re not responsible for yourself,” Lorenc says. “In some ways, open-source code is amazing. It’s enabled all this innovation and velocity and reuse. But it’s also scary because that means 98% of your code is written by strangers on the internet. Which is great when people are well-intentioned, but not everyone on the internet is nice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite evidence of the risks open-source code can pose to a company’s security, Lorenc learned that managing these risks wasn’t something widely prioritized. When he spoke with engineers at other software companies, supply chain security wasn’t a top concern. “Being a software engineer is like playing Whac-A-Mole. There are so many issues you have to deal with on a constant basis that you can’t spend time on preventive measures,” Lorenc says. “You only pay attention to a problem when it rears its head. At this point, there hadn’t been large instances of open-source vulnerability being a problem, so no one seemed to think much about it.”</p>



<p>No one but Lorenc. That is, until December 2020.</p>
 



Lorenc with fierce Chainguard mascot, Charlie



 
<p>Lorenc was at home when he received a news alert about the SolarWinds attack. Thousands of companies were reporting their data, networks and systems compromised—exactly what Lorenc had been worried about. He stood and walked to his car. Lorenc’s house in Austin was close to SolarWinds’ headquarters. He drove there and took a picture of himself in front of its sign. It would serve as a reminder of how important it was that he continue to raise a red flag about the software supply chain. But it was also a moment of validation—he had seen this coming, and he felt vindicated that his concern was justified. Maybe now people would take the problem seriously.</p>



<p>Although Google was not affected by the breach, Lorenc and his coworkers were intimately familiar with the type of attack that SolarWinds fell victim to because they had spent years building internal systems at Google to prevent it. Dan and team would end up working closely with engineers from SolarWinds to help them do the same. (The following year, when Chainguard held a conference to announce its launch, a SolarWinds engineer spoke about how instrumental Lorenc’s team had been in designing its new security system.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the question of how to entirely prevent these attacks remained: When programs are built on hundreds of thousands of lines of open-source code, how do you ensure that every line is as advertised and secure? It’s a problem so large in scale that it feels almost impossible to figure out. Luckily, that’s kind of Lorenc’s thing.</p>



 



<p>Lorenc’s love of solving difficult problems began when he was a kid, fixing up damaged stock cars with his grandfather. They’d spend hours after school and on weekends tinkering together in a small garage. Once the cars were up and running, Lorenc’s grandfather (and after he got his license, Lorenc himself) would race them in community events. When the cars would break down, they would take inventory of the problems and fix them up again. This was the part Lorenc loved most—looking at the engine as a system of parts, understanding how each one functioned and then using that knowledge to fix what wasn’t working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In college, Lorenc pursued mechanical engineering. During his junior year he took a programming class and was hooked. “I was building stuff, but it was a lot faster,” Lorenc says. “You didn’t have to order parts and wait a week for them to ship. You could build those components yourself with a laptop, anywhere.” Software engineering offered the same thrill as fixing up old cars. “It’s that loop of trying to solve a problem, and then either seeing it work or seeing it fail miserably and getting to debug it live. You keep going and get real-time feedback until you solve it. That’s why I liked the computer world. I could do more of that in a lot less time.”</p>



<p>One of the first pieces of code he wrote was a program to solve Rubik’s cubes. The program didn’t work—it kept running without ever arriving at a solution. One of his peers laughed when he saw the code and showed Lorenc how to fix it. It was an important moment. “That’s when I realized, with programming, there’s always a solution,” Lorenc says. “It might not be obvious at first, but it’s there. You just have to find it.”</p>



<p>Lorenc began working at Microsoft soon after he graduated college. He remembers the environment as rewarding, but also stressful. There was a weekend when he and his colleagues were working overtime for an upcoming release, and during a particularly tense moment, his manager pantomimed a Monty Python sketch. Lorenc and his team broke into fits of laughter, and the mood instantly brightened. This left an impression on Lorenc: the need for a work environment that balanced hard work with humor.</p>
 



Chainguard founders Kim Lewandowski, Ville Aikas, Dan Lorenc and Matt Moore.



 
<p>“You’re doing what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bogomil Balkansky, Chainguard’s partner at Sequoia, sat across the table from Lorenc and Moore, not sure he was hearing them right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the months since Moore’s initial text to Lorenc at the restaurant in Austin, Chainguard had officially launched, and its founders had begun building its product and seeking out investors. Lorenc says starting a company at the beginning of 2022 wasn’t easy. Inflation was rising and a wave of layoffs at tech companies meant Lorenc would pitch Chainguard to software engineers—potential customers—one day, only to learn the following week that they had been laid off. After months of meetings, they finally gained traction. The need for supply chain security tools was too great, and companies realized they couldn’t handle the job alone.</p>



<p>Lorenc and the Chainguard team first met with Sequoia in the spring of 2022. Balkansky was impressed by Chainguard’s initial product in development, Chainguard Enforce, a program that scans containers and produces an itemized list of the code inside. Engineers can then review the list for malware and loopholes that might make the containers vulnerable to hackers. And so Balkansky was surprised to learn, just days after Sequoia’s partnership with Chainguard was finalized, that, according to Lorenc, Chainguard was in the midst of building out a far more ambitious product: Chainguard Images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In computing, a “container image” refers to a static collection of executable code. Chainguard Images would be a library of these files, made from open-source code that Chainguard engineers would verify, sign, patch and secure. With Chainguard Images, customers would no longer have to opt for open-source code they’d found on the internet and hope for the best. Instead, they could select an image from Chainguard’s library and feel confident that their code was as advertised and could not be edited by bad actors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a massive undertaking, which explained Balkansky’s incredulity when he first learned of it. To execute Chainguard Images, Lorenc and his team would first have to build a Linux distribution, an operating system on which Chainguard Images could run. Balkansky had worked with other companies who had endeavored to do this but hadn’t succeeded; he knew it was an incredibly complex task that could take years to complete, and even then there was no guarantee it would work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky wasn’t the only one who was skeptical. Other software companies with thousands of engineers struggled to believe that Chainguard, with only 25 engineers, could not only build a Linux distribution, but also comb through and verify numerous libraries of code. “Yes, it seemed impossible,” Lorenc says. “Yes, just based on the sheer numbers, the lines of code we would need to pore over and adjust to make secure, it was daunting. Everyone else looked at it and saw it as too hard of a problem, too massive to actually solve. But it seemed obvious it was something we needed to do.” Lorenc shrugs, “To me, it didn’t seem impossible, it just seemed hard. And I’m okay with hard.”</p>



<p>“Hard” paid off. Lorenc and his team spent a year working tirelessly on Chainguard Images. To motivate and energize his team during long days and even longer nights and weekends, Lorenc pulled from the lesson learned at Microsoft, making sure that hours of focus were interspersed with jokes, lighthearted stories and plenty of room for laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky was sitting in a conference room in early 2023 when Lorenc let him know Chainguard Images was live. Balkansky’s first thought: “Pretty damn impressive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Chainguard has rebuilt around 80% of the open-source code most companies use, and because Chainguard is the only company offering access to this type of library, they’re racing to keep up with demand for the remaining 20%. Chainguard also takes custom orders—if a company needs a certain container specific to their product verified, Chainguard will take it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As time consuming and challenging as building out Chainguard Images continues to be, Lorenc recognizes its payoff for users. It’s akin to building a house—yes, you can use cheap and readily available materials for construction and deal with a rickety staircase or a toilet that won’t flush later, but Chainguard’s philosophy is that it’s worth the extra time, money and labor to start with high-quality products. Lorenc believes in taking every measure possible, no matter how complicated it might be, when it comes to keeping software and its users safe.</p>



 



<p>Working in security necessitates a certain amount of paranoia—the fear of what you’ve missed, of an unseen crack or fatal flaw, is relentless. Lorenc’s use of humor to assuage the high-risk, high-anxiety environment has paid off in more ways than one. He regularly makes his own memes, many of which have gone viral within software development communities. One meme shows Ken from the Barbie movie, with the caption “My job is just CVEs.” (CVEs meaning “Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.”) Another depicts Ned Stark from “Game of Thrones,” with a caption that reads “Brace yourselves. VEX is coming.” (VEX is an open platform for sharing information about software vulnerabilities.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lorenc’s goal in creating memes was originally to provide levity and form a community with people working in security, so he was surprised when his social media presence ended up being one of Chainguard’s most successful marketing strategies. Lorenc regularly sees his memes making rounds on LinkedIn and X, formerly Twitter. Chainguard’s TikToks are also popular among engineers, many of which feature Lorenc, in his trademark backward baseball cap, speaking to viewers as though he was guiding a friend through a casual tutorial on software security. Lorenc attributes the love for Chainguard’s social media to his users’ desire for authenticity. He’s not some faceless CEO of a corporation; he’s a software engineer, just like his customers, and he speaks their language. It’s not a traditional avenue for a security company to market itself, but Chainguard has always done things its own way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite his numerous duties as CEO, Lorenc’s favorite part of the job is still working with other engineers to solve complex and granular problems. He thinks Chainguard was able to attract some of the best engineers in the industry precisely because the company has such lofty goals. “The people on our team were drawn to the difficulty of our mission,” he says. “Smart people want to work on hard problems.” Often when people encounter what seems like an impossible series of problems, they get overwhelmed, but not Lorenc. He knows every inch of this engine, and working on it part by part, he’s confident he can get it to run.</p>

<p>While competition fosters innovation, the proliferation of different blockchains has resulted in the fragmentation and isolation of liquidity within each ecosystem. Early attempts to address this issue primarily involved bridges and wrapped assets. Unfortunately, these solutions were often vulnerable to hacks and exploits, and the value of wrapped assets was contingent on the security of the wrapper contract, rather than the underlying asset. Cross-chain swaps of native assets hold the promise of resolving liquidity fragmentation, but numerous technological challenges must be overcome to make them as seamless as same-chain swaps.</p><p>We were joined by Simon Harman, founder of Chainflip, to discuss multi-chain liquidity fragmentation and how Chainflip’s JIT AMM (Just in Time) aims to solve this, by providing cross-chain native swaps.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Simon’s background  (Legacy) Bridging vs. Threshold Signature Scheme  Chainflip’s Just in Time (JIT) AMM vs. Uniswap’s V3/X  Providing liquidity on Chainflip  Slippage and UX  Deciding trading pairs  Chainflip validators  Validator stake auctions  Governance  Roadmap and bootstrapping liquidity  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonAHarman">Simon Harman on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Chainflip">Chainflip on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

The EON platform is designed to provide both the technical infrastructure and a nurturing environment for builders, complete with product support and incubation.</p>



 The EON Launch is Joined by a Vibrant Range of Protocol Integrations and Partnerships 


 
 


<p></p>



<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/ecosystem">The Horizen EON ecosystem </a>welcomes protocols, builders, and dapps that resonate with its<a href="https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/web-assets/eon-litepaper-april-2023.pdf"> core values</a>:&nbsp; Transparency, Accountability,&nbsp; Security, Community Engagement, Continuous Growth, and Social Responsibility. </p>



<p>The EON ecosystem is launched with a wide range of protocols and dapps, providing a vibrant ecosystem for its new users starting day one.

 Embrace the Web3 Revolution 



<p>Horizen EON’s foundation rests on the belief that the path to web3 adoption involves enhancing the web2 experience. It is not looking to reinvent the wheel but to optimize it, ensuring that the unique features of web3 (like Tokenization, Authentication, and Interoperability) seamlessly integrate into applications that are familiar and user-centric.</p>



<p>Across cutting-edge verticals, EON aims to support innovative application ideas that can bring the next generation of builders and consumers to web3.</p>



<p>As the world has been ushering in a new era of decentralized applications, Horizen invites developers, innovators, and users to join the Horizen EON ecosystem and work together to drive mainstream adoption of web3 technologies, foster a more connected multi-chain world, and create solutions that cater to users at every stage of the Web3 journey.</p>

  Partnering with Chkk: Your Kubernetes Co-Pilot  <p>Awais, Fawad and Ali are helping devops catch problems before they lead to downtime.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky	 



Published October 25, 2023
  



Awais, Bogomil, Fawad and Ali at Sequoia.



 
<p>If you’re building an application hosted in the cloud today, there’s a very good chance it’s running on Kubernetes. In fact, a 2021 <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/02/10/cncf-sees-record-kubernetes-and-container-adoption-in-2021-cloud-native-survey/">survey</a> by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) found an impressive 96% of organizations using or evaluating K8s—and as ever-more business-critical apps land on the platform, its uptime and availability have become a top concern for Platform Engineering, SRE and DevOps teams. But some of Kubernetes’ main strengths, its flexibility and its vibrant ecosystem of add-ons, come with a price: complexity. Navigating the multiple configs and tracking intricate dependencies, across multiple layers and multiple add-on solutions, is not for the light-hearted. A typical Kubernetes footprint is not a single platform or product; rather, it is a complex environment built using components from add-ons in the CNCF ecosystem, many of them open source, and some of them commercial products. Each add-on has its own release and upgrade schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The seams between these products are where failures most often occur, and most current tooling is designed to address problems after the fact—meaning devops and SREs get stuck in fire-fighting mode. This reactive troubleshooting is both painful and resource-intensive, with even mundane config changes and upgrades taking a lot of time and effort.</p>



<p>But what if you could add a proactive tool to your toolbelt, to warn you about potential issues—and help you fix them—before they ever lead to downtime? That tantalizing possibility is now a reality with <a href="https://www.chkk.io/">Chkk</a>, a first-of-its-kind platform that allows enterprises to identify and address availability risks and upgrade their Kubernetes deployments safely, quickly and with confidence. Think of it like the X-ray that diagnoses your health issue early on—so it doesn’t land you in the ER.</p>



<p>Chkk co-founders Awais Nemat, Fawad Khaliq and Ali Khayam took inspiration from best practices in cybersecurity, where security vulnerabilities are reported publicly. Similarly, Chkk is building a database of availability risks by tracking the behavior of hundreds of Kubernetes projects. Powered by this innovative Collective Learning technology, the platform then continuously scans your environment to find and prioritize risks and prevent disruptions—and even creates pre-verified plans to reduce upgrade time from weeks to days. Teams learn from other’s mistakes so they don’t repeat them, and developers spend far less of their valuable time putting out fires.</p>



<p>Awais, Fawad and Ali are a founding dream team who worked together for more than a decade, including at AWS and on the team that built Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and they understand the challenges Platform, SRE and DevOps teams are facing firsthand. Now, they’re on a mission to solve those same problems for all developers, and we at Sequoia are thrilled to support them and lead this seed round. With their Kubernetes Availability Platform now in general availability and with more infrastructure teams adopting Kubernetes every day, we believe this is just the beginning—for Chkk’s growing team, and for the indispensable technology they’re building.</p>

 The Horizen ecosystem is thrilled to announce its integration with the LayerZero protocol. This integration aims to bolster the Horizen EON ecosystem’s cross-chain capabilities, ensuring seamless and direct communication between various blockchains via arbitrary message bridging. 



<p>This integration is poised to catalyze significant advancements for the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> ecosystem. By integrating <a href="https://layerzero.network">LayerZero</a>‘s advanced messaging infrastructure, Horizen’s EON will offer enhanced interoperability, allowing data, assets, and information to be transferred across blockchains without compromising on efficiency or security. Beyond just messaging, this integration signifies a broader vision of creating a unified digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Interoperability is the future of blockchain technology. By integrating with LayerZero, we are not only enhancing the capabilities of our EON platform but also taking a significant step towards a more interconnected and resilient blockchain ecosystem. LayerZero’s expertise in cross-chain communications will be instrumental in achieving our vision for EON as a leading smart contracting platform in a multichain world.” </p>
Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs.</blockquote>



<p>LayerZero’s protocol has already shown its prowess by connecting over 40 blockchains and processing more than 75 million messages since its inception. Their collaboration with giants like Google Cloud further attests to their commitment to security and performance.</p>



<p>Horizen’s EON, with its EVM compatibility, is already making waves in the blockchain community. The addition of LayerZero’s cross-chain expertise will further solidify its position as a go-to platform for developers and DeFi enthusiasts.</p>

 <code>endpoint</code>: <code>0xb6319cC6c8c27A8F5dAF0dD3DF91EA35C4720dd7</code> 
 



<p>For more insights into this integration and the future of EON, stay tuned to the upcoming EON Mainnet Launch Summit where the teams behind Horizen EON and LayerZero will share more insight on this integration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This means that a Zebra-backed lightwalletd server can now query Zebra using the new and updated RPC methods for the Spend before Sync light wallet feature.</p>



<p>One other notable feature released in this version is the ability to enable progress bars in Zebra’s config file. When progress bars are enabled, users will be able to see Zebra’s blocks, transactions and peer connections in their terminal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stablecoins represent a safe haven against crypto’s volatility, allowing participants to remain in the market, without off-ramping to fiat. While the major stablecoins are centrally issued (e.g. USDT, USDC, BUSD), there is a pressing need for an algorithmic variant or a synthetic dollar asset. (DAI is somewhere in between since approximately 50% of its collateral is USDC). After Luna’s collapse, many jumped to point out its design flaws, yet such a concept would be crucial for crypto’s decentralisation and self-sustainability. Arthur Hayes proposed an interesting concept of NAKA synthetic dollar (NUSD), backed by Bitcoin and its inverse perpetual swap short. However, yield generation on $BTC is significantly lower than that of $ETH. A sustainable yield would help balance the cases in which funding rates would be negative (a minority in crypto).</p><p>We were joined by Guy Young, co-founder of Ethena, to discuss the stablecoin landscape and their synthetic eUSD, backed by staked ETH and its inverse perpetual swap.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Guy’s background and founding Ethena  The history of stablecoins  The stablecoin trilemma and transparency  eUSD synthetic dollar mechanics  Ethena’s insurance fund and hedging  Minimising the impact of depegging  Leveraging centralised liquidity while maintaining self custody through MPC  User experience  Risk factors  CEX vs. DEX: liquidity, infrastructure, UX  The potential of fixed return rates  Supply &amp; rates equilibrium  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_">Guy Young on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ethena_labs">Ethena Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/dust-on-crust-300d4b5cf3ec">Arthur Hayes' article proposing the Naka synthetic dollar</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

    <p>Q3 2023 was full of growth and exciting milestones for the Horizen ecosystem! The Horizen DAO went live and the core team launched the Alpha version of Horizen’s EVM sidechain, EON on mainnet. This alpha launch has activated increased developer activity and&nbsp; BD partnerships – watch out for more news in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>We look forward to another fruitful and productive quarter!</p>
<p></p>
 Launch of the Horizen DAO 
<p></p>
<p>Last month, the Horizen DAO officially launched, marking the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!<br><br><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">Learn more about the Horizen DAO launch in our blog post.</a></p>
 Horizen EON Alpha Launch&nbsp; 
<p>On August 1st, Horizen EON Alpha was activated on mainnet, marking the beginning of the on-boarding phase for launch partners &amp; early builders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Horizen EON documentation can be found in our <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/">documentation hub</a>, featuring content around different network environments, developing and deploying smart contracts, staking, service providers, and tutorials.</p>
<p>The core team has also worked to release a new software upgrade that adds a new voting power contract for the Horizen DAO governance, improved the node synchronization speed, and enhanced security&nbsp; features.</p>
 Horizen EON Q3 Partnerships and Integrations 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-wanchain-to-expand-cross-chain-interoperability-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Wanchain Expanding Cross-Chain Interoperability for EON</a></p>
<p>Wanchain is an R&amp;D-focused blockchain interoperability project whose mission is to drive blockchain adoption through interoperability by building fully decentralized bridges that connect the world’s many siloed blockchain networks.</p>
<p>This collaboration will enhance Horizen EON’s potential by adding it to the roster of chains that users can bridge their funds to using Wanchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-tatum-to-enabling-blockchain-application-development-and-integrations-on-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Tatum Enabling Blockchain Application Development And Integrations On EON</a></p>
<p>This collaboration aims to make it much easier for developers to build using Horizen ecosystem by integrating Tatum’s easy-to-use blockchain development tools and framework. By leveraging Tatum, Horizen EON will offer developers the ability to seamlessly integrate blockchain functionalities into their applications, coded in JavaScript.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-and-pyth-network-join-forces-to-amplify-decentralized-oracle-services-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Pyth Network Amplifying Decentralized Oracle Services For EON</a></p>
<p>Pyth Network is a specialized oracle solution, to provide decentralized oracle services for EON. This collaboration will bring accurate and trusted on-chain market data to EON, empowering developers to enhance their smart contract capabilities and expand the possibilities for DeFi, gaming, and NFT applications.</p>
 Horizen EON Welcomes NTT DATA, Joining The Network As A Certificate Signer Node To Support The Growth And Security Of The EON Network 
<p>Last month, a leading IT service provider and global innovation partner, NTT DATA, is deploying a Horizen EON blockchain Certificate Signer Node on the NTT DATA infrastructure, which will contribute proactively to the credibility, security, and robustness of the Horizen EON network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen EON chain will have a total of 47 certificate signer nodes. These signer nodes provide credibility to the transactions on the EON chain and ensure decentralization. They are responsible for signing backward transfer requests allowing the flow of ZEN from the EON chain to the Horizen mainchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-welcomes-ntt-data-joining-the-network-as-a-certificate-signer-node/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=marketing+EON">Learn more about this announcement here.&nbsp;</a></p>
 Q3 Core Software Releases 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/new-software-release-eon-1-0-0-is-available-to-download-now/">EON 1.0.0 Release</a></p>
 
 EON 1.0.0 is used for GOBI Testnet nodes and EON Mainnet nodes. Deployment guides can be found at <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/develop_and_deploy_smart_contracts/local_build_and_deploy">EON Documentation</a>. 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">Node Software Upgrade ZEN 4.1.0</a></p>
<p>Learn more about ZEN 4.1.0 in <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">our blog post.&nbsp;</a></p>
 ZenIP 42206 – Redirecting Secure Node Rewards into Horizen EON 
<p></p>
<p>Horizen’s Community Council has recently submitted <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a>, which proposes a redirect of the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund. The purpose is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zendoo has increased the requirements of mainchain nodes so that the Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen chain. Furthermore, with the removal of the shielded pools on the mainchain, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.</p>
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Please join the conversation and make this decision with us. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">Learn more about ZenIP 42206 </a>and let us know what you think by submitting the community survey:</p>

 Community Voting Proposals 
<p>During Q3, the Horizen ecosystem saw a few different community voting proposals ongoing. Featuring a proposal for <a href="https://debank.com/proposal/15639">Rabby Wallet to support the EON chain</a>, Tally, a leading DAO tool to join the EON chain, and a request for Phantom Wallet to integrate with EON.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also saw a proposal to deploy Synapse on Horizen EON, this deployment aims to establish connectivity between the Horizen Ecosystem and a wide range of popular Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains connected to the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
 Node Growth 
<p></p>
 Beyond the Horizen Podcast Updates 
<p>During Q3, we continued our Beyond the Horizen Podcast Series, a monthly show all about the Horizen ecosystem and Web3 movement, with three new episodes:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hype of web3 in marketing has entered the chat. More and more businesses from various industries turn towards leveraging web3 opportunities within their marketing campaigns. To put this into reality, so has the <a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/how-loreal-is-gearing-up-for-the-metaverse/">L’Oréal Group</a> utilised the variety of web3 in several of their latest marketing campaigns, especially the metaverse, gamification as well as NFT drops. As more companies seek innovative ways to connect with audiences, the marketing department often takes the lead in experimenting with these modern approaches. Let’s dive in and explore what web3 means for the future of marketing.</p>



 Traditional vs. Web3 Marketing: Effectiveness&nbsp; 



<p>In the dynamic landscape of marketing, two distinct paradigms emerge: web3 marketing and traditional marketing. Web3 marketing harnesses cutting-edge technologies like blockchain to empower users with greater control over their digital presence. In contrast, traditional marketing relies on established channels and centralisation. Web3 marketing is an unchartered field with creative means of disrupting traditional marketing models. The characteristics of web3 marketing are (logically) close to what benefits web3 can offer in general:</p>



 
 Decentralisation  



 Transparency  



 Tokenisation  



 Community  



 Ownership  
 



<p>Especially decentralisation is the pillar that differentiates web3 marketing from traditional marketing practices. Decentralisation is giving individuals control over their data. This shift creates a cooperative and mutually beneficial environment, strengthening the bond between brands and consumers.</p>







<p>When evaluating the effectiveness of web3 marketing in both the short and long term, one key aspect stands out: customer loyalty. Ultimately, it’s the bedrock of long-term success in web3 marketing. Without a loyal customer base, your marketing endeavors lack purpose. While many aspects of web3 may currently seem like mere buzzwords, the cultivation of a strong community sets apart effective web3 marketing from fleeting traditional campaigns (through e.g., print, radio, TV, or social media), as the latter often yield only short-term results. By embracing the user-centric essence of Web3 technologies, businesses can lay the foundation for long-lasting effectiveness. This approach enables them to cultivate trust and engagement with their consumer base, and forge meaningful connections with their target audience, ultimately leading to sustainable marketing success in the long run. One of many ways to achieve this is through, e.g., the introduction of loyalty programs, to keep customers hooked and committed.</p>



 Community-centricity: Reinvented brand-customer power dynamics 



 The community 



<p>“Commonality is a purpose, meets frequency of touch” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qu5KQJGCs">Swan Sit – web3 developer</a>). Establishing meaningful connections between a brand and its customers is a fundamental objective in marketing. This involves not only targeting customers who align with the brand’s values but also striving for maximum customer engagement. What sets web3 marketing apart is its participatory nature, where customers are not only part of a group but actively engage within that collective. Furthermore, the notion of tangible value comes into play, as the community can receive incentives or rewards from the brand they support, fostering a sense of pride in being part of that specific community. How these incentives could look like, is touched upon later in the article (see NFTs).</p>



<p>Navigating the integration of web3 into your marketing practices may encounter resistance from existing communities that are resistant to change. To overcome potential backlash, open and transparent communication is essential. Engage with your community, address their concerns, and emphasise how the shift to web3 benefits them. Demonstrating a clear understanding of their needs and a commitment to preserving what they value can help ease the transition. Additionally, gradual implementation and education about the advantages of web3 can mitigate resistance and pave the way for a smoother transition, ultimately ensuring the long-term success of your brand’s evolution.</p>



 New power dynamics  



<p>In today’s evolving landscape, we can witness a shift in power dynamics, where the consumer takes a central stage and wields a more significant influence on brand decisions. This represents a stark departure from the traditional paradigm where brands held the upper hand, often due to information imbalances. Web3 technology is a game-changer in this context, offering the potential to rebalance these dynamics. What’s particularly noteworthy is the active involvement of brands in these online communities, signifying a fundamental transformation in how businesses approach marketing.</p>



<p>In this new era, understanding your audience and constructing strategies tailored to their preferences and behaviours becomes paramount. It’s a shift towards a more consumer-centric approach, where the community’s voice plays a crucial role in shaping brand decisions and forging stronger, mutually beneficial relationships.</p>



<p>Web3 technology, thanks to its transparent and authentic nature, helps build trust between brands and consumers. Using blockchain, brands can provide proof of where their products come from, their authenticity, and their sustainability, giving consumers the information they need to make informed decisions. In this context, deceptive marketing practices struggle to gain traction, highlighting how important transparency and authenticity are in web3 marketing. This shift represents a significant departure from traditional marketing, fostering a more genuine and accountable connection between brands and their audiences.</p>



 The web3 marketing trends 



<p>Web3 marketing allows for various new trends, which enrich ways of doing marketing:&nbsp;</p>



 
 NFTs 



 Virtual experiences 



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  
 



 NFTs 



<p>A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a one-of-a-kind digital asset, which replicates real-life items in the form of e.g., art or music and can be sold or bought online. NFTs have gained popularity as a means for brands to enter the web3 marketing space, and hold the promise of serving as valuable bridges between brands and their communities.</p>



<p>NFTs serve a dual purpose:</p>



 
 NFTs can expand the current audience of the brand, and reel those in, that show a clear interest in the web3 space.&nbsp; 



 Additionally, they can also be harnessed for branding and communication strategies. Businesses can use NFTs as a means to incentivise their fans and followers. Within the NFT ecosystem, the range of possibilities is vast: this includes providing discounts, delivering rewarding products, or crafting unique digital items exclusively available to members of the NFT community. 
 



<p>To put this into reality, <a href="https://raritysniper.com/news/adidas-tokenproof-partnership-to-reward-loyal-nft-holders/">Adidas</a> has explored web3 marketing through NFTs. They recently collaborated with Tokengate, where an NFT loyalty program grants access to exclusive Adidas sneakers. Furthermore, Adidas has also teamed up with the Doodles collection and had a partnership with Pharrell &amp; Adidas for an exclusive Samba sneaker drop.</p>



 Virtual experiences 



<p>One of the major trends within web3 marketing revolves around creating virtual experiences, primarily through the metaverse or Virtual Reality (VR). The core concept of such, in a marketing sense, is to offer a fluid experience that seamlessly bridges the gap between the physical and virtual worlds. This enables users to engage with both one another and digital elements in real time, soaking up the person into the action. As previously mentioned, consumers are part of a brand experience, giving them a sense of belonging to the particular brand, as well as active participation in the experience. This emotional side of marketing can often be more important than the actual physical product being sold.</p>



<p>In November of 2021, Nike solidified its position in the nascent metaverse with the launch of <a href="https://www.nike.com/kids/nikeland-roblox">Nikeland</a>, a branded virtual interactive space, marking a significant step in blending sales, marketing, and gaming.</p>



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  



<p>Worries regarding privacy and the handling of personal data have surged, and the demand for replacing platforms is growing. Think of web3 as the rebel of the internet world, challenging the status quo. It’s all about giving you, the user, the reins to control your online experience. Unlike those traditional social media giants that hoard your data on their servers, web3 rides on blockchain technology, creating decentralised networks where you are the data owner. Privacy, anonymity, security, and ownership are redefined in web3 (social media) marketing, creating a more trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p>



 Conclusion: Embrace the shift  



<p>As we navigate the evolving landscape of marketing, it’s crucial for brands to adapt and embrace the shift towards integrating web3 into their practices. This means staying true to your brand’s core values while modifying your existing products or services to align with the futuristic space. In this context, experimentation is not an option; it’s a necessity. Embracing web3 in your marketing strategies is the path forward to ensure your brand remains relevant and competitive in an ever-changing digital world.</p>

<p>Demystifying artificial intelligence, challenging the status quo, and empowering everyday people to embrace the digital revolution.</p>
<p><a>The Brave Technologist Podcast</a> (formerly The Brave Marketer) returns for a new season with a fresh perspective: Deconstructing AI and Bleeding-Edge Tech</p>
<p>From privacy concerns to limitless potential, AI is rapidly impacting society.</p>
<p>How can we, as new users and early adopters, make emerging tech more approachable and less daunting? How can we unlock the potential of new Web technologies with confidence and curiosity, and redefine the digital age?</p>
<p>Every Wednesday, The Brave Technologist will bring you insightful conversations with industry leaders who share their expertise, visions, and practical applications of AI. The new season launches today, and features an interview with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kjellcarlsson/">Dr. Kjell Carlsson</a>, Head of Data Science Strategy &amp; Evangelism at Domino Data Lab. Together, we’ll discuss AI’s impact on human intelligence (both now and in the future), and its implications for how we understand ourselves and our place in the world. Part philosophy, part tech, this episode promises to get you thinking.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>Future episodes will feature guests from Planful, A121 Labs, the University of Michigan, the Brave Search team, and more! Topics in this new 10-episode season include: privacy concerns, the future of AI, local data, machine learning, the confluence of Web3 and AI, and more!</p>

Self-custody requires increased security measures, from both end-users, as well as application developers. Web3 wallets are the interface between users and decentralised applications deployed on blockchains. While Metamask still maintains the largest market share, a multitude of wallets have emerged, promising additional features and a better UX.</p><p>We were joined by Evgeny Yurtaev, co-founder &amp; CEO of Zerion, to discuss the challenges of building a Web3 wallet and how Zerion aims to improve user experience, while still maintaining security.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Evgeny’s background  The motivation behind building a Web3 wallet  Zerion UX and security  Seed phrase storing  Zerion user profile  Challenges in building a new wallet app  Protecting users and potential attack vectors  Supported blockchains and (seamless) bridging  Account abstraction and MPC  Business models for Web3 wallets  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/evgeth_">Evgeny Yurtaev on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zerion">Zerion on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst.

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>It’s the end of the month again! Here’s a round-up of everything that went down this September.</p> Tech Updates  v1 Testnet update <p>Stage 2 of our v1 Testnet is still in the making. This Stage is predominantly about converting Panther Reward Points to $zZKP. The introduction of an additional feature ("vouchers") will enable users to test this conversion while remaining in a testnet environment, an addition that slightly differs from this Stage's original design. The function is still undergoing internal testing.</p><p>Concurrently, Stage 3 work has already started and is in progress. This Stage will be centered around depositing assets into Shielded Pools.</p><p>We're excited to get Panther v1 in your hands. Look out for more updates on the Testnet launch in the coming weeks!</p> Update to the Stage 1 Testnet’s url <p>As we progress on the above, we have updated the link for Stage 1 on our Testnet information repository. The new version contains a few tweaks and upgrades.</p><p>To access it, go to: <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages</a></p> Comparing Panther’s approach to ‘Privacy Pools’ <p>The recent <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Privacy Pools paper</a> struck a chord with the Web3 community. It's clear that preserving users' privacy in a compliant way is crucial for the mass adoption of decentralized technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>After carefully reviewing the paper by <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Vitalik Buterin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ameen Soleimani</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mat_nadler?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Mat Nadler</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Chainalysis</a>' J. Illum, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fschaer?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Fabien Schär</a>, we wrote an article comparing Panther's solutions to ‘Privacy Pools’.&nbsp;</p><p>Both protocols attempt to exclude bad actors from a privacy-preserving system based on disclosures that can be legally adopted. However, although there are clear similarities, there are also key differences in how we tackle this challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>Read our in-depth analysis:</p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-privacy-pools-approaches-compared/">https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-privacy-pools-approaches-compared/</a></p>We analyze Panther's solutions against ‘Privacy Pools’, both aiming to exclude malicious actors from privacy-preserving systems. Integrating PureFi as Panther’s first accredited compliance integration <p>Although PureFi’s integration into v1 had already been approved by the Panther DAO, this month we formalized it with an announcement. With this, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-joins-forces-with-purefi-to-enable-compliance-in-prifi/">PureFi joins Panther in enabling compliant DeFi privacy</a>.</p><p>Privacy integrations enable Panther to:</p>  Improve its decentralization  Apply compliance at a protocol level  Provide on-chain support for ZK-compatible attestations &amp; signatures  <p>These&nbsp; integrations also prioritize neutrality. Through our team’s collaboration with compliance providers like PureFi Protocol, they will be able to issue zero-knowledge proofs for Panther users that submit their data and achieve passing AML scores, ensuring Panther remains uninformed of user data.</p><p>Integrating third-party compliance tools like PureFi underscores Panther's dedication to shaping a DeFi ecosystem where privacy tools are normalized and malicious actors are diligently screened out.</p>PureFi &amp; Panther’s integration illustrated. Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi <p>We hosted a meeting with PureFi Protocol to discuss our upcoming v1 integration.</p><p>Panther’s CEO Oliver Gale, CTO Anish Mohammed, and Head of Product Saif Akhtar joined PureFi’s CEO Slava Demchuk, CTO Mykhailo Tiutin, and COO Vasily Vidmanov to break down the complexities of the integration and answer all your questions.&nbsp;</p><p>This was a great opportunity to showcase how Panther and PureFi are working together to make privacy-preserving DeFi a no-brainer.</p><p>You can listen back to this Twitter Spaces at:</p> <blockquote><p>We'll be hosting a panel with <a href="https://twitter.com/PureFi_Protocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@PureFi_Protocol</a> to discuss our v1 integration!<br><br>We'll have Panther CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginalOlii?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@OriginalOlii</a>, CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@anishmohammed</a>, Product Head <a href="https://twitter.com/saifonblock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@saifonblock</a> with CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/demchukvm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@demchukvm</a> , CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/mtiutin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@mtiutin</a> and COO Vasily Vidmanov from PureFi.<br><br>Set a reminder: <a href="https://t.co/HXZ3933KX8?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://t.co/HXZ3933KX8</a></p>— Panther Protocol (@ZKPanther) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1708924109906727164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">October 2, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>Danny Ryan is a coordinator at the Ethereum Foundation. He’s been on Bankless many times before. Usually, we’re talking about the Ethereum roadmap and what’s coming next. This time we’re talking about something different…a risk to Ethereum that Danny sees. A little over a year ago, Danny wrote a blog post titled “The Risk of LSDs”... discussing the various risk vectors that a dominant LSD presents to Ethereum…even naming Lido specifically in the process.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ ✨ DEBRIEF | Ryan &amp; David unpacking the episode: <a href="https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan">https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ A lot of people have decided that liquid staking with Lido is the place to do it. At the time of recording Lido has over 30% of all staked Ether. Does this present a systemic risk to Ethereum?</p> <p>We did an episode called, “In Defense of Lido” with researcher Hasu who argued that Lido does not pose a systemic risk to Ethereum. In fact, Lido’s dominance is better than many other alternatives. We left that conversation half-finished when we published it in August 2023.&nbsp;</p> <p>In today’s episode, we cover part two of that debate with Ethereum researcher and guest Danny Ryan who argues the opposite. Lido is a systemic risk to Ethereum and what to do about it.</p> <p>We believe our role as podcasters for issues like this is to voice both sides of the argument in long-form conversations and healthy debate. It is exactly the kind of thing you don’t get on Twitter. That’s why we’ve given voice to both sides of this issue.&nbsp;</p> <p>We think there are good actors who care about this ecosystem at Lido and in the broader Ethereum community and we’re sure this episode won’t be the last word on this subject.</p> <p>----- 🏹 Airdrop Hunter is HERE, join your first HUNT today <a href="https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT">https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 a16z Startup School | Apply Before Oct. 20th <a href="https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school">https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE ⁠<a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2%C2%A0%20%E2%81%A0">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2&nbsp; ⁠</a></p> <p>🦊METAMASK PORTFOLIO | MANAGE YOUR WEB3 EVERYTHING <a>⁠https://bankless.cc/MetaMask&nbsp;</a></p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a></p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/Toku">https://bankless.cc/Toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄UNISWAP | ON-CHAIN MARKETPLACE ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap&nbsp;</a></p> <p>🔗 CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 7:41 Is Lido a Threat to Ethereum 8:57 &nbsp;Blog Post Thinking Change? 19:30 Uniswap 21:20 Theoretical Main Risks 25:45 God Mode&nbsp; 27:20 Practical Main Risks 34:00 Hasu Counter-Arguments&nbsp; 38:25 Permissionless Validator Set Mitigation 42:30 Veto Power Mitigation Argument 46:55 How Likely is the Lido Risk? 51:26 Client Team Positioning&nbsp; 55:00 How Special is the Lido Case?&nbsp; 57:45 One LST Inevitability &nbsp; 1:02:30 Solutions&nbsp; 1:06:55 Profit Maximization&nbsp; 1:09:00 Action Steps For Ethereum Decentralization&nbsp; 1:11:53 Can Ethereum Devs Do Something?&nbsp; 1:20:10 Hasu Questions Answered by Danny&nbsp; 1:22:45 Magnitude of the Lido Threat 1:24:20 How Can Lido Fix This?&nbsp; 1:25:59 Stick &amp; Carrot for Lido 1:26:27 Silverlining of Lido Threat 1:29:05 Next Conversations&nbsp; 1:32:16 Closing &amp; Disclaimers &nbsp;</p> <p>----- RESOURCES</p> <p>Danny Ryan <a href="https://twitter.com/dannyryan">https://twitter.com/dannyryan</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Danny Ryan Blog Post <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd">https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Hasu’s Bankless Interview <a href="https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY">https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Back in 2017, there was no DeFi as we know it today, yet MakerDAO were already envisioning and building towards what they thought to be a certainty. The backbone of DeFi is represented by stable coins, and MakerDAO quickly understood this: they set out to build a decentralised stable coin, $DAI (and its precursor $SAI). Being collateral-backed, the smart contract needs to know the value of that collateral, but any off-chain price data is not readily available on-chain. This is where oracles come in and provide data feeds on-chain. MakerDAO’s internal oracle has been active since 2017 on Ethereum and has recently branched out, forming Chronicle. By using aggregated Schnorr signatures, Chronicle solves the problem of oracle cost-efficient scaling.</p><p>We were joined by Niklas Kunkel, founder of Chronicle, to discuss the challenges and tradeoffs that oracles regularly face, and how Chronicle is solving them, continuing the ethos of early MakerDAO.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Niklas’ background and the early days of MakerDAO  How MakerDAO evolved over time and the adoption of DAI  MakerDAO’s core principles  Why Chronicle branched out from MakerDAO  Oracle challenges &amp; tradeoffs  Oracle validators  Business model for oracles  Providing oracle services to different blockchains  Schnorr signatures  Chronicle’s supported chains and oracle offerings  Real-world assets (RWA) and credit delegation  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nomos_paradox">Niklas Kunkel on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChronicleLabs">Chronicle on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerDAO">Maker DAO on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p><code>zcashd</code> 5.7.0 deprecates <code>fetch-params.sh</code> and <code>zcash-fetch-params</code> and bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly so they do not need to be downloaded or stored separately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless you need to generate transactions using the deprecated Sprout shielded pool, you can delete the parameter files stored in these directories to save space, as they are no longer read or used by <code>zcashd</code>: </p>



 
 <code>~/.zcash-params</code>&nbsp;(on Linux); or 



 <code>~/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Mac); or 



 <code>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Windows) 
 



<p>If you do wish to use the Sprout pool, you will need the <code>sprout-groth16.params</code> currently available for download <a href="https://download.z.cash/downloads/sprout-groth16.params">here</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, 5.7.0 reports new mempool metrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All node operators, which include our mining and other ecosystem partners, should upgrade to this latest version as soon as possible. Please note that version 5.6.1 will expire on or around Wednesday, October 11.</p>



<p>Additional changes have been included in this release. For technical details, please read the full release notes available at <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0">https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0</a>.</p>

			 by the Zcash Foundation Board 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Over the past few months, members of the Zcash community have begun discussing what should happen after the current Dev Fund sunsets in late 2024. The Zcash Foundation (ZF) looks forward to supporting the Zcash community in debating and deciding whether or not to institute a new ecosystem funding mechanism.&nbsp;</p><p>As a party to the Zcash <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zcash_Trademark_Donation_and_License_Agreement_20191106.pdf">Trademark Donation and License Agreement</a>, ZF is committed to enacting the clear consensus of the Zcash community when it comes to approving and implementing proposed changes to the Zcash protocol (aka network upgrades). The introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace (or extend) the current Dev Fund falls within this remit, as it would involve a change to the Zcash protocol.</p><p>Therefore, ZF proposes that we follow a similar approach to the tried and tested process that resulted in the creation and adoption of ZIP 1014.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 History Lesson: How the first Dev Fund was created 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>During 2019, the Zcash community began discussions about what should happen after the end of the Founders Reward in late 2020. In August 2019, the Zcash Foundation set forth a <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcash-foundation-guidance-on-dev-fund-proposals/">process and timeline</a>, and described how it would assess community sentiment towards proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community members drafted <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/future-of-zcash-dev-funding-megathread-everything-in-one-place/34063">twenty proposals</a>. Following extensive community debate, these twenty were whittled down to thirteen (preserved in the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/">Zcash ZIPs repository</a>, as ZIPs 1001 thru 1013), which were presented to the community in November 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community sentiment was gathered using three mechanisms:&nbsp;</p>
 
 a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/68dcd8ba-08b5-11ea-95c2-1a34a475f69c/view">poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (previously known as the Community Governance Panel or CGP), in which 48 people voted, 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/community-sentiment-collection-poll-on-nu4-dev-fund-zips/35439/">forum poll</a>, in which people who had joined the forum before March 2019 were eligible to vote, and in which 71 people voted, and 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/7">staked poll</a> of coinholders (in which <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHq-KoiE0mKmllcr_LTwS5tNacf5HHt_VFKPL_tYlHU/edit#gid=0">over 105,000 ZEC was staked for polling purposes by 17 distinct Zcash addresses</a>).&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; 
<p>ZF also <a href="https://zfnd.org/restarting-community-sentiment-collection-for-dev-fund-proposals/#on-miner-signaling">invited miners to signal their sentiment</a> but no miners did so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the ZCAP (CGP), forum (F), and staked poll (CH) can be found <a href="https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dev-Fund-Results.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;(with credit to ECC for creating the graphic).&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZF and ECC worked together to draft a new, mutually-agreeable proposal based on the proposals that had received the most support from the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result was a draft of <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">ZIP 1014</a>, which proposed instituting a Dev Fund, consisting of 20% of newly minted coins and lasting until the next halving event (projected for late 2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2020, two mechanisms were used to assess community sentiment regarding ZIP 1014, and to decide on some final details, including how the Dev Fund should be divided among its recipients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zcash Foundation conducted a <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">combined poll</a> of users who participated in the forum poll during the first round of community sentiment gathering, alongside the pre-existing Zcash Community Advisory Panel. This combined group numbered 119, and <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/43b9bec8-39a1-11ea-914c-b6e34ffa859a/view">88 voted in the poll</a>, which approved ZIP 1014 by 77 votes to 11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/111">staked poll</a> of coinholders was coordinated by Zooko and Andrew Miller, in which 24 distinct Zcash addresses staked over 119,000 ZEC for the purposes of the poll. All but one of the participants in this poll (representing 99.9% of the staked coins) voted to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSlHXhA_NoJy0RW3Gc6YY3bmYcKT_YF8oS_BrSkBnvEGGaJ56WYo7iL_9shuoh-z_DZMYojA6FpLoJv/pubhtml">approve ZIP 1014</a>.</p>
<p>ZF and ECC subsequently agreed that ZIP 1014 should be implemented in the Zcash protocol, and it duly activated in November 2020.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			  Process and Timeline for Submitting Proposals 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Both ZF and ECC agree that it is desirable to gain clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem sooner, rather than later. Therefore, we aim to conduct a first round of community sentiment gathering by polling ZCAP in December (alongside the Zcash Community Grants election).&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, teams and organisations that are interested in receiving protocol funding should publicly announce their interest as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>As with the process that led to ZIP 1014, we invite community members to post proposals to the Zcash community forums, in the form of a draft ZIP for review and discussion by the community.</p><p>We will consult with the ZIP editors on whether they are willing to provide editorial feedback on the draft ZIPs (something that Daira and str4d did last time, and which was very useful in clarifying the proposals), and, if so, what deadline would be appropriate for submitting pull requests to the ZIPs Github repo in time for a December round of community sentiment gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>We will host community calls where specific proposals can be discussed, and the community can ask questions of those who are putting forward proposals.&nbsp;</p><p>After the first round of voting, we will assess the results and, if necessary, do further rounds of proposal revision and sentiment-gathering, in order to zero in on a proposal that we are confident represents the clear consensus of the Zcash community</p><p>While we don’t currently intend to formally analyze sentiment beyond the ZCAP poll, we are interested to hear suggestions and ideas&nbsp; for other means of assessing community sentiment, and we will consider other forms of community feedback collected by other parties if it is valuable and informative, and was collected in good faith.</p><p>If you have suggestions or ideas, please post them to the Zcash Community Forum, in the Governance category.</p>

							<p>We at the Zcash Foundation believe that the work we have carried out over the past few years has been of benefit to Zcash and the Zcash community. We hope that the Zcash community agrees, and is willing to continue funding the work of the Foundation.</p><p>However, for the avoidance of any doubt, if the Zcash community decides that the Dev Fund should end and not be replaced (or that it should be replaced but that ZF should not receive any funding), ZF will support that decision, and do what is necessary to enact it (including implementing the new consensus rules in Zebra).&nbsp;</p><p>If the Zcash community does decide to create a new Dev Fund, ZF recommends furthering the decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem by increasing the number of Dev Fund recipients, with at least one recipient in a jurisdiction outside the United States. We also recommend that any new recipients should be nonprofit entities with tax-exempt status, that are subject to legally-enforceable governance requirements similar to those required of&nbsp; 501(c)(3) organizations (e.g. prohibition of private inurement, restrictions on excessive executive compensation, financial disclosure requirements to ensure transparency and accountability).&nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to helping the Zcash community reach consensus on this important decision, which will have a far-reaching impact on the future of Zcash!</p>

This program is aimed at individuals and teams who are seeking funding of up to $25,000 for work that benefits Zcash, or other approaches to financial privacy, in line with our charitable purpose. The total budget for this round of Minor Grants is $75,000.</p><p>Minor Grant applications are submitted to a poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP). To be eligible for funding, applications must receive greater than 50% approval in the poll, and grants will be funded in order of priority determined by the level of ZCAP’s approval, and as the total budget ($75,000) permits.</p><p>We’re pleased to present 20 applications that were submitted to this round of the Minor Grants program.

<p>We are excited to announce that a leading IT service provider and global innovation partner, <a href="https://nttdata.com">NTT DATA</a>, is deploying a <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> blockchain Certificate Signer Node on the NTT DATA infrastructure, which will contribute proactively to the credibility, security, and robustness of the Horizen EON network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horizen EON is Horizen’s EVM-compatible sidechain and smart contracting platform, built with Z<a href="https://horizen.io/zendoo">endoo</a>, a powerful ZK-Enabled cross-chain transfer protocol. Horizen EON enables Web3 developers to both build decentralized applications easily, while quickly accessing the fast-growing Horizen ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See here for more information about Horizen EON (<a href="https://eon.horizen.io/">https://eon.horizen.io/</a>)</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Contributing to public blockchains, running nodes and validators is part of our strategy of working very closely with the public blockchain industry, supporting the growth of these ecosystems and providing the scalability capabilities that as NTT DATA we have.</p>



<p>This is the first of several other initiatives we would like to launch with the crypto industry, and we are happy to have taken this important step with Horizen, in which we strongly believe and with which we plan to undertake other joint actions to offer blockchain-based solutions to our clients.”</p>
– Francisco Spadafora, Head of Blockchain Competence Center EMEAL</blockquote>



<p>What Are EON Certificates Signer Nodes and Why Are They Important</p>



<p>The Horizen EON chain will have a total of 47 certificate signer nodes. These signer nodes provide credibility to the transactions on the EON chain and ensure decentralization.

<p></p><p>Horizen EON Forger Nodes will soon be available to the public for anyone who wishes to participate in the EON network.</p>



<p>Available on the Proof-Of-Stake Horizen EON chain, these nodes are different from the Proof-Of-Work Horizen mainchain nodes. How do these two types of nodes differ, and how do they each play a critical role in securing the network?</p>



<p>Before understanding the importance of these forger nodes, it’s important to first remember or learn some blockchain terms.</p>



 What is the Horizen mainchain and the Horizen EON sidechain? 







<p>The Horizen mainchain is a <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/layer-0/">layer 0</a> chain whose native cryptocurrency is ZEN. It doesn’t natively support smart contracts but natively supports the creation of sidechains.</p>



<p>A sidechain is an independent blockchain that runs parallel to the Horizen mainchain and inherits its security. Sidechains can be used to extend the capabilities of the mainchain, for example by enabling smart contracts, token minting, voting, etc. In addition, ZEN can be transferred back and forth between the mainchain and sidechains (as a gas token) using the forward and backward transfer mechanism.</p>



<p>The Horizen sidechains and the mainchain are independent of each other. A sidechain can have its own consensus and does not rely on the mainchain to grow and add more blocks.</p>



<p>Horizen EON is a dedicated sidechain that implements an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This brings smart contract capabilities to the Horizen ecosystem.</p>



<p>Thanks to the forward and backward transfer mechanism, it’s possible to mint ZEN on Horizen EON by locking an equal amount of ZEN on the mainchain and vice versa. This is important for two reasons:</p>



 
 ZEN are required to pay gas fees on Horizen EON. 



 Horizen EON brings programmability to ZEN. Once ZEN are transferred to Horizen EON, it’s possible to operate on them with all the flexibility enabled by smart contracts.&nbsp; 
 



 Why does the Horizen EON sidechain need forger nodes? 







<p>Horizen’s mainchain operates on a proof-of-work consensus, meaning that it is the miners (in this case, ASICs) who compete to add new blocks to the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>Currently, The Horizen blockchain has a block reward system where the miner who completes the block receives 60% of the reward for this work. Then 10% goes to the Secure Nodes operators, 10% to the Super Nodes operators, and 20% to the ecosystem Treasury.</p>



<p>Secure Nodes and Super Nodes may sound like a hybrid POS/POW system, but they’re not. On Horizen, Secure Nodes and Super Nodes were created to add an extra layer of security to the network by allowing the community to keep a copy of the blockchain and be compensated for verifying transactions validated by miners.</p>



<p>This multi-layer node system has been in place since 2018. In the meantime, the needs of the network have evolved, particularly with the release of Zendoo and Horizen EON, Horizen’s EVM-compatible sidechain. As a result, the current Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen network. Furthermore, with <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/upcoming-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">the removal of the shielded pools on mainchain</a>, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, there is a strong need for forger nodes in the EON chain. The Horizen EON chain is consensus and scalability-independent. To achieve consensus independence, it is necessary for the chain to have its own nodes to validate the transactions taking place on its chain.</p>



 Forger nodes permit to secure the network 



<p>In a Proof-of-Stake chain, the nodes are called forger nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes play a critical role in PoS consensus by creating blocks, validating transactions, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes are critical to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus for several reasons:</p>



 
 Block production: They create new blocks in the blockchain, with their chance of being selected often based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold as collateral. 



 Transaction validation: Forger nodes validate and add transactions to the blockchain, ensuring that only valid transactions are recorded. 



 Security: They’re financially motivated to act honestly because they’ve staked their own tokens as collateral, risking loss if they behave maliciously. 



 Energy efficiency: PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW because it doesn’t require the same amount of computing power. 



 Sybil attack resistance: PoS networks are less vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where an attacker creates many fake nodes to gain control. 



 Decentralization: Forging nodes contribute to network decentralization, allowing a wider range of participants to be involved. 
 



<p>There is an open Zen Improvement Proposal (ZenIP) for redirecting Secure Node block rewards to EON forger node. The purpose of this proposal is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization through forger nodes. The current Secure Node operators are well-equipped to provide this type of support. For more information about this ZenIP, please visit “ <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">ZenIP 42206 Explained: Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards Into Horizen EON</a>”.</p>

 The launch of the Horizen DAO marks the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community. 



<p><a href="http://horizen.io">Horizen</a> is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>



 About Horizen DAO 



<p>DAO stands for “Decentralized Autonomous Organization,” which has emerged as the standard for decentralized governance in the blockchain space and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horizen has always been a community-driven project and has long recognized that a strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is directed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on<a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about"> the Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 Proposal Phases and Voting Process 



<p>The Horizen DAO further decentralizes decision-making for technical, non-technical, and other substantive improvements to the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Protocol Improvement Proposals (IPs) are an established mechanism used to select and implement new features and core protocol changes in many blockchain projects. In Horizen’s case, this IP process is the key tool for the Horizen DAO’s community-led governance. With Horizen’s native token, $ZEN, serving as the governance token for both the Horizen mainchain and the EON sidechain, IPs for each are called, respectively, ZenIPs and EONIPs.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>


 
 


<p>$ZEN holders are the ultimate decision-makers for the future of Horizen and exercise governance over the network’s evolution through participating in the Horizen DAO. Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community. To facilitate effective community governance, users will also be able to delegate voting power to individuals they view as effective stewards of the Horizen ecosystem guiding values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">hard fork that was activated at block 1426200</a> (September 26th 2023), private addresses can no longer receive ZEN from transparent addresses. This affects both Secure and Super Nodes’ ability to continue to perform challenges, and the ability to set up new nodes which currently requires a balance in a shielded address.</p>



<p>Starting September 26, 2023, challenges in both systems are suspended indefinitely. The increased requirements of successfully validating certificates introduced with the registration of EON will serve as a substitute for challenges in the interim.</p>



 Steps for Node Operators 



<p>Existing Nodes<br>There should be no effect on any existing nodes unless the node’s wallet is replaced. See New Nodes below.</p>



<p>Any API calls from a node operator requesting a manual challenge should be stopped.</p>



<p>New Nodes<br>If a new node is created (or a new wallet is created) it will need to follow the current guide. One private address will still need to be created and a very small amount of ZEN sent to it to give the private address a balance. The ZEN will need to be sent from another private address. This is a workaround until a new version of the Nodetracker is published.</p>



 System Changes 



 
 An updated version of the Nodetracker software that removes the check for private addresses will be available for new nodes once testing is complete. 



 An updated version of the tracking server software that disables challenges (instead of just suspending) will be rolled out once testing is complete. 
 



<p>After the system changes have been implemented, Node Operators are free to start withdrawing funds previously required for challenges from their shielded addresses to transparent addresses.</p>

  Partnering with PartyKit: Everything is Better with Friends  <p>Sunil and his team are turning lonely online tasks into collaborative multiplayer experiences.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky	 



Published September 26, 2023
  



Team PartyKit: CXO Sylwia Vargas, Founder Sunil Pai and CTO Jani Eväkallio.



 
<p>I am a student of antiquity. At age 10, while many of my peers in the tech industry were learning how to code, I was buried somewhere between the sixth and fifth centuries BC, learning Latin and ancient Greek. (To this day I have some highly marketable skills—like reciting Virgil in the original.) One lesson that stuck with me from those studies is something Aristotle said many centuries ago: that we humans are “social animals.” As markets and technologies have come and gone, this part of our nature has been slow to change; <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/this-study-of-300000-people-reveals-1-secret-to-living-a-longer-healthier-life.html">dozens of studies</a> on health and longevity show that no matter what we do in life, it is better with friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By that measure, the Internet is not an ideal environment for us—because our digital experiences are so often lonely. We spend 8-10 hrs a day in front of our screens largely alone. Collaborative editing in Google Docs, collaborative design in Figma, and multiplayer video games are the rare exceptions that give us a taste of what the good life on the internet could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The view that all business apps require multiplayer collaboration is not necessarily universally held. The skeptic might ask how many Google Docs and Figmas there can be, i.e., how many apps truly require real-time, multiplayer collaboration?</p>



<p>Such skepticism is a failure of imagination, anchored in how things have been rather than how things can be. The fact is very few business processes are truly single-player; even something as mundane as expense reports requires collaboration, as does every other workflow that involves approvals. But these naturally multiplayer experiences have been artificially constrained into sequential, asynchronous workflows that can take weeks to complete.</p>



<p>Imagine instead you could just tag your manager or colleague in finance—or your friendly AI-driven finance copilot—to review your expense report, and they could flag anything that needs fixing on the spot. Historically, creating that kind of collaborative experience required a lot of hard work and technical sophistication. The likes of Google could do it, but your average SaaS startup could not. And while some new technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> libraries have been inching us closer to multiplayer experiences, they still require a lot of technology integration and many hours of engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.partykit.io/">PartyKit</a>, a developer-friendly platform for real-time human-to-human and human-to-AI collaboration. PartyKit does the heavy lifting for you, enabling multiplayer experiences with a few lines of Javascript code. It is easy to customize; it includes all the analytics, and other tools you need to build production apps; and because it is open source, it can run on your organization’s own infrastructure—or even your own laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first met PartyKit founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunil-pai-a47732253/">Sunil Pai</a> earlier this year, we fell in love with his velocity and can-do attitude. Case in point is the way he got hired at Cloudflare: after he complained on X (formerly known as Twitter) about certain aspects of the developer experience, they invited him to join the team and fix it—which he did. During <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sequoia-arc/">Sequoia Arc</a>, we got to know Sunil very well, and were impressed with his contagious enthusiasm for his creation; he was quick to show anyone who was interested a demo on his phone. As they say, ABC—always be closing!</p>



<p>During the beta period, we were also impressed with the diversity of applications users found for PartyKit, from a <a href="https://www.tldraw.com/">drawing app</a> to a <a href="http://v/">state machine</a> to an <a href="https://sitegpt.ai/">LLM-based customer service agent</a>. And those are just small hints of what’s to come; as we celebrate the general availability of the platform, we will no doubt be surprised in the weeks and months ahead by the multitude of use cases PartyKit enables! We are proud to support Sunil and his team as they continue to grow, and we look forward to the better, less lonely internet we’ll all enjoy as they work to make collaborative multiplayer experiences the norm.</p>

 📖 Deep dive: How Machiavellian principles could help fix decentralized governance <p>Miles Jennings</p><p>Whatever you make of Renaissance-era Italian philosopher and political operator Niccolo Machiavelli (who inspired the word “Machiavellian” for better or worse), many of the principles he explored in his writings remain relevant today. For instance, we can see echoes of such principles -- on leadership and the preservation of political liberty -- in both the Federalist Papers and design of the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>But several Machiavellian principles can also be applied to fix decentralized governance, particularly issues with DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) in web3. How? Because Machiavelli’s philosophy during that time was developed with a very pragmatic understanding of the struggle for social power, as well as the premise that no mechanism exists to guarantee virtuous actions.&nbsp;And while most DAOs have developed, as a first step, simplified models of governance based on direct democracy, indirect democracy, and corporate governance -- these approaches have failed to overcome the complex sociopolitical realities involved in decentralized governance. </p><p>So in this set of articles, Jennings examines issues facing DAOs today; and outlines current solutions such as subDAOs, delegate programs, governance minimization, and others, as well as their limitations. Jennings then shares how 4 Machiavellian principles can help design more effective DAOs and better decentralized governance, including minimizing governance and checking-and-balancing the leadership class.</p><p>read more on Machiavelli for DAOs:<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-principles-dao-decentralized-governance/">Principles for Fixing Decentralized Governance</a> (part 1)<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-daos-designing-effective-decentralized-governance/">Designing Effective Decentralized Governance</a> (part 2)</p><p>share on: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1705276359831060654?s=20">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x22ba35">Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7111042659175059456">LinkedIn</a><br><br>see also: </p>  <p>“a16z suggests Machiavelli to fix decentralized governance”, by Ana Paula Pereira in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/a16z-machiavelli-fix-decentralized-governance">Cointelegraph</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Lightspeed Democracy: What web3 organizations can learn from the history of governance”, by Andrew Hall and Porter Smith on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/lightspeed-democracy-what-web3-organizations-can-learn-from-the-history-of-governance/">a16zcrypto.com</a></p>   🇬🇧 Announcing: Crypto Startup School goes to London <p>Jason Rosenthal&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-startup-school/">Crypto Startup School</a> (CSS) is our popular accelerator program for early-stage companies, providing expert guidance, capital, and resources tailored for crypto founders.

<p>Protecting users from total transparency is crucial for addressing one of the main hurdles facing DeFi adoption: data privacy.</p><p>In a system where blockchain transparency can be maliciously exploited, alpha decay and surveillance are inevitable, making the current state of decentralized finance incompatible with traditional services. As such, addressing our networks’ inherent concerns can only be done with robust controls and proactive strategies in place to prevent the misuse of decentralized tools.</p><p>To this end, and in an ecosystem milestone, <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> and its DAO are debuting a suite of zero-knowledge compliance solutions. This initial release integrates <a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi</a>'s services to create a path to compliance and data privacy in DeFi. </p> Panther Protocol’s approach to compliance <p>Panther Protocol’s goal is to create a cross-chain architecture that enables seamless access to DeFi while preserving the privacy of users’ data and activity. The protocol leverages the security and liquidity of existing networks while integrating zero-knowledge technology for users to have full control over their data. The protocol’s v1 also integrates these features into a solution that DeFi enthusiasts can use to access their favorite protocols.</p><p>In a first-of-its-kind approach that complements its decentralized structure, Panther introduces an innovative method to manage compliance risks. Panther integrates third-party<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/"> compliance providers</a>, operating autonomously from the protocol, to authenticate users, offering them a unique set of credentials after users complete a series of verifications. These credentials then serve the dual purposes of:</p>  Crafting zero-knowledge proofs directly within their browsers.  Seamlessly integrating with blockchain-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIDs </a>and similar platforms.  <p>Due to the flexibility of this design, Panther users can access the protocol without being bound to a single compliance provider, being able to choose from a variety of them. Once verified, users can then present these credentials as an irrefutable attestation to their authenticity, granting them unhindered access to the protocol. As a result, Panther can retain its neutrality while giving users a path to complying with regulations.</p> Integrating PureFi<br> <p>In the process of selecting a compliance vendor suitable for Panther’s compliance flow and willing to support the proposed architecture, the Panther DAO elected PureFi.</p><p>PureFi has gained recognition in the Web3 space by pioneering the use of technologies such as decentralized verifiable credentials. The protocol’s goal is to become a one-stop decentralized compliance solution that onboards institutional money to DeFi. PureFi also actively participated in the Panther DAO’s discussions surrounding compliance integrations.</p><p>For Panther’s v1 release, the integration will fulfill the following functions (with all zero-knowledge capabilities built by the Panther team and PureFi in charge of compliance procedures):</p>  Capturing users’ data (email, name, birth date, and nationality) upon their first attempt to access the protocol.  Issuing a signed zk-friendly attestation of the user sharing their data, tied to the user’s wallet (which the user can use as a “Master” account to identify themselves).  Running KYT checks (aka “wallet screening”) to analyze AML/CTF risks of a deposit/withdrawal, both on the receiver’s and sender’s end, and issuing zk-friendly KYT attestations upon passing.  Maintaining an on-chain list of valid cryptographic keys (i.e., certificates) of compliance providers, including the EdDSA public key available on Polygon.  Escrowing the compliance provider’s backup keys with a reliable 3rd party, e.g., a law firm, to be used in case PureFi goes offline.  <p>Importantly, the integration is designed to be compatible with any compliance provider or multiple of them simultaneously.</p> In Summary <p>Zero-knowledge, decentralized compliance, and self-sovereign identity solutions create a technology stack that, for the first time ever, opens a seamless path to compliance while protecting users’ privacy. Panther and PureFi are proud to announce a collaboration that will set the foundation for greater adoption of these solutions and Decentralized Finance as a whole.</p><p>Panther’s <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">compliance integrations</a> can already be tested by ZK technology and DeFi enthusiasts at <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s Testnet Stage 1</a>, released earlier this month. To test, read <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">Panther’s official Stage 1 announcement</a>. Testers can go through the verification flow, create Panther Accounts, and get an exclusive look at Panther's v1!</p> About PureFi Protocol <p>PureFi Protocol allows dApps to fully comply with local and global regulations while preserving decentralization and user anonymity.</p><p>Developed by AMLBot in partnership with Hacken Foundation to provide a full-cycle solution for crypto asset analytics and AML/KYC procedures for the Web3 infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> |<a href="https://dashboard.purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Dashboard</a> |<a href="https://wp.purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Whitepaper</a> |<a href="https://t.me/purefiprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> TG Chat</a> |<a href="https://t.me/purefipro?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> TG ANN</a> |<a href="https://medium.com/purefi?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Medium</a> |<a href="https://twitter.com/Purefi_Protocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Twitter</a></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>On stage at Messari Mainnet today in New York, Brave, Electric Coin Co. (ECC), and Filecoin Foundation announced that they are teaming up to bring innovative new privacy features to the Brave browser and its integrated Web3 wallet.</p>

 Private transactions for all&nbsp; 
<p>With support from ECC, Brave will integrate the Zcash protocol in the browser’s built-in crypto wallet so users can securely store, send, and receive ZEC alongside other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The integration underscores Brave’s commitment to blending privacy, transparency, and user choice. With private transactions possible alongside public ones, users will have greater control over their Web3 activity.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m excited about integrating Zcash into the Brave web browser because privacy should be normal. The Brave browser is a tool that tens of millions of people are using for everyday communication, web browsing, shopping, and other activities. This gives them access to money that respects their security and consent. I’m thrilled for this launch — and what’s to come — as a result of this partnership with Brave and Filecoin Foundation.”</p>
<p>— Zooko Wilcox, CEO, Electric Coin Co.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This partnership with like-minded organizations reinforces Brave’s mission for a more private and user-first Web. Not only do we hope to make it simple to use ZEC for private transactions, but we also aim to maximize privacy during key moments of purchase or exchange.”</p>
<p>— Yan Zhu, CISO, Brave</p>
</blockquote>

 A private and decentralized messaging feature 
<p>Brave, ECC, and Filecoin Foundation also teased plans on stage to develop a new, privacy-based feature in the Brave browser that will offer private messages and media transmission via the Zcash protocol. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) – the technology underlying the Filecoin protocol – will play a crucial role in providing secure storage for the encrypted content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re thrilled to be a part of this important project. We believe cryptocurrency can be the foundation for a better Internet — an alternative to big tech that puts people in control of their own data, protects user privacy and security, and permanently preserves humanity’s most important information.”</p>
<p>— Marta Belcher, President, Filecoin Foundation</p>
</blockquote>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>Brave</p>
<p>Brave Software’s fast, privacy-oriented browser, combined with its blockchain-based digital advertising platform, is reinventing the Web for users, publishers, and advertisers. Users can opt into privacy-respecting ads that reward them with the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a frequent flyer-like token they can redeem or use to tip or contribute to publishers and other content creators. Brave is a driving force leading the way for Web3 adoption, directly supporting Web3 into the broader Web through its privacy browser, independent search engine, and browser-native, multi-chain crypto wallet. Brave currently has over 60 million monthly active users and 1.8 million Creators. Learn more at <a>brave.com</a>.</p>

 <blockquote>Different approaches to private asset velocity in light of the Privacy Pools paper.</blockquote> <br>Introduction <p>Public blockchains inherently champion transparency. The cornerstone of this architecture allows anyone to validate transactions without dependence on centralized intermediaries. This transparency, while advantageous in many respects, also accentuates the pressing need for privacy, especially given the escalating prominence of platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum, their DeFi applications, and adoption by institutions.<br><br>The industry has various challenges to solve to deliver privacy-enhancing protocols: transaction linkability, network privacy, and private key management are some. There have been commendable strides in these areas, such as the development of Layer-1 blockchains like <a href="https://z.cash/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zcash</a>, which offers private transactions, and smart contract solutions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Cash?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Tornado Cash</a>, which breaks the transaction link between deposit and withdrawal addresses on Ethereum. Due to their permissionless nature and approach, these systems are currently not designed for risk management. Notably, Tornado Cash was rampantly used for cybercrime money laundering activities. According to Buterin: “Tornado Cash has also been used by various bad actors. Deposit data suggests that hacker groups have moved funds from illicit sources through the protocol.” (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Buterin et al.</a>, page 1). While Tornado Cash had its pitfalls, notably its usage by malicious actors (causing the protocol to get internationally sanctioned), the root cause of such vulnerabilities isn't necessarily technological but rather structural and was meant to be exploited.<br>At its core, the true sentiment we need to grapple with is this: compliance, while ensuring standardized behavior and safeguarding user interests, undeniably carries a cost – both financial and in terms of user accessibility. There's an exclusionary element to compliance, where stringent checks can sometimes inadvertently alienate non-malicious users. Furthermore, the absence of clear regulatory frameworks around decentralization and DAOs has ushered in shades of ambiguity. This uncertain environment is ripe for exploitation.</p><p>Historically, many actors in the space prioritized rapid growth over diligent compliance, often underestimating or even ignoring the long-term repercussions of such a strategy. Their motivations were straightforward – to reduce immediate costs and accelerate expansion. But such a strategy is inherently flawed. With today's well-informed user base demanding greater clarity and accountability, the repercussions of neglecting compliance have grown exponentially in magnitude. Simply put, compromising compliance for short-term gains threatens the longevity and credibility of any decentralized system.</p><p>It's essential to differentiate between ideologic and economic motives. While the decentralized movement was born from a <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">desire for autonomy and freedom from permissionless surveillance</a>, its sustained growth and mainstream adoption are undeniably tethered to economic incentives. In this case, ideology isn't the dominant force; it's the potential for economic upside. Similarly, while security concerns are paramount, they represent a distinct set of challenges, separate from those posed by compliance.</p><p>Thus, as we critique systems like Tornado Cash, it's imperative to understand that their vulnerabilities aren't just a result of technology but are deeply intertwined with larger strategic challenges and a blind eye toward solving compliant access.<br><br><a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a>, however, envisions a refined balance. Our goal is to augment data privacy on public blockchains while introducing a flexible approach to compliance, making it accessible to a diverse user base, from individuals to institutional giants.<br></p> Panther’s overall approach <p>Panther Protocol refines and extends the Shielded Pool concept and has developed advanced <a href="https://research.metastate.dev/multi-asset_shielded_pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Multi-Asset Shielded Pools</a> to include compliance features enabled by zero-knowledge proofs.</p>  Users can deposit into a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-shielded-pools-the-cornerstone-of-panther-protocol/">Multi-Asset Shielded Pool</a> (or simply Shielded Pool) only after <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">presenting a ZK proof of their verified status</a>, an action that's verifiable on-chain.  Transactional activities like deposits or withdrawals necessitate a ZK proof to vouch for the purity of the associated wallet address.  Upon providing the necessary proofs, users activate a zero-knowledge <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/panther-accounts?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Account</a> (or zAccount), which serves as a unique user identity record, tethering all their transactions.  Situations like regulatory scrutiny may necessitate users to reaffirm their credentials, leading to zAccount reactivation.  All interactions with the protocol are strictly based on zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring minimal data exposure on-chain.  With the zAccount system, all transactions from the same user are interconnected, and a ZK proof can be generated to showcase the volume or assets dealt with, offering a possible avenue for regulatory review.  <p>In a pioneering approach that seamlessly complements the decentralized structure we've discussed, Panther introduces an innovative method to manage compliance risks. At the heart of this strategy is the inclusion of a<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/"> compliance provider</a>, operating autonomously from the Protocol. This provider's principal role is to authenticate users, offering them a unique set of credentials after a series of verifications. These credentials then serve a dual purpose:</p><p>First, they enable users to craft zero-knowledge proofs directly within their browsers—a testament to the strategy's user-centric design. Second, in line with the modern digital identity landscape, these credentials can be seamlessly integrated with blockchain-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIDs </a>and similar platforms. Panther's vision extends even further. In a move that underscores flexibility and choice, users aren't bound to a single compliance provider. They can seek verification from any compliance provider of their choice. Once verified, users can then present these credentials as an irrefutable attestation to their authenticity, granting them unhindered access to the protocol. This strategic integration ensures multilevel compliance and amplifies user trust, forging a pathway to a more secure decentralized future.</p> <br>The Solution for the problems presented in the Privacy Pools paper. <p>In a quest to strike the right balance between privacy and compliance in decentralized finance, Panther unveils a revolutionary approach that aspires to solve the same set of issues as presented in the paper titled “Blockchain Privacy and Regulatory Compliance: Towards a Practical Equilibrium”, also known as the “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Privacy Pools” research paper</a>, by thought leaders such as <a href="http://vitalik.ca/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Vitalik Buterin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ameen Soleimani</a>. As highlighted in their work, "Privacy Pools-like systems allow users to achieve more privacy around their financial transaction histories and activity while retaining the ability to prove their disassociation with known illicit activity. We expect that honest users will be incentivized to participate in such a scheme by a combination of two factors: (i) the desire for privacy, and (ii) the desire to avoid suspicion.” (p.8)</p><p>Central to the Privacy Pools model is a foundational idea: "Instead of merely zero-knowledge-proving that their withdrawal is linked to some previously-made deposit, a user proves membership in a more restrictive association set." (p.4) However, Panther diverges here, adopting a more tailored approach suited for real-world applicability. Panther operates on the positive constraint that all deposits emanate from verified users with authenticated wallets. This eradicates the need for additional proof during fund withdrawals.</p><p>Users can:</p>  Attest ownership of the originating Account for their deposits.  Showcase credentials affirming the withdrawal to an address in good standing, either owned by them or a validated Account holder within Panther.  When directing withdrawals <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">to other DeFi protocols</a> or centralized exchanges, they can offer proof of 'source of funds', which is verifiable by the receiving party.  <p>Another aspect highlighted in the Privacy Pools paper is the inventive adaptation of the Tornado cash UTXO model. However, one of the challenges presented is the maintenance of reliable and upright Associate Set Providers within a decentralised framework. These systems employ third-party entities known as ASPs to establish association sets. While the association data resides off-chain, its Merkle proof is recorded on-chain, ensuring ASPs maintain data integrity. ASPs might encompass compliance providers or even wallet screening oracle services.</p><p>The Privacy Pools paper underscores the necessity of expansive association sets to attain the desired privacy level and to lure good depositors, distancing them from malicious actors. Panther's answer to this is the creation of "<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zones</a>". Differently from the association sets of Privacy Pools, Zones are logical divisions within a Shielded Pool, each identified by a unique Zone-ID ingrained in every UTXO commitment. This allows for entities to create and tailor their own Zone, shaping membership criteria, selecting compliance providers, meeting regulatory demands, and even facilitating interactions with other Zone members. Notably, while these Zones provide tailored functionalities, they share the same anonymity set, as they all operate under the unified MASP architecture, reinforcing the strength and integrity of the system.</p><p>For instance, as a Zone Manager, an institution would have the capability to:</p>  Designate which Zones can transact their Zone and vice versa.  Choose a new compliance provider or integrate an existing one tailored for its Zone.  Define KYC renewal durations for Zone members.  Set transactional boundaries, including deposit, withdrawal, and internal transfer limits.  <p>The advent of "Zones" thus arms regulated entities and institutions with a formidable toolset, enabling them to seamlessly conduct privacy-preserving on-chain transactions and interact with protocols, welcoming a broader spectrum of participants into the world of DeFi. This agility comes out of Panther’s UTXO design and is instrumental in tapping into new opportunities and maximizing the potential of decentralized finance.<br></p> Panther Protocol &amp; the advanced UTXO model <p>Before the broader public became acquainted with the intricacies of the Privacy Pools paper, which mentions, "The simplified, privacy-preserving coin systems above only support coin transfers in the same denomination. Zcash supports arbitrary denominations through its use of a UTXO model," (p.6) Panther Protocol was already ahead of the curve. Panther crafted a pioneering system that not only facilitated transactions in diverse denominations, but also tackled real-world challenges to amplify on-chain transactional privacy. Additionally, Panther's advanced Shielded Pools are designed to support a wide range of assets, including:</p>  <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-20</a>: The standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum, allowing for a consistent interface across multiple token contracts.  <a href="https://ethereum.org/nl/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-721</a>: A standard for representing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be used to represent ownership over unique items or pieces of content.  <a href="https://ethereum.org/nl/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-1155</a>: A more generalized standard that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens, enabling the creation of multiple token types within a single contract.  <p>With these integrations, Panther Protocol not only serves as a privacy shield for traditional tokens, but also for the blossoming world of NFTs, showcasing its versatility and forward-thinking approach.</p><p>Let’s dig a little deeper into Panther User Accounts and how they enable Compliance:</p><p>1. User Account UTXOs ( or zAccounts): At the heart of Panther's approach lies the concept of the "User Account UTXO" — a distinctive type of UTXO nestled within the broader UTXO Merkle Tree. This can be imagined as a dynamic address book or user registry that can be activated based on several criteria, such as:</p>  Association with a social network account.  Linkage to an Ethereum address.  Ties to a user’s KYC records.  <p>2. Activation and Non-Interactive Transfers: Upon Account activation, the user account registry establishes a link between the public root spending key, public reading key, and a "public" Ethereum address associated with the user. This elegant arrangement enables non-interactive transfers within the Shielded Pool, eliminating the need for the sender to fetch the receiver’s pubkeys.</p><p>3. Accounts and their utility: The fields encapsulated within the zAccount UTXO pave the way for a myriad of functionalities. For instance:</p>  The "Nonce" serves as a transaction counter for user accounts, helping in linking and ordering transactions under the same Account.  Parameters such as "Order" and "Quantity" further enhance transactional clarity.  This feature might also be employed for disclosures to provide proof of completeness.  <p>4. Expiry Time &amp; Renewal Mechanisms: Recognizing the absence of a foolproof exclusion proof, Panther has instituted an "Expiry Time"mechanism, which mandates periodic renewals of user accounts. Potential renewal methodologies could range from:</p>  Aligning with KYC renewals.  Adopting a permissionless approach.  Re-verification of humanity.  Using a zk-proof to validate the total volume of transactions remaining under specified limits.  <p>Panther Protocol's nuanced use of the UTXO model paints a future where transactions are not only private but also flexibly aligned with the intricate demands of the world of DeFi.</p> <br>Navigating the DeFi space with Panther Protocol <p>Panther's architecture, with its foundational pillars of privacy, is crowned with a structure for on-chain compliance. Yet, one might wonder –what avenues are available to Panther users to leverage the augmented privacy derived from their Panther-based transactions?</p><p>This is precisely where Panther distinguishes itself from conventional privacy paradigms:</p><p>1. Seamless integration with premier DeFi protocols<br>Panther has engineered private adaptors in collaboration with eminent DeFi protocols such as <a href="https://uniswap.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap </a>and <a href="https://www.curve.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve</a>. This enables users to execute  ‘one-click’ swaps, instantly privatizing and verifying the transaction from a regulatory standpoint.</p><p>2. Diverse platform Adaptors<br>Our vision goes beyond mere swaps. We anticipate adaptors that <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zswap-and-defi-adaptors-unlocking-private-defi-usage/">bridge Panther with an eclectic range of platforms</a>, spanning from NFT marketplaces to lending hubs and beyond.</p><p>3. zTrade: Panther’s Dark Pool<br>Panther includes an innovative solution for confidential and compliant dark pool transactions. With <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ztrade-otc-trading?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zTrade</a>, users can preserve their trading strategies, mitigate counterparty risks, and effortlessly execute voluminous trades at pre-negotiated rates, all within the Shielded Pool.<br></p> Conclusion <p>In the ever-evolving world of decentralized technology, the quest for innovation remains perpetual. As the landscape gravitates towards establishing fully permissionless and decentralized privacy solutions, the challenge is ensuring these platforms don't inadvertently provide refuge to malicious actors. Panther recognizes this dilemma and has meticulously worked to strike a balance. By weaving in compliance features, we ensure a blend of unwavering privacy without compromising the ethos of decentralization.</p><p>An essential distinction to note is that while Panther's system might appear to have rules-based access on the surface, it operates within a decentralized framework. No centralized entity dictates or establishes the rules. Instead, the rules of compliance, tiers, and other requirements are orchestrated by the Panther DAO or by the institutional entities that will own and oversee the Zones. This approach signifies a pioneering stride in the blockchain world, merging decentralized ethos and structured compliance advantages.</p><p>Moreover, as government-issued identities gain traction in various developing nations and blockchain-based DIDs persist, the symbiosis with Panther becomes increasingly potent. We are confident that such integrations will pave the way for scalable, secure, and trustful access methods, aligning with the vision of a more inclusive and transparent decentralized world.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p><p></p>

      Generative AI’s Act Two         
	By Sonya Huang, Pat Grady, and GPT-4	 



Animation: James Buckhouse, Midjourney and Runway



Published September 20, 2023
        One year ago, we published a hypothesis that generative AI would become a profound platform shift in technology. Then came the firestorm.      



 
<p>Scientists, historians and economists have long studied the optimal conditions that create a Cambrian explosion of innovation. In generative AI, we have reached a modern marvel, our generation’s space race.</p>



<p>This moment has been decades in the making. Six decades of Moore’s Law have given us the compute horsepower to process exaflops of data. Four decades of the internet (accelerated by COVID) have given us trillions of tokens’ worth of training data. Two decades of mobile and cloud computing have given every human a supercomputer in the palm of our hands. In other words, decades of technological progress have accumulated to create the necessary conditions for generative AI to take flight.</p>



<p>ChatGPT’s rise was the spark that lit the fuse, unleashing a density and fervor of innovation that we have not seen in years—perhaps since the early days of the internet. The breathless excitement was especially visceral in “Cerebral Valley,” where AI researchers reached rockstar status and hacker houses were filled to the brim each weekend with new autonomous agents and companionship chatbots. AI researchers transformed from the proverbial “hacker in the garage” to special forces units commanding billions of dollars of compute. The arXiv printing press has become so prolific that researchers have jokingly called for a pause on new publications so they can catch up.</p>



<p>But quickly, AI excitement turned to borderline hysteria. Suddenly, every company was an “AI copilot.” Our inboxes got filled up with undifferentiated pitches for “AI Salesforce” and “AI Adobe” and “AI Instagram.” The $100M pre-product seed round returned. We found ourselves in an unsustainable feeding frenzy of fundraising, talent wars and GPU procurement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And sure enough, the cracks started to show. Artists and writers and singers challenged the legitimacy of machine-generated IP. Debates over ethics, regulation and looming superintelligence consumed Washington. And perhaps most worryingly, a whisper began to spread within Silicon Valley that generative AI was not actually useful. The products were falling far short of expectations, as evidenced by terrible user retention. End user demand began to plateau for many applications. Was this just another vaporware cycle?</p>



<p>The AI summer of discontent has sent critics gleefully grave dancing, reminiscent of the early days of the internet, where in 1998 one famous economist declared “By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”</p>



<p>Make no mistake—despite the noise and the hysteria and the air of uncertainty and discontent,&nbsp; generative AI has already had a more successful start than SaaS, with &gt;$1 billion in revenue from startups alone (it took the SaaS market years, not months, to reach the same scale). Some applications have become household names: ChatGPT became the fastest-growing application with particularly strong product-market fit among students and developers; Midjourney became our collective creative muse and was reported to have reached hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue with a team of just eleven; and Character popularized AI entertainment and companionship and created the consumer “social” application we craved the most—with users spending two hours on average in-app.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, these early signs of success don’t change the reality that a lot of AI companies simply do not have product-market fit or a sustainable competitive advantage, and that the overall ebullience of the AI ecosystem is unsustainable.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has settled for a bit, we thought it would be an opportune moment to zoom out and reflect on generative AI—where we find ourselves today, and where we’re possibly headed.&nbsp;</p>



 Towards Act Two 



<p>Generative AI’s first year out the gate—“Act 1”—came from the technology-out. We discovered a new “hammer”—foundation models—and unleashed a wave of novelty apps that were lightweight demonstrations of cool new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We now believe the market is entering “Act 2”—which will be from the customer-back. Act 2 will solve human problems end-to-end. These applications are different in nature than the first apps out of the gate. They tend to use foundation models as a piece of a more comprehensive solution rather than the entire solution. They introduce new editing interfaces, making the workflows stickier and the outputs better. They are often multi-modal.</p>



<p>The market is already beginning to transition from “Act 1” to “Act 2.” Examples of companies entering “Act 2” include <a href="http://harvey.ai">Harvey</a>, which is building custom LLMs for elite law firms; <a href="http://glean.com">Glean</a>, which is crawling and indexing our workspaces to make Generative AI more relevant at work; and <a href="http://character.ai">Character</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ava-your-digital-friend/id6446257579">Ava</a>, which are creating digital companions.&nbsp;</p>



 Market Map 



<p>Our updated generative AI market map is below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike last year’s map, we have chosen to organize this map by use case rather than by model modality. This reflects two important thrusts in the market: Generative AI’s evolution from technology hammer to actual use cases and value, and the increasingly multimodal nature of generative AI applications.</p>
 







 
<p>In addition, we have included a new LLM developer stack that reflects the compute and tooling vendors that companies are turning to as they build generative AI applications in production.</p>
 







 
 Revisiting Our Thesis 



<p>Our original <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">essay</a> laid out a thesis for the generative AI market opportunity and a hypothesis for how the market would unfold. How did we do?</p>



<p>Here’s what we got wrong:</p>



 
 Things happened quickly. Last year, we anticipated it would be nearly a decade before we had intern-level code generation, Hollywood-quality videos or human quality speech that didn’t sound mechanical. But a quick listen to Eleven Labs’ voices on TikTok or Runway’s AI film festival makes it clear that the future has arrived at warp speed. Even 3D models, gaming and music are becoming good, quickly.&nbsp; 



 The bottleneck is on the supply side. We did not anticipate the extent to which end user demand would outstrip GPU supply. The bottleneck to many companies’ growth quickly became not customer demand but access to the latest GPUs from Nvidia. Long wait times became the norm, and a simple business model emerged: pay a subscription fee to skip the line and access better models.&nbsp; 



 Vertical separation hasn’t happened yet. We still believe that there will be a separation between the “application layer” companies and foundation model providers, with model companies specializing in scale and research and application layer companies specializing in product and UI. In reality, that separation hasn’t cleanly happened yet. In fact, the most successful user-facing applications out of the gate have been vertically integrated. 



 Cutthroat competitive environment and swiftness of the incumbent response. Last year, there were a few overcrowded categories of the competitive landscape (notably image generation and copywriting), but by and large the market was whitespace. Today, many corners of the competitive landscape have more competition than opportunity. The swiftness of the incumbent response, from Google’s Duet and Bard to Adobe’s Firefly—and the willingness of incumbents to finally go “risk on”—has magnified the competitive heat. Even in the foundation model layer, we are seeing customers set up their infrastructure to be agnostic between different vendors.&nbsp; 



 The moats are in the customers, not the data. We predicted that the best generative AI companies could generate a sustainable competitive advantage through a data flywheel: more usage → more data → better model → more usage. While this is still somewhat true, especially in domains with very specialized and hard-to-get data, the “data moats” are on shaky ground: the data that application companies generate does not create an insurmountable moat, and the next generations of foundation models may very well obliterate any data moats that startups generate. Rather, workflows and user networks seem to be creating more durable sources of competitive advantage. 
 



<p>Here’s what we got right:</p>



 
 Generative AI is a thing. Suddenly, every developer was working on a generative AI application and every enterprise buyer was demanding it. The market even kept the “generative AI” moniker. Talent flowed into the market, as did venture capital dollars. Generative AI even became a pop culture phenomenon in viral videos like “Harry Potter Balenciaga” or the Drake imitation song “Heart on My Sleeve” by Ghostwriter which has become a chart-topping hit. 



 The first killer apps emerged. It’s been well documented that ChatGPT was the fastest application to reach 100M MAU—and it did so organically in just 6 weeks. By contrast, Instagram took 2.5 years, WhatsApp took 3.5 years, and YouTube and Facebook took 4 years to reach that level of user demand. But ChatGPT is not an isolated phenomenon. The depth of engagement of Character AI (2 hour average session time), the productivity benefits of Github Copilot (55% more efficient), and the monetization path of Midjourney (hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue) all suggest that the first cohort of killer apps has arrived. 



 Developers are the key. One of the core insights of developer-first companies like Stripe or Unity has been that developer access opens up use cases you could not even imagine. In the last several quarters, we have been pitched everything from music generation communities to AI matchmakers to AI customer support agents. 



 The form factor is evolving. The first versions of AI applications have largely been autocomplete and first drafts, but these form factors are now growing in complexity. Midjourney’s introduction of camera panning and infilling is a nice illustration of how the generative AI-first user experience has grown richer. Across the board, form factors are evolving from individual to system-level productivity and from human-in-the-loop to execution-oriented agentic systems. 



 Copyright and ethics and existential dread. The debate has roared on these hot-button topics. Artists and writers and musicians are split, with some creators rightfully outraged that others are profiting off derivative work, and some creators embracing the new AI reality (Grimes’ profit-sharing proposition and James Buckhouse’s optimism about becoming part of the <a href="https://buckhouse.medium.com/augmented-imagination-a3f4519f9784">creative genome</a> come to mind). No startup wants to be the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90942310/ai-napster-who-going-to-own-it-next">Napster or Limewire to the eventual Spotify</a> (h/t Jason Boehmig). The rules are opaque: Japan has declared that content used to train AI has no IP rights, while Europe has proposed heavy-handed regulation.&nbsp; 
 



 Where do we stand now? Generative AI’s Value Problem 



<p>Generative AI is not lacking in use cases or customer demand. Users crave AI that makes their jobs easier and their work products better, which is why they have flocked to applications in record-setting droves (in spite of a lack of natural distribution).&nbsp;</p>







<p>But do people stick around? Not really. The below chart compares the month 1 mobile app retention of AI-first applications to existing companies.&nbsp;</p>







<p>User engagement is also lackluster. Some of the best consumer companies have 60-65% DAU/MAU; WhatsApp’s is 85%. By contrast, generative AI apps have a median of 14% (with the notable exception of Character and the “AI companionship” category). This means that users are not finding enough value in Generative AI products to use them every day yet.</p>







<p>In short, generative AI’s biggest problem is not finding use cases or demand or distribution, it is proving value. As our colleague David Cahn writes, “the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/">$200B question</a> is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?” The path to building enduring businesses will require fixing the retention problem and generating deep enough value for customers that they stick and become daily active users.</p>



<p>Let’s not despair. Generative AI is still in its “awkward teenage years.” There are glimpses of brilliance, and when the products fall short of expectations the failures are often reliable, repeatable and fixable. Our work is cut out for us.&nbsp;</p>



 Act Two: A Shared Playbook 



<p>Founders are embarking on the hard work of prompt engineering, fine tuning and dataset curation to make their AI products *good*. Brick by brick, they are building flashy demos into whole product experiences. And meanwhile, the foundation model substrate continues to brim with research and innovation.</p>



<p>A shared playbook is developing as companies figure out the path to enduring value. We now have shared techniques to make models useful, as well as emerging UI paradigms that will shape generative AI’s second act.</p>



<p>The Model Development Stack</p>



 
 Emerging reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought and reflexion are improving models’ ability to perform richer, more complex reasoning tasks, closing the gap between customer expectations and model capabilities. Developers are using frameworks like <a href="http://langchain.com">Langchain</a> to invoke and debug more complex multi-chain sequences. 



 Transfer learning techniques like RLHF and fine-tuning are becoming more accessible, especially with the recent availability of fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 and Llama-2, which means that companies can adapt foundation models to their specific domains and improve from user feedback. Developers are downloading open-source models from <a href="http://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</a> and fine-tuning them to achieve <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/blog/fine-tuning-llms-lora-or-full-parameter-an-in-depth-analysis-with-llama-2">quality</a> performance. 



 Retrieval-augmented generation is bringing in context about the business or the user, reducing hallucinations and increasing truthfulness and usefulness. Vector databases from companies like <a href="http://pinecone.io">Pinecone</a> have become the infrastructure backbone for RAG. 



 New developer tools and application frameworks are giving companies reusable building blocks to create more advanced AI applications and helping developers evaluate, improve and monitor the performance of AI models in production, including LLMOps tools like <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">Langsmith</a> and <a href="http://wandb.ai">Weights &amp; Biases</a>&nbsp; 



 AI-first infrastructure companies like <a href="https://www.coreweave.com/">Coreweave</a>, <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/">Lambda Labs</a>, <a href="https://mlfoundry.com/">Foundry</a>, <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a> and <a href="https://modal.com/">Modal</a> are unbundling the public clouds and providing what AI companies need most: plentiful GPUs at a reasonable cost, available on-demand and highly scalable, with a nice PaaS developer experience. 
 



<p>Together, these techniques should close the expectations vs reality gap for models as the underlying foundation models simultaneously improve. But making the models great is only half the battle. The playbook for a generative AI-first user experience is evolving as well:</p>



<p>Emerging Product Blueprints</p>



 
 Generative interfaces. A text-based conversational user experience is the default interface on top of an LLM. Gradually, newer form factors are entering the arsenal, from Perplexity’s <a href="https://twitter.com/alexgraveley/status/1659276299091812353">generative user interfaces</a> to new modalities like human-sounding voices from Inflection AI.&nbsp; 



 New editing experiences: from Copilot to Director’s Mode. As we advance from zero-shot to <a href="https://thezbook.com/ask-adjust-the-future-of-productivity-interfaces">ask-and-adjust</a> (h/t Zach Lloyd), generative AI companies are inventing a new set of knobs and switches that look very different from traditional editing workflows. Midjourney’s new panning commands and Runway’s Director’s Mode create new camera-like editing experiences. Eleven Labs is making it possible to manipulate voices through prompting. 



 Increasingly sophisticated agentic systems. Generative AI applications are increasingly not just autocomplete or first drafts for human review; they now have the autonomy to problem-solve, access external tools and solve problems end-to-end on our behalf. We are steadily progressing from level 0 to level 5 autonomy.&nbsp; 



 System-wide optimization. Rather than embed in a single human user’s workflow and make that individual more efficient, some companies are directly tackling the system-wide optimization problem. Can you pick off a chunk of support tickets or pull requests and autonomously solve them, thereby making the whole system more effective? 
 



 Parting Thoughts 



<p>As we approach the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-paradox-perspective/">frontier paradox</a> and as the novelty of transformers and diffusion models dies down, the nature of the generative AI market is evolving. Hype and flash are giving way to real value and whole product experiences.</p>



<p>At Sequoia we remain steadfast believers in generative AI. The necessary conditions for this market to take flight have accumulated over the span of decades, and the market is finally here. The emergence of killer applications and the sheer magnitude of end user demand has deepened our conviction in the market.</p>



<p>However, Amara’s Law—the phenomenon that we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run—is running its course. We are applying patience and judgment in our investment decisions, with careful attention to how founders are solving the value problem. The shared playbook companies are using to push the boundaries on model performance and product experiences gives us optimism on generative AI’s second act.</p>



<p><br>If you are building in the AI market with an eye towards value and whole product experiences, we would love to hear from you. Please email Sonya (<a href="mailto:sonya@sequoiacap.com">sonya@sequoiacap.com</a>) and Pat (<a href="mailto:grady@sequoiacap.com">grady@sequoiacap.com</a>).

  Brave recently released Leo (our native AI assistant) to Nightly users. We have since incorporated a lot of feedback, and made numerous improvements.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In August 2023, Brave released <a>Leo—Brave’s native AI assistant</a>—on its <a>Nightly channel</a>. Since then we’ve incorporated a lot of user feedback, and made numerous improvements to the feature. There are more changes on the way, and soon we will launch Leo on our full release channel, making it available to our 60 million users.</p>
<p>We thought now would be a great time to share more about how Brave is thinking about Leo, and the future AI integrations within the browser.</p>

 Background: Brave as a user agent 
<p>Brave has always been a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent">user agent</a>. A user agent is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_%28computing%29">client</a> application that gives users better control of the content they access on the Internet, without conflicts of interest between server operators – including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_tracking">third parties</a> – and the user. Leo takes this concept one step further, moving beyond the limited stance of browsing content in the way the author or creator intended. With Leo, you’re not passively consuming web pages and videos, rather you’re actively exploring content: asking tangential questions, seeking clarifications, exploring diverse viewpoints, and overall tailoring the Web to your preferences.</p>
<p>Leo “understands” the current page you’re visiting—it’s the next best thing to talking directly with the author. In fact, in many ways it’s better, as Leo can independently analyze and reason about pages, free of the author’s or creator’s biases.</p>
<p>To be clear, Brave isn’t trying to create the world’s leading Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch. Instead, our goal is to link users with top LLMs and harness them in innovative and where feasible, privacy preserving ways. Our goal is to open novel, convenient, and private use cases that are often possible only in the context of a particular user’s browsing session.</p>
<p>As with all Brave products, Leo adheres to Brave’s core values and is built with privacy by design. User inputs are always submitted anonymously through a reverse-proxy to our inference infrastructure, giving users an AI experience with unparalleled privacy. Also, conversations are discarded immediately after the reply is generated and are not persisted on Brave’s servers. As we expand Leo’s development, we will continue to integrate privacy into its features and to innovate with new approaches to give our users the privacy they expect.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 General release channel availability: cost and viability&nbsp; 
<p>The first step to opening <a>this amazing feature</a> to our general release channel is to make sure the cost is viable for Brave to offer to its full user base. With more than 60 million users worldwide, the cost of running Leo as-is on our general release channel would be prohibitive without a paid option. For this reason, we’ll soon be offering a premium version of Leo. Alongside the free version of this feature, the premium version will cover the costs of hosting our premium models, and for paying the API access for other premium model choices.</p>
<p>This next update to Leo will include:</p>
 
 A seamless onboarding experience for the premium upgrade, including the ability to pay for premium access with BAT. 
 The ability to select different models directly in the main Leo interface. 
 The addition of integration points from other parts of the browser into Leo. 
 Access to better models such as Llama 2 70B, and Claude Instant (by Anthropic). 
 
<p>Here’s a table that summarizes the free / premium options:</p>

Inputs are always submitted anonymously through a reverse-proxy and are not retained.



<p>We’re targeting mid to late Q4 for the Leo release.</p>

 Mobile parity 
<p>Mobile parity will most likely follow shortly after the desktop release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of the mobile release will be to make sure everything from the desktop release works on Android and iOS.</p>

 Roadmap 
<p>Major enhancements and features for Leo are described and grouped into categories below. Some of these features will be available with the first release, and others will roll out during each of our browser updates.</p>

 Local persistence of conversations, and full-page interactions 
 
 Ability to store and reference past conversations locally on your device, and continue these conversations at a later date. 
 Ability to sync these conversations across devices using Brave Sync. 
 Full-page interactive UI via a URL like brave://chat (or brave://leo). 
 

 Better answers 
 
 Provide Brave Search results to the model for up-to-date information. 
 Provide <a href="https://community.brave.com/">Brave Q&amp;A</a> and <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us">Brave Support</a> to the model for user questions. 
 Provide Brave News results to the model for help answering user questions. 
 Provide cryptocurrency context to the model for help answering Web3-related questions. 
 Provide a generalized extension framework, or adopt an existing form of extensions such as ChatGPT plugins. 
 

 Richer output 
 
 Image generation as part of Leo’s possible outputs. 
 Ability to highlight text within a page that’s currently being viewed to support Leo’s claims. 
 Ability for Leo to take actions on a user’s behalf (for example, for Leo to start a Web search, change the current page to dark mode, or change a browser setting). 
 Entity highlighting of response text to link to Brave Search (for example, if an output talked about Brave, it may highlight Brave and make it a Brave Search query). 
 

 Model expansions 
 
 Continually add access to the latest-and-greatest models. 
 Expand commercial relationships to offer more model choices for premium users. 
 Larger context sizes. 
 

 Better language support 
<p>Today, if Leo is prompted in another language, it can already answer in that language (such as French and Spanish). However, not all languages are covered, and a page’s context, when used, will likely determine the response language. We’d like to add better handling for languages, and overall to expand the number of languages, and the quality of the output of those languages, by adding better international models.</p>

 Chat interface and customization 
 
 At the time of writing, context for Leo interactions can derive either from the entire page, or it can work with no context at all. In the future, we’d like to make this better via context menus, allowing users to select a specific part of a page to supply the model its interaction context. 
 We’d like to offer access to Leo via omnibox (address bar) suggestions, a new tab card, and more. 
 A CodeLlama integration into developer tools and in the sidebar, with optional injection into the current page context. 
 

 Model personalization and personification 
 
 Customize Leo’s tone and summary styles for personalized interactions. 
 User-defined boundaries, mood, and context awareness. 
 

 Content consumption 
 
 PDF summarization: the ability to interface with not only web pages and videos, but also with PDF documents. 
 Using accessibility and other information available to help models understand web pages better. 
 Image understanding via drag and drop. 
 

 Writing tools 
 
 Tools for filling in editable fields on web pages (such as formatting and generating text). 
 Grammar, spelling, and other suggestions. 
 Content suggestions, and content auto-completion. 
 

 Local model support 
 
 We’d like to offer locally running models, and even allow users to configure their own models. Doing so would open more possibilities for assisting users with their local, private Brave data (for example, making a better suggestion bar or autocomplete suggestions). 
 

 Brave Ads &amp; Brave Rewards integration 
 
 We may offer a privacy-preserving ad-supported option for those users who don’t want to buy a premium subscription, but still want premium features. 
 Thinking beyond display ads, we’d like the model to help users make purchasing decisions, via context such as detailed product information; this could entail an ad catalog and all knowledge about the products behind those ads, but not advertise or give you phony or biased information (for example, if you were trying to buy a TV, Leo could tell you it knows of a less expensive TV, or one that offers features not available in the TV you’re currently asking about). 
 We’d like to investigate how to tie this recommendation engine to Brave Rewards. 
 In these shopping scenarios, the model would always genuinely act first as the user’s agent. For instance, it might respond that a TV you were viewing had a better price elsewhere than in an online ad you may have seen. 
 
<p>With Leo by their side, users can interact with the Web in groundbreaking new ways. The future of Leo outlined in this roadmap is exciting to us. Unlike other AI assistants, Leo is not a simple chat interface. Leo is a companion for helping you make sense of the Web as you browse, while preserving your privacy and helping you stay in charge of your experience.</p>

<p>Summary:&nbsp;Reflections on advancing digital asset regulation in 2023. How can we eliminate roadblocks and engender robust and transparent markets?</p>



<p>Like so many of us who have busy lives and demanding careers, we preciously guard our time for private life and relaxation. For me, having an overabundance of free time between jobs was daunting in its own way. I am sure that many of you, in a period of calm, also tend to want to take stock of your life, read books, clean out your closets, listen to podcasts, and do all the “things” there normally isn’t time for, while paradoxically filling the time we wish to have more of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually I found a balance where I enjoyed the calm and time for positive self-reflection through lots of running and reading. Like many of you, I could not escape thinking about my profession, which frankly, I love. I contemplated how we can build on the solid work already undertaken this year in the nascent regulation of digital assets, through further collaboration and analysis, while eliminating barriers and roadblocks that aren’t helping to engender robust, fair, liquid, open and transparent markets.</p>



<p>Improve&nbsp;</p>



<p><a></a><a>&nbsp;</a>“To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.” -Winston Churchill</p>



<p>In discussing digital assets and the events of the past year, the saying, “don’t throw out the baby with the bath water”, is often used to emphasise the importance of not discarding the positives that DLT has delivered in seeking to improve financial markets through removal of bad practices such as fraud and market manipulation (to name just a couple) and increase participation in the financial system.</p>



<p>This can also be applied to regulation. There is a tendency to think that because there is new technology, the governing policies and regulations must also be completely new, yet this is not always the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Great Financial Crisis of 2007/2008 led to many useful reforms and strong global principles and standards in the (global) financial services sector. These provide a solid foundation that can be modified, improved, and built upon for the regulation of new technologies within financial markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many global standard setting bodies (GSSBs) have already begun to consult on and modify their principles and recommendations to provide guidance for emerging regional frameworks. There are a few foundational pieces of work by the GSSBs that have been set out over the past few years such as FATF policies<a>[1]</a>, FSB recommendations<a>[2]</a>, and IOSCO principles<a>[3]</a> aiming to improve their existing guidance and requirements and mitigate any unintended gaps.</p>



<p>At a regional level, financial regulators around the world seek to implement the improvements made by the GSSBs while also enhancing and modifying local frameworks. In Europe, work on digital assets frameworks has been predominately grounded in MiFID II. The EU’s MiCA Regulation aims to complement MiFID II, and the UK’s recent consultations have also indicated that they will seek to improve upon these frameworks, and others that are already implemented in the region.</p>



<p>North America has taken approaches that vary widely by country. The US and Canada have drawn predominately on both existing securities and commodities frameworks.&nbsp;Some, such as Bermuda have been amending existing regulation for specific topics such as issuance or custody.</p>



<p>The Asia-Pacific region has also drawn on securities regulation, as well as payments regulation. The UAE is racing ahead with a bold new approach for virtual assets while balancing these with strong securities laws and a common law framework. South America, by contrast has seen some countries jumping straight to using digital assets as legal tender and/or as a permissible mode of payment.</p>



<p>From these few examples of recent policy developments, it is clear there are frameworks that should be built upon. Regulation does not need to start from a blank sheet of paper, and market participants must continuously improve and implement best practices from the responsible innovation of the previous decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminate</p>



<p>“Their knowledge of their tools is purely empirical; and they have a firm belief in the mummery that surrounds them.” – Isaac Asimov, Foundation</p>



<p>The dangers of trust without a comprehensive understanding of digital assets and regulation are hazardous, and this is arguably evident in the rhetoric from all sides. It often appears that many are blind in their beliefs and will trust without question the technology or the current regulation from those who have taught it to them. While much of this works and appears to have a high degree of social utility, many do not have a true grasp on why it works, or how to closely interrogate any individual component to ensure it works in the future with a higher degree of social utility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Danger may present itself in overzealous faith in DLT, especially when compounded by new regulations that are not proportional and are ill-fitting to new digital technologies. If those who work in technology regulation allow ‘mummery’ to induce a haze of belief in the infallibility of innovation, bad actors will continue to undermine the ecosystem. Blind belief must be eliminated, and replaced with verifiable transparency, compliance, and technical understanding from both regulators and market participants.</p>



<p>Despite much work in 2023 to advance legal definitions, there remains a lack of clarity for many market practitioners. Unclear or undecided legal status for digital assets is a clear barrier for the market. There are other missing pieces as well such as a lack of a global taxonomy for digital assets that prevent clear dialogue and comprehensive development of global frameworks.</p>



<p>The persistent use of the term “crypto” when referring to any kind of digital asset muddies the waters and puts Shiba Inu coin into the same bucket as a fully reserved fiat stablecoin or a bank issued digital bond. That is not a particularly helpful association, and a comprehensive global taxonomy could serve to eliminate some of this conflation and confusion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it is important not to blindly believe in technology, it is also important not to vilify it. In a truly technologically neutral approach DLT is not a cult, to be either worshiped or rallied against. DLT-specific risk should be assessed based on its implementation model, lifecycle activity, and network archetype and then the risk management and controls configured accordingly, with regulatory treatment to match.</p>



<p>So, what isn’t working? Ideologically, blind belief, while either favourable or punitive towards digital assets and DLT can be harmful to the market as a whole. From a legal and regulatory lens, lack of clarity both in the terms used, and the legalities that apply must also eventually be replaced by specificity and global consensus.</p>



<p>Delegate&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In dealing with the future… it is more important to be imaginative and insightful than to be one hundred percent ‘right.’” – Alvin Toffler</p>



<p>Beyond the foundational aspects of existing regulation and the problems still to be eliminated, what are aspects of the digital assets market that are not ‘solvable’ so to speak, by immediate regulation?<a>[4]</a></p>



<p>DeFi is one such still evolving area where it may be prudent for regulators to delegate further analysis and research before imposing requirements. Recently, IOSCO published their consultation on DeFi<a>[5]</a>, and the BiS also published a report on the future of DeFi<a>[6]</a>. Yet it is still evolving rapidly and difficult even to define. Even if the right definition is agreed upon, an enterprise that is truly decentralised in nature would present regulatory challenges and a unique and imaginative approach may be necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another item that can, and perhaps should be delegated, is RegTech. The ability for regulators to access, analyse and interpret the digital assets market is imperative. There are many RegTech solutions being created by the private sector, and regulators who leverage those innovations to implement outsourced technology, will have a fresh capability for digital supervision and this is pivotal to complete the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are only two areas where perhaps creativity is needed to solve the problem. As progress is made, neither the public nor private sector may always have the ‘right’ answer, however with insight, and imagination, these answers can evolve to contribute to the broader framework in innovative ways.</p>



<p>My reading, running, and at times, at times self-absorbed reflections left me a singular conclusion – it is clear there is much to be improved upon, but not in the sense that what already exists is not beneficial or useful.</p>



<p>There is a wealth of knowledge and existing regulation that can be drawn from to build a comprehensive global digital assets framework. Dogma towards both technological developments and unclear policies should be eliminated to better support the further digital development of the global financial services ecosystem and mitigate risks.</p>



<p>While there are areas where regulation may not provide the (optimal) solution for society, further discovery through cross-sector, multi-jurisdictional, and public private sector cooperation remains pivotal to the success of a robust, transparent, viable, and innovative digital assets market for everyone.</p>



<p>Improve, Eliminate, Delegate.</p>

<p>Today we are excited to announce our partnership with ZebPay, one of India’s leading crypto exchanges. ZebPay represents a new custodial account provider option for <a>Brave Rewards</a> users in India, and is available in Brave version 1.58 on both desktop and Android.</p>
<p>With this partnership, Brave Rewards users in India will now be able to connect a ZebPay account to Brave Rewards in order to begin earning <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Tokens (BAT)</a>. Existing users in India with <a>previous earnings</a> will also be able to connect a ZebPay account and have their balances redeemed for BAT and transferred to their ZebPay accounts.</p>
<p>In the near future, creators will also be able to connect a ZebPay account to their <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creators</a> account, allowing them to receive BAT contributions from Brave Rewards users.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with ZebPay to enable our millions of Brave users in India to benefit from their Brave Rewards experience,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “With this custodial integration, users can seamlessly access their BAT payouts in their ZebPay account and get rewarded for their online attention.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to be the exclusive partners for Brave Rewards in India,” said Rahul Pagidipati, CEO of ZebPay. “This strategic partnership not only reinforces our commitment to empowering users but also demonstrates our unwavering support of the crypto ecosystem in India. By enabling users to seamlessly transfer Brave Rewards to ZebPay, we are unlocking a new realm of possibilities for crypto enthusiasts. This is a testament to ZebPay’s vision of creating a more inclusive and accessible crypto ecosystem where users can fully harness the potential of their digital assets.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave provides users with a better Internet experience by protecting their privacy. The Brave browser blocks invasive ads and trackers, which provides a faster (3-6x) and more private Internet experience, as well as less battery drainage. Brave users can earn BAT for seeing privacy-preserving ads in Brave. Online creators can also earn BAT from Brave users with <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creators</a> by publishing great content across a range of platforms including YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), Vimeo, Github, Twitch, or their own website.</p>

 Instructions 
<p>To connect a ZebPay account to Brave Rewards, first make sure you’re on the latest version of Brave (version 1.58 or above). On Android, some users may only see Brave version 1.58 on the app store in a few days.</p>
 
 Open the Brave Rewards panel by selecting the BAT icon in the URL bar. Select “Connect account”, and then select ZebPay as your account provider. 
 


    
    

    


    



    
    

 
 Follow the steps on ZebPay. If you don’t already have a ZebPay account, create one and then complete these steps. Make sure to complete all ID verification steps for your account on ZebPay. 
 


    
    

    


    



    
    

 
 Voilà! Once your ZebPay account is connected, you’ll see a “Connected” status and a ZebPay zebra icon in the Brave Rewards interface.

<p>with @alive_eth @danboneh @smc90</p><p>This week's all-new episode covers the convergence of two important, very top-of-mind trends: AI (artificial intelligence) &amp; blockchains/ crypto. These domains together have major implications for how we all live our lives everyday; so this episode is for anyone just curious about, or already building in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversation covers topics ranging from deep fakes, bots, and the need for proof-of-humanity in a world of AI; to big data, large language models like ChatGPT, user control, governance, privacy and security, zero knowledge and zkML; to MEV, media, art, and much more. Our expert guests (in conversation with host Sonal Chokshi) include:&nbsp;</p>  Dan Boneh, Stanford Professor (and Senior Research Advisor at a16z crypto), a cryptographer who’s been working on blockchains for over a decade and who specializes in cryptography, computer security, and machine learning -- all of which intersect in this episode;  Ali Yahya, general partner at a16z crypto, who also previously worked at Google -- where he not only worked on a distributed system for a fleet of robots (a sort of "collective reinforcement learning") but also worked on Google Brain, where he was one of the core contributors to the machine learning library TensorFlow built at Google.  <p>The first half of the hallway-style conversation between Ali &amp; Dan (who go back together as student and professor at Stanford) is all about how AI could benefit from crypto, and the second half on how crypto could benefit from AI... the thread throughout is the tension between centralization vs. decentralization. &nbsp;So we also discuss where the intersection of crypto and AI can bring about things that aren't possible by either one of them alone...</p><p>pieces referenced in this episode/ related reading:</p>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06616.pdf">The Next Cyber Reasoning System for Cyber Security</a> (2023) by Mohamed Ferrag, Ammar Battah, Norbert Tihanyi, Merouane Debbah, Thierry Lestable, Lucas Cordeiro  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14752.pdf">A New Era in Software Security: Towards Self-Healing Software via Large Language Models and Formal Verification</a> (2023) by &nbsp;Yiannis Charalambous, Norbert Tihanyi, Ridhi Jain, Youcheng Sun, Mohamed Ferrag, Lucas Cordeiro  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01215.pdf">Fixing Hardware Security Bugs with Large Language Models</a> (2023) by Baleegh Ahmad, Shailja Thakur, Benjamin Tan, Ramesh Karri, Hammond Pearce  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?</a> (2022) by Neil Perry, Megha Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, Dan Boneh  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09293">Asleep at the Keyboard?

 Feature: Secrets, and how to prove them — a magician’s guide to zero knowledge proofs <p>with Michael Blau</p><p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic (or so science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke famously said). One such area of sci-fi-like progress is that of <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/zero-knowledge-canon/">zero-knowledge</a> proofs (or ZKPs), a cryptographic tool that addresses two critical challenges in web3: scalability, and privacy. In particular, ZKPs could be the key to unlocking lower transaction fees and designing new privacy-preserving applications — ushering in many more crypto users. But beyond crypto, ZKPs can also help transmit sensitive data securely, combat illicit finance through <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/privacy-protecting-regulatory-solutions-using-zero-knowledge-proofs-full-paper/">privacy-preserving regulatory solutions</a>, and fight <a href="https://medium.com/@boneh/using-zk-proofs-to-fight-disinformation-17e7d57fe52f">disinformation</a>. </p><p>But what are ZKPs, really? There are many clever explanations out there, but even with the wealth of analogies available — from Waldo to Ali Baba’s Cave — it’s not easy to find an accurate, easy-to-grasp explanation of zero-knowledge proofs. Especially one that fully captures their superpowers, including for those who aren’t cryptography researchers or engineers.</p><p>So in this post and special demo, a16z crypto partner Michael Blau combines his background in magic with his work in crypto to explore a new analogy for demystifying ZKPs: a magic trick. Magic tricks, and magicians hiding secrets, can serve as a helpful mental model for understanding the key properties of ZKPs. Which makes sense, since zero-knowledge proofs in practice are indistinguishable from magic…  </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/a-magicians-guide-to-zero-knowledge-proofs/">read more/ watch here</a><br>share: on <a href="https://twitter.com/blauyourmind/status/1700175388557885828">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0xb8bff3">Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/a16zcrypto_magic-tricks-are-zero-knowledge-proofs-activity-7105942084783636480-sKAY">LinkedIn</a></p> Resource: ‘Back to school’ special playlists  The latest in crypto research  <p>Tim Roughgarden</p><p>With the goal of advancing the science and technology of the next generation of the internet, last year we <a href="https://a16z.com/announcing-a16z-crypto-research/">introduced</a> a16z crypto research — a new kind of multidisciplinary lab dedicated to helping shape crypto and web3 as a formal area of study. One of our goals was to help bridge the worlds of academic theory with industry practice, and one of the ways we do so (besides working with our portfolio and publishing our own work) is by bringing together the very best research talent across disciplines relevant to the space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, we’ve now hosted two immersive summer programs at the a16z crypto office — where we invite both established and emerging researchers to present their work and ideas, collaborate on some of the hardest problems in the ecosystem, and sharpen each other’s ideas by spending time with one another.

The initial drop included talks from a16z crypto research partners Joe Bonneau on distributed randomness beacons and Lera Nikolaenko on distributed data storage; as well as talks from Matt Green (Johns Hopkins) on “going beyond zero knowledge: next steps for compliance and constrained encryption on blockchains”; Sarah Meiklejohn (University College London, Google) on distributed key generation; and Ittai Abraham (Intel Labs, former VMWare; also <a href="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/">Decentralized Thoughts</a> blog) on “it’s all about trust”. The second drop, themed “<a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1696632783194718451">cryptography week</a>”, features talks from Dan Boneh (Stanford, a16z crypto); Elaine Shu (CMU); Foteini Baldimitsi (GMU); and Ron Rothblum (Technion), <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1696632783194718451">here</a>.

There are 3 main types of secrets most people have to hold for online access:</p>  <p>Passwords — which people use to access various websites and services. These must not only be kept secret, but be unique from service to service.</p>  <p>TOTP codes — which are often generated by an authenticator app or TOTP (time-based one time password) system. These provide two-factor authentication, where a second layer of security (hence the “two”, and “multi-” if more layers) helps protect access.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Seed phrases — “mnemonic” codes or recovery phrases that give direct control of all crypto wallets derived from that seed phrase. This reflects one of the empowering features of crypto wallets: Once you enter your seed phrase, you have total control of your assets without needing to move them from one custodian to another.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Note, these “secrets” aren’t all specific to crypto/ web3; anyone using the internet today should be using these practices (or something custom tailored for their needs)! And while our recommendation would be to harden everything to the maximum extent possible, the practical reality is that purchasing hardware wallets, webauthn keys, and machines with TEEs isn’t easy to do for most people (at least, not yet). Furthermore, losing secrets can sometimes be a greater risk than having them compromised: some information, once lost, can’t ever be found.&nbsp;</p><p>So one could consider this a “minimal viable security” approach. That minimum setup — using things many people already have — would be to use a well-vetted password manager to store your seed phrases and passwords; and a TOTP app on your phone to store and use TOTP codes for 2FA (two-factor authentication). Here’s more on why and how:</p><p>Do NOT use text messages on your phone (SMS) as a second factor for authentication. SMS is a very weak choice for 2FA, given <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208">the rise</a> of SIM swapping/ jacking: where a hacker pretends to be you to your mobile provider (“I lost my phone and need help accessing it…”); then reroutes your phone number to their device; and then can then access any accounts linked to that phone. That’s why we recommend using authenticator apps (like Authy, Google Authenticator, etc.). Not all services allow two-factor authentication, unfortunately; so you should still make sure you’re using strong, unique passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Store your passwords in a password manager. This is mostly to make having unique passwords for all internet services possible; otherwise most people default to reusing passwords across sites. A password manager secures each online account with a unique, complex password — and uses one strong “master password” to encrypt all the stored passwords (see for example <a href="https://1passwordstatic.com/files/security/1password-white-paper.pdf">1Password</a>, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-security-white-paper/">Bitwarden</a>, or <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/download/whitepaper-en.pdf">Dashlane</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Your master password should be at least 16 characters — preferably a randomly generated passphrase of at least 5 words, which is usually around 30 characters, but easier to remember. This is not an arbitrary recommendation; the GPU costs for computers to guess passwords by brute force <a href="https://support.1password.com/pbkdf2/">goes up exponentially</a> the more characters and words there are in a password. That’s why longer is better. Finally: Never forget the master password! If you have to, you can write down a password hint with pen and paper, store that in the safest place you can think of, and remember where it is.</p><p>Store an encrypted copy of your backup codes/ TOTP in cloud storage, and print them out in a secure hard safe. But what about storing your TOTP codes in a password manager? Some password managers do support this, but it is better to use two different applications so that both security “factors” — password, and TOTP — remain separated. So then where should you store seed phrases? While the answer is a bit more complicated, the short answer is: in your password manager. (If you have a crypto wallet with a lot of assets in it, consider a more complex scheme; otherwise, this approach should work for most).</p><p>related:</p>  <p>📑 <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/wallet-security-non-custodial-fallacy/">Wallet security: the ‘non-custodial’ fallacy</a> (with Nassim Eddequiouaq &amp; Riyaz Faizullabhoy)</p>  <p>🎧 <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/crypto-web3-security-bridge-hacks-wallet-hacks-nomad-slope-MomCe42_">Bridge hack, wallet hack</a> (with Matt Gleason)</p>  <p>☑️ <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/12/16-steps-secure-you/">16 steps to securing your data, and life</a> (a16z)</p>  <p><br>-- Sonal Chokshi and a16z crypto teams</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6db3e133-2c70-4dbb-bb2a-d5ad55d3c1fa_550x69.png">   </a> <p><br>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

<p>Social media revolves around content creation, and while the content itself could be tokenised through NFTs, SocialFi aims to take it a step further. The recently released friend.tech app went to show that users might be interested in something more than just content - creator shares. This implicitly links back to handles and profiles, and we can slowly start to unveil the primitives of social media. Lens Protocol predates the friend.tech venture, in both timeline, as well as scope. While social media became synonymous with monopolistic central entities, Lens Protocol aims to build the decentralised bedrock for Web3’s social layer. These primitives would not only be interoperable with any Web3 application, but they would redefine content creation, feed generation and monetisation.</p><p>We were joined by Stani Kulechov, founder of Lens Protocol &amp; Aave, to discuss decentralised social graphs and how to leverage smart contracts to build the primitives for Web3's social layer.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The vision behind Lens  Lens V2 and smart contract capabilities  Social media development platform  Defining the Web3 social media primitive  Feed generation algorithm on Lens  Integrating on-chain and off-chain infrastructure  The tragedy of the commons in decentralised social media  Can a public good architecture also accommodate private goods?

<p>In November 2024, the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/reaching-consensus/">current Zcash development fund</a> will expire. Conversations about a new dev fund have begun, and community sentiment seems to favor changes regarding who receives Zcash issuance and how much issuance they receive. There’s little support for carrying over the current structure into a new dev fund, and there is a vocal minority who advocates against any new dev fund.</p>



<p>A little over a month ago, I gave <a href="https://youtu.be/Cy0rwBhlv10?si=2MvzjDRK2qTt8FRz">a presentation</a> at Zcon4, the annual conference hosted by the independent Zcash Foundation, about the importance of the Zcash dev fund and why it’s Zcash’s superpower. I made the argument that every decision is about balancing trade-offs and that the community needs to consider this in structuring funding and governance.</p>



<p>For context, here’s a common view of how Zcash community funding works today: 80 percent of Zcash issuance is distributed to miners, while 20 percent is devoted to Zcash development funding. Importantly, 8 percent of the total block reward (or about 40 percent of the current dev fund) goes into the Zcash Community Grants organization, which exclusively funds independent third-party developers. ECC (through the Bootstrap org) receives 7 percent of the total rewards, and the remaining 5 percent goes to the Zcash Foundation.</p>







<p>While this view of funding and governance is accurate, there are alternate views that are also accurate.&nbsp;</p>



 Tradeoffs in the current dev fund structure 



<blockquote>
<p>“There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.”</p>
Thomas Sowell</blockquote>



<p>The Zcash Community Grants organization actually receives its funding through the Zcash Foundation; it doesn’t receive funds directly. It was set up this way for good reasons (mainly, creating a wholly new and separate entity is expensive), and Exhibit B represents this flow of money.&nbsp;</p>







<p>In <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014">ZIP 1014</a>, the community stipulated that the Zcash Foundation must not interfere with Zcash Community Grants’s decisions, and both the Zcash Foundation and Zcash Community Grants should be commended on their financial transparency. In a majority of cases, this structure in which money flows through the Zcash Foundation to the ZCG to independent developers and teams is just fine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the tradeoff is that the Zcash Foundation is beholden to US laws* which means that any organization or team that is downstream of the Zcash Foundation is also constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my Zcon4 presentation, I highlighted two recent examples of the real-life implications of this structure.</p>



 
 In 2022, a person living in Iran who goes by Bitcoin Buddy applied for a grant to become a Zcash ambassador. They wrote about living under a theocratic dictatorship and incompetent kleptocracy that inflicts poverty and allows women to be attacked in the streets. Their goal was to tell their community about Zcash and frame it as an alternative or an “escape” from the oppressive Iran ruling regime. I suspect Zcash Community Grants would have liked to fund Bitcoin Buddy, but it couldn’t because its money flows through the Zcash Foundation, which is based in the US, is subject to the laws of the US, and would find its nonprofit status at jeopardy by funding a person or project in Iran. 



 In another example, a team of engineers who wished to remain anonymous applied for funding to build and implement new code on Zcash. However, because the team refused to give information like names and home addresses, a US KYC (Know Your Customer) requirement, its application was rejected. 
 



<p>If these scenarios alone don’t demonstrate the need for changes in a “Dev Fund 2,” consider that ECC, the organization I lead, is also based in the US and subject to the laws of the US, which means that all dev fund monies are constrained by the laws of a single government and regulatory framework.</p>







<p>It’s worth noting that miners, who receive 80% of all Zcash issuance, live outside the control of the US government and are not bound by rules on how they use that issuance.</p>



 A metric for Zcash sustainability and resilience 



<p>One useful way to address trade-offs is to look at a metric: the number of independent and sustainable organizations that support Zcash.</p>



<p>Exhibit A shows us that the number is three: ECC, Zcash Foundation, and Zcash Community Grants. Exhibit B illustrates that there are only two, and Exhibit C suggests that all of these organizations are consolidated and beholden to one entity, the US government. (I don’t count miners as supporters of Zcash because, to my knowledge, none of the large commercial miners do anything to improve Zcash. And in fact, most sell it at the end of each day to buy Bitcoin.)</p>



<p>There’s an ineluctable trade-off between independence and accountability. For any circle in these illustrations, you can choose independence or accountability, but only one attribute, not both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Exhibit B, for example, the Zcash Foundation serves a valuable role, which is that it holds Zcash Community Grants accountable to its charge. But because it’s downstream of the Zcash Foundation, Zcash Community Grants isn’t actually independent.</p>



<p>At the blockchain level you can create accountability by the community as a whole adding and removing recipients of a dev fund, but below the blockchain level independence and accountability are a trade-off.</p>



 Failure modes 



<p>As a security engineer, I really like thinking about failure modes. In Exhibit D, I break them into four categories.</p>







<p>The first two failure modes, external and internal attacks, are pretty self-explanatory. Either could have a huge impact and even cause catastrophic failure of a project. US policy appears to be lining up against crypto as an industry, but for now, I still categorize these failure modes as “rare.”</p>



<p>Category 3, however, is common. Sadly, two-thirds of everyone who sets out to do anything never quite finishes, because success requires a mix of vision, timing, talent, and luck. When designing governance, we must be aware of and protect against a simple law of the universe: No matter how well-intentioned and skilled a person or team appears to be, there’s a not-insignificant chance they will fail to live up to expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last failure mode, Category 4, is 100% likely. Every person and every group of people is a special interest with differing motivations, differing blindspots, and differing values and perspectives. Systems of governance must be resilient enough to produce good results in spite of this universal law.</p>



 Designing the next Zcash dev fund 



<p>Even with guaranteed failure modes and complex tradeoffs, it’s possible to design a governance system that increases the sustainability and resilience of Zcash.<br></p>



<p>As I said at Zcon4, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” The next dev fund the Zcash community implements needs to (1)&nbsp; include more, independent teams than the current iteration, and (2) at least one of those teams should be headquartered outside the US.</p>







<p>No governance model is perfect, but my opinion is that these two recommendations will foster lasting benefits for Zcashers and the future of Zcash. I have extremely high confidence in the voice of the community, and I’m looking forward to continuing this conversation into 2024 and beyond!</p>



<p>*The Zcash Foundation recently announced that it has begun the process of setting up an operational nonprofit entity in the Cayman Islands, so that’s excellent news!</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market#:~:text=Report%20Overview,13.4%25%20from%202023%20to%202030.">gaming market set to grow at 13.4% yearly until 2030</a>, gaming is bigger than ever. And in a digital era marked by blockchain innovation, GameFi emerges as a game-changer, blending gaming with Web3 technologies. This article sheds light on what GameFi is, explaining its core elements, the exciting opportunities it offers players and publishers, and the complex challenges it faces.</p>



<p>GameFi isn’t just a passing trend; it’s a dynamic system that lets players earn while they play, provides publishers with new ways to make money, and creates special communities. But it also needs to deal with tricky issues like regulations, market ups and downs, and security concerns. As GameFi continues to evolve, it’s not just changing how we see gaming; it’s a symbol of the resilience and innovation of our digital world. The future of gaming has arrived, and GameFi is leading the way, ready to transform the gaming industry in ways we are only beginning to understand.</p>



 What is GameFi?  



<p>At its core, GameFi represents the usage of novel web3 aspects in traditional games, referring to things like changes in ownership of in-game assets as well as changes in reward mechanisms.</p>



<p>Some of the key components of GameFi include play-to-earn models as well as tokenised assets, both of which we will explain below to give you a better understanding of what GameFi is about.</p>



 Play-to-earn models 



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/play-to-earn-business-models-games/">Play-to-earn models</a> are models for games in which players get rewarded for playing the game. These rewards can then be exchanged for real money (or cryptocurrencies).</p>



<p>In contrast to traditional gaming models such as pay-to-play or free-to-play models, where players either purchase the game upfront or invest money for in-game benefits, play-to-earn models harness the power of blockchain technology to establish an entirely new dynamic. While pay-to-play and free-to-play models have effectively catered to gamers’ preferences for years, the introduction of play-to-earn models represents a shift in how players perceive their gaming experience and their potential to make money while gaming.</p>



<p>Play-to-earn models approach this differently and compensate players for their time spent in the game. This compensation usually happens in the form of digital assets, both in the form of ‘regular’ tokens as well as non-fungible tokens. Players can also receive certain rewards for reaching specific milestones, achievements, levels, etc. After a player receives these rewards, they can either use them again in the game or sell them on a marketplace.</p>



<p>All in all, this kind of model provides a greater incentive for the players to continue playing, and it allows game publishers to push players in certain directions by changing the reward structure.</p>



 Tokenised assets  



<p>Closely related to these play-to-earn models are <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/tokenisation/">tokenised assets</a>. In a GameFi context, tokenised assets are actually the same as regular in-game assets, with the only difference being that instead of the game developers controlling the assets, the user controls the asset.</p>



<p>And this opens up a whole barrage of options. First of all, when players purchase in-game assets, their financial investment doesn’t simply disappear within the gaming ecosystem. Instead, they can sell or trade these items outside the game environment, linking their tokenised assets to real-world financial opportunities. While platforms like Steam currently allow the sale of in-game assets, these transactions are limited to the platform’s ecosystem. Tokenised assets have the potential to break down these barriers, offering a more versatile and user-friendly solution.</p>



<p>Secondly, tokenised assets empower players with greater influence over the in-game economy. Traditionally, game economies are subject to the control of developers. While this dynamic still holds true to some extent in play-to-earn games, players are gaining a voice in determining the value and significance of different aspects of the game, including specific items or features.</p>



<p>Thirdly, by tokenising assets, game developers can hand out limited in-game assets more transparently and easily. Blockchain technology can prove the scarcity of the items, adding more trust and also making it easy to verify the authenticity of in-game items in marketplaces and inventories.</p>



<p>These tokenised assets are key to play-to-earn models, as well as to GameFi as a whole.</p>



<a href="https://alienworlds.io/"></a><a href="https://alienworlds.io/">Alien Worlds</a> is one of the largest GameFi games in the world in terms of transaction volume.



 Opportunities of GameFi 



<p>There are a variety of opportunities opened up by GameFi, ranging from new ways to make money for both players and game publishers to the opportunity to create new kinds of exclusive communities. Let’s dive into each of these below!</p>



 Earn money while playing  



<p>GameFi offers gamers a unique chance to turn their favourite pastime into a potentially lucrative venture. Unlike traditional gaming, where the fun is its own reward, GameFi lets players earn real money while they enjoy virtual adventures. This shift is exemplified by play-to-earn models, which allow players to collect valuable in-game items and cryptocurrencies as they play.</p>



<p>Another fascinating aspect of this is the creation of limited special items. Game developers can use blockchain tech to make unique, scarce digital goods that players can get through in-game achievements or events. These limited items create a buzz, making players compete to get them, and they often become valuable assets that can be sold for profit on secondary markets. Furthermore, they can be used by game developers to incentivise player behaviour or to generate hype around certain events.</p>



 Secondary market fees for publishers 



<p>For game publishers, GameFi opens up a new way to make money through secondary market fees. As players actively trade and sell tokenised in-game items on external marketplaces, publishers can charge small fees for each transaction. These fees, although tiny individually, add up significantly as more and more trades happen within the game’s ecosystem.</p>



<p>These secondary market fees offer publishers a steady income source that goes beyond the traditional game purchase or in-game purchases model. This consistent revenue stream enables publishers to invest more in game development, enhancing the overall gaming experience and attracting a wider audience.</p>



<p>The secondary market also creates a lively ecosystem, encouraging players to actively participate in trading and investing in virtual assets. This dynamic player-driven economy enhances the game’s long-term appeal.</p>



 Exclusive communities  



<p>Another benefit of GameFi is the ability to create exclusive communities within gaming ecosystems. As players accumulate achievements, assets, and more, they become part of a unique group of individuals who share similar experiences or possess similar skills and/or items. These communities can be built around the shared ownership of rare in-game items, achievements, and a mutual interest in exploring the possibilities of GameFi.</p>



<p>These exclusive communities offer several advantages. They enable players to verify and show off their in-game achievements and items transparently, thanks to blockchain technology. This transparency builds trust among players and makes it easy to confirm the authenticity of in-game items in marketplaces and player inventories.</p>



<p>Game developers can also use these exclusive communities to foster direct communication with their player base. This direct engagement allows for real-time feedback, which can be invaluable in shaping game development and ensuring a responsive and player-centric gaming experience.</p>



 Challenges of GameFi  



<p>As with any new technology, challenges are part of the adoption process. GameFi is no exception to this, so it is important to consider the following three challenges related to GameFi.</p>







 Regulatory issues 



<p>One of the foremost challenges facing GameFi is the ever-evolving landscape of regulatory frameworks. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are still grappling with how to classify cryptocurrencies, decentralised applications, and blockchain-based assets. This ambiguity can result in uncertain legal status and potential compliance challenges for GameFi projects.</p>



<p>Moreover, the integration of real-world financial incentives, such as cryptocurrencies, within gaming environments can raise concerns about consumer protection, taxation, and money laundering. Navigating these complex regulatory waters requires a delicate balance between innovation and adherence to evolving legal standards, making it essential for games using GameFi components to stay informed and proactive in addressing regulatory challenges.</p>



 Market volatility 



<p>GameFi’s reliance on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology also exposes it to the inherent volatility of these markets. The value of cryptocurrencies can experience rapid fluctuations, impacting the real-world value of in-game assets and player earnings. Players and developers alike must grapple with the potential for sudden wealth fluctuations, which can pose financial risks and affect the overall stability of the GameFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>These fluctuations in prices of both cryptocurrencies and assets related to the game can heavily influence interest, player behaviour, and overall sentiment. To mitigate these challenges, developers may need to implement strategies like stablecoin integration or token stabilisation mechanisms within their games. Such measures can help shield players from extreme volatility while maintaining the economic incentives that make GameFi appealing.</p>



 Security concerns  



<p>As GameFi relies heavily on blockchain technology, the security of smart contracts, wallets, and decentralised applications becomes paramount. Malicious actors are constantly probing for vulnerabilities and exploits, and the financial aspect of GameFi makes this even more appealing. Incidents like hacks, exploits, or scams can erode player trust and confidence in the platform.</p>



<p>It is key to invest in robust security measures, including rigorous code audits, multi-layer authentication protocols, and secure wallet integrations. Additionally, educating players about safe practices in handling cryptocurrencies and in-game assets can help protect them from potential security breaches. After all, you decide for yourself how secure you store your assets.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>This month, we completed Stage 0 of our v1 testnet, launched Testnet Stage 1, saw the DAO put across two crucial improvement proposals (one of them forming a solid alliance!), and expanded the information available in the Panther-verse.</p><p>Let’s recap everything that happened in August.</p> Tech Updates  Stage 0 is complete, but the Miner will keep going! <p>We are proud to announce that Stage 0 of the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-announcement-panthers-testnet-is-going-live-on-july-10th/">v1 Testnet</a> was successful! We're thrilled by the engagement we registered during it, and invite you to be a part of the journey towards Panther’s v1 launch.</p><p>Importantly, the Miner will continue working during the whole Testnet, with rewards not exhausted yet. However, browser mining has been discontinued, and only the desktop version will remain available.</p><p>Here’s, so far, how mining testing is going:</p>Mining Testnet results. v1 Testnet: Stage 1 Stage 1 is LIVE!<p>After a successful <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage0-live/">Stage 0</a>, we are debuting <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet</a>. At this stage, you’ll test two of Panther’s very anticipated innovations: third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts.</p><p>Stage 1 is public and will have dedicated rewards. Differently from Stage 0, users are rewarded for completing the product flow. However, we encourage the community to try to find and submit bugs, as well as to provide feedback. This process ensures that the Testnet returns a bug-free protocol, ultimately improving our product and its users’ experience. Furthermore, it works only on desktops, and not mobile devices. </p><p>At this stage, you’ll be testing two features that allow Panther to combine privacy-preserving DeFi access with compliance capabilities:</p>  <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/third-party-compliance-integrations?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Third-party compliance integrations</a>  <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/panther-accounts?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Accounts</a>  <p>Users can visit the Testnet link for Stage 1 <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">in the info repository on our docs</a> to test the onboarding functionality. This involves creating a Panther Account, undergoing a simple verification process (name and email required, ID NOT required) with PureFi, and activating their Account. </p>Stage 1 of Testing showcases our first-ever third-party integration: PureFi!<p>To share feedback, testers will be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a dedicated form</a> as the only accepted procedure. The steps mentioned in the form’s description are needed to make this interaction both efficient and productive.</p> v1 Testnet documentation <p>Our Testnet documentation page will compile all the relevant links and info as our Testnet release progresses. This will guide users through our Testnet's development, ensuring easy access to the latest updates, key milestones, and important information. </p><p>Click here to view the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">v1 Testnet page</a> on our docs.</p>This chart containing all relevant Testnet information will be updated as our Testnet release progresses. Panther’s compliance integrations <p>We recently shared an in-depth article on <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">Panther's compliance integrations</a>. These integrations are a major milestone for the protocol and will be tested at Stage 1 of Panther's Testnet!</p>Panther’s privacy-preserving compliance integrations.<p>Panther recognizes the need for a robust solution that safeguards privacy and also ensures compliance with regulatory standards. This keeps malicious actors away from the protocol while adhering to &nbsp;the Web3 ethos of decentralization and anonymity.</p><p>The Panther team and DAO have meticulously discussed ways to address this challenge, with ongoing conversations around regulatory best practices. As a result, we’ve designed an approach to bring compliance to the protocol while retaining neutrality.</p><p>Within Panther's solution, compliance providers need to be able to process users' data without the protocol learning it, proving a user's ownership of their wallet and giving them a zero-knowledge proof attesting to the validity of their statements. This allows users to access Panther while maintaining the protocol's neutrality.</p><p>Panther's strategy hinges on three core components:</p><p>1) Third-party compliance vendor integrations, maintaining neutrality and decentralization.</p><p>2) Panther accounts (zAccounts), creating a ZK bridge between verification and privacy.</p><p>3) Zones, logical partitions within Shielded Pools.</p><p>This article sheds light on Panther's simple yet elegant solution to the privacy-compliance paradox, adding yet another innovative feature to Panther’s groundbreaking solution.

During this discussion, multiple compliance vendors have been mentioned, and through <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x454f67e23b7f38f65b837a3c97233f467967fcb304e8c2826e3ab9b5fee97d35">PIP-17</a>, PureFi was proposed as the best solution for Panther Protocol based on, but not limited to, the following criteria:</p>  Decentralization.  Protocol-level integrations.  On-chain support for ZK-compatible attestations and signatures.  Fees paid (in $ZKP) on-chain by the protocol, enabling further utility for our token.  <p>As such, this integration will be of great importance as we progress towards Panther v1. Panther’s compliance integrations and PureFi’s flow can already be tested at Panther’s Testnet Stage 1. </p><p>In time, we’ll publish a blog post with all the details about the integration, which are also found at <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x454f67e23b7f38f65b837a3c97233f467967fcb304e8c2826e3ab9b5fee97d35">PIP-17</a>.</p> Events  ParisDOT conference <p>At <a href="https://twitter.com/Paris_Dot_Comm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ParisDOT Conference</a>, our Co-Founder Anish Mohammed shared his expertise on Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) during a panel with <a href="https://twitter.com/hydra_dx?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">HydraDX</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/paritytech?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Parity Tech</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/BifrostFinance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Bifrost Finance</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/DIAdata_org?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIA</a>! </p><p>Take a deep dive into this exciting DeFi trend:</p> Media  Router Protocol interview <p>Co-founder Anish Mohammed also participated in a Twitter Spaces organized by<a href="https://twitter.com/routerprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Router Protocol</a> to discuss Panther.

One might argue that it is a natural result of solving market inefficiencies, but it entices to centralisation and collusion in order to extract the highest amount of value. Additionally, through front-running and back-running, it creates unnecessary overhead, which caused up to 2.4% of the total network congestion back in DeFi summer of 2020 (according to Flashbots’ research). As current infrastructure cannot eliminate MEV altogether, Flashbots and other research groups have tried to come up with solutions to address its aftermath.</p><p>We were joined by Stephane Gosselin, co-founder of Flashbots and Frontier Research, to discuss the MEV landscape, what research breakthroughs have been recorded and how they impact DevEx and UX.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Reflecting on ‘Frontrunning the MEV crisis’  Decentralising the MEV ‘supply chain’  The vision behind Frontier Research  Request-for-Quotation (RFQ) explained  Block building  Uniswap X and how it might impact LPs &amp; block building  Decentralising block building  Proposer-builder separation (PBS)  MEV burn  How MEV influenced different applications’ UX   Intents  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/thegostep">Stephane Gosselin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://frontier.tech/">Frontier Research</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FrontierDotTech">Frontier Research on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Brian Fabian Crain &amp; Felix Lutsch.

 💸 Feature: On financial freedom, web2 to web3, &amp; company building big to small <p>David Marcus, Sonal Chokshi&nbsp;</p><p>This wide-ranging conversation on our recent episode of the ‘<a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/">web3 with a16z</a>’ podcast covers company building big to small — including what is the right cadence, and when is the right time in product development, to ship — as well as views on scaling, remote work (yay or nay?), and more. </p><p>We also touch on the journey from web2 to web3, and the journey from payments to crypto — including why bitcoin — since our guest is David Marcus, CEO and co-founder of Lightspark (previously head of Novi/Diem/Libra, head of Facebook Messenger, former president of PayPal). From the tension between centralization vs. decentralization and the role of platforms in power, we also talk about the importance of financial freedom and American innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/payments-bitcoin-crypto-decentralization-platforms">listen here</a><br>share <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1694008498580021696">on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x8480c8">on Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7099761028321705984">on LinkedIn</a></p> 💎 Resource: On ‘protodanksharding’, ‘danksharding’, and ‘data availability sampling’ … in 30(ish) minutes <p>Valeria Nikolaenko</p><p>In just 36 minutes, a16z crypto research partner Valeria Nikolaenko describes and explains protodanksharding, danksharding, data availability sampling, rollups (how they work, types)… all of which are important for future upgrades to Ethereum, and for understanding networking/ blockchain scalability. Nikolaenko also highlights some of the best data availability schemes so that others can improve on them, incorporate those ideas into their own projects, or do further research.

So she covers the process of pitching from start to finish — before making a deck, before the pitch, during the pitch, and following up after — including especially how to craft a narrative for your product and team. Why is this a big market/ vision/ opportunity? Why are you the right team to bring it to market? And what is the one question Simpson likes to ask every founder? (Hint: the answer will be the key theme throughout your pitch).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/JL0zM7MkDpI?si=Ttx8bQEazrxunSMd">watch this video</a> &nbsp;<br><a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1692693948433608882">share</a></p> 🌐 Trend: On stateless blockchains <p>Miranda Christ and Joe Bonneau</p><p>As blockchains grow to support more users and more frequent transactions, so too grows the amount of information (the “state”) that validators have to store to verify transactions. For example: in Bitcoin, the state consists of a set of unspent transaction outputs; while in Ethereum, the state consists of an account balance for each account, as well as code and storage for each smart contract. These storage burdens will become unwieldy as blockchains grow (given enough accounts or everyday transactions), making it difficult to become a validator — posing a potential threat to decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s tempting to turn to cryptography as a solution — where tools such as Merkle trees and zero-knowledge proofs have previously helped us achieve the implausible — to create “stateless” blockchains, they remain far from practical despite substantial research (e.g., <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1188">Boneh et al</a>, <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal">Buterin</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/599">Srinivasan et al</a>, <a href="https://petertodd.org/2016/delayed-txo-commitments">Todd</a>). In fact, argue the authors of this piece (including a16z crypto research intern &amp; PhD student Christ), stateless blockchains won’t ever be feasible without additional measures to manage the state. But such “impossibility results” shouldn’t be discouraging, because they can direct researchers and builders to pursue more fruitful paths…</p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/on-the-impossibility-of-stateless-blockchains/">read the post</a> “On the impossibility of stateless blockchains”&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/UGcfTkZbjAw?si=rpL-hXcQcDVhNJHd">watch the video</a> “On limits on revocable proof systems, with implications for blockchains”</p>  <p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1478">check out the full paper</a> “Limits on revocable proof systems, with applications to stateless blockchains”</p>  <p>share on <a href="https://twitter.com/miranda__christ/status/1694735693463826856">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0xa76b82">on Farcaster</a></p>   🗞️ News &amp; moves: IRS guidance on staking; crypto &amp; banks; more <p>Our ongoing <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/regulatory-updates-roundups-recaps">regulatory updates</a> — as curated by the a16z crypto regulatory team — cover news, guidance, legislation, and frameworks released by agencies, associations, governments, banks, and other entities around the world as they impact the crypto industry in terms of regulation and policy.

<p>Panther community,</p><p>After a very successful Stage 0, today we are debuting Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet. At this Stage, you’ll test two of Panther’s very anticipated innovations: <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts</a>. </p><p>Stage 1 is public and will have dedicated rewards. It will work only on desktop, not mobile devices. Differently from Stage 0, users will be rewarded for completing the product flow. However, we encourage the community to try to find and submit bugs, as well as to provide feedback. This process ensures that the Testnet returns a bug-free protocol, ultimately improving the protocol and its users’ experience.</p><p>Let’s dive deep into Stage 1:</p><p>(Note: For this Stage, the Panther Miner used in Stage 0 will be shut off for two days. We’ll put out an announcement when it is back to activity).</p> Why Stage 1 matters <p>At this stage, you’ll be testing two features that allow Panther to combine privacy-preserving DeFi access with compliance capabilities:</p> Third-party compliance integrations <p>Panther has built a system that retains neutrality by plugging directly into compliance providers and integrating them into the application’s flow. These systems can capture certain types of user data and issue a zero-knowledge proof attesting that users have been verified without the protocol learning any information from them.</p><p>The Panther DAO has been commissioned to select a compliance vendor that aligns with its interests, a discussion taking place in <a href="http://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s forum</a>. For the sake of this Testing exercise, an integration has been built that uses <a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi’s</a> system. PureFi is a multi-vendor compliance provider that has demonstrated interest in partnering with Panther through the DAO discussions.</p><p>Registering using these integrations is a multi-step process that connects a user’s Panther Account with the verification performed by PureFi.</p><p>It consists of:<br><br>a. Creating a Panther Account by connecting your wallet (e.g., Metamask).<br>b. Undergoing a basic verification on PureFi’s site (opened in a pop-up tab).<br>c. Completing the verification process in the Panther dApp by providing the created proof of verification. This process involves downloading files on your browser (around 30MB), which can sometimes take 2-3 minutes (depending on IPFS’ responsivity at the time. In case of trouble, reloading may help.)</p><p>The above activates the user’s Panther account created in step (a) above, and issues account creation rewards to the user.</p> Panther Accounts <p>Within Panther, users are identified through their Panther Account (which has a corresponding zAddress), a concept similar to a bank account in that it englobes all of a user’s transactions within a single reference point. Accounts attest to users’ compliance verification while retaining zero-knowledge properties. In other words, they prove that a user has passed verification (as well as the type of verification passed), but they do not store any private information about users.</p><p>We posted an article further expanding on the rationale behind both of these components, as well as Panther’s compliance focus. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">Check it out here!</a></p> Testing and providing feedback <p>As we mentioned, Testnet rewards are automated, and as such, the Testnet itself will reward users for going through the Account creation flow. However, the goal for the Testnet is to debug and enhance the protocol before v1’s launch. </p><p>Our expectation is that users submit bugs and share ideas to enhance end-to-end functioning, interaction and usage of wallets, UI/UX flows, and let us know about any component that doesn’t look or feel as expected. We have created the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">spreadsheet</a> containing all the details that users can test, which includes functional and visual components. Note that every testing case is numbered to facilitate the process of providing feedback.</p><p>Spotting and fixing any possible bugs within the Testnet will make the first version of the protocol more sustainable in the middle term while allowing users to receive their earned rewards.</p> How to test <p>Users can visit the Testnet link for Stage 1 found <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">in the info repository on our docs</a> to test the onboarding functionality. This involves creating a Panther Account, undergoing a simple verification process (name and email required, ID NOT required) with PureFi, and activating their Account. We recommend that you test along with reviewing the testing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">spreadsheet</a> so that you can keep track of everything you need to test.</p><p>To share feedback, testers will be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a dedicated form</a> as the only accepted procedure. The steps mentioned in the form’s description are needed to make this interaction both efficient and productive.</p><p>Users will be rewarded with 100 $tzZKP (test $zZKP) sent to their wallet as soon as they complete the onboarding process and successfully activate their Panther account. tZKP tokens will be used to interact with the protocol during later stages. Interactions with the protocol also accrue rewards for users in the form of tPRP, which will be used in the second stage. As such, testers will receive 500 tPRP.</p><p>Remember that, to test, you will need to use the Mumbai Polygon Testnet. To use this network, you may also use a faucet (such as <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">this one</a>) to obtain test MATIC to pay for transactions.</p> Important note (do not skip this!) <p>It’s possible that, during testing, you might encounter a set of RPC errors derived from the Mumbai testnet network itself. These errors are due to infrastructural challenges and outside Panther’s control. <br><br>If at some point (such as while logging in or trying to switch networks) you encounter an error that prevents you from signing transactions (which might even cause your wallet extension to crash needing a browser or PC restart), please: </p>  Visit <a href="https://chainlist.org/chain/80001/to?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://chainlist.org/chain/80001/</a> to see a list of Mumbai network working nodes.  Identify a working node. Note that, since this is a Testnet product, privacy is non-essential.  Access your wallet’s Network settings, and edit the Mumbai network to use the working RPC’s server address.  If needed, change the Chain ID to “80001”.  Re-start the product flow.  <p>If the problem persists even after trying a new valid RPC, please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">the official form</a> to fill out a bug report.</p> Thank you for testing!<br> <p>The Panther community has done a great job testing Stage 0. We’re sure this will be a constant as we progress through the different stages of our Testnet leading up to v1. </p><p>We’re looking forward to receiving your feedback. If you have any further questions, please reach out through our official channels below!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>From the very beginning, Cosmos set out to provide an alternative to the monolithic blockchain architecture proposed by Ethereum. Cosmos SDK was the cornerstone of this vision, as it allowed developers to spin up blockchains effortlessly. Its modularity enabled custom, self-sovereign chains to become a reality. And, instead of being a jack of all trades, those chains were centred around a sole purpose, thus transforming them into appchains. In turn, as the ecosystem grew, appchains had to be interoperable with one another, but this was already a core feature of Cosmos, via IBC. Before Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap, appchains were thought to be a much-needed scaling solution. However, with the advancements of zero knowledge technology, the Cosmos SDK now faces another set of challenges as it navigates the market demand for L2 scaling solutions.</p><p>We were joined by Marko Baricevic, Cosmos SDK product lead, to discuss the development philosophy behind the Cosmos Hub and how appchains evolved over time.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Marko’s background  Cosmos SDK’s history and high-level overview  Cosmos SDK modules and VMs  Ethereum’s &amp; Cosmos’ development philosophies  Cosmos SDK value prop and use cases  Cosmos SDK vs. other frameworks (e.g. Substrate)  Token value accrual and the fragmentation dilemma  Using the Cosmos SDK to build rollups  Cosmos SDK vs. Avalanche’s HyperSDK  Adoption of fraud proofs and validity proofs by the Cosmos SDK  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/mark0baricevic">Marko Baricevic on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmos">Cosmos on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmos_sdk">Cosmos SDK on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/interchain_io">Interchain Foundation on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/binary_builders">Binary Builders on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Meher Roy &amp; Felix Lutsch.
