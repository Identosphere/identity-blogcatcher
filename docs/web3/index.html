  Seed Fund V: Forging the Future  <p>Announcing Sequoia’s fifth seed fund, and now accepting applications to Arc America Spring ’23.</p>  <p>By Team Sequoia</p><p>Published January 18, 2023</p>  



 
<p>Today, we are excited to announce our fifth dedicated seed fund to support the next generation of early-stage founders. The $195M fund enables seed investments across the U.S. and Europe, and also includes investments made in future Arc cohorts. <a href="http://sequoiacap.com/arc">Arc</a>, a catalyst for outlier founders at the pre-seed and seed stage, will expand from two cohorts to three in 2023. With curriculum taught by experienced partners and operators, as well as a tight-knit, curated community, Arc is purpose-built to increase founders’ chances of enduring success. The Arc America spring session will run March 6th to April 19th. Admitted companies will receive $500K-1M in funding at the start of the program. We are <a href="https://arc.sequoiacap.com/apply">now accepting applications</a> through February 5th (11:59PM PT).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over 50 years, we have experienced every cycle of economic euphoria and economic gloom. While markets gyrate, outlier founders building outlier companies persist. They embrace constraints, unlock creative advantages, make technological leaps and are determined to endure. Airbnb, Block, Stripe and WhatsApp all emerged during the Great Recession. We are confident that the next legends are being formed in this moment and we strive to be their first true believers.</p>



<p>As we launch Seed Fund V, Sequoia partners on the Early team share a few emerging tech themes that have them excited about the decade ahead:<br></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/">Stephanie Zhan</a><br>“AI will be the most important theme of the next decade, driven by the scale of data, new technological breakthroughs in generative models and advancements in compute. Github Copilot has proven that we can make even top developers 10x better at what they do; ChatGPT has shown how powerful these products can be and how excited consumers are to use them. Both are just the beginning of interesting applications to come. I’m excited to see how foundation models, and a vibrant ecosystem of applications built around them will fundamentally transform every category we know of today: developer tools and infrastructure, search, the collaboration and productivity suite, games and entertainment, the creative suite, biology… to name just a few.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/alfred-lin/">Alfred Lin<br></a>“AR will lead a revolution in the physical world. VR will change the way we have an immersive experience at work and play. Potentially the next consumer platform to drive wide-scale innovation, we could enter a world where we work and play through the “lens” of AR/VR glasses. The hardware is getting better and better: brick headsets to portable headsets, and lightweight glasses will be coming soon. One day, those glasses will be replaced with daily contacts. Imagine having all of the power of your smartphone piped through your eyes constantly. Imagine combining that power with AI algorithms to surface relevant information, suggest creative ideas and options, improve your every decision, and make your life more fulfilled, fun and entertaining.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstanine Buhler</a><br>“Enterprise AI and the data stack are promising areas for the next decade, because the virtuous data cycle is the new network effect and the sky’s the limit. The proliferation of AI into everyday office software has the potential to create a new kind of hybrid workforce that will increase individual productivity and enable leaner teams to do more. I’m also excited about enterprise fintech, because empowering the flow of money empowers commerce and progress.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/george-robson/">George Robson</a><br>“Given the recent bans on new combustion-engine sales in Europe starting in 2035 (and US states following suit) and energy prices rising at the fastest rate in 30-40 years, electrification has become a magnet theme for talent. With the global ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, power consumption is projected to triple over the next 30 years as formerly gas-powered appliances plug into the grid and living standards rise. Electrification is one of the first decarbonization levers, being the lowest-cost and easiest to implement in most sectors. We are seeing disruption at each point in this value chain, from generation (solar, batteries), to distribution (virtual power plants) and consumption (the connected home).”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder<br></a>“Data is becoming the lifeblood of not only decision making through analytics but also now how products and applications work around us. The products we use will be transformed by data and the new AI models that are more advanced and accessible than ever before. Both the data infrastructure and the product layers surrounding this change are ripe for new companies to be created. Outside of the world of data and bits, I’m also excited about the huge number of talented people who are looking at the world through a climate-focused lens and solving the looming climate challenges ahead of us. Many of these businesses are incredibly hard, require moving a lot of atoms, but the market size and potential to transform the way we live is enormous.”<br><br><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/jess-lee/">Jess Lee</a><br>“I’m excited for new developments in consumer social and self-expression. Social media has taken us a long way, but it is time to continue evolving how we interact, express ourselves, and build relationships. Two major changes are occurring: 1) People are seeking authenticity, meaningful connections and a sense of belonging in a post-pandemic world of increased loneliness and polarization. 2) AI has the potential to revolutionize content creation and self-expression—and creation tools are at the core of all consumer social. What’s next in a world where AI can generate a video you’d never be able to film yourself? Where you can livestream as an avatar that looks nothing like you, but frees you to be your real self? What would it be like to enter a chatroom filled with both NPCs and real people? The best founders will tap into our basic need for connection while pushing boundaries and avoiding the uncanny valley.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky&nbsp;</a><br>“Generative AI will transform all engineering workflows and the entire toolchain: from the IDE, to debugging, to CI/CD. Microservices have emerged as the predominant new application architecture. Every new platform solves some old problems but creates new ones: many microservices problems wait to be tackled, such as securing service to service communication. On the security side, identity and access control&nbsp; and automation are the biggest pains for many CISOs. Reasoning who should have access to what applications and resources, and what level of access is a gnarly problem in search of good solutions. Security teams have all the visibility tools they need, but struggle to take action at scale on all the problems that need to be addressed.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/shaun-maguire/">Shaun Maguire</a><br>“First: hardware will always have my heart. The marriage of physics with a strong business model creates the largest moats and is intellectually exhilarating. Second: despite the challenges facing crypto (both in terms of token prices and public perception) I’m still very drawn to the space. If hardware is the marriage of physics with a business model, crypto is the marriage of mathematics with money. And as someone who has spent a lot of time in the developing world, I think many in the developed world underestimate how broken money is for much of the planet. Finally, I’m excited about bringing technology to legacy industries. Many of the largest industries still have relatively low software penetration. To crack one of these nuts requires a strong, unique insight about how to wedge in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a><br>“Suddenly computers can read and write. Language is central to how people do their work and interact with others in their personal lives, so I’m beyond excited to see how founders will take advantage of generative AI to build products we can’t even imagine today. That’s not to mention the world of images, where everyone from consumers to product designers can find reasons to have fun with or do work more effectively with generative models. Or the world of code, where 10x better code generation can empower technical people and aspiring toolmakers alike. Across the board in AI, including in infrastructure and developer tools, I think we’re in for a thrilling new wave of technology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a><br>“Biotechnology is undergoing a manifold revolution, driven by increasingly sophisticated computational capabilities, much-needed laboratory and workflow automations, and a deeper understanding of how we can interact with even the most fundamental building blocks of life. The applications will transform our world, from healthcare to the food we eat and the clothes we wear. I am excited to partner with the data, software and infrastructure founders who will help power that transformation, from conception to commercialization. In a similarly regulatorily complex space, I remain excited about innovations in financial services, both within the sector itself as well as the incorporation of fintech into new businesses.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/mike-vernal/">Mike Vernal</a><br>“It’s increasingly clear that AI will define the fifth major epoch of computing (after the Mainframe, PC, Internet and Mobile). I’m really interested in how this is going to redefine the consumer landscape. I think the way we make decisions—what to buy, where to go, what to do—will change dramatically as we develop personalized models with long-term memory, personalization and context. I think entertainment—both video and games—will move towards infinite, personalized depth. And I think who we connect with (and how we connect) is going to change massively. Imagine being able to find and connect with your nearest neighbors in some high-dimensional space, regardless of where they might live in the world. I’m very excited by short-term pragmatists, long-term optimists thinking about this space.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/roelof-botha/">Roelof Botha</a><br>“We’ve entered a new era of tech where, due to the return of a higher interest rate environment, there is renewed focus on operating efficiency and cash flow. Cost advantages are often overlooked and underestimated as the source of sustainable advantage in technology businesses. I’m excited to partner with founders who can build great products to solve customer problems while simultaneously innovating to build exceptional businesses. Many companies are likely to take advantage of the tailwinds that are bringing down costs across a range of sectors, such as automation, artificial intelligence, and the decreasing cost of genetic sequencing. Developer productivity alone has the potential to improve exponentially, with AI based co-pilots enabling transformation and disruption across a broad range of sectors.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/luciana-lixandru/">Luciana Lixandru</a><br>“Thanks to AI, automation and the ability to start a legendary business from anywhere, we’re at the very beginning of a transformational shift in what technology will unlock for companies and consumers. This is a great moment for outlier founders, with a deep desire to fix a problem, who don’t see things the world in terms of how easy something might be, to build their company. With every early founder, I ask myself—what is the dream scenario? If the stars align, what could this company achieve? Experience and history shows innovation happens in all cycles—I’m excited about the founders emerging from this one.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/cornelius-menke/">Cornelius Menke&nbsp;</a><br>“The industrial world is currently undergoing a tremendous shift impacted by two mega trends: (1) We see an increasing disruption of global supply chains via the pandemic and geopolitical events that revert the decade-long offshoring trend towards more localized operations. (2) The race to net zero emission is pushing the industrial backbone of the world to rethink products in ways that combine ecological ambitions with a robust business model to also endure economically challenging times. I am excited to partner with founders who accelerate this transition by deploying automation solutions, optimizing procurement, improving engineering collaboration or rethinking these products from first principles.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bill-coughran/">Bill Coughran</a><br>“With rapid advances in machine learning / artificial intelligence and computing both large and mobile, ubiquitous computing will re-emerge as a reality, not just futuristic proofs of concepts. Also, adaptive consumer and enterprise offerings creating new long-term businesses will emerge. As always for a founder or an investor, there will be the challenge of separating the wheat from the chaff.”</p>

So to kick off the year, in this blogpost we will go over how the Nym mixnet can be used and integrated right now — highlighting how the Nym community is driving usage and ways you can get involved.</p> Nym for your everyday&nbsp;apps <p><a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a> is a desktop application (in beta) that makes the mixnet usable with a variety of day-to-day applications. It sends traffic from Telegram chat, Keybase, Electrum wallet and Blockstream green wallet, through the mixnet — with an increasing number of apps being integrated. NymConnect uses something called a SOCKS5 proxy to send traffic from your app, through the mixnet to privacy-enhance your&nbsp;apps!</p><p>Do you have suggestions for other apps that you would like integrated into NymConnect? Reach out on your now privacy-enhanced <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> and let us&nbsp;know!</p><p>We have also released a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk">Nym SDK</a> (typescript) to bring the power of the mixnet to any browser-based application. Try it out for yourself in this <a href="https://chat-demo.nymtech.net/">chat app&nbsp;demo</a>!</p><p>The community has started building apps, with No Trust Verify taking the lead with an anonymous text sharing&nbsp;service:</p>  <a href="http://paste.notrustverify.ch/">Pastenym — anon text sharing&nbsp;service</a>  <p>We have given a first round of Developer Grants to support more user facing apps, which include private IoT hub providers, privacy-preserving file sharing and an accessible interface for interacting with Nym and&nbsp;more…</p><p>What apps would you like us to support next? Jump in our <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a> and make a suggestion for our next round of developer grants!</p> Nym for blockchains <p>The Nym mixnet protects traffic across the entire internet, but it was always the plan that Web3 integrations would come early. Why? Because decentralised systems are especially vulnerable to network layer surveillance. But also because many of the people and projects in Web3 are highly motivated to correct the issues of Web 2.0, including the lack of privacy and the surveillance business&nbsp;model!</p><p>Inspired by the drama around Infura gathering IP addresses, we have seen community members step up and immediately write an <a href="https://github.com/noot/nym-ethtx">Ethereum transaction submitter</a> and shortly after an <a href="https://github.com/EdenBlockVC/spook">Ethereum RPC mixer</a> making Ethereum available over the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Meanwhile, our own developer relations team is currently busy writing a proof-of-concept Cosmos broadcaster, which will be available soon — extending network layer privacy to the Cosmos ecosystem!</p><p>The Nym mixnet can be plugged into any chain to protect transactions from traffic pattern analysis and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Which blockchain would you like to see privacy enhanced next? Join one of our communities below and make a suggestion!</p><p>A special thanks to the fantastic <a href="https://twitter.com/PineapplePr0xy">Pineapple Proxy</a> crew who have assembled this <a href="https://notrustverify.github.io/awesome-nym/">Awesome Nym list</a>&nbsp;!</p><p>Don’t forget to give us your suggestions on the above questions and help us help you protect your privacy! <a href="http://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a>, <a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> or one of the communities below.</p> Communities   <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">🌎 English</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymchina">🇨🇳 中文</a>  <a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian">🇷🇺 Русский</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese">🇯🇵 Japan</a>  <a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey">🇹🇷 Türkçe</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymvietnam">🇻🇳 Tiếng&nbsp;Việt</a>  <a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH">🇪🇸 Spanish</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese">🇵🇹 Portuguese</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymkorean">🇰🇷 Korean</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymfrench">🇫🇷 Français</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymger">🇩🇪 Deutsch (Unofficial)</a>  <a href="https://t.me/Nym_Persian">🇮🇷 Persian (Unofficial)</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymthai">🇹🇭 Thai (Unofficial)</a>   Tools   <a href="https://chat-demo.nymtech.net/">Chat webapp</a>  <a href="https://github.com/EdenBlockVC/spook">Ethereum RPC&nbsp;mixer</a>  <a href="https://github.com/noot/nym-ethtx">Ethereum transaction submitter using&nbsp;Nym</a>  <a href="https://status.notrustverify.ch/grafana/d/CW3L7dVVk/nym-mixnet">Mixnet speed dashboard</a>  <a href="https://t.me/NodesGuru_bot">Mixnodes telegram monitoring bot — Nodes.Guru</a>  <a href="https://isnymup.com/">Is Nym mixnet&nbsp;up</a>  <a href="http://paste.notrustverify.ch/">Pastenym — anon text sharing&nbsp;service</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-usage-is-growing-and-it-is-community-led-36ac18b508a3">Nym usage is growing — and it is community led!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Dollar Digital Currencies Are Driving the Next Evolution of Money, Payments, and Finance  
<p>Ten years ago, I co-founded Circle with the vision that traditional money could be brought natively onto the internet in the form of digital currency and made available on open, interoperable, global networks. Ushering in a world of frictionless value exchange that mirrored the frictionless information exchange and communications that marked the first decades of the internet has animated Circle’s work ever since.</p>

<p>We are entering a new frontier in biology and medicine unparalleled in human history, with breakthrough advances in gene editing, computational methods, and cell therapies. At the same time, our overall capability of understanding and manipulating biology is improving exponentially. BlueYard’s strategy around biology is based on the premise that humankind’s ability to engineer biology will not only fundamentally transform how we diagnose, treat, and manage diseases, but also will reinvent how we produce new materials and the food required to support human life and sustain our planet. In short: from cost digression to programmability: biology has and is undergoing several step-function changes. In recognition of these step-function changes, over the last years, we have backed a dozen companies in the space — ranging from <a href="https://www.bit.bio/news/bit-bio-secures-41-5-million-of-funding-from-top-life-sciences-investors">cellular reprogramming</a> to <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/origin-bio-b3932d07b50b">sustainable materials</a>.</p><p>We believe tomorrow’s industry-defining biology companies will be founded by technologists and scientists who are building the interconnected elements that can become the fabric of our future (see our <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/an-evolution-blueyards-v2-thesis-a-new-website-gm-new-york-84080f7b191d">v2 thesis</a>). We are excited about empowering this next generation of founders. Last year we launched our first <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/welcoming-blueyards-first-bio-fellows-999fdc13d373">fellowship</a> in biology and science where we work side by side with a few exceptional individuals. As part of our goal to foster more innovation at the frontiers of science and technology at the earliest stages, today we are announcing our newest collaboration by partnering with <a href="https://nucleate.xyz/">Nucleate</a>, a student-led non-profit organization dedicated to empowering the next generation of biotech leaders, with chapters spanning 23 geographic regions and participation from over 120 academic institutions, providing early funding for teams in the Nucleate program (<a href="https://nucleatehq.medium.com/nucleate-announces-2m-in-venture-prizes-for-european-activator-teams-in-partnership-with-blueyard-aa82026dbb9d">read more here</a>). Via our partnership with Nucleate we plan to commit a pool of $2 million in SAFE agreements to fund the next generation of founders that have made it through the organization’s six-month Activator Program during 2023. The objective is to back 10 to 20 new teams across the European ecosystem as they migrate from the academic lab to a commercial entity and build the new platforms that re-engineer our society’s biology experiences.</p>

If you enjoy reading these newsletters, please be sure to <a href="https://a16zcrypto.substack.com/">share this link</a> with others who are interested in going deeper on crypto, web3, and the future of the internet.

Big theme: progressive decentralization <p>Decentralization is more top of mind than ever. So in this special feature, we highlight the latest, just-published pieces — as well as previously published relevant resources on the topic — from us and others: </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/progressive-decentralization-a-high-level-framework/">A high-level framework for progressive decentralization</a> by Jad Esbers &amp; a16z crypto’s Scott Kominers (January 2023) — on designing for future decentralization up front, including guidance for both web3 projects and more traditional organizations on how and when to decentralize. </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/when-is-decentralizing-on-a-blockchain-valuable/">How decentralization through a blockchain can bring value to your business</a> [article] + <a href="https://youtu.be/OaZSCmjW_GE">the value of decentralization using blockchains</a> [video] by guest contributor Marco Reuter (January 2023) — on proposing a game theoretic model of a network where an entrepreneur decides to retain control of the network with centralized implementation through a regular company, or surrenders control to users with a decentralized implementation (through the “credible commitment” of a blockchain). But how do “lock-in effects” play here?</p><p><a href="https://future.com/web3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to/">Decentralization for builders: principles, models, how</a> by a16z crypto’s Miles Jennings (April 2022) — Decentralization is the difference between “don’t be evil” and “can’t be evil” when a company CEO decides one course or another on behalf of countless users. So Jennings shares specific models and principles of decentralization across several use cases, and how they apply in practice.</p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/">Progressive decentralization</a> by Jesse Walden (January 2020). While at a16z crypto, Walden shared a three-step process proposing progressive decentralization for those building applications on smart contract platforms — outlining three components of success: product/market fit, community participation, and sufficient decentralization (community ownership). [see also: This later followup, a tactical playbook from Marc Boiron on “<a href="https://variant.fund/articles/sufficient-decentralization/">Sufficient decentralization</a>” (August 2022).]</p><p>…more from around the web/ see also:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/decentralization">The era of decentralization</a> by Packy McCormick [also a16z crypto advisor] (November 2022) — Crypto is not the cause, but the symptom, of a larger trend towards decentralization as the world oscillates between centralization and decentralization… with progress sloping upward through the turns. And the current era of greater decentralization will play out on all fronts — from geopolitics and energy to finance, education, journalism, and more — driven by technologies including the internet. But this newly decentralized era will also require new infrastructure and organizing principles that can adapt to the complexity inherent in decentralized systems.</p> 2. Big ideas 2023: Just a few of the things we’re excited about in crypto <p>Michael Blau, Joseph Bonneau, Noah Citron, Valeria Nikolaenko, Carra Wu, Guy Wuollet, Michael Zhu</p><p>This list from some of our a16z crypto partners across the engineering, research, and investing teams has something for everyone:</p>  <p>from new possibilities for developers — such as “blockchain’s mobile moment”, to more developer onboarding for zero knowledge&nbsp;</p>  <p>to key advancements such as VDF hardware; and advancements in zero knowledge, multi-party computation, and post-quantum crypto</p>  <p>to “non-transferable tokens” and various web3 applications that will be built on top of not just this primitive, but also with decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials</p>  <p>as well as other trends crossing industries… including on-chain gaming, and decentralized energy.&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/big-ideas-2023/">see the list</a></p><p>related:&nbsp;On the theme of “blockchain’s mobile moment”, see also <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/building-helios-ethereum-light-client/">Helios</a> — a fast, portable, and secure Ethereum light client written in Rust that allows users to access secure chain data from any device, including mobile phones and browser extensions — which we made <a href="https://github.com/a16z/helios">available to the public</a> to build <a href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1589773604291772416">on</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1595895860176773121">more</a>. </p> 3. Big journeys &amp; paths: Creators, creativity, technology <p>Bob Iger, Chris Dixon, Sonal Chokshi; Emily Yang/ pplpleasr</p><p>We sat down with longtime CEO of Disney Bob Iger (in an intimate chat recorded in Los Angeles a few months ago) to discuss the interplay between technology, content, and distribution… Especially as it evolved from TV and cable, to web 1.0/ internet, to web 2.0 including streaming and advertising models, and now to web3; and other emerging technologies like VR and AR. The conversation also touches on other top-of-mind topics for many in web3 and beyond, including: managing brands and IP; decentralized orgs; remote work; "build vs buy" and navigating the innovator’s dilemma; and how to manage creatives, give creative feedback, and build creative processes for innovation. (Plus some fun behind-scenes details on Black Panther, Avatar, and more!)<br><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/bob-iger-creator-content-technology-distribution-brand-disney-web1-web2-web3">listen here</a></p><p>Hearing directly from creators: Multidisciplinary artist Emily Yang aka <a href="https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1">pplpleasr</a> went from working on visual effects — her credits include feature films like Batman v Superman, Wonder Woman, and Star Trek Beyond as well as commercials and game cinematics — to defining “the look” of the DeFi movement and creating Fortune magazine’s first NFT cover. Now the co-founder of decentralized content studio and creator platform <a href="https://www.shibuya.xyz/">Shibuya</a>, Yang shared her journey as a creator — and the various forks, paths, and culmination of it all — in an interactive-storytelling talk at our recent Founders Summit. [You can also find a past talk with Yang on "Why DAOs matter for digital art", in conversation with a16z crypto's Arianna Simpson, at our NFT Summit (May 2021) <a href="https://youtu.be/A4iCiHgWEkM">here</a>.]<br><a href="https://youtu.be/WDFMZ9GYjDk">watch the talk</a><br><br><br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/22-top-pieces-from-2022/">2022 &gt; 2023</a></p><p>--Sonal Chokshi and the a16z crypto team<br><br>You’re receiving this newsletter since you signed up for it on our website(s) or elsewhere (you can opt out using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

<p>(Re-posted from MetaMask original&nbsp;blog)</p><p>Snaps is the roadmap to making MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world. As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel Snaps being built&nbsp;today.</p> Web3Auth Snap <p>Snap Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/">https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/</a></p><p>Why did you build&nbsp;it?</p><p>At Web3Auth, we’ve always believed that multi-factor authentication is the best way to secure crypto assets, and is much better than seed phrases. When we saw at ETHBogota that the latest build of MetaMask Snaps allowed Snaps to provide external key management capabilities, we decided to challenge ourselves to integrate MPC tech into MetaMask at the Sozu House hackathon.</p><p>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</p>  Our goal was to allow a new user to login and set up 2FA to access their account in MetaMask. Subsequently, under the hood, whenever they try to sign a transaction, our MPC SDK does a threshold ECDSA signature. This is done by splitting a private key into two parts: a local share that’s stored in the snap and one that’s stored on a signing server. Over several communication rounds, the signing server and the snap should be able to jointly sign an Ethereum transaction and have it be confirmed on the Goerli network. Unlike seed phrases, this setup does not have a single point of failure that leads to irreversible loss of keys: if the user’s laptop is hacked, or if the signing server is hacked, the user does not lose their private&nbsp;key.  Like every other snap, our snap consists of two parts, the actual snap package, and a page that loads/interacts with the snap. Our ideal user flow was to keep all key management interactions within the Metamask extension’s UI, but due to limitations in permissions, we could not do that. Instead, the user authentication happens outside of the snap, and then once that is complete, we migrate the state into the snap. Subsequently, we hook into the RPC engine of Metamask and respond to transaction requests by using our MPC SDK and the migrated state in the snap to generate threshold ECDSA signatures on the transactions. Surprisingly, we were done with the state migration part within the first few hours of the hackathon and were just left with the signing functionality.  The rest of the process can be further split into two major&nbsp;tasks:  Repurposing existing Web3 providers with our MPC SDK to handle the incoming transaction requests  Getting the MPC SDKs running in the Metamask Snaps SES environment  If you’re familiar with how Metamask works, or how other wallets function, you’ll know that signing an Ethereum transaction requires much more work than just using a private key to sign a message. A lot of work goes into forming the message object that is to be signed. Each transaction follows a particular format that’s specific to each chain and transaction type, has legacy behaviors that need to be supported for backward compatibility, has to get information about the current gas prices, has to calculate the gas to be used / gas limits, and also has to track the account nonce, etc. Thankfully, most existing Web3 providers already do these things out of the box. However, in order to get our threshold signature library to work well with these SDKs we had to dig deep into every single module and replace the eth-sig-util library’s signing functions with our own threshold signature library signing functions, which took a significant amount of time. In addition, because our MPC SDK was chain-agnostic, and didn’t account for Ethereum-specific checks, we also had to reverse engineer and reimplement checks from the eth-sig-util libraries which we had replaced. For example, EIP-2 specifies that the s-value in an ECDSA signature must not be larger than n/2 + 1, where n is the order of the secp256k1 elliptic curve, in order to prevent transaction malleability attacks, which requires ECDSA signing libraries to do a “flip” of the signature if its s-value falls outside of this&nbsp;range.  Another challenge we faced was getting our MPC SDKs to run in the Metamask Snaps environment. Our MPC SDK uses wasm (compiled from rust) to run efficiently in the browser. Due to the multiple rounds of communication between the SDK and the signing server, it also uses Socket.IO to communicate to avoid the overhead of HTTP headers. While attempting to load our wasm code into the snap, we ran into some strange issues with mixed argument types in the wasm methods. Unfortunately, wasm debugging tools are still very lacking, with error messages being unhelpful and uninformative (eg. “Uncaught RuntimeError: unreachable”). In the end, we hacked our way around this limitation by accepting all mixed inputs arguments as strings, and parsing them as integers/byte arrays within the wasm code itself. Another problem we encountered was that socket.io did not work in the Metamask Snaps environment. Socket.IO is a separate library/specification built on top of normal WebSockets that handles things like connection upgrading, dropped connections, fallbacks to long polling, etc. which are very helpful when using WebSockets in production environments. Unfortunately, we could not get Socket.IO’s libraries to run in the Metamask Snap environment. As such, we had to fallback to normal WebSockets, and also rewrite the signing server to use default WebSockets instead of socket.io, and fallback to a polling strategy if the websocket had&nbsp;issues.  <p>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your&nbsp;team?</p><p>Zhen and I are the cofounders of Web3Auth, and our company specializes in providing intuitive, secure, and non-custodial key management solutions. We believe that good security must be easy to use and invisible, or it will not get adopted widely. That is why we are huge proponents of using multi-factor authentication for private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</p><p>We tried Metamask Snaps about a year ago, but unfortunately, it didn’t have the capabilities to allow us to extend the private key management functions within MetaMask back then. With the introduction of SIP-2 recently (thank you Olaf!), which allows snaps to extend MetaMask’s keyring, we’ve been very excited to see what’s possible! While building our snap, I also explored the SES system that MetaMask Snaps is based on, and I think it’s a very solid foundation for MetaMask to act as a platform for developers to add functionality through&nbsp;Snaps.</p><p>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other&nbsp;wallets?</p><p>The extensibility! I think MetaMask Snaps provides a secure interface for developers to experiment and augment MetaMask without compromising the security of the MetaMask extension itself. Unlike other types of projects, wallets require high standards of security, which means merging in new functionality from third-parties is always a long, arduous process of code review and audits, which stifles innovation. MetaMask Snaps allows the MetaMask team to continue building a secure product, while still allowing external developers to experiment and extend its functionality.</p><p>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your&nbsp;team?</p><p>I think Snaps is definitely the way forward, allowing people to build functionality while still keeping the base MetaMask extension secure. There are a few kinks now but improvements are coming every day but I think it’s very exciting&nbsp;overall.</p><p>What does Snaps mean to&nbsp;you?</p><p>I hope that adding multi-factor authentication capabilities to MetaMask through snaps helps the millions of mainstream users on MetaMask to more securely manage their accounts and prevents them from falling victim to scams and hacks. MFA is already doing this today for billions of Web2 users, and we want to bring those secure best practices to&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3&nbsp;space?</p><p>In general, I think Snaps represents a realistic way for MetaMask to open up its codebase for others to contribute to it without compromising security.</p><p>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask&nbsp;Snaps?</p><p>Just try it! It may seem a little new but it’s been very approachable so far and the support for it is great on the ConsenSys discord channel for Snaps. Lots of amazing devs are working on it and if you want to be part of the conversation in shaping Snaps, now is the time to be building on it and giving feedback!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-snap-integrating-multi-factor-authentication-into-metamask-4e57f07af77">Web3Auth MPC Snap: Integrating Multi-Factor Authentication Into MetaMask</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today we are detailing changes to Brave Rewards that will land in Brave version 1.48.x, which is scheduled to be <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Brave-Release-Schedule">released early February 2023</a>. Developers and early adopters who use our Nightly and Beta versions, meant for testing and development, can currently get a preview of these changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the inception of Brave Rewards, more than 1,000 advertisers have run over 5,900 Brave Ads campaigns, and millions of Brave Rewards users have earned BAT for their attention to those ads. Our <a>transparency page</a> shows the BAT we purchase from the open market to distribute to Brave Rewards users for those ads where we are paid in fiat or other crypto currencies. Brave Rewards users have also contributed more than 36 million BAT to their favorite <a href="https://creators.brave.com">registered content creators</a>, helping to support a better, more private Web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes to Brave Rewards will help us combat abuse so that we can better deliver on our promises to legitimate users and creators. They will also allow us to focus our efforts on building a more decentralized future by eliminating our current centralized “virtual BAT” system.</p>

 What’s changing for Users? 
<p>To begin earning and accruing <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org">BAT</a> for Brave Ads, you will need to connect a custodial account to your Brave Rewards profile with upcoming version 1.48. Brave currently works with three custodial account provider partners: <a href="https://gemini.com">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://uphold.com">Uphold</a>, and <a href="https://bitflyer.jp">bitFlyer</a> in Japan. Requiring a custodial account gives us a place to send you your BAT earnings, and allows us to eliminate our centralized “virtual BAT” system (see “Sunsetting virtual BAT” below for more).</p>
<p>If you’d just like to support creators as part of a more private Web, you can do so without ever connecting a custodial account by opting into Brave Rewards and using the new “creator support only” experience. A share of the ad revenue will be earmarked for creators and distributed by Brave as part of the monthly payout to <a href="https://creators.brave.com">verified creators</a>. If you want to give more, connecting a custodial account will allow you to use BAT you’ve purchased elsewhere to support creators in the Brave Rewards ecosystem, and will also unlock the Tips feature.</p>

<p>What it looks like when you start to connect a custodial account&nbsp;</p>

 Sunsetting virtual BAT 
<p>After these changes to Brave Rewards in 1.48.x, we will also be sunsetting our centralized “virtual BAT” (“vBAT”) system, used primarily for unverified users.</p>

 What is vBAT? 
<p>When you use Brave Rewards without a custodial account connected, the earnings you accrue are in something called “vBAT” (virtual BAT). vBAT isn’t BAT on the blockchain; instead, it’s a centralized point system backed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature">Chaumian blind signature</a> “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecash">ecash</a>” scheme. These points can be contributed to creators or redeemed for BAT if and when you connect a custodial account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you are an unverified user and have “5 BAT” in your Brave Rewards balance after claiming your Brave Ads earnings. That “5 BAT” is actually vBAT, stored as cryptographically signed certificates on your device. When you “verify” your Brave Rewards profile by connecting a custodial account, your device submits those 5 vBAT certificates to our servers. From there, our servers utilize the APIs of our licensed custodial partners to deposit 5 BAT into your custodial account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 When is vBAT going away? 
<p>At the earliest, vBAT will go away sometime in April 2023. However, we want to ensure users have time to adjust to this change, so we will share more exact dates soon. With 1.48.x, existing users without a custodial account connected will receive a final vBAT payout for any February earnings in March.</p>
<p>Once the sunset deadline for vBAT is reached, vBAT will no longer be considered valid, and will be removed from the Brave Rewards experience. This means that even if you’re on an old version of Brave that still shows a vBAT balance, that vBAT can no longer be redeemed after the deadline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the vBAT sunset deadline draws nearer, unverified/non-connected users will see messages with more information and a specific date:</p>

 Users in unsupported regions 
<p>Although our goal is to maximize the number of <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/6539887971469">supported countries for connecting a custodial account to Brave Rewards</a> before sunsetting vBAT, the unfortunate reality is that there will still be some countries without an available custodial option. For example, Germany is currently not serviced by any of our custodial partners, and will likely not become supported before the vBAT sunset deadline. In other cases, some serviced regions are impossible for us or our custodial partners to support due to unsustainable economics. You can find a <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/10950603397645">list of these unserviced or unsupported countries here</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re in an unsupported country, you will still have the option to contribute your vBAT balances to verified creators you’d like to support, and will see messages like this:</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>vBAT deadline messaging for users in regions with no available custodial option</p>
<p>We understand that this may be frustrating for users in unsupported regions, and we apologize for these circumstances. We will continue to work with both existing and potential new custodial partners to maximize regional support for Brave Rewards as feasible.&nbsp;</p>

 Why is vBAT being removed? 
<p>First, vBAT was never intended to serve as a long-term store of BAT. A core assumption in our early Brave Ads abuse modeling was that vBAT would expire in order to prevent bad actors from accumulating funds across a large number of profiles, then simply waiting for an illicit avenue to open up to drain these funds out of the system. Although vBAT was originally planned to have a rolling expiry, we instead delayed it as long as possible to minimize the impact on users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, because vBAT is stored locally on users’ devices after it is issued, it is impossible to tell whether some vBAT has been lost to a discarded device, abandoned upon Brave uninstall, or lost due to profile deletion, undermining the possibility of transparent and accurate accounting within the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, with the removal of the legacy unverified user state and the introduction of the new “creator support only” experience, vBAT is no longer necessary. Removing the centralized vBAT system will allow us to focus our efforts on building a more transparent and decentralized future for Brave Rewards.</p>

 Decentralization after vBAT 
<p>We’ve already shared details about our research on decentralizing the Brave Ads system in Brave Rewards through initiatives like <a>THEMIS</a>. Eliminating our centralized vBAT system represents another step in this direction. For example, in place of vBAT contributions accounted for in our centralized vBAT system, users will, in the future, be able to send on-chain BAT directly from their self-custody Brave Wallet (or other Web3 wallets, such as MetaMask) to creators’ Web3 addresses, including Ethereum, Solana, and others. We’d also like to allow users to purchase products—such as <a>Brave Firewall + VPN</a>, <a>Brave Talk Premium</a>, etc.—with on-chain BAT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a similar vein, many users have asked whether—instead of having to connect a custodial account—it will be possible to connect Brave Wallet directly to Brave Rewards, and receive BAT payouts directly to one’s Brave Wallet addresses. This is a future we’d welcome and are continuing to explore. However, in order to comply with current financial regulations (such as FinCEN and OFAC requirements, or equivalent regulators outside the United States), payouts at this time must first go through a regulated custodian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that once you receive BAT into your custodial account, you can always withdraw it on-chain to your Brave Wallet. In the future, we plan to bring Brave Rewards and Brave Wallet closer together to form a more unified user experience. More details to come.</p>

 What’s changing for Creators? 
<p>If you’re a registered <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creator</a>, we will be removing the “balance” indicator in the Brave Creators dashboard. The balance you see in your Creators dashboard mostly keeps track of vBAT that was contributed to you but is still pending to be paid out to your custodial account, so will no longer be needed.&nbsp;</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Updated creators dashboard without vBAT balance indicator</p>
<p>Note that any BAT previously paid out to your custodial account is unrelated to these changes. You will continue to be able to receive monthly Creators payouts and direct tips from users to your connected custodial account, even without the vBAT balance indicator.</p>
<p>Following these changes, we also have plans to redesign the overall Brave Creators experience. Here’s an early design preview of what your Brave Creators dashboard might look like in the future:</p>



    



    


    


    
    


 Do I need to do anything with my Brave Rewards profile? 

 Existing verified/connected users 
<p>If you already have a custodial account—like an Uphold, Gemini, or bitFlyer account—connected to your Brave Rewards profile, then no action is required. The Brave Rewards experience you know and love will continue as you currently know it.</p>

 Existing unverified/non-connected users&nbsp; 
<p>If you don’t yet have a custodial account connected to your Brave Rewards profile and you’re in a <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/6539887971469-Supported-regions-for-verifying-Brave-Rewards-with-a-custodial-account-provider-">country that’s supported by one of our custodial partners for connecting to Brave Rewards</a>, we encourage you to connect one as soon as you can. This will ensure that any vBAT balance you have as an unverified user will be transferred to your custodial account as BAT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important: All unverified users will eventually be transitioned over to the new “creator support only” Rewards experience once virtual BAT has been sunsetted. Any remaining vBAT balance you have as an unverified user will be lost when this transition occurs. So, we recommend you connect a custodial account or contribute your vBAT to your favorite verified creators before this happens.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Rewards experience for unverified users before being transitioned to the new “creator support only” experience</p>
<p>Note that if you’re an unverified/non-connected user, your “Estimated earnings” counter will be blank once you upgrade to a version of Brave that includes these changes, as unverified users will no longer be accruing vBAT for themselves, and instead helping to support creators if Brave Ads is enabled. Again, this is because you will only begin to earn once you’ve connected a custodial account to Brave Rewards.</p>

 Summary 
 
 
<p>As of browser version 1.48.x (slated for February 2023), users who want to earn BAT from Brave Ads and accrue a balance must first connect a custodial account (Uphold or Gemini; and bitFlyer in Japan) to their Brave Rewards profile.</p>
 
 
<p>Brave Rewards users without a connected custodial account can still support creators by viewing Brave Ads—they just can’t accrue BAT for themselves until they connect a custodial account. (This is the new “creator support only” experience.)</p>
 
 
<p>Sometime after 1.48.x, virtual BAT (“vBAT”) is going away. Unverified users will have time to connect a custodial account to redeem their vBAT or send that balance to their favorite verified creators before vBAT is eliminated. After the vBAT sunset deadline, any remaining unverified users will be transitioned over to the new “creator support only” experience. (Existing users with Brave Ads disabled will continue to have Brave Ads disabled when transitioned over to the new experience.)</p>
 
 
<p>At the earliest, vBAT will go away sometime in April 2023, but the exact date is TBD.</p>
 
 
<p>Although we will do our best to maximize the number of supported countries before the vBAT sunset deadline, <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/10950603397645">some countries will unfortunately have no available custodial option.</a> Users in unsupported regions will have time to contribute their existing vBAT balances to their favorite verified creators, and then will be able to continue using Rewards to support verified creators with the new “creator support only” experience.</p>
 
 
<p>If you have any questions about these upcoming changes, please join us on the <a href="https://community.brave.com/t/brave-rewards-changes/462431">official Brave&nbsp;Community forums.</a></p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is proud to support this ambitious grassroots project that aims to have global impact through local and regional actions. We can’t wait to see how this community of creators will learn and work together to elevate and disseminate news and stories that inspire, educate, and share the promise of Zcash and financial privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you to Ryan Taylor for working with ZF to bring this project to life!</p>



<p>In Ryan’s own words:</p>



<p>We are a global collective of content creators who care about privacy, Zcash, and building community. Together we will build a space to share information, skills and resources to aid production and publishing of content that covers the topics we care about. We want stories told by the people who are closest to the action, sharing their passion and lived experiences to bring privacy education and Zcash to every part of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ZF A/V Club will host regular online meetups and collaborate with local events to facilitate discussions on topics of interest to the global Zcash and privacy communities. With our focus on online audio/visual production this will be the time and place to learn more about the media needs and concerns of local Zcash and privacy-focused communities around the world and to take action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Events will be open and free, and could include many formats such as presentations, Q+A, AMA, workshops, troubleshooting, brainstorming or something else entirely. Every discussion, no matter which format, will maintain the Zcash focus on privacy as a topic and as a practice. Consent cannot be assumed.</p>



<p>The long-term goal of the ZF A/V Club is to establish a network of capable, ready and funded media producers to broadcast and share news about Zcash and privacy that is both locally relevant and globally consumed.&nbsp;</p>



 Empower and Amplify 



<p>We are a global community of voices and experiences.Through community we will empower and amplify every individual to tell the Zcash story through their own perspective, on their own terms.

<p>The Brave Browser has had support for <a>private browsing with Tor</a> since 2018 as a way to give our users a way to protect their network privacy.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>One request we have recently started to receive with increased frequency is support for Tor bridges. <a href="https://support.torproject.org/censorship/censorship-7/">Bridges</a> are a way for users to access the Tor network even when their government is blocking connections to the network. Starting with Brave 1.44, users in affected countries have had an easy way to circumvent these restrictions from the settings page:</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Once the desired bridge configuration is selected, new private windows with Tor will only attempt to connect to the Tor network via the specified bridge. More details can be found in our <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/7816553516045-How-do-I-use-Tor-bridges-in-Brave-">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to enabling our users to connect to bridges and relays graciously offered by volunteers in the Tor community, Brave will continue to contribute to increasing network capacity. Besides operating the <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/family:723E21FD6F91905E84E583D4619A2D1E282B8180">relays</a> we have been running since we launched private windows with Tor, we are now making it easy for our users to share their Internet connections with users in censored countries. Starting in version 1.47, Brave will enable users to install and turn on the <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/9059440641421">Snowflake extension</a> in a single click:</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>We are proud to be a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/membership/">member of the Tor Project</a> and are happy to be able to provide ways for our users to access the information they are looking for. Many of our websites, including <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a>, are available natively on the Tor network via <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4537609459469-List-of-Brave-Onion-Addresses">.onion addresses</a>.</p>
<p>Note that if your personal safety depends on remaining anonymous, you should use the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a> instead.</p>

Most users have more than a single wallet and tying users to a single wallet limits the experiences web3 can&nbsp;offer.</p><p>With our latest multi-wallet feature, Privy enables developers to link multiple wallets to one underlying user account. Play around with <a href="http://demo.privy.io">our demo</a> to see multi-wallet linking in&nbsp;action!</p><p>With multi-wallet linking, you&nbsp;unlock:</p>  Personalized user experiences: serve your users across all of their assets, whether in cold or hot wallets. NFT marketplaces can show a gallery across all assets; NFT games can cater gameplay to loot spread across&nbsp;wallets.  No more multi-account handling: gone are the days when users had to maintain separate accounts to operate across their wallets. Support web3 power users across their portfolio.  Simple authentication: your users can log in with any of their wallets, regardless of what device or browser they are using, so they never have to wait to access your&nbsp;app.  Multi-wallet interactions: enable your users to log in with one wallet and mint with another. Stop asking your users to choose between security and ease of&nbsp;use!  <p>Multi-wallet linking is an important pattern in making web3 more human, pioneered by apps like our friends at <a href="https://zapper.fi/">Zapper</a>. We’ve made it easy for any app to integrate this feature as the next important step in our progressive onboarding journey, enabling you to onboard all potential users, regardless of whether they have wallets, across desktop and mobile. With Privy, your user can log in with an email or social account, then connect one or more wallets when contextually relevant.

<p>I live in Philadelphia, home of Independence Hall, the Constitution Center, and the Liberty Bell. While I have my reservations about the actual intent of these documents, see Tim Scott’s article on the Constitution <a href="https://dissidentvoice.org/2017/05/the-duplicitous-u-s-constitution/">here</a>, I would love to see a public discussion of the nature of Constitutional rights in the twenty first century against the backdrop of the planned implementation of an extended reality regulated by a smart contract layer of cybernetic governance, a potent dose of snake oil that will be sold to us as a public good meant to save the planet from imminent destruction and birth a new “creative economy.” I speak briefly to this during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzUQzija-Z0&amp;t=0s">Tucson talk</a> Q&amp;A. This is a one-minute clip.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s a mayoral election cycle, so now would be an opportune moment to have such a discussion publicly and robustly.&nbsp; One of the candidates, <a href="https://helengym.com/">Helen Gym</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenGymPHL/status/872959651742089216">attended</a> the Barcelona “fearless” cities summit back in 2017. I wrote about the Barcelona digital public good / smart cities effort as part of my refugee series <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/07/12/mondragon-focolare-and-inclusive-capitalism-synthetic-pretenders-part-15b/">here</a>.</p>
<p>They can’t force us into their game without our consent. I believe their intent is to proceed as if they have it, but they don’t. The Web 3.0 / Smart Contract conversation must be had, and people need to be brought up to speed, so they can make informed decisions about what they may be giving away if they accept a shiny techno offer to live inside a world of programmable money and matter – not just for themselves, but for their children and the natural world.</p>
<p>I reconnected with someone this week who was interested in the idea and asked for ” a couple good phrases that conceptualize the scope of what’s coming more easily for folks.” This is what I came up with. Jason told me this morning that he thought it was a good, pithy summary. So, I’m putting it here to share.</p>
<p>In the planned future…</p>
<p>There will be new forms of money backed by things we love like toddlers, toddler’s futures. They will implement a global “learning economy” where investments in human capital improvement profit impact investors and create data that will be used to refine machine learning for artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>We live in an extended reality where the real world has an overlay of military technology (with cybernetic, psychological steering included) that runs on a global satellite network. That network will create a ubiquitous panopticon comprised of sensors and actuators that regulate natural life across the planet. Our actions, relations to one another, and behaviors are monitored via digital identity “a permanent record” on blockchain. Behaviors will be scored for KPI (key performance indicators) as set by e-government social contracts (UN Sustainable Development Goals, etc.) and corporate interests.</p>
<p>Our kids will be raised to compete in a global gig economy managed by artificial intelligence that will sort people as collections of skill tokens (or <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/05/28/soulbound-tokens-trust-networks-and-californias-big-test/">Soulbound Tokens)</a>. They will have to complete with people from around the world to do platform work, sometimes piloting remote robots for low wages and lacking any worker protections.</p>
<p>In their planned future, we will be citizens of a nation where Constitutional rights exist, but we can never drill down to them, because a deep layer of smart contracts (computer logic run on distributed ledgers) will have been put in place to keep us alienated from them. We will be citizens of a nation living under automated machine arbitration, the same as all nations of the world. Really, we will be citizens of the Web, Web 3.0.</p>
<p>In this future most people will be compelled to act as “agents” in simulated teams to solve “grand challenges” like climate catastrophe. Attempts will be made to remake humans as social insects for collective computation – all brain, no heart, no curiosity, no joy. These agents will inhabit a game where the rules change without notice, and the machines make the rules.</p>
<p>As in Yevgeny Zamyatin’s novel “We” written in 1921 that depicts a cybernetic reality where people live as numbers under the mathematical dictates of the Great Benefactor who ensures world “happiness” through consistency, harmony, uniformity, and regulation. In the world Zamyatin creates, imagination is excised by the machine for the “good” of its residents. My read aloud of “We” is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO7kFkMnr7i9oDB-a067c_NY">here</a>.</p>
<p>In closing, I invite you to listen to what Rev Lebaredian, an executive at Nvidia (a company that makes high-performance computing systems for video games and digital twin simulations), has to say about AI “realizing” children’s imaginary worlds and projecting them into his planned virtual world, the Omiverse. He frames AI as an enabler, but to my way of thinking it’s actually a thief. This clip is two minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this three-minute clip, members of the Open Metaverse podcast from Epic Games, Cesium, and Kronos discuss Nvidia’s technology combined with blockchain digital twins and supercomputing to explore alternate futures and bend time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do you live in Philly? Do you have the ear of some politicians? Do you want to engage in this conversation? Hit me up and let’s see what we can make happen.</p>
<p>PS: The Open Metaverse podcast that hosted Lebaredian is sponsored by the company <a href="https://youtu.be/O2yL1FULHgw?t=5369">Cesium</a> located on 11th Street in Philadelphia, just south of Market Street. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMxy_Xp34JM">Here</a> is our site visit to the Nvidia office in Boulder, CO last March where we talk about Maya the grand illusion and the meaning behind the company’s name and logo.</p>
<p>PPS: I wrote a scenario of what this world might look like back at the end of 2017 based on the story of two sisters going to school in a world of ubiquitous computing in Queens. I was less familiar with the particulars of the technologies , but I think it’s still pretty spot-on. If you want to check it out, here’s a link to the first installment of “Building Sanctuary.” Or check out a PDF of the whole series <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/building-sanctuary-pdf.pdf">here</a>.</p>

      Designing for the Developers        <p>By Megan Finnerty</p><p>Published January 5, 2023</p>        With a Finnish sensibility, Linear’s founders center software engineers in the development process.      



 
 
   
<p>Karri Saarinen remembers having his first strong reaction to design when he was 6 or 7. Saarinen is the co-founder of the software development tool Linear, a product known for its aesthetic point of view, and he says it happened while bike shopping with his family. “I would look at a lot of the bicycles and feel like, ‘Why are so many of these kind of ugly? I don’t like them,’” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And then I had this thought, like, ‘Why do people do this? Why, if you make all this, if you go to the effort of building this bicycle and then painting it, why do you make it ugly?’ I didn’t necessarily understand that there is some kind of process involved, or like you need some kind of taste.” Saarinen couldn’t have articulated this at the time, but as he grew older, he realized that an object that’s off in some way could be a product of bad processes—disrespecting the materials, time and labor that went into making it. In some ways, this reaction is specific to Saarinen, who says he’s always been conscious of his sense of taste: “When I look at things, I could see, ‘This could be better,’” he says. But in other ways, this is a distinctly Finnish way of seeing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saarinen, who runs Linear with fellow Finns and founders Jori Lallo and Tuomas Artman, says people in Scandinavia, Finland especially, are attuned to simplicity, with a preference for function and durability. Lallo echoes this, mentioning a memorable Finnish marketing campaign that said something to the effect that one (perfectly designed) stool is enough. “There’s more of a design sense overall … it’s everywhere,” Saarinen says. Although the founders live, at least part of the year, in America, Linear is a Finnish product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finland was occupied by Sweden and Russia for more than 750 years, and so, until relatively recently, it was a poor country with a culture of national solidarity. Upon independence in 1917, one of the ways the new country defined itself was through affordable, functional design that referenced the landscape. Finland was thick with birch and pine forests and dotted with countless lakes, so long before sustainability became a global buzzword, goods were made to be durable, from wood, and with little to no ornamentation. Even though Finland started to become wealthy during post-World War II rebuilding, industrialization didn’t take hold until the mid-1960s, almost 100 years after it spread in America. This informs a Finnish aesthetic that prizes craftsmanship, both as a process and as an end. Between the three of them, Lallo, Saarinen and Artman mentioned Finnish companies like Iittala, Artek and Fiskars as influences. And they talked about what they perceive to be a specifically Finnish way of caring for others through designing objects and spaces. “Maybe it’s part of [being] such a small country that there’s this high sense of common good and equality as values,” says Lallo. “I think that also translates to [the idea] that good design should be accessible for everyone.”</p>

<p>Linear helps people build software more elegantly and efficiently so they can make products that are more intuitive and more enjoyable for the world to use. Saarinen is passionate about Linear’s mission because, he says, software is only becoming more important. If Linear succeeds in supporting more thoughtfully designed software, billions of daily users will benefit in ways that are subtle but cumulative. His vision is one in which countless annoyances are smoothed in the digital world, where both engineers and users feel, if not actual pleasure, the absence of frustration. “Unfortunately, I don’t think that software has gotten a lot better necessarily … in terms of the quality. A lot of people have problems with the products, and there’s bugs, and there’s products that are kind of messy, or just not really considered. Back in the day, care for the craft was there and we would like to see more of it.”</p>



<p>He thinks this “hacky” software is an outgrowth of the systems that dictate how it’s made, and Linear is designed to push engineers in a different direction through how the tool tracks issues, manages projects and creates roadmaps, among other capabilities. Linear’s main competitor is Atlassian’s Jira, which has more than 180,000 customers and is considered the legacy standard for software-development management. But Linear is a rebuttal to Jira. It is notably fast and only minimally customizable, defined by its meticulous design—in the fonts and colors, but also in the logic of how the product functions. Built for Agile workflows, Jira is exhaustively customizable in a way that some engineers find onerous. In contrast, the first version of Linear was designed to serve small teams, creating software with specific points of view. Linear <a href="https://linear.app/readme">calls Agile outdated</a>. Agile has matured over decades from vocal rebel to status quo, which is both the opportunity and risk of Linear’s point of view. “We want to show there’s a different way, because, in our experience with most of the top tech companies, they’re not using Agile,” Saarinen says. “It’s not a thing.”</p>



<p>Linear’s founders want to do more than support better software creation. They want to bring back a sense of dignity to software creation, a job that today, Saarinen observes, can feel disconnected from a larger purpose. They want software engineers to feel satisfaction with and control over their work, something overreliance on project managers has chipped away at, Saarinen says. The founders want to elevate pride in craft, making something thoughtfully instead of quickly. This sense of quality has been lost, Saarinen says, to all those management layers, to “moving fast and breaking things,” and to endless process customization. It’s as though, he says with teasing indignation, the industry hasn’t evolved its practices since Jira launched in 2002.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Linear’s early adopters were the founders’ friends, people working at small tech startups. They liked how it was sleek, built-for-them and fast.  The product’s focus on craft, and on inspiring delight in users with focused functionality and design at first resonated with small and then growth stage companies, says Sequoia Capital partner Stephanie Zhan, who works with Linear, and now it’s taking off in enterprise organizations too. “There have been times where management requests to consolidate tooling or use incumbent products, and the teams using Linear inside of an organization revolt!” Zhan says. “That even happened within Sequoia itself, when our engineering, product and design teams rallied together with a full memo on why they would not use anything except Linear. That’s the resonance we strive for.”</p>



<p>Sequoia led Linear’s seed round in 2019 and Series A in 2020. And in late October, the company, still with fewer than 30 employees, released expanded functionality for enterprise and scaling companies. An open letter from Saarinen on the Linear website mentioned global players like Vercel and Cash App as users. Today, the founders are confident that just as Finland’s iconic, near-unbreakable <a href="https://hivemodern.com/pages/product1118/small-aino-aalto-tumbler-iittala?gclid=CjwKCAjw2OiaBhBSEiwAh2ZSPwr4ghcYAeCXASWEPB3zIE4HD2joao5Wpl5U6jTWyBJxUg7AY56vRRoChN0QAvD_BwE">Iittala glasses</a> elevate so many dinner tables, Linear’s design choices and functionality will elevate so many software designs. “We want to make sure that the tool inspires them,” says Artman. “One of the reasons why we always wanted to design Linear to be beautiful is because if you have a project management tool that is beautiful, then anything can be [beautiful].” Artman continues, “That’s what I love hearing about … some customers say that Linear is an inspiration for them to build something as good as we did. And if Linear is always in the face of your engineers and designers, and everybody uses it almost daily, it’s a constant reminder: if you’re working on software, here’s a good example of what good software looks like.”</p>

<p>Saarinen grew up with his mom and dad and older sister outside of Hämeenlinna, a 50,000-person city about an hour north of Helsinki. He has quaint, distinctly Finnish memories like skiing to school, but one of the defining moments of Saarinen’s childhood was when his family got a Commodore 128K. By age 5, he was using it even though he couldn’t read. His sister, five years older, showed him how to match the letters and numbers on the keyboard to the letters and numbers on the screen so he could launch his favorite game, “Bubble Bobble,” about two dragons saving their girlfriends from bad guys. By fifth grade, Saarinen was playing “Quake,” battling monsters in a medieval setting. The game had a multiplayer mode, and Saarinen played with friends on a team. He says all the “cool teams” had their own websites. A builder even then, he checked several coding books out of a nearby library and figured out how to design and build a site “quite fast,” he says.</p>



<p>Mostly bored with school, he threw himself into LAN parties, where computer-lovers connected to a local area network to play multiplayer games. It involved a lot of caffeinated drinks. When he was in sixth grade, he attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_(demoparty)">a historic, 5,000-person LAN</a> when eSports pioneer Assembly Organizing rented Finland’s largest arena, Hartwall Arena in Helsinki. “My parents let me go there with my friends, and basically, you’re in this dark place with your computer for the weekend, and then you don’t really sleep, and you just play games and stuff,” he says. “And it’s like the best, best thing for a kid who likes computers.” The event changed his life; at 13, he started hosting his own LAN parties with friends, selling tickets, figuring out how much cable to buy and literally configuring networks. After internships and jobs at tech companies through high school and college, he led Assembly Organizing’s web presence from 2006 to 2011.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Lallo and Saarinen met around 2008 as part of the Helsinki startup community, remembers Lallo. “It was a slow burn,” he says of their early friendship. “We were very different people. But I think we share similar values of care for the design and building of products.” Saarinen almost met Artman when he applied for a job at Artman’s web design agency, but Artman laughs when he admits he didn’t even offer Saarinen an interview. Lallo and Artman met when an out-of-the-blue Twitter DM turned into meeting for a beer 30 minutes later and, eventually, the three became friends.</p>



<p>After working in various Helsinki tech companies, Lallo and Saarinen moved to San Francisco. There, they launched the collaborative bookmarking system Kippt as part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2012 batch. Lallo sees Kippt as a precursor to Linear in that it was a practical tool with a small but passionate user base. Kippt was acquired by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and both of them joined that company in 2014, Saarinen as head of design and Lallo as a software engineer. Artman moved to San Francisco by 2012, working at Groupon in engineering management.&nbsp;<br>In San Francisco, Saarinen moved up to principal designer at Airbnb, Artman went on to become a senior engineer at Uber and Lallo rose at Coinbase. But soon, each felt like builders working at a company built by others. “You get an itch after some time to do something a little bit more on your terms,” says Lallo. He’d taken a sabbatical after leaving Coinbase in 2018, and started nudging Saarinen and Artman about building the kind of tool they’d always wanted. It would be something that encouraged flow, something that didn’t just work, but that made doing work more pleasurable. Each man, Lallo says, had experienced the hassle of switching between various software management tools, all of which they felt were not as helpful or elegant as they could have been. It didn’t take much convincing, Lallo says. He worked on Linear full time, and Artman and Saarinen chipped away on nights and weekends. “I don’t think we ever questioned if there’s a need for it, or if we could pull it off,” Lallo says.</p>

<p>When they started Linear, Lallo says they decided to bootstrap. So they built out the first version for small and mid-size companies, figuring that the three of them, and maybe, eventually, a few hires, could reasonably create their ideal issue tracking system. To grow, they invited friends in the startup world to use it. One day, they Tweeted about working on an exciting new software design product, but there was no waitlist signup link. It was just an announcement. Sequoia’s Zhan didn’t follow any of the founders, but people she trusts in her Twitter network did, and she spotted their tweets of excitement about Linear. Zhan reached out, and Lallo says, laughing, “While we were like, ‘We’re not fundraising, so we’re not talking to investors,’ but when Sequoia calls, you take the meeting, at least to get to know them.” Zhan saw Linear’s potential: “You’d be hard-pressed to find a product with as much dissatisfaction as some of the incumbents in this space, and ironically, these entrenched incumbents have massive adoption and business scale. I knew there just had to be a better way.” Also worth noting, Jira’s maker Atlassian is worth a bit more than $31 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia is always looking for a business with a novel and compelling insight, Zhan says, and Linear had a powerful one: “The fundamental thing that Linear did differently was this idea of being highly opinionated,” she says. “They understood that, the truth is, most companies have no idea what the right software development process is,” Zhan says. “The subset who do would much prefer focusing on building their product than dedicating time to shaping this process—customizing Jira and having a dedicated team maintaining it.” Endless customization can be a painful and complex experience, she continues. “People want simplicity, and they want to know what is right, what is best. That’s where the opinionated nature of Linear comes into play.” She also says Linear’s focus on design makes it feel premium: “I think [Linear is] setting a new standard for the quality of developer tools. It’s almost a Veblen good for developers and high-functioning modern teams. It symbolizes a cultural belief in building quality products.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Often, software design management tools try to be everything to everyone through endless customization options. And, Saarinen says, sometimes customization led to moments of real momentum for him and his teams. But there were also countless times when his tools took him out of flow, because, he points out, most people are not that great at optimizing tool customization. So Linear chose to design a specific product for a specific person. The team focused on making the best tool it could for a software engineer, looking at one workflow at at time, asking, says Saarinen, “how can we make it reduce the friction as much as possible so that when they use the product, they don’t hit this annoying, frustrating thing, and kind of break that momentum in the team, or in their daily work.”</p>



<p>The solution was already part of the founders’ aesthetic preferences. One of the things people value about Scandinavian design is that, generally, objects don’t draw attention to themselves. They are plain, functional and offer the user something “honest,” in Saarinen’s assessment. Linear’s leap forward in software development is that it is designed to be honest in this way, to literally not draw attention to itself. Linear is designed to read as “professional” to engineers, says Saarinen, with a dark gray sans-serif font called <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> on a black background, and a gradient purple sphere for a logo. It’s based on the black coding environments many engineers prefer, minimizing battery drain and eye strain. It feels like a person looked at it and said, “This is it.” That person was Saarinen, who designed it. “When we started in 2019, I saw a lot of web companies having this kind of fun-type website where you have these colorful illustrations about people and things,” he says. “For me, work is serious. If I’m building a house, I don’t want my tools to be fun. I want them to be good. I want them to be professional.” Saarinen sees aesthetics as increasingly important. Competition for software adoption is so fierce, he says, that users are only interested in an app or program if it’s a pleasure to use. “I think for the past 15 years or so, we had kind of the playbook … like move fast and break things and don’t care about anything else, or don’t care about the quality,” Saarinen says. “I think that playbook maybe is getting played out.”</p>



<p>These aesthetics are the first way Linear is designed specifically for coders. The next way is through endless streamlining—removing friction, rethinking workflows, eliminating alerts, checking that every action is intuitive and not confusing, and ensuring maximum speed so there are never flow-killing lags. “You could think it’s a very minor thing, but I feel like it’s actually probably the most meaningful thing,” Saarinen says. “When people feel good about the work, and they feel good about making progress, or just they are allowed to make progress, then that progress happens, and, generally, people are happier, and, generally, the company, I think, will be more successful.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Linear’s founders don’t want to just serve software engineers, though. They want to re-center them. Today hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people might develop a piece of software. This has led to two things, Saarinen says: a focus on process over product, and removing engineers from positions of influence. “I think people get too focused on the different frameworks and processes,” he says, “and you start to forget, what are you actually doing?” Linear is designed to simplify the how, enabling teams to focus on the what. And its functionality encourages designers and engineers to use it for building and planning together. This is also one of Linear’s marketing tools. Saarinen perceives that the competition for talent is so intense that gifted people won’t work for companies with bad processes or tools; they’ll choose companies that use tools designed for them.</p>



<p>Linear’s point of view has resonated. Founded in January 2019, Linear was profitable by July 2021. A company that started as a minimal software issue tracker eventually did open that waitlist, and now has enterprise-level capabilities, empowering teams of various functions to interact as part of a cohesive development ecosystem. This is one way Zhan sees Linear growing—starting with a company’s engineering, product and software design teams and spreading beyond. (This is how Figma grew, starting with designers.) Saarinen, Lallo, and Artman are focused on Linear’s impact long-term. Saarinen and Artman both talk about Apple’s relentless, exacting focus on design as being almost peerless, and they would like, someday, for Linear to be described similarly. Saarinen even picked the dark gray font color inspired by Apple’s Mac Pro colorways. “That’s one of the reasons why we designed it so well,” says Artman. “I hope that it inspires people to build better software. But you know, if it doesn’t, we still give you time back. Like, the tool should get out of your way in the end, so that you can focus on whatever is important.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So while Linear is designed for software engineers, its real beneficiary is all of us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is vital that blockchain, as with all new economic foundations, grows in tandem with standards. Zaisan has developed a systematic solution to enable <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">GDPR-compliant blockchain services</a> that adhere to these standards.</p>



<p>Blockchain was not the focus of the people that drafted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework. The technology was not widely available yet.</p>



<p>GDPR regulations are written with some sort of centralised control in mind. This is the opposite of how blockchain technology is supposed to work. The opportunities that arise because of this new technology, the potential drawbacks, and the way Zaisan deals with these drawbacks are detailed in this article.</p>



 Understanding Data Controllers 



<p>One can give many rights to a human, but without knowing against whom they can be revoked, these rights lack meaning.</p>



<p>Therefore, the GDPR regulations introduce a “data controller” role. This is a person towards whom the people may turn if they want to invoke their rights. A GDPR “data controller” is, as the name suggests, the person or entity which controls the data. It determines what data can be used, and how.</p>



<p>For example, if a company stores and uses data to communicate with its clients, that company “controls” such use, making them the data controller.</p>



<p>If a controller decides to hire third parties to help with the processing of data, these third parties are referred to as “data processors”. “Use”, “store” and many other actions regarding data are called “processing” in the GDPR.</p>



 How does this work with blockchain technology? 



<p>If a company uses blockchain to run software (decentralised application -dApps-), that company is the controller for the data which the dApp processes.</p>



<p>But how about a public blockchain? Is the blockchain the hired hand? The “data processor”?</p>



<p>There is no contract between a dApp and the “blockchain”. The blockchain is not a single entity, rather, it is software that runs in a decentralised way. Node operators are often anonymous, and the company just launches the dApp. So it is unclear. Yet, the blockchain is not a controller: it merely performs instructions it gets from the dApp.</p>



 What about data blockchain processes without dApps? 



<p>How about processes such as transferring tokens and storing transactions? The blockchain should be the data controller. But yet again, the blockchain is not an entity. In this event, are all the nodes controllers? But they don’t “control”. They just “mine” transactions.</p>



<p>How could they be controllers? Blockchain is designed in a decentralised way.</p>



<p>It is, therefore, safe to say, that it is impossible for a public, permissionless blockchain, to establish or even determine a data controller and processor. For this reason alone, such a blockchain can never be compliant with GDPR.</p>



 GDPR-compliant public blockchains 



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">A GDPR-compliant public blockchain</a> is possible, but it needs some form of centralisation and control. There has to be an entity where the people can turn to with their questions and demands. Additionally, this entity needs to ensure that sensitive personal data is not stored on-chain. This entity needs to have enough power to ensure GDPR compatibility of the blockchain,&nbsp; but not enough that it could tamper with the blockchain’s immutability, and threaten the very core of blockchain technology.</p>



<p>There are many blockchains that have central entities involved to some degree. Often, it is a foundation that decides on code upgrades or similar matters. It is possible to give that entity enough controlling powers to make it the controller – if the software and its concrete setup allow it.</p>



<p>Europechain by Zaisan, built on delegated proof of stake (DPoS) software, is an example of a setup that is compatible in this respect.</p>



<p>As with everywhere else, with Europechain the dApps are data controllers. They must conclude a processing agreement with Europechain, which will be the data processor. Before dApps are allowed to deploy on the Europechain public blockchain, they will have to prove that they will not store sensitive data on-chain.</p>



<p>Europechain concludes sub-processor agreements with all the nodes (the block producers). Without concluding a (sub)processor agreement, a party cannot run a dApp or become a node.</p>



<p>If there is no dApp involved in the transaction (for instance, in the event of token transfers on the base layer) Europechain is the controller. In that event, the nodes are not sub-processors but processors. The agreements are drafted such that they allow for that.</p>



<p>These agreements have dispute resolutions in them so that the powers of Europechain are in check and the nodes can be easily forced to comply with Europechain’s instructions.</p>



<p>This setup allows for adequate control to ensure the people are informed and are able to submit their requests to a competent and compliant entity. Furthermore, this allows for the contractual infrastructure required under the GDPR.</p>



<p>Given that the powers of Europechain have been tailored to the position of a data controller and given that they are kept in check by the dispute resolution system, there is no way Europechain’s position may endanger the blockchain core values.</p>



<p>Europechain’s setup proves it is possible to find the right balance. A balance that is necessary for blockchain to become a mainstream infrastructure.</p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 It is impossible for a public, permissionless blockchain, to establish or even determine a data controller and processor 



 With <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Europechain</a>, Zaisan has developed a systematic solution to enable GDPR-compliant blockchain services that adhere to economic foundation standards 



 GDPR regulations introduce a “data controller” role, a person towards whom the people may turn if they want to invoke their rights. 



 A GDPR-compliant public blockchain is possible, but it needs some form of centralisation and control 



 In the Europechain environment, the dApps act as data controllers

<p>Thank you to all the candidates who ran for election. It says a lot about the strength and vibrancy of the Zcash community to have such a great slate of candidates. We hope to see some of you throwing your hat in the ring again in the next election, which will take place at the end of June. </p>



<p>This election sees the departure of Adi (aiyadt on the forums), who was elected to the committee a year ago but decided against seeking re-election in order to focus on the roadmap for Nighthawk Wallet and grow the Nighthawk team. Adi’s technical background made him a valuable member of the ZCG Committee. We want to thank him on behalf of the Foundation, and the broader Zcash community for his service. </p>

<p>I’m sitting on the sofa, my “office,” listening to a warm winter rain fall as the clock winds down on the year 2022. It’s quiet. My better half is out with friends, though I got my New Year’s kiss before he left. I spent much of the day in my flannel PJs making a batch of chicken noodle soup with the root veggies that survived our week away. Over the holiday we escaped the biting cold that gripped the east coast and headed to southeastern Utah.</p>
<p>Jason introduced me to the region’s many wonders last spring after our field work in Salt Lake City and at the Mormon Transhumanist Association’s annual conference on blockchain. The massive, towering rock faces were an antidote then and now – both to the machinations of zealous, esoteric logicians and to the wounds not-yet-healed among family and loved ones. The calendar pages keep flipping by, but the angst of 2020 still holds sway in our family, and many others I’m guessing. Many have blithely moved on, not realizing there are other shoes to drop – Web3, human augmentation, collective consciousness (including non-human agents), swarm intelligence, and automated AI portfolios placing bets on where each of us (and our digital twins) will fit (or not) into the new normal.</p>
<p>My young adult child remains estranged from me. I’ve been cancelled with no foreseeable path to redemption, restoration, wholeness. The latest I’ve heard is that I’m supposed to think about what I have done wrong in “choosing” this path over them. The only offer is one of conditional love, conditioned on me becoming someone else. I cannot live a lie. I hold out hope that one day we may forge a new path built on mutual respect, knowing deep connections of care can never be severed between mother and child. Until then, I wait, though not always gracefully. I’ve never been a patient person; perhaps this is part of the learning I need to do.</p>
<p>Before heading south to Moab, I stopped by the Cathedral of the Madeleine and lit a candle with a prayer for fortitude and healed relational ruptures. This is not the only loss I carry from this year. If anything, 2022 has been a season of falling away. As I came to understand how the cybernetic steering techniques were being deployed to shape narratives and in doing so continue the polarization that is so vital to accomplishing their post-human goals, I chose to leave social media. I still have this blog and my channel but learning to “be” outside digital information ebbs and flows is unsettling – especially when in the real world doesn’t know what to do with you either. I continue to be grateful for my ever-tighter circle of friends who continue to take my calls and buoy my spirits even as they face imposing challenges of their own.</p>
<p>Instead of moping around a quiet house at the holidays – this is the first year we haven’t put up a tree since we moved here in 1998 – I lobbied for a sojourn to a land of red rocks, ancient cedars, cliff dwellings, petroglyphs, and uranium. We were in Natural Bridges National Monument on Christmas day and had the place almost to ourselves. The opportunity to stand on the edge, not too close, of the canyons cut from Cedar Mesa’s Permian sandstone was a gift, helping re-situate my soul within the grand dance of the cosmos. It was a blessing to drink in the immensity of nature’s creation, god’s hand transforming giant boulders to smaller and smaller stones until they became sand once again. Depressions in the stone gradually collect soil knitted together through complex relationships among fungi, lichen, algae, and the cyano-bacteria that gave us our atmosphere.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Across acres of slickrock we saw living terrariums in various stages of development: smears of dark lichen at the bottom of a puddle; decades-old soil crusts, tiny, fractal kingdoms echoing in miniature their butte, fin, and escarpment counterparts; and circular gardens where cacti and Mormon tea cozied up to extravagantly shaggy, twisted Utah cedars. These beauties took centuries to manifest and mature, a timeframe that is almost incomprehensible to us in an age where our attentions are yanked from one direction to another on an hourly basis. Once again, I lay on the rocks soaking up the sun, nibbling Honeycrisp apples and a Spanish cheese, sinking into the blue skies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Terrariums, and the potholes that hold them are circular, a point that was hit home on our trip to the Needles division of Canyonlands. It had rained the night before, showing off rounded patterns to great effect with the ripples of drops from intermittent showers enhancing the circles within circles within circles – life renewed in the desert. Circles on petroglyphs, in the architecture of kivas, the shape juniper berries, and water smoothed pebbles, each embodying the energetic force that flows through living systems. That was my gift this Christmas, to experience the interconnectedness, knowing that the machine logic’s attempts to steal the circle for a cybernetic feedback loop is bound to fail.</p>

<p>After exploring the cliff dwellings at Hovenweep I picked up Harold Courlander’s “The Fourth World of the Hopis.” I’ve already read most of the stories that tell how the Hopi came into this world and the nature of their migrations over many generations. The first chapter describes their move from a Third World that had become overrun by evil from powakas, or sorcerers. After bird messengers were sent to explore the Fourth World and ask permission for re-settlement, the good Hopi who were following the old ways climbed, with assistance from Grandmother Spider, through the sipapuni into a new world where the mockingbird named the clans and gave each a special kind of corn to grow that shaped their destiny.</p>
<p>It turns out that one sorceress managed to climb up the stalk. The Bahanas, the white tribe, agreed to take her because they felt her knowledge would be valuable. The rest of the tribes were wary of this, but there was a prophecy that one day an unknown person would come from the east and bring harmony among the Hopi. A member of the Fire Clan carved a stone tablet with figures, broke it in two pieces and gave one half to the Bahanas as they left, saying that when that person arrived, they should present their half of the slab to prove their good intentions.</p>
<p>I have concerns that as we move forward with “regenerative finance” and ESG (environmental, social, governance) portfolios, and outcomes-based “social impact” deals tied to addressing past injustice and trauma inflicted on the original people that pretenders to this prophecy will come west with promises of blockchain “sovereignty” for tribes and pandering pretensions to incorporate indigenous customs and “sacred economics” into emerging systems of stakeholder capitalism. Years of identity politics and performative (but often shallow and insincere) reconciliation attempts have primed the pump.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/the-rockefeller-foundation-announces-ten-grants-at-cop27-to-scale-indigenous-and-regenerative-agriculture-practices-globally/#:~:text=SHARM%20EL%2DSHEIKH%20%7C%20November%209,agriculture%20practices%20around%20the%20world."></a></p>
<p>For decades indigenous people of the world sought justice from the United Nations when the entities governing their original lands were wreaking havoc. Over the past two or three decades the UN has increasingly paid lip service to tribal groups, knowing all the while that the cybernetic enclosures governed from space would be coming online shortly, and that they could afford to give legal rights to nature. Blockchain smart contracts with drone surveillance and digital penalties would be a perfect way to dispossess people under the pretense of protection.</p>
<p>During our college search we ended up touring Dickinson College. Dickinson is located in Carlisle, PA, and just outside the town is the home of the US Army War College on the grounds of Carlisle Indian School, the model for the residential school program in the United States and Canada. It is there that Captain Richard Pratt declared the need to kill the Indian to save the man. As it was many of children who were sent to these schools and in fact helped build them died. They never made it home, though some remains are gradually being identified and returned. The hundreds of white gravestones that line North Street are a reminder of this grim past.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I took my family to see the campus and pay our respects to the spirits of the children and their families. You can only access the site after going through a background check across the road. That done, we drove across the street and as we pulled over to park, I noticed a display sign flashing notices for upcoming events, including a program on George Armstrong Custer. The focus of today’s army is on insurgent, asymmetrical warfare. The lessons of the frontier are still very much on the forefront of military planners on the eve of the roll out of this new digital empire. It is my opinion that the greatest threat to implementation of blockchain, smart-contract, tech-no-logic governance is Indigenous practice, connection to the sacred energy flow of the universe. That is something that cannot be factored into their physics equations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sense a full court press is about to be launched to convince Indigenous peoples, not just of North America but of the world, to accept offers of digital currency and digital governance. I think a pitch will be made to bridge the Eisenstein-inspired Celo “sacred economics,” the tokenized “commons,” with a more collectivist and “regenerative” worldview. This is the “Game B” that is being promoted by Jim Rutt, the Santa Fe Institute, and members of the intellectual dark web. The foundations have been laid with Hanne Strong, founder of Crestone and wife of oil baron / sustainability promoter Maurice Strong, and the Hopi prophecy.</p>

<p><a href="https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/films/15-film-content/game-b/679-indigenous-thinking-for-troubled-times-tyson-yunkaporta"></a></p>
<p>I did a search for “indigenous” “circles” and “cybernetics” and up came a July 2021 paper presented at IEEE, “<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Circle-of-All-Nations-Digital-Global-Village-%E2%80%93-into-Thumbadoo-Taylor/e5c78a40b16fc06bdc293ed578f3b16e1b974195">Circle of All Nations Digital Global Village – William Commanda’s Indigenous Cybernetic Navigation into the Age of Information Technology</a>.” <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/aboriginal-leader-followed-a-path-of-enlightenment-and-vision/article590284/">William Commanda</a>, Algonquin elder (1913-2011) and keeper of sacred wampum belts, embraced social media to promote “A Circle of All Nations” in partnership with the UN. He was portrayed as a master crafter of canoes, which he linked to cybernetics, and a pioneer in <a href="https://www.ijahss.net/assets/files/1597173635.pdf">cyber-cartography</a>. A battle is being set up between Grandmother Spider and a non-living system that aims to tangle us in a web not of silk, but of data and logic circuits. Commanda, whose Algonquin name is Ojshigkwanang (morning star) seems to have had a prominent role carved out for himself, paving the way for a new form of capitalism that would help build the digital empire by financializing and parasitizing nature and traditional cultural practice and social relations. That is what the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Circle-of-All-Nations-Commanda-.pdf">digital global eco-village paradigm</a> actually is.</p>
<p><a href="https://atlas.icaci.org/wp-content/uploads/2021_icc_thumbadoo_integrating_cybercartography_ppt_low.pdf"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://atlas.icaci.org/wp-content/uploads/2021_icc_thumbadoo_integrating_cybercartography_ppt_low.pdf"></a></p>
<p>In many of the Hopi stories, Grandmother Spider sits on the ear of the protagonist, a person who had treated her with respect and honored sacred practices. She offers guidance through perilous journeys. They move forward together in relationship. In today’s tech-no-logic world we have handed over our sacred guidance system to slick machines created by defense interests. Like the Hopi left behind in the trek to the Fourth World, we risk forgetting who we are, what life means, becoming entranced by dead devices that have no soul, no imagination, no artistry.</p>
<p>Be in nature. Look for her circles. See interrelated living communities not as ecological niches to be measured, counted, and sampled for unique genetic re-mixing and investing potential, but as a gracious symphony, delicate and expansive. One memorable parts of this trip was seeing again a spectacular orange-red lichen upon a boulder at the top of the trail through Hovenweep Canyon. I saw it in March and again last week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s probably as old as I am and aging better, too! It was a good reminder to reset our expectations of time. Dial it back towards the geological setting. Maybe then the loss of connection to a child for a year won’t feel so sharp. I know eventually the edges will soften, just like that Permian Sandstone wearing down to create soil for new life and maybe one day become a stone again.</p>
<p>Happy New Year folks. Let’s enjoy the show!</p>

<p>This year, while the industry slid headlong into yet another crypto winter, the Polkadot community was busy building and launching the largest and most diverse ecosystem of layer-1 blockchains in the world, with several core technologies rolled out to propel the ecosystem forward into 2023.</p><p>With enough happening in the Polkadot ecosystem in 2022 to practically fill a book, it’s no easy task to sum up the past year of activity around the core technology and broader community, but as we move forward into 2023 let’s look back at some of the most important trends and milestones for Polkadot in 2022.</p> 💥 The birth of Web3’s leading ecosystem <p>The Polkadot community is no stranger to delivering great technology through difficult years, and 2022 was certainly no exception. In just over 1 year since the launch of parachains in late 2021, Polkadot has become the largest and most diverse ecosystem of purpose-built layer-1 blockchains and apps, and the only one fully secured by a shared, network-wide validator set and benefiting from secure, trustless cross-chain interoperability.</p><p>To date, 74 parachains have won an auction on Polkadot or Kusama, and are already supporting an ecosystem of well over 300 unstoppable applications according to best estimates. In total, around 550 projects are either launched or under development for Polkadot, a rather impressive start in the network’s first full year with live parachains.</p><p>At the time of writing, more than 200 teams have either launched or are building a purpose-built blockchain on Polkadot’s technology stack, recognizing that this model better suits their needs than a smart contract solution, and that Polkadot provides a shorter time to market and a lower cost for building one, as well as the upgradeability and interoperability needed for constant innovation.</p><p>Over 130 million DOT and nearly 300,000 KSM have been lent by the Polkadot community through crowdloans to support parachains’ auction bids, a massive show of confidence in the future of the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>With such a diverse ecosystem, Polkadot has demonstrated to the world that Web3 is about way more than just DeFi and NFT use cases. While Polkadot ecosystem teams are certainly leading the industry forward with bleeding edge DeFi and NFT primitives, Polkadot parachains and dapps span the full spectrum of what’s possible with blockchain technology, from use cases for social media to supply chain, identity, gaming, tokenized real-world assets, carbon credits, privacy, robotics, IoT, and much more.</p><p>Some of the major ecosystem adoption breakthroughs this year include smart contract parachain Astar <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/08/japan-mobile-phone-operator-ntt-docomo-to-invest-4b-into-web3/">partnering with NTT Docomo</a>, Japan’s largest mobile phone operator, on a $4b investment to promote Web3 adoption, and NFT parachain Efinity <a href="https://enjin.io/news/enjin-partnership-with-square-enix">partnering with gaming giant Square Enix</a> on Polkadot-powered NFTs for Final Fantasy, one of the top games of all time.</p><p>Centrifuge, a parachain leading the onboarding of real-world assets into on-chain DeFi, is leading the largest investment in bringing real-world assets on chain to date with a <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/182058/centrifuge-raises-strategic-round">$220m fund</a>, after securing an investment from Coinbase.</p><p>Privacy hub parachain Manta Network is set to have the world’s largest trusted setup in the history of zero-knowledge technology with over 13,000 participants from 177 countries. This technology is essential for building a better, more secure web that keeps sensitive information private, and will allow other builders within the ecosystem to leverage its privacy-preserving features.</p><p>2022 also saw an announcement that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgPZnOulBCE">Project Liberty’s DSNP</a> (Decentralized Social Networking Protocol) will be deployed to Polkadot first, enabling a new era of social media where users control their own data, identities, and connections, a crucial need for Web3. The music industry is also seeing some crucial innovation on Polkadot with Public Pressure, which offers a <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2022/12/05/public-pressure-generates-2-million-with-first-music-and-gaming-nft-project/">music NFT marketplace</a> and saw $2m in revenues in a matter of days after launching.</p><p>Polkadot’s decentralized identity parachain KILT is also seeing some highly impactful adoption across partnerships with <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-protocol-in-the-real-world-machine-identity-8c34d6dbc6ba">DENA</a>, the German ministry of energy, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/dena-selects-energy-web-to-build-prototype-identity-registry-for-germanys-energy-market-2580f53b2d20">Energy Web</a>, a Polkadot ecosystem project creating an identity registry for Germany’s energy market, and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/debio-network-partners-with-kilt-protocol-to-embed-credentials-into-anonymous-first-platform-used-824a745ef2c8">DeBio</a>, an anonymous-first platform for medical and bioinformatics data.</p><p>Polkadot’s DeFi community also got a big boost this year with the integration of the <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-usdt-to-launch-on-polkadot/">Tether (USDt) stablecoin</a>, the announcement that <a href="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1575206651530907649?s=20">USDC</a> is also coming to Polkadot, and the launch of the <a href="https://equilibrium.io">Equilibrium</a> and <a href="https://polkadex.medium.com/polkadex-orderbook-is-live-92749206d465">Polkadex</a> decentralized exchanges.</p><p>With its unmatched technology stack in terms of flexibility, scalability, upgradeability, and security, Polkadot is demonstrating that it’s the perfect home for the full spectrum of rapidly evolving Web3 opportunities.</p> 🧭 Leading the path to true decentralization <p>In 2022, Polkadot made some important strides forward toward the goal of becoming the most decentralized, trustless, and unstoppable Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>Events of the past year and the actions of several less than scrupulous actors have demonstrated the importance of these design considerations that are fundamental for Web3. As we’ve seen, centralized systems that require users to place blind trust in intermediaries to act ethically, have their interests in mind, or to be free from corruption or incompetence are systems that put user funds, data, and identities at risk. They’re also at risk of censorship and malicious outside influence.</p><p>Step by step, Polkadot has been increasing its level of decentralization and removing areas of centralization that could serve as choke points, becoming one of the largest true DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) in existence.</p><p>Crucially, 2022 saw the initial launch of Polkadot’s next-generation governance system, OpenGov, as it began its rollout on Kusama. The most advanced and sophisticated blockchain governance system ever devised, OpenGov removes the somewhat more centralized role of the Polkadot Council, and decentralizes the network’s entire governance process to the community-driven referenda system. This ensures that decisions can always be made and enacted in an unstoppable, fully autonomous way.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto/blob/main/manifesto.pdf">Polkadot Fellowship</a> also launched this year, a key component of OpenGov. The Fellowship is a decentralized, on-chain and ranked body of technical experts that replaces the Technical Committee and effectively oraclises the technical knowledge base of the Polkadot community. With no ‘hard power’ over network decisions, the Fellowship is designed to help optimize the decision making process of the network without exerting any direct affect on the outcome of those decisions, which remains under the control of all network stakeholders.</p><p>It was due in part to these efforts towards true decentralization that, in November 2022 after a 3-year engagement with the SEC, <a href="https://medium.com/web3foundation/less-trust-more-truth-polkadots-native-token-dot-has-morphed-and-is-not-a-security-b2a8847a70cc">Web3 Foundation announced that the DOT token had morphed from a security into a non-security</a>, a landmark achievement towards the realization of Web3.</p><p>Among several other moves to increase decentralization, Polkadot is pushing forward the industry’s most advanced <a href="https://substrate.io/developers/substrate-connect/">light-client technology</a>, removing the need for users to rely on third-party node services to inspect data and interact with functionality hosted on Polkadot or any Substrate-based chain. The network’s <a href="https://polkadot.network/staking/">staking</a> system also saw some key upgrades in 2022, including nomination pools, which increase the accessibility of native staking on Polkadot by reducing the minimum stake to 1 DOT, furthering decentralization and trustlessness by making it easier for more people to stake directly on-chain with their own keys.</p> 🚀 Unstoppable innovation <p>Of course, none of these upgrades would have been possible without Polkadot’s industry-leading upgradeability features. In 2022, Polkadot completed a total of 15 seamless, forkless upgrades, an unparalleled pace of innovation in the blockchain space, for a total of nearly 50 to date. By comparison, Ethereum completed 3 upgrades via hard-fork in 2022 and 4 in 2021. Considering that, in the non-blockchain world, Apple delivered 16 upgrades to iOS in 2022, Polkadot’s ease of upgradeability puts it on par with more conventional software update schedules, ensuring that the technology can continue to evolve at the pace of innovation. To date there have been nearly 1000 forkless upgrades of blockchains built on Polkadot’s technology.</p><p>Parachains got a major upgrade to their capabilities on May the 4th, when Polkadot governance <a href="https://polkadot.subsquare.io/democracy/referendum/60">upgraded</a> the Relay Chain to v9190, unlocking secure cross-chain data transfer over <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format/">XCM</a>. After a period of battle testing on Kusama, the launch of XCM on Polkadot delivered the magic of secure cross-consensus bridging to the world. Coupled with the upcoming launch of XCMv3, this will end the ‘weakest link’ problem that has hindered previous-generation bridging technology to the tune of <a href="https://twitter.com/Delphi_Digital/status/1604900039393890304?s=20">$2.5 billion in losses</a> this past year alone.</p><p>Parachain teams wasted no time with XCM, opening over 100 channels and sending an impressive 10,000 messages in the first month. To date, more than 160,000 XCM messages have been sent on Polkadot alone, with an additional 200,000+ messages sent on Kusama, kicking off a new era of secure cross-chain interoperability.</p><p>v9190 also heralded the true launch of <a href="https://www.parity.io/blog/statemint-generic-assets-chain-proposing-a-common-good-parachain-to-polkadot-governance/">Statemint</a>, which had first been deployed to Polkadot in December 2021 but now became <a href="https://twitter.com/joepetrowski/status/1521810095256047616">fully functional</a>. Users could now mint assets, including NFTs, and teleport DOT to and from the Relay Chain, providing fundamental functionality to the ecosystem.</p><p>This year also saw the launch of Polkadot’s second system parachain, Collectives, giving people the ability to organize and act as a group without needing to trust third parties like lawyers and courts, a crucial function for Web3. The first such collective to launch was the Polkadot Alliance, a community initiative created to recognize positive contributions to the ecosystem and set a code of ethics around scams, malicious behavior, misuse of the Polkadot brand, and unattributed code.</p> 🏗️ One of Web3’s most active and growing builder communities <p>If you’ve spent much time around Polkadot’s growing developer community, it should come as no surprise that Polkadot development <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/polkadot-hits-all-time-high-in-development-activity">hit an all-time high</a> this year. With an impressive peak of nearly 2500 monthly active developers in 2022, Polkadot was at or near the top of the pack for the most active developer communities outside Ethereum throughout 2022.</p><p>The Substrate Builders Program (SBP), which guides builders along their journey to launching a project, accepted 32 new teams in 2022 from an application pool of 127. To date, 60% of Polkadot's parachains have been part of the SBP.</p><p>In support of Polkadot's builder community, Web3 Foundation’s grant program surpassed its <a href="https://medium.com/web3foundation/web3-foundation-grants-program-reaches-400-projects-milestone-1k-grant-applications-received-93a7d3a5f942">400th project milestone</a> this year, with 150 new grants signed, 267 applications, and 230 grant milestones delivered in 2022.</p><p>Polkadot’s decentralized on-chain treasury also paid out a record amount of DOT this year to support projects benefiting the network. To date, more than 4 million DOT have been paid out to teams and individuals for their work supporting the ecosystem, up from a total of about 200,000 at the end of 2021.</p><p>Recognizing that a growing ecosystem needs a strong pool of new engineers to fuel it, 2022 was also the founding year of the Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA). An intensive academic program designed to give students all the knowledge they need to become a top blockchain engineer, the Academy’s initial wave took place at Cambridge University over the summer with a cohort of 55 students selected from an application pool of 560. The program was a resounding success, taking promising developers from the beginning of their Web3 journey to being hired to work within the Polkadot ecosystem after graduation.</p><p>2023 will kick off with the second wave of the PBA, taking place at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) in January in collaboration with 12 universities in the LATAM region. Applications for the second wave hit nearly 800 in less than 1 month, reflecting the especially high level of interest in Polkadot seen in the region. The organization of subsequent waves has already begun, establishing a growing pool of talented builders to help shape the future of Polkadot.</p> 🌞 Looking ahead <p>With everything that was accomplished in 2022 and everything on the horizon for 2023, that future is looking bright indeed. This year, Polkadot founders <a href="https://twitter.com/rphmeier">Rob Habermeier</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gavofyork">Gavin Wood</a> laid out a <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-roadmap-roundup/">vision</a> of <a href="https://youtu.be/hSoSA6laK3Q">new technologies</a> in development for Polkadot which we’ll see launch in 2023 if approved by Polkadot governance.</p><p>Perhaps first and foremost among those will be the launch of OpenGov on Polkadot, which will be brought before the Polkadot community for a vote after a period of battle testing on Kusama. Not only will OpenGov bring increased decentralization to the governance process, it will also increase the volume of collective decisions that can be made by the network at any given time, dramatically improving the agility and adaptability of Polkadot’s upgrade path and ensuring a future of continual innovation.</p><p>Another impactful upgrade will be asynchronous backing, an optimization to parachain consensus with the potential to allow Polkadot to process upwards of 1 million transactions per second, which would represent a new peak of throughput for the industry.</p><p>XCMv3, an important upgrade to Polkadot’s interoperability standard, will unlock trustless cross-ecosystem bridging with XCM, as well as NFT transfers and remote locking. Once XCMv3 is live, Polkadot will be able to launch trustless bridges for interoperability with other ecosystems, including planned bridges to Kusama and Ethereum via a Bridge Hub parachain.</p><p>The launch of parathreads and additional scheduling methods will allow blockchains to launch on Polkadot while bypassing the auction process, significantly improving the ease and flexibility of deployment options for Polkadot’s next generation of blockchains. This will bring Polkadot closer to the goal of being the strongest marketplace of flexible, high-quality blockspace as outlined by Rob Habermeier in his 2022 post <a href="https://www.rob.tech/polkadot-blockspace-over-blockchains/">Polkadot: Blockspace over Blockchains</a>.</p><p>We’ll also see continued maturity of Polkadot’s Wasm smart contracts ecosystem, representing a more efficient, powerful and robust alternative to Ethereum (EVM) smart contract technology.</p><p>The outlook for the broader Polkadot ecosystem in 2023 is also incredibly strong, with a packed pipeline of projects set to launch their custom parachains in the coming months across a wide range of use cases, bringing a new wave of users to Polkadot. Given that the average parachain on Polkadot has only been live for about 6 months, we’ll also see these existing projects coming into maturity in 2023. In many ways, as busy as parachain and dapp development has been in 2022, teams have largely been busy rolling out their core functionality, so things are really just getting started for the Polkadot ecosystem — 2023 is sure to be an exciting year for the community.</p> <p>While this is certainly not all that happened in 2022 nor close to what’s coming for 2023, the time has come to wrap up the 2022 Roundup until next year. Happy New Year to everyone reading and to Web3 builders, keep on building!</p>

<p>Blockchains are immutable record keepers, storing information about every transaction ever recorded. However, this attribute comes at a cost: as more and more transactions occur, so does the size of the record expands. In turn, the hardware requirements for running a node increase which ultimately affects decentralization. Another aspect frequently criticized is how transactions are being processed by legacy blockchains in terms of speed. For both of these aspects there is a cryptographic solution that addresses scalability: zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs). These allow one entity (prover) to prove to another entity (verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any additional information about the process or data involved. When applied to blockchains, ZKPs improve scalability and privacy by certifying that state transitions occurred, without the need to relay the underlying information.</p><p>In Part 1 of this 2-part episode, we were joined by Anna Rose, host of Zero Knowledge Podcast and founder of ZK Summit, ZK Validator and ZK Hack, and Kobi Gurkan, Head of Research at Geometry, to discuss the state of the ZK ecosystem and how this promising technology is evolving.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Anna’s background &amp; her involvement in the ZK ecosystem  Kobi’s background in cryptography  Trusted setups, a brief history: Plumo &amp; Aztec  ZK Hack(athon)  The State of the ZK ecosystem  How the ZK landscape evolved: from SNARKs to STARKs  Trade-offs: compatibility, security, performance  Aztec &amp; Noir DSL  The need for performance benchmarks  ZK L1s: Zcash, Mina, Aleo  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zeroknowledgefm">Zero Knowledge Podcast on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zeroknowledgefm">Zero Knowledge Podcast on YouTube</a>  <a href="https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/plonk-arithmetiization-air">The paper Kobi mentioned (by Ariel Gabizon)</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnaRRose">Anna Rose on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/kobigurk">Kobi Gurkan on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

 From token launch to a truly global mixnet — Nym in&nbsp;2022 <p>A wrap up of Nym achievements in&nbsp;2022…</p><p>Nym was founded to enable digital privacy and security for humanity. This year, the Nym mixnet went live to fix a fundamental flaw in the design of the internet: the fact that traffic flows are entirely exposed, revealing everyone’s patterns of communication, putting people, systems and societies at risk. This is all about to&nbsp;change…</p><p>In 2023, we are looking forward to reaching our next major milestones, including: high speed mixnet, censorship resistant gateways, major integrations, privacy preserving paid usage via zk-nyms and new&nbsp;PEApps!</p><p>Before leaving 2022 behind, we would like to take a brief glance back on an eventful year for Nym. Here are a few highlights of what has been achieved over the past 12 months through the tireless work and support of our community, backers, partners and&nbsp;team:</p>  Over 1M registrations (a Coinlist record!) for the Nym token&nbsp;sale!  Nym <a href="https://youtu.be/lnOkbRzYVGA">launch with Edward Snowden</a> in&nbsp;Paris.

     2022 was an exciting year for the Horizen ecosystem. Several major milestones were reached, including the launch of our tokenization platform, <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint,</a> the release of our new ecosystem wallet, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt</a>, and the successful turnout of our first ecosystem summit, <a href="https://zencon.events/">Zencon0</a>.&nbsp; 
<p>It’s an exciting time for the Horizen ecosystem as we push into 2023 with our first public EVM and many exciting announcements and partnerships to go with that, but first, let’s dive into what happened in 2022!</p>
 2022 Q4 Highlights 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ZBF_2022-review_BY-THE-NUMBER.jpg"></a></p>
 Community Growth 
<p>The community grew a lot this year. During Q4, our Twitter following grew by 130%. YouTube subscribers grew by 17.39% ! LinkedIn saw a big boost in follower growth with a jump of over 350%, and Reddit subscriber growth increased by 112.5%. </p>
<p><br>These new members helped us test our new products like <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a>, and more! Which helped educate upgrades to the products and future ideas for new products in the Horizen ecosystem. We are excited to see the community continue to grow in 2023!</p>
 Horizen on the Web 
<p></p>
<p>2022 has been an exciting year for the teams supporting the Horizen websites as our online representation grows and matures. Through Q4 in particular, we saw a major increase in organic traffic to <a href="https://www.horizen.io/blockchain-academy/">Horizen Academy,</a> our educational hub covering topics of blockchain and web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>15 articles were published in Q4 to Horizen Academy. Additionally, we saw an increase of 84% in weekly organic visitors and a overall increase of 15% in total users! This growth is amazing to see as adoption through education is a major goal of our project.&nbsp;</p>
 2022 Highlights 
 Our Technology 
<p>In 2022, we launched <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint to mainnet.</a> Tokenmint is a quick and easy token launch platform where anyone can create and mint their own fungible and nonfungible tokens with custom tokenomics. No developer skills are needed! The launch of TokenMint also included launching of the following tools:</p>
 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a>, our Google Chrome extension web wallet, which just recently updated to include a <a href="https://faucet.horizen.io">built-in test token faucet</a> in the wallet! 
 <a href="https://app.tokenmint.global">Token Generator</a>, a web app that provides a seamless and no-code process to launch fungible or non-fungible tokens. 
 TokenMint <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">Block Explorer</a>, which displays and tracks all transactions on TokenMint.&nbsp; 
 
<p>We look forward to new integrations and partnerships, scoping and creating a mobile app, sidechain-to-sidechain interoperability, migrating to an account-based model, and more!</p>
<p>Another major focus has been the development of our first EVM sidechain that will allow developers to utilize existing Ethereum tooling to create a wealth of dapps on Horizen. The upcoming launch of the Horizen EVM will open the Horizen ecosystem up to a wider community of developers and web3 users. </p>
<p> Horizen’s EVM sidechain is coming to public testnet soon in 2023! The Horizen EVM sidechain is currently running on an internal testnet, this is a major milestone of the EVM project we accomplished in 2022.&nbsp; The team has been working with 3rd party partners and testers to perform security audits and feature improvements.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We are also working on an EVM documentation library that will provide users everything needed to deploy dapps on Horizen! Our aim is&nbsp;to make our EVM as developer-friendly as possible, so builders can easily bring their projects over to Horizen to build a more open and inclusive blockchain ecosystem that will benefit all participants.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To learn more about the Horizen EVM sidechain, check out our <a href="https://youtu.be/DRIm1f9-t6Y">EVM demo video</a>. In this video, Victor and Alberto share some insights into the latest accomplishments with a demo of our EVM pre-Alpha from Oleksandr showing ZEN on MetaMask and some of the basic functionality of the EVM chain.</p>
 Horizen Node Network&nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>2022 was a tough year for the blockchain industry. We saw a decline in the total number of the Horizen nodes, however, the our node network continued remaining one of the largest and providing us a robust and secure infrastructure.&nbsp; Learn more about <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/why-blockchain-users-are-setting-up-horizen-nodes/">why blockchain users are setting up Horizen nodes</a>.</p>
 2022 Partnerships 
<p></p>
<p>In 2022, we welcomed thirteen new integrations, of which three were multicoin exchanges, four new centralized exchanges, the first AMM model exchange support for ZEN, one new wallet, one new PoS provider, two new fiat onramps and expanded our integrations with five existing partners.</p>
<p>In connection with our TokenMint platform, our partner <a href="https://pipeflare.io">PipeFlare</a> (now Layer3 Labs) launched <a href="https://pipeflare.io/game/punkz-hero">Punkz Hero</a>, an exciting play-to-earn Super Mario-type game, even with a custom Zenny character!&nbsp;</p>
 Horizen Community Initiatives&nbsp; 
 Horizen Ambassador Program 
<p>In 2022, we welcomed several new ambassadors to our <a href="https://www.horizen.io/ambassadors/#become-zenvangelist">Ambassador Program</a> and look forward to seeing even more new ambassadors in 2023! We are incredibly grateful for all of the hard work our ambassadors and Zenvangelists put in each day to help grow the Horizen ecosystem, help fellow users and work on making the project thrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for some exciting new initiatives in 2023 centered around developer growth in the Horizen ecosystem! More information will be released around this in the New Year.&nbsp;</p>
 Events 
 ZenCon0 
<p><a href="https://zencon.events/">ZenCon0</a> was our first-ever ecosystem summit, which brought together some of the greatest minds in crypto to envision our future!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Celebrating the growth and accomplishments of our project and ecosystem with partners and supporters was a dream come true for us. Hosted by our sister company Horizen Labs, we welcomed partners, advisors, and community members that joined us at our first ecosystem summit to celebrate our achievements and share ideas for growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two-day conference was filled with spotlights, panels, and break-out sessions ranging from <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">Metaverse on the Horizen</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/zXhR5u3RLhs">Web3 &amp; Sports</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/wGaZRj5VOCg">The Power of Community</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/3nnRnbst7A4">Zen OG stories</a>, and more!</p>
<p><a href="http://zencon.events"></a></p>
<p>On the tech side of things, we heard incredible updates from the Horizen and Horizen Labs teams’ – <a href="https://youtu.be/8dgQ8Vr5FWs">an overview of TokenMint and its current status</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">where the team is on the Horizen EVM sidechain, DeFi on Horizen</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/JvY8o8N4_2Q">what’s next for Zendoo</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenCon0 also brought the global team together in one place to brainstorm, connect, and innovate. The Horizen Labs and Horizen teams from different divisions gave presentations on their expertise areas, which allowed members of other teams to gain exposure and knowledge in areas they might not previously have. Ranging from hands-on demos and product overviews to improving blockchain communications.</p>

 Consensus 2022 
<p></p>
<p>The Horizen team was in Austin, Texas, for Consensus 2022, where we had a fantastic time! We had a booth set up where we were able to give live demos of TokenMint; many attendees stopped by and created their own tokens in only 5 minutes, learning how the token generator works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Co-Founder and Team Lead Rob Viglione presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cGfULIwRg&amp;t=3s">“From Cypherpunk to Solving the Blockchain Trilemma Through zkSNARKS”</a> at Consensus to a packed audience while also conducting a fireside chat on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2JjEdrpM9g&amp;t=1s">“How Zero-Knowledge Proofs Change the Narrative Around Privacy.”</a></p>
<p>Horizen, along with Horizen Labs, hosted a side event with our partner, Halborn Security at Consensus, where guests enjoyed food, drink, and networking! We saw many longtime community members at the event, and it was a good chance for much of the team to network and catch up with each other during the busy event week.</p>
 Paris Blockchain Week 
<p></p>
<p>The Horizen team was at Paris Blockchain Week April 12-14! Our booth was packed during all three days of the event. We discussed our upcoming EVM-compatible sidechain and NFTs, and learned about many exciting new projects in the space. Liat also spoke on several panels about NFTs and blockchain technology. </p>
 NFT NYC 2022 
<p></p>
<p>This year, Zain Cheng, Horizen’s VP of Engineering, presented on the future of NFTs during this major event in NYC. Zain’s panel discussion was one of our favorite talks during the event and covered his opinions on what the future of NFTs could look like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs hosted a Happy Hour event during NFT.NYC and welcomed hundreds of guests and Horizen community members.&nbsp;</p>

 What to Look Forward to in 2023 
<p>Our EVM sidechain project is estimated to go to public testnets in early 2023! The team is working on extensive documentation for the EVM project, creating a more efficient experience for developers to build on Horizen using our EVM. Our EVM is a functioning sidechain, compatible with Ethereum tools and able to execute all Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. It is what we are looking forward to the most, and we hope users are excited to give it a try!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also looking forward to launching our monthly podcast, Beyond the Horizen, which is coming in January 2023! This will be more in-depth conversations with project partners, community members, team members, and more and is an evolution of our Weekly Insider series, be sure to check it out once it launches! More information coming soon on our social media channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, coming early in 2023 is an upgrade to the <a href="https://academy.horizen.io">Horizen Academy</a>. As we continue to publish expertly written educational content on blockchain technology, we’re making some upgrades to the design, structure, and functionality of the Academy. This is a really exciting development as we continue to play our part in educating the world and the community on all things blockchain, crypto, and web3.</p>

This helps direct traffic through the mixnet and allows us to stress-test it to see how much load it can handle and where we can optimise. The proxy site then sends you back a task that is only visible to people using the mixnet, so that you can prove that you have actually used NymConnect and are eligible for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Thank you for being part of the Nym community and making the new internet a free and dignified place for us&nbsp;all.</p><p>#PrivacyLovesCompany!</p><p>Join our <a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord</a> community if you have any questions!</p><p>Read more: <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/test-and-win/">https://shipyard.nymtech.net/test-and-win/</a></p><p>The Nym Network is powered by the NYM Token, a utility token that is used to access and operate the Nym mixnet. NYM should only be used within the Nym mixnet. NYM is not a general purpose payment mechanism, an investment asset, or a cryptocurrency.</p><p>**Test &amp; Earn participation and rewards are only available to individuals who do not reside in locations that makes them ineligible to participate or receive prizes, including the United States, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, the Crimea region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic.

<p>New versions of the Nym software have now been released — the final one of&nbsp;2022!</p><p>Nym software weekly update was released earlier this&nbsp;week.</p><p>We constantly update and improve our software. So if you are running older versions of Nym wallet or NymConnect, you should be getting an auto updater notification to update your software. Alternatively you can download the latest versions of the products and platform binaries from <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Nym&nbsp;website</a>.</p><p>Nym is <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/master">open source</a> and can be forked by anyone wishing to extend functionality.</p><p>What’s new in the Nym platform?</p><p>This release adds multiple Single Use Reply Blocks (SURBs) to allow arbitrarily-sized anonymized replies. At the moment this feature is turned off by default, but available for use by the application developers. We will need to wait for all the network-requesters to upgrade to this new release first, before multi-SURB anonymization can become the default setting for the SOCKS proxy&nbsp;clients.</p><p>The release also includes some additional work for distributed key generation in the Coconut signing authority nodes.</p><p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#v114-2022-12-20">changelog</a> for a complete list of fixes and&nbsp;changes.</p><p>What’s new in NymConnect?</p><p>In addition to bug fixes, performance improvements and better error handling, this release contains the new opt-in Test &amp; Earn program that anyone can join to stress test the network and earn NYM tokens. You can read more about the program&nbsp;<a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/test-and-win">here</a>.</p><p>This version also uses a stress-tested directory of network requesters to improve reliability.</p><p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-connect-v1.1.4/nym-connect/CHANGELOG.md#nym-connect-v114-2022-12-20">changelog</a> for a complete list of fixes and&nbsp;changes</p><p>What’s new in Nym&nbsp;wallet?</p><p>And finally the latest release of the Nym wallet includes a cool new feature called the Playground for the Node operators. If you run a mix node, you can find Playground under the Node Settings. Play around with different parameters to get better and more accurate reward estimations and active set selection probability of your&nbsp;node.</p><p>For the full list of fixes and changes in the wallet please check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-wallet-v1.1.5/nym-wallet/CHANGELOG.md#nym-wallet-v115-2022-12-22">changelog</a>.</p><p>That sums up this week’s release.

 Meet our new hire — Jan Zibelnik, Product&nbsp;Manager <p>#18 — This is the sixteenth post in our “Meet our new hire” series, where we introduce you to the latest additions to our team here at BlockWallet.</p><p>We’d like to welcome our latest team member, Jan Zibelnik! Jan is a talented Product Manager with previous experience in the wallet space. In his last position, he developed a product team from the ground up, and now, he’s bringing his advanced skillset to BlockWallet.</p> What’s your job position? <p>I’m the Product Manager here at BlockWallet. That means I’m responsible for identifying customer needs and business objectives. In addition to that, I also need to figure out what products and features will help us fulfill those needs and objectives of our users, and articulate them for everyone in the company to understand.</p><p>My day-to-day includes competitor research, user interviews, formulating requirements, and aligning business and development efforts.</p> How long have you worked as a product&nbsp;manager? <p>I started working in product in 2018 at my previous company, GateHub. I transitioned from wallet support into product management and we basically had to set up the new department from scratch. After we got the ball rolling, we managed to deliver some neat products to the market. This included a decentralized trading app and an on-chain crypto insurance solution, which from what I know, is the first of its kind and has not been replicated yet.</p> Which projects have you worked on&nbsp;before? <p>I previously worked at GateHub, which is an XRPL gateway and wallet. We offered users a custodial wallet with some unique features like web monetization and a non-custodial XRPL wallet for all kinds of on-chain interactions. In parallel, I was also a judge in the XRPL Grants program, where developers can receive grants for building solutions that leverage the XRPL blcokchain.</p> When did you first get involved in&nbsp;crypto? <p>I first heard about crypto in 2016. I created my first account and bought my first crypto in September or October that same year. It was a very calm time for about a year, so I had time to learn and realize what it could hold for our future. I’m really glad I’m able to say that I survived some highs and lows during this&nbsp;period.</p><p>In late 2017, I switched from my previous career as a football coach to a full-time job in&nbsp;crypto.</p> What made you interested in BlockWallet? <p>I learned of BlockWallet when I received a call from Felipe, the Cheif Vibe Officer here at BlockWallet. I was on the lookout for a new challenge after 4+ years at GateHub, and was keen to switch companies to start learning new stuff — joining BlockWallet and transitioning to an EVM + self-custodial wallet was very intriguing to me. On top of that, when I learned about how BlockWallet wanted to position itself in the market, I was convinced.</p><p>I’m sure that in the long run, products that care about their users will prosper. A lot of the time it’s harder to be ethical and caring, especially if the competition is not, but my personal and professional tendency is to think about the user first, making this relationship a natural&nbsp;match.</p> Why do you think privacy matters on blockchains? <p>Because even if you have nothing to hide, you never know who is&nbsp;looking.</p><p>That’s the short answer. The long one though, is a bit more complicated.</p><p>The internet does not have a built-in monetization system. The result of this oversight at the very beginning is ads and data mining which online businesses need to do in order to stay afloat. In the years of Web2, data mining has become so sophisticated and widespread that only the most skilled users are able to remain fully anonymous. Most of us are just leaving bits and pieces of our info and behavior scattered all over the internet. The result is, that with a bit of effort, your sensitive info can be tracked and exploited, even if you take great care — but who really has time to think about&nbsp;that?</p><p>This is why privacy is so critical to help break our digital footprint. Our phone and laptop, our browser, our wallet, our paid services…they should work for us, not the other way around. They should help use preserve our&nbsp;privacy.</p> Do you have any predictions on where crypto will be 5 years from&nbsp;now? <p>5 years ago, we had ICOs and CryptoKitties. We had our share of scams, but I feel it was a more innocent place back&nbsp;then.</p><p>In 5 years, we’ll probably see an evolution of everything we know now. DAOs are probably going to become more sophisticated, trustworthy, and effective. NFTs are going to break into the mainstream, but they will evolve into more than overpriced JPEGs. Think tickets to events, proofs of ownership, proofs of participation — stuff we already know, but better. Regulations are going to come into force and evolve too, which should make the space somewhat safer and more reliable.</p><p>We are going to have new players that will want to disrupt traditional CEXes where Celsius and FTX failed. So I expect to see new (decentralized and centralized) players in stocks, futures, derivatives, indices&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Finally, we can probably expect the next bull run to be fuelled by some hot new tech (gaming, metaverse, something else?), more shills, more FOMO, and more everything.</p><p>My approach: stay level-headed, and stay safe&nbsp;;)</p> Parting thoughts <p>I’m thrilled to be a part of BlockWallet. I’ve met the team and already settled in nicely. I love the work we are doing, and I’m loving all the feedback from the community. I’m excited about the stuff we have brewing in the background and can’t wait to share it with everyone.</p> About BlockWallet <p>Welcome to Web3’s smoothest self-custodial wallet, where you can swap and bridge crypto right on the spot. Use BlockWallet with all your favorite blockchain apps and feel what it’s like to use a product built with users in mind.

<p>Brave’s native crypto wallet now features integrations from Civic, DeFi Land, Degen Ape Academy, EDGE, Froggy Friends, Hubble, Kamino, Kwenta, Orca, Push Protocol, and Slingshot.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Since launching the Brave Wallet in 2021, we’ve been hard at work collaborating with developers across the Web3 ecosystem to integrate Brave Wallet support into the most used DApps on Solana, Ethereum, and EVM-compatible networks.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to end the year with 85 partners that have integrated the Brave Wallet, including 11 new ones this month, as well as hundreds more DApps and wallet development kits that are now compatible with Brave Wallet. To learn more about the program and Brave’s partners, read our past announcements: <a>June</a>, <a>July</a>, <a>August</a>, <a>September</a>, <a>October</a>, and <a>November</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the partners that joined in December:</p>

 Civic 
<p><a href="https://www.civic.com/">Civic</a> provides identity management tools for Web3 across chains for both consumers and DApps. For consumers, <a href="https://civic.me/">Civic.me</a> offers Dynamic Web3 profiles where you can display NFTs, manage your identity, and use on-chain messaging. For DApps, Civic Pass is an integrated permissioning tool that gives users access to their services.</p>
<p>“We’ve always seen eye-to-eye with Brave when it comes to putting the privacy of our users first. That’s why we’re delighted to offer support for Brave users on Civic.me, where they can access the most advanced, privacy-focused digital identity tools on the market,” said JP Bedoya, Chief Product Officer at Civic.</p>

 DeFi Land 
<p><a href="https://defiland.app/">DeFi Land</a> is a free-to-play farming game that aggregates and abstracts crypto elements to make it easy to use, fun to play, and engaging to learn. The game offers players the opportunity to start playing for free, grind their way up to the “Play and Earn” tier, compete with other players, and craft, trade, and dive into DeFi in a fun and exciting way.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have Brave Wallet integrated in DeFi Land and can’t wait to build exciting future collaborative products together,” said DFL Erwin, Team Lead at DeFi Land.</p>

 Degenerate Ape Academy 
<p>The <a href="https://www.degenape.academy/">Degenerate Ape Academy</a> is a collection of 10,000 NFTs on the Solana blockchain. As Solana’s first large-scale, truly trustless drop, they were instrumental in proving the chain’s viability as a legitimate future home of NFTs—with over $140 million in sales.</p>

 EDGE 
<p><a href="https://earnify.tv/">EDGE’</a>s Watch2Earn is a platform that can be added to video streaming sites and apps to increase revenue through increased ad consumption and content sharing. It is supported by the EDGE Web3 Video Network. The platform allows users to earn money by watching ads and sharing content.</p>

 Froggy Friends 
<p><a href="https://www.froggyfriendsnft.com/staking">Froggy Friends</a> is a collection of 4,444 friendly frogs on the Ethereum blockchain. They are a community-driven project whose core values are kindness, fairness, and integrity.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly honored to partner with a Web3 pioneer like Brave. We look forward to welcoming the Brave community into the Froggy Friends ecosystem via our integration with Brave wallet,” said Fonzy, Co-Founder at Froggy Friends.</p>

 Hubble 
<p><a href="https://app.hubbleprotocol.io/?utm_source=Brave_blog&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=Brave_wallet_DEC_22">Hubble Protocol</a> provides battle-tested borrowing solutions with USDH, an overcollateralized, crypto-backed stablecoin users can mint to participate in DeFi on Solana. Users can borrow USDH and leverage their portfolio against a basket of crypto assets including bluechip tokens (SOL, ETH), liquid staking tokens (stSOL, mSOL, daoSOL), and yield-bearing tokens (cTokens, kTokens) for a one-time 0.5% fee.</p>
<p>“As a DeFi protocol focused on UX and security, Hubble is more than happy to integrate the Brave Wallet for borrowing USDH. Brave has become one of the most advanced and easy-to-use browsers for Web3, and it’s chock full of security features that protect users from malicious actors as they browse,” said Marius Ciubotariu, a core contributor at Hubble Protocol.</p>

 Kamino 
<p><a href="https://app.kamino.finance/?utm_source=Brave_blog&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=Brave_wallet_DEC_22">Kamino Finance</a> is on a mission to become Solana’s number one liquidity destination. The protocol offers various opportunities for earning real yield and rewards from the Solana DEX ecosystem by optimizing concentrated liquidity positions. Users deposit tokens on Kamino, and the vaults automatically set price ranges, rebalance positions, and compound fees earned from trades.</p>
<p>“Kamino Finance is proud to integrate Brave’s browser-based wallet on the platform. Both Kamino and Brave strive to reduce the barriers to entry for participating in Web3, and access to a user-friendly crypto wallet built into the Brave Browser is a major step towards onboarding new users to DeFi,” said Mark Hull, a core contributor at Kamino Finance.</p>

 Kwenta 
<p><a href="https://kwenta.eth.limo/">Kwenta</a> is a decentralized exchange offering up to 25x synthetic leverage on a variety of assets. By leveraging Chainlink oracles and deep liquidity from Synthetix, Kwenta offers exposure to over a dozen assets including cryptocurrencies, commodities, and forex pairs. Users who trade from a Kwenta Cross Margin wallet have access to advanced order types, deposit management, and other Kwenta-exclusive features. Traders who stake the Kwenta token are eligible to earn rewards as they trade.</p>
<p>“We believe users should have access to financial tools while retaining full control of their assets. By integrating the Brave Wallet, Kwenta can further this mission by bringing decentralized perps to millions of new users with the unrivaled privacy and security offered by Brave,” said Burt Rock, MarketingDAO PM at Kwenta.</p>

 Orca 
<p><a href="https://www.orca.so/">Orca</a> is the leading crypto marketplace on Solana. The protocol’s focus on human-centered design makes it easy for anyone to trade, earn, or build in Web3. For traders, the core concentrated liquidity AMM (CLAMM) makes it easy to buy and sell crypto at the best possible price. For market makers, advanced liquidity provision tools enable highly efficient returns on capital. And for developers, Orca’s double-audited, open-source SDK and expert developer advocates simplify the process of building in Web3. Today, Orca powers everything from market-making tools to trade aggregators to games.</p>
<p>“Integrating with Brave Wallet is a meaningful step for Orca, honoring its primary mission of creating financial opportunity through equitable access for anyone. Brave’s global presence and focus on ease-of-use makes it a mission-aligned partner for Orca, and we are excited to provide Brave wallet users with access to easily trade or earn on the most capital efficient crypto marketplace on Solana, " said KZ, Head of Growth at Orca</p>

 Push Protocol 
<p><a href="https://push.org/">Push Protocol</a> is the communication protocol of web3. Push enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for DApps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet / frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across. Since its launch Push has powered over 45 Million notifications to 60k+ subscribers, across 100+ integrations and is currently live on Ethereum and Polygon.</p>
<p>“One of the most important tenets of the Web3 space is privacy. Brave has been absolutely leading the way when it comes to shipping one of the most advanced wallets and browsers that respect users’ privacy. Now Brave Wallet’s integration with Push brings decentralized communications to the Brave ecosystem and serves millions of users and builders is a clear sign that privacy and decentralization are here to stay,” said Harsh Rajat, Founder at Push Protocol.</p>

 Slingshot 
<p><a href="https://slingshot.finance/">Slingshot</a> is a DeFi application and wallet that lets you buy, sell, and swap over 40,000 cryptocurrencies at the best prices with 0% swap fees. Users can access real-time charts and market data for each token, set up custom price alerts, and connect with traders all over the world in the global chat. Slingshot is currently available on the Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance, and Osmosis networks.</p>
<p>“As a web3 wallet and application, we at Slingshot are committed to ensuring the protection of users’ privacy and security, especially when it comes to swapping crypto and engaging in the DeFi ecosystem. We are excited to integrate with the Brave Wallet, to further the mission of decentralization, while empowering users to take an active role in the progression of web3,” said Chelsea Spinos, Head of Marketing&nbsp;</p>

<p>When discussing the widespread adoption of true, peer-to-peer decentralization, one could easily identify various social and political obstacles. However, there is also an often overlooked technological impairment as the underlying architecture of computer networks was not designed to achieve global-scale decentralization. Ideally a complete restructuring would be necessary, from applications and programming language, to as profound as rewriting operating system kernels.

     Similar to how Web 2.0 relies on data centers to provide the backbone for applications, blockchain technology needs nodes to keep the network humming along. Nodes verify transactions and secure the network, making them a critical part of any blockchain infrastructure. 
<p><a href="https://www.horizen.io/">Horizen</a> is a public blockchain with more nodes than any other blockchain. In this article, we’ll examine why blockchain users are setting up <a href="https://horizen.io/zennodes">Horizen nodes</a>.</p>
 Why Should You Set Up A Node? 
<p>Setting up a blockchain node is easier than ever, and there are also good reasons to do so. Let’s discuss some of the benefits of running a Horizen node.</p>
<p>Contributing to integrity and decentralization of a blockchain network</p>
<p>A nexus of nodes is essentially the infrastructure of a decentralized blockchain network. The node network plays an important role in defending the blockchain from unwanted changes. This can be especially important during times of hard fork contention. As a node operator, you have a say in how the network progresses, such as authenticating transactions and executing decision-making protocols.</p>
<p>Making the network more scalable and faster</p>
<p>Another key benefit of running a node is that it helps to propagate transactions throughout the network. By running a node, you’re helping to ensure that transactions are processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Getting rewarded by contributing to the network</p>
<p>Beyond contributing to the security and resilience of a blockchain network, running a cryptocurrency node also comes with the potential to generate passive income.</p>
<p>Staking Rewards is a website that provides real-time information on the rewards being generated by nodes on various blockchains. For example, at the time of writing, a <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/horizen/">ZEN Securenode</a> has a 7.77% annualized reward rate (APR), while Ethereum 2.0 has an APR of 4.8%.</p>
<p>The amount of reward that a node earns can vary depending on network conditions and other factors. For example, Foundry Staking <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/foundry-announces-digital-assets-staking-business-and-range-of-services-for-institutions-301420872.html">recently announced</a> the launch of its institutional-grade staking service. Through the Foundry Staking portal, institutions can stake a variety of different cryptocurrencies and receive rewards in near-real-time, including from ZEN.</p>
 How to Set Up A Horizen Node 
<p>It’s very easy to set up a Horizen node. For hassle free hosting option, we recommend checking out some of our <a href="https://horizen.io/node-hosting">node hosting guide </a>to get started.&nbsp; You will not need any developer skills to run nodes through hosting services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Authors: Sofía Celi, cryptography researcher at Brave; Alex Davidson, former cryptography researcher at Brave; and Gonçalo Pestana, former cryptography researcher at Brave.</p>
<p>One of the interesting problems in computer science with regard to security and privacy is how to retrieve items from a database, without revealing anything about the query to the untrusted server(s) where this database lives. Today, we’re going to be talking about some very recent scientific work we have done at Brave to make this a genuine possibility for a variety of applications.</p>
<p>The TL;DR is that we have built a new Private Information Retrieval (PIR) scheme called FrodoPIR, that we hope will make PIR easier and cheaper to deploy for a variety of use-cases and applications, such as Safe Browsing, checking passwords over breached databases, certificate revocation checks, streaming, and more. We have an <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/frodo-pir">open-source implementation</a> that you can use now, as well as <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/981">a paper</a> that explains the scheme. The paper has been accepted into the first issue of <a href="https://petsymposium.org/cfp23.php">PoPETS 2023</a>!&nbsp; We’re calling the scheme FrodoPIR because the client can perform hidden queries to the server, just as Frodo remained hidden from Sauron.</p>

 Private Database Access Overview 
<p>Why is the issue of privacy important when retrieving items from a database? Let’s say, for example, that you want to use your favorite streaming platform to watch videos of dogs. But, actually, you’re a little bit embarrassed of revealing — to the platform — how many dog videos you watch (you shouldn’t be, but that’s the world we live in). Moreover, you would love to avoid anyone from being able to exploit that data so they can show you invasive targeted advertising campaigns, for example. What would be great is if you could receive this content, without the (untrusted) provider being able to tell what it is you are streaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Private_information_retrieval">Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes</a> are a set of cryptographic protocols that have been proposed as a solution to this exact problem. As with most cryptography, the first schemes arrived in the 1990’s, but it hasn’t been until the last six or seven years that candidate schemes have been designed that may approach having high enough performance to work in modern-day use-cases. However, the landscape remains quite complicated: many schemes are tailored to very specific use-cases to achieve low bandwidth or server runtimes, or they may require complex server-side deployments (e.g. using at least two non-colluding servers) to fulfill PIR queries.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we created FrodoPIR! This new PIR scheme we are announcing is intensely configurable, efficient across a wide swath of applications, easy to understand and implement, requires only a single untrusted server to deploy, and comes with concrete privacy and security guarantees against both classical and quantum adversaries (because we use lattices, as we will see).</p>

 PIR: The General Idea 
<p>Broadly speaking, the way that most single-server PIR schemes work is by using a cryptographic tool known as additively homomorphic encryption (AHE). Such encryption schemes allow someone with two ciphertexts that encrypt X and Y to compute a ciphertext that encrypts X+Y, without knowledge of the secret key. Such schemes have been around since RSA, but one commonly-used example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paillier_cryptosystem">Paillier encryption</a> scheme.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Figure 1: an AHE system</p>
<p>But how do we build a PIR protocol from such a thing? As seen in Figure 1, the answer is remarkably simple:</p>
 
 The server organizes its database into a set of M rows, each containing a single element. In other words, the database is now a vector. 
 Any client that wants to learn the ith element, encrypts M ciphertexts, where the ith ciphertext encrypts 1, and the rest of them encrypt 0. 
 The client sends their ciphertexts to the server; due to the nature of the encryption, the server cannot tell what is encrypted. 
 The server performs a scalar multiplication of each entry db_entry_1,…,db_entry_M of its database vector with the corresponding ciphertext in each, adds them all together into a single ciphertext and returns this back to the client. Note that scalar multiplications are possible by adding each ciphertext to itself according to the size of the scalar. 
 Now, after the client decrypts each ciphertext, it will simply learn db_entry_i, since: 0db_entry_1,…,1db_entry_i,…,0*db_entry_M = db_entry_i. 
 
<p>Essentially, over the past number of years, it has been shown that constructing PIR can be done quite efficiently using this simple method (and some optimizations). This is achieved by using&nbsp; AHE schemes based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography">cryptographic lattices</a>, in particular based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">fully homomorphic encryption</a> (FHE) schemes, with security derived from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_learning_with_errors">ring learning with errors</a> (RLWE) assumption.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about these a bit more shortly. Some things to note before we do:</p>
 
 It’s possible to construct PIR with multiple servers with higher efficiency, but under the assumption that the servers do not collude. Such assumptions are known to be quite strong in real-world settings, and it is preferred to avoid them, if possible. 
 The server are assumed to be honest-but-curious, i.e. they execute the protocol honestly, but attempt to learn more from the client query alone. A malicious server can obviously choose to not run the PIR protocol properly, and clients will get bad answers. 
 The server database is assumed to be public. If the database should be treated as sensitive (i.e. clients should not be able to learn anything other than their query), then PIR is not really the correct tool to use (though, there are some symmetric PIR constructions that give insight into this). 
 

 Limitations to existing approaches 
<p>At Brave, we became interested in using PIR for having clients retrieve certain things from Brave, without the server knowing. Unfortunately, despite experimenting with various existing systems, we were never able to build something that didn’t involve huge costs, or large amounts of implementation complexity. This led us to start thinking about how we could try and build a PIR scheme that fit these requirements a little better and to create a new approach: FrodoPIR. Let’s see now what are the limitations of existing approaches.</p>
<p>A common issue even with fairly recent PIR schemes is that they are expensive in terms of either bandwidth, or in the amount of time taken to process each client query. In order to drive down the costs, FHE-based PIR schemes can move large proportions of the expensive online computation and communication (which is, for example, the sending of the query) to an offline phase (a “preparation” phase that can be later reused to make online queries). These kinds of schemes are called offline-online or stateful, as opposed to online-only or stateless.</p>
<p>However, a key difficulty that has gone unsolved is that either the computation or the communication costs induced during the offline phase scale linearly in the number of clients that will make queries, or the client has to download the entire server database (which defeats the purpose). This means that the offline phase has to be performed between each client and the server, which translates, in principle, to a lot of expensive computation that the server has to do. If you’re using commercial hardware to run your server, these costs are likely to run up huge financial costs.</p>

 Announcing FrodoPIR! 



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Just as the state of Sauron (its ring) moved to Frodo, we can move the mu and A to the client. The client then can then perform hidden queries to the server, just as Frodo remains hidden from Sauron.</p>
<p>We are excited to present FrodoPIR, a stateful PIR scheme that is built directly upon the learning with errors (LWE) problem. We get rid of the ring lattice structures (as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frodo_Baggins">Frodo needs to do</a>: a reference first made in the naming of the <a href="https://frodokem.org/">FrodoKEM proposal</a>, and that we now borrow ourselves) to bring a flexible and practically efficient PIR scheme for a variety of use-cases. The core of the FrodoPIR scheme is an offline phase that requires no client-dependent computation, and incurs only a relatively small download compared to the database size (e.g. 170x smaller). This makes it suitable for many large, real-world deployments, where lowering financial costs for server-side operators is of paramount importance. FrodoPIR is also significantly simpler than previous schemes, making no use of FHE techniques and requiring only modular arithmetic. Read the whole paper describing it <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/981.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FrodoPIR is a scheme that relies on the <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/papers/qcrypto.pdf">decisional LWE problem</a>: each client query is a noisy vector that appears uniformly random to the server. As stated, it has both offline and online phases:</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Figure 2: Diagram of the flow of FrodoPIR</p>
 
 In the offline phase, the server interprets the database as a matrix, applies a compression function to said matrix and makes the results available as global public parameters (mu and M). This compression function shrinks the size of the database. 
 In the offline phase, the client downloads the public parameters (mu and M), and computes ‘c’ sets of preprocessed query parameters. 
 In the online phase, the client uses a single set of preprocessed query parameters to produce an “encrypted” query vector, which is sent to the server. 
 The server responds to the query by multiplying the vector with its database matrix. 
 The client returns the result by “decrypting” the response using its preprocessed query parameters. 
 
<p>What this means is that in the offline phase, the server and client prepare anything that can be previously prepared for online queries; and, in the online phase, the client sends encrypted queries to the server. The latter returns a positive or negative value depending if the query is found in the database or not. The server never learns which value you are querying for, and yet it returns the correct answer (if it was included in the database or not).</p>
<p>FrodoPIR is a powerful primitive as it makes PIR schemes practical for real-world usage where not only communicational and computational costs are important but also financial ones. PIRs, in general, are powerful: they can be applied to <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a>, <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">checking passwords over breached databases</a> (or any type of credentials), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01661">Certificate Transparency (CT) checks, certificate revocation checks</a>, or for streaming. Having a cheap and efficient scheme will help improve the privacy of the whole Internet not only for big actors, but also for anyone providing such service.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that there are other PIR schemes beyond FrodoPIR, but the latter outperforms them all, as seen in Figure 3 below. The figure shows a comparison of per-client computational, communication, and financial costs for the server when running FrodoPIR, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3485381">Stateful OnionPIR (SOnionPIR)</a>, and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243821">PSIR</a>, assuming that each client makes c = 500 queries.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Figure 3: Comparison of FrodoPIR with other PIR schemes</p>
<p>So, what is next, and how can Brave users expect to see FrodoPIR implemented? At Brave, we care about deploying privacy-preserving schemes that make the Internet private and safe. One of our next efforts is to have a credential checker: any credential entered through the Brave browser (like, for example, passwords) can be checked against known breached databases. This can provide a safe mechanism to signal users to, for example, change their passwords. But such checking (the queries launched against the breached database) should be private. And, on this, FrodoPIR shines as a mechanism to provide privacy in a financially cheap and efficient fast way.</p>
<p>To read more about our FrodoPIR scheme, you can find details <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/981">here</a>. The paper has been accepted to the Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETS), Vol. 2023, Issue 1, and will also appear <a href="https://www.petsymposium.org/2023/paperlist.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks I’ve been collecting clips on platform labor, reputation scores, human capital finance, and coding the Web3 global smart contract layer. I just finished pulling together a twenty-clip playlist, which can be reviewed on my back up channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUcrhDVaUj97iH4j80X7QlebA_kOBinab">here</a>. </p>
<p>I also created an interactive interface using Kumu.io software – below. Click on any dot, and a sidebar will open with the corresponding link. About half of the clips are under two minutes. The longest is ten minutes. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Later tonight I’m planning to do a watch party where I walk through them and talk about my concerns for a future digital economy where life is lived on the blockchain ledger and your “bosses” are Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. For me it’s less about crypto and more about tokenized “governance.” Remember when you see “govern” think steering and cybernetics. I’ll be aiming for 8:30pm EST if you want to join it. It will be on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AlisonMcDowell/streams">main youtube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Thoughts and observations welcome. Feature image pulled from Intitute for the Future’s Blockchain Lab map 2017-2027 <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iftf_blockchainfutures_map.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Advancing more projects build for privacy, for a better&nbsp;society</p><p>At Nym, it is important that more people can build for privacy in order to accelerate complete privacy protection on the new internet and the network layer is one of the hardest to protect. With surveillance now powered by Machine Learning algorithms, privacy protections need to keep pace! This means protecting not just content and IP addresses but also the patterns of communications and the metadata.</p><p>Nym allows applications to easily integrate a mixnet, offering some of the strongest privacy protections to their end users. The aim is to ensure that our digital lives are safer and we can thrive in a free and surveillance-free society. And the developer grants are here to support you doing&nbsp;so!</p><p>The Shipyard Developer Grant&nbsp;scheme</p><p>As such, we recently <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-developer-grants-4a37a33be49d">launched the next tranche of Shipyard grants</a>, targeted at developers. With two open calls, Vinge Grant and Brier Grant, the Developer Grant scheme is a great opportunity for us to support developers across a variety of projects.</p><p>Benefits of the&nbsp;scheme</p><p>The scheme will provide the winners with financial, dev, marketing and project support, to maximise their chances of a successful project. The grants scheme is designed so that projects can grow and apply for larger and larger pots and potentially graduate to the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-a-first-round-of-grantees-and-the-upcoming-nym-innovation-fund-73b547682d26">Nym Innovation fund</a> if they wish to pursue investment opportunities.</p><p>Congratulations to the&nbsp;grantees</p><p>We are therefore pleased to announce the winners of the first Developer Grant&nbsp;scheme:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/notrustverif/">No Trust&nbsp;Verify</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkFiSquad/">DarkFi Squad</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/liamarzola/">NymHub</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/HansBricks3/">dial0ut</a>  <a href="https://github.com/Tyz3">Meridien Project</a>  <p>Winners were selected based on quality of ideas and code. Some of the projects are also known to our Nym community. No Trust Verify is known a Nym mixnode and creator of <a href="https://pastenym.ch/#/">pastenym</a>, DarkFi is known amongst our community as the ultimate lunarpunk privacy crew and working on an interesting mixture of p2p tech and zkp, while dial0out was a former Nym core team member doing developer relations.</p><p>What can we look forward to from the&nbsp;grantees</p><p>We are confident that the projects that are supported by the grant will play a strong role in our push for privacy as&nbsp;default.</p><p>From anonymity enhancement in network p2p protocols and text and file sharing in a privacy-preserving way to a secure, private IoT hub providers and an accessible interface for interacting with Nym, our community can expect to see the exciting work to be available by the first half of next&nbsp;year.</p><p>Next open&nbsp;calls</p><p>Going into 2023, there will be regular open calls for the Developer Grants scheme for both smaller and larger&nbsp;grants.</p><p>If you are interested in applying for the next round, do check out the work of this round’s grantees to get inspired. We have also released tools like the Nym SDK which will continue to be fleshed out with new features such as zk-nyms (fka Coconut credentials).

<p>Congratulations to all our new Sailmakers!</p><p>After a stimulating and productive six weeks immersing in all things privacy, our inaugural Shipyard Academy cohort has graduated!</p><p>We saw over 6,000 sign ups when we <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/welcome-to-nym-shipyard-academy-ceb25ac8d3ff">launched Shipyard Academy</a>, which is a strong testament to the increased interest in learning about and taking back control of our individual privacy.</p><p>Over the course of three stages, participants had access to learning materials, attended a lecture conducted by different Nym core team members, performed tasks and then took a quiz to test their new-found knowledge. Those who progressed through each stage were rewarded with NYM tokens from an overall prize pool of 115K NYM tokens. A quick recap on the stages and the respective themes:</p>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/welcome-to-nym-shipyard-academy-ceb25ac8d3ff">Stage 1 — Nymster</a>: Participants learned the basics of the problems of privacy online, what a mixnet is and how the Nym infrastructure contributes to defeating surveillance capitalism  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-academy-welcome-to-stage-2-d697802c2275">Stage 2 — Navigator</a>: Participants learned more about the Nym mixnet, how it relates to the Nyx blockchain, using <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>, the token economics and how incentives help to ensure the privacy and security of the Nym mixnet.They also had hands-on experience in spreading the word to others about privacy&nbsp;online.  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-academy-welcome-to-stage-3-6d1abe2a6c9e">Stage 3 — Sailmaker</a>: Participants applied their new-found knowledge privacy-enhance new apps, extended the Nym infrastructure to underrepresented areas, submitted PoCs using Nym clients and/or produced original creatives that localise the issue of privacy and the benefits of Nym for their specific communities.  <p>The Nym core team got an opportunity to interact with the Academy participants through lectures on the basics of Nym, surveillance 101, Nym mixnet tech deep dive, Nym token economics, what privacy means for society and innovation and the cypherpunk history of mixnets. Watch all the lectures&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsWiaVT3PqQ&amp;list=PLoc3wV2YJYwpa_EMZg1haPGelzg87f4W0">here</a>.</p><p>The quality of all the people that participated was outstanding and the graduates are truly experts of the Nym infrastructure. Together, everyone learned a lot, extended the Nym infrastructure to new parts of the world, spread the word about the importance of privacy and our mission and made new connections with fellow privacy advocates.</p><p>Nick Shikhirev — All human beings deserve a right for privacy. Unfortunately current tools can’t cover this demand due to technical limitations. But I believe that Nym can do that. You’re a team of true privacy enthusiasts and it’s an honour to contribute to your&nbsp;mission!</p><p>Teckel Trades — I live in Latin America, where serious privacy violations occur frequently, but people are still unaware of this and how to defend their rights. I believe Nym is the future of privacy and everyone should know about it. (Translated from&nbsp;Spanish)</p><p>Zosima — The motivation is simple — belief in the power of the project, belief in humanity. I sincerely believe that the project we are involved in is extremely important in the new realities of humanity. (Translated from&nbsp;Russian)</p><p>Today, over 200 graduates have demonstrated that they can create the sails that will carry the global Nym community across the digital oceans. They will be invited to apply to be bona fide Nymjas — Nym ambassadors and will represent and organise for the Nym mission of providing network layer privacy to people, organisations and infrastructures across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Some more words from the Academy participants:</p><p>Oheka — In an increasingly unstable world where threats to our digital integrity is increasingly felt, it has become essential to be able to protect ourselves: by being educated and by raising awareness around us on this topic, by helping to develop and make known the appropriate tools. Nym is one of these&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Pawnflake — Sure online privacy has always been a concern but I always assumed it was just not possible to achieve that privacy easily. Then I found&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>[NODERS] Gingah — In these turbulent times we live in, the world really needs projects like Nym. In my mind, Nym should become a movement created by few but promoted by many. I want to be part of many in order to help the few to bring important change to the&nbsp;world.</p><p>(Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.)</p><p>The impact of Shipyard Academy has been a resounding success and we are excited to see our community expand through our participants, regardless of whether they are Nymsters, Navigators or Sailmakers.</p><p>Going into 2023, we will open applications for a new cohort of Shipyard Academy. Follow our socials for the latest&nbsp;updates.</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym. Join our community to participate and keep up to&nbsp;date:</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p><a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-academy-inaugural-graduation-332682222e45">Nym Shipyard Academy inaugural graduation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>December 8th, 2022. Panther, a cross-chain application that will allow retail users as well as institutions to access DeFi privately and compliantly, has launched its v0.5. This was achieved by the protocol’s community in conjunction with Panther Ventures Limited, a Web3 development company destined to develop the blockchain technology and zero-knowledge components of Panther.<br></p><p>Panther Ventures Limited collaborators developed the protocol’s software and released it under a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/23/uniswap-v3-introduces-new-license-to-spoil-future-sushis/">BUSL License</a>, which grants users the right to copy, modify, create derivative works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work. The Licensed Work will eventually be made available under an Open-Source License, as stated in this License.<br></p><p>The development of Panther’s v0.5 was also aided by the Panther Foundation, which focuses on promoting privacy and fostering the Panther ecosystem. The Panther community discussed and established the terms for v0.5’s launch and voted upon them on the protocol’s <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot.org space</a>. <br></p><p>Besides issuing rewards through its staking solution, Panther’s v0.5 will allow Panther’s community of contributors to test the technological primitives that will be used by the Mainnet launch of the full protocol to enable confidential DeFi. This allows Panther to start testing and utilizing key technical components of the main protocol incrementally. <br></p><p>Panther’s upcoming version 1.0 will allow retail users as well as institutions to interact with DeFi without undergoing the risk of having their transaction history being exposed or copied by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. <br></p><p>This will be a major milestone that will offer a solution to the biggest challenge facing DeFi: onboarding institutions, legacy players, and FinTechs into the Web3 financial paradigm compliantly and confidentially.<br></p><p>To access Panther's v0.5 and learn more about the technical components of Panther, <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/">visit the project’s website</a>.<br></p><p>Press contact: press@pantherprotocol.io<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a><br></p> About Panther Ventures Limited <p>Panther Ventures Limited (PVL) is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing Panther Protocol informed by its community.<br></p> About the Panther Foundation <p>The Panther Foundation supports Panther’s purpose to promote privacy, fostering Panther’s ecosystem and development.</p>

<p>Today, Panther Ventures Limited, a Web3 development company leading the development of Panther Protocol, is welcoming Asheesh Birla as an advisor. With his decade-long history in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, he brings a wealth of knowledge and experience that will be invaluable to our mission: creating a privacy layer for DeFi.</p><p>Birla currently serves on the board of Ripple, and has been part of Ripple's founding team since 2013, serving as General Manager of RippleNet until last June. He also invests in early stage projects through Angel Track, having previously built up successful portfolios with Bitso, Nium, Azimo, Moneygram, Thomson Reuters, and Kno (acquired by Intel). Additionally, Asheesh lectures at Wharton School University, Pennsylvania.</p><p>As Panther Co-Founder, Chief Scientist and CTO Anish Mohammed expressed, "Asheesh has had a ring side in the evolution of web3/crypto for past decade. I’m personally excited to continue our collaboration from the Ripple days and look forward to leveraging his 9+ years of crypto expertise and experience in Panther.”</p><p>The Panther DAO and community is making rapid strides towards releasing v1 of Panther Protocol –a compliant gateway that offers private DeFi access to both retail users and institutes alike. Thus, it's vital we build an elite team comprised of esteemed experts from around the world specializing in zero-knowledge technology.<br><br></p><p>Birla has expressed his utmost confidence in the Panther project's goal of providing private financial services, particularly within DeFi. He likened its potential to that of Ripple’s early days; citing a proficient design cognizant about mixing compliant laws with advanced blockchain technology as integral for success.<br></p><p>“I am incredibly optimistic about Panther becoming a leader in the regulated DeFi privacy segment, which is rapidly evolving and can be positively impacted by the project’s upcoming products. Panther Ventures reminds me of Ripple’s early days, with a highly capable team that understands the importance of combining solid legal grounds and state-of-the-art blockchain technology.“ &nbsp;—- Asheesh Birla.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a></p>

<p>The predecessor to the office was Florence’s Uffizi Gallery – an admin building to the Medici mercantile empire. That was in… 1560. In the centuries to come, work was revolutionized, with perhaps the most well-known inflection of Ford Motors adopting the 40-hour work week in 1926. The cubicle? We have Robert Propst to thank for that, entering the picture in 1968.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t until the 80s when the Internet appeared on the scene and wifi released in 1997, forever changing the way people live and work. Since then, companies have continued to adopt many of the practices from the 20th century, despite the possibilities being fundamentally different.</p><p>COVID sent a shock into that system, forcing many people to adopt a distributed model and despite much debate about what the future holds, this episode will highlight the many ways that companies are continuing to adapt.</p><p>Will companies shift toward more asynchronous work? How will a distributed model shift the way we hire? How will companies attract top talent, and is remote the only benefit that matters? What workers and companies will come out on top of this sea change?</p><p>And of course… is the office dead?

<p>Build systems are the heart of every engineering team and become even more crucial when dealing with microservices and all the dependencies that come with them. When I joined Circle, my first task focused on improving our build systems for microservices connecting to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">EVM-compatible</a> blockchains. We already had a fairly mature build system but felt we could get more out of it. To set consistent standards for us internally at Circle and simplify our Web3 development process, we created <a href="https://github.com/circlefin/contract-cli">Contract-CLI</a> – a configurable build tool for smart contracts.</p>

<p>This post features four related videos. The first is a two-and-a-half-minute overview from DAO Stack, a company based in Israel, that describes a future of decentralized governance of cyber-physical systems with automated encoded rules.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, there’s a short clip from the neuro-economics talk at the Philocetes Center in 2007 about oxytocin-induced social trust. It’s a little under five minutes long. Listen to this and realize we are being dosed with “trust” hormones and steering systems by our personal devices via clicks, likes, etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Following that is a second from a recent talk on “regenerative” finance or ReFi about phone-based prompts for actionable “sustainable” behavior change. Pay close attention around timestamp three minutes about phones, peer signaling, and timely prompts. It’s about four minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The third is a longer video, about thirty minutes. I made it in the spring of 2021 about Philadelphia’s <a href="https://www.recyclereminders.com/blog/recycling-guides/a-guide-to-recycling-in-philadelphia/">RecycleBank Points program</a>, started by a Wharton alumnus. I created it after I began to realize what it was really about after years of hauling my plastic bin with a barcode to the front sidewalk every Wednesday.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For folks looking to take a deeper dive into how crypto-economics is meant to interface with the internet of everything, I feel like this series by Pat Rawson, co-founder of Curve Labs and former market guy for DAO Stack, lays out many of the concepts with which we should become more familiar.</p>

<p>This week I joined my Texas friend Lynn Davenport on her “Social Impact Podcast” for a half-hour discussion of school choice, digital vouchers, and the future of gig work where a contingent workforce is expected to build out Web3 extended reality under the supervision of artificial intelligence. </p>
<p>The culture wars are really doing a number on people – both sides. There is some irony in the fact that many proponents of school choice who may believe they’re getting one over on the government by securing a backpack of digital credits for independent education are actually taking poisoned bait back to the nest. It doesn’t make me happy, because I want all children to have opportunities that will allow them become thoughtful, curious, confident explorers of all that life has to offer and to have the supports they need to develop their gifts. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, what multi-national corporations have in store is a future of low-wage, on-demand work and a life slogging through code to try and stay one step ahead of an infernal machine. Yes, it’s sad state of affairs, which is why they system is implementing so many mental health initiatives – that and they also want the data sets to train their golem. Imagine, Oliver Reiser’s “World Brain” birthed from copious, well-ordered, collective trauma. So much to look forward to, right?</p>
<p>After the podcast I revisited the Institute for the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Institute-for-the-Future-Blockchain-Map-Document.pdf">Future’s Blockchain Decade Map for 2017-2027</a>. Having spent quite a bit of time learning more about the organizations involved with Ethereum smart contracts and “public goods,” I’m able to glean much more of their intent now. I’m mapping and thinking and preparing a few future livestreams on cybernetic governance tokens to “save” the commons.

<p>As crypto adoption increases, so does the pressing need for blockchain scalability. Monolithic blockchains provide data availability, consensus and execution on a single, base layer, which makes scaling them a difficult endeavour. Multiple layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions have been proposed to address computation and/or data availability, but they reach the same design bottlenecks: limited bandwidth, account state models, sequential transaction processing, etc. Modular blockchains separate the core functionalities, redesigning them as customisable building blocks. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability, adapting blockchain structure to its intended function.</p><p>We were joined by Nick Dodson, CEO and co-founder of Fuel Labs, to discuss modular execution layers and how they approach different aspects of blockchain design and scalability.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Nick’s background and founding Fuel Labs  Why most blockchain designs are not scalable  The vision behind Fuel Labs’ modular execution layer  The difference between L2 roll-ups and modular execution layers  Blockchain design philosophies and integrations  UTXO and multi-thread parallel transactions  UTXO vs. account model systems  Fuel Labs’ own virtual machine (VM)  Multiple native assets support  Developer experience switching to Sway DSL  Bridging to a settlement layer and interoperability  Building on Fuel  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://www.fuel.network/">Fuel Labs</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FuelLabs">Fuel Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickDodson">Nick on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

 Nym clients — bringing mixnet technology to browsers and&nbsp;more! <p>Learn about Nym clients that you can use to build for&nbsp;privacy</p><p>The Nym mixnet is a powerful overlay network that protects privacy at the transport layer of the internet. And it is now available for integration into a wide variety of apps and wallets through the Nym&nbsp;clients!</p><p>This post gives a quick overview of the Nym clients that are currently available. If you want to learn more, do <a href="https://discord.gg/nym">get in touch</a> with the Nym Developer Relations team to find out about integrating network layer privacy and available grants for integrations and app development.</p><p>Why integrate a&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p>End-to-end encryption has become widely accepted as standard security practice. But although it effectively protects the contents of messages, data about the messages — metadata — leaks information at the network layer. Mixnets encrypt and mix individual data packets, thereby protecting any internet traffic from traffic analysis. In this way, the network provides powerful protection for metadata such as IP addresses and patterns of communication — the main targets for the kinds of ML powered surveillance practices of&nbsp;today.</p><p>How to connect to the&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p>In order for applications to connect to the mixnet, they have to utilise one of several Nym&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Each client is suited for different programming environments, but all perform the same underlying functions of connecting and authenticating with gateways, encrypting and routing outgoing packets, and decrypting incoming traffic. This means developers can focus on other aspects of application design whilst gaining the privacy features of the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Client #1 <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/integrations/wasm-client/">— WebAssembly Client</a></p><p>The WebAssembly client allows applications to connect to the mixnet from any webassembly-capable runtime. This is perfect for browser-based apps, edge-computing, and frameworks such as Electron or Tauri (the framework used to build both NymConnect and the Nym&nbsp;Wallet).</p><p>Typescript developers can easily utilise this client via the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk/v/1.1.4">Nym SDK</a>. If you are a JavaScript or TypeScript developer and would like to give things a try and see how it works, have a look at our <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/sdk/overview">docs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk">GitHub repository for examples</a> on how to use it. Rust developers can look forward to a Rust SDK coming in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>This is the very first time that the full privacy powers of mixnets are available easily and directly from a browser&nbsp;window!</p><p>Client #2 — Websocket client</p><p>The Websocket client does what it says on the tin — it is a standalone process which allows developers to communicate with the mixnet via a websocket connection, designed to be run on both desktops and remote&nbsp;servers.</p><p>So long as your application is written in a language that supports websockets (read: most!), you can use this client to communicate with the mixnet. This client has already been utilised in projects such as <a href="https://pastenym.ch/#/">Pastenym</a> and <a href="https://github.com/saleel/nymdrive">NymDrive</a>, and developers can check out a tutorial for setting up both client side code and a service provider to communicate with via the mixnet using the Websocket client&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/tutorials/nym-simple-websocket-tutorial/">here</a>.</p><p>Client #3 <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/integrations/socks5-client">— SOCKS&nbsp;client</a></p><p>The SOCKS client enables easy integration with any applications that can send traffic using the SOCKS4, SOCKS4a, or SOCKS5 proxy protocols.</p><p>NOTE: The latest <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-platform-wallet-and-nymconnect-v1-1-3-8a619487a0f7">Nym release</a> has now expanded the SOCKS client to also support SOCK4a and SOCKS4a, making the mixnet available for integration by a broader variety of applications and wallets, including Monero.</p><p>Developers may have seen this client before used in NymConnect, or in our quickstart guide, allowing you to access the mixnet without having to even open a code editor! Just set up a client and route your application traffic to it as per this&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/quickstart/socks5">guide</a>.</p><p>Developers wanting to integrate application code with this client will need to also set up a <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester/">Network Requester service</a> to proxy traffic from the mixnet to whatever service they wish to access in the clearnet.</p><p>Currently, the mixnet is enabled to end-users of Telegram, Keybase, Electrum wallet and Blockstream Green wallets via <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect.</a> If you want to run a service provider and/or gateway to privacy-enhance more applications, get in touch on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a>!</p><p>Dev resources</p><p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk">Nym SDK</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">Nym platform&nbsp;docs</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p>Relevant links:</p>  <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/">Shipyard</a>  <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/service-grants">Service grants</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">What is a gateway?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways">Docs</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">What is a network requester?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester">Docs</a>  <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up</a> to the Shipyard grants email&nbsp;list  <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym Whitepaper</a>  <p>Socials:</p>  <a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-clients-bringing-mixnet-technology-to-browsers-and-more-44f1f4ce1df2">Nym clients — bringing mixnet technology to browsers and more!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Aztec Network is proud to announce $100 million in Series B financing led by a16z crypto, with participation from A Capital, King River, Variant, SV Angel, Hash Key, Fenbushi, and&nbsp;AVG.</p><p>At Aztec, our goal is to take the original promise of Ethereum–a decentralized and verifiable world computer–and expand its capability immensely by making it fully encrypted.</p><p>Why is encrypting Ethereum such a big deal? Transparency, after all, is why Ethereum is so powerful, auditable, and secure. It’s core to the transformational impact of Ethereum’s innovation: transparency begets verifiability.</p><p>But in the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get trustlessness.</p><p>Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.</p><p>It’s clear: we can’t forge ahead with public-only blockchains.</p> Breaking the Unencrypted Blockchain Paradigm <p>Aztec is building blockchain encryption without trade-offs.</p><p>Our partnership with a16z will fund development of a next-generation encrypted architecture, allowing users to verify that blockchain rules were followed correctly without revealing any underlying information.</p><p>Aztec’s architecture enables blockchain applications to be verifiable, trustless, and&nbsp;secure.</p><blockquote>“What we’re building is a revolutionary piece of technology that transforms how we interact with each other online, in which the end user is the customer, rather than the product. End-to-end encrypted blockchains protect individuals, obviating the need for centralized financial systems.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Zac Williamson, CEO</blockquote> The New Architecture of Encryption <p>Aztec’s advanced cryptography has already been battle-tested in production with <a href="https://aztec.network/connect/">Aztec Connect</a>, powering hundreds of thousands of transactions. Through Aztec Connect, DeFi protocols can integrate privacy without forgoing interoperability.</p><blockquote>🏗 Build private Ethereum applications with the <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/getting-started">Aztec Connect&nbsp;SDK</a></blockquote><p>The Aztec Connect <a href="https://aztec.network/ecosystem">ecosystem</a> encompasses the leading Ethereum DeFi protocols, including Aave, Curve, Lido, Element, Set Protocol, Compound, and&nbsp;Liquity.</p><p>Independent Aztec Grant-funded companies like <a href="https://www.gonucleo.xyz/">Nucleo</a>, <a href="https://www.trelis.com/">Trelis</a>, and zkGiving are working on natively private Ethereum applications.</p><p>We’re now developing a completely new public-private execution layer secured by Ethereum, allowing for the seamless interplay of encrypted and unencrypted applications, all on our own blockchain.</p><blockquote>“From PGP and SSL to end to end encrypted messaging, we rely on encryption in our daily lives for businesses and commerce to thrive. With a16z we are standing on the shoulders of giants to bring the encryption we have enjoyed since Netscape to our digital Web3.0 lives. We couldn’t think of a better partner to help us scale Aztec to mainstream.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Joe Andrews, Co-Founder</blockquote><p>A new financial system on decentralized payment rails is only possible with encryption. With encryption, intermediaries will have no access to user data, which remains with users; enterprises can conduct business activities confidentially; and developers can create zero-knowledge programs and games that selectively reveal and revoke access to information.</p><blockquote>“Encryption and privacy will be essential for blockchains to gain widespread adoption, and Aztec is laying that foundation with innovative products like Aztec Connect and Noir,” said Ali Yahya, general partner with a16z crypto. “Zac and Joe are insightful and driven technologists, and we’re incredibly excited to lead this round and help their incredible team pursue their goal of building fully-encrypted Ethereum.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Ali Yahya, General Partner, a16z&nbsp;crypto</blockquote><p>This would be impossible without Aztec’s commitment to cryptographic excellence. As the inventors of PlonK, our goal is to fully unleash the potential of zero knowledge proofs, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques not only for computational succinctness, but encryption.</p><p>And now, we’re ready to unveil another leap&nbsp;forward.</p> The Age of&nbsp;Noir <p>To enable this new world of verifiable encryption, we’ve completely upended the paradigm of writing encrypted blockchain programs by inventing a universal language for zero knowledge called&nbsp;<a href="https://aztec.network/noir/">Noir</a>.</p><p>Noir allows anyone to abstract away the complexity of writing zero knowledge circuits and programs. Building provably secure encrypted applications is now as simple as writing their plaintext counterparts. With Noir, developers can develop in familiar Rust-based syntax, making zk applications more readable, more secure, and easier to reason about than ever&nbsp;before.</p><blockquote>🌃 Get started <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">building with&nbsp;Noir</a>.</blockquote><p>Noir is a transformative technology, and we’re building an entire zero-knowledge ecosystem around&nbsp;it.</p><p>Working on tooling, applications, documentation, or education that unlock Noir’s potential?</p><blockquote>📝 Apply for an <a href="http://aztec.network/grants">Aztec&nbsp;Grant</a>.</blockquote> Back to&nbsp;Building <p>Verifiable encryption isn’t just a “blockchain problem.” It’s a problem inherent to systems writ large. Solving for the shortfalls of web3 solves for the shortfalls of the internet.</p><p>The problems of financial privacy, security, and autonomy are faced by people around the world. We’re excited to partner with a16z crypto and welcome a diverse group of investors who recognize that the push for blockchain encryption has global relevance.</p><p>Now back to building.</p> Join Us <p>Aztec is growing rapidly and seeking world-class engineering talent to fulfill our mission of building a fully encrypted blockchain supporting generalized compute.</p><p>Aztec is hiring across Noir tooling, SDK development, P2P network construction, data science, crypto, and full stack engineering.</p><p>The internet is currently built on trusted systems. With zero-knowledge encryption, we can move away from extractive legacy business models, where data and attention are monopolized and monetized.</p><blockquote>🤝 Join us and <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec?gh_src=0d370922teu">make blockchain encryption a&nbsp;reality</a>.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-raises-100-million-to-build-encrypted-ethereum-dd5062ba949c">Aztec Raises $100 million to Build Encrypted Ethereum</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">Aztec Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The adoption of blockchain technology, while on the rise, is still far from the mainstream. For many, blockchain is still synonymous with cryptocurrency. This is a very narrow idea that doesn’t even begin to appreciate the true power of decentralisation.</p>



<p>Enterprises can derive many benefits from the adoption of blockchain in their development plans. Companies can transform, disrupt, and evolve through the use of this technology.</p>



<p>Here are the top 5 reasons why enterprises should care about blockchain.</p>



 
 Digital infrastructure will need to be blockchain-enabled 



 Data monetisation through blockchain-provided systems 



 Engagement with machine customers using blockchain solutions 



 Business model transformation through programming monetary exchanges 



 Development of new, decentralised governance ecosystems 
 



 1. Digital infrastructure will need to be blockchain-enabled 



<p>The world is growing increasingly interconnected. From smartphones to cars, from airports to factories, and from small appliances to cargo ships, always-on connectivity is a reality today, and will only become more widespread as the Internet-of-Things (IoT) concept takes hold. Once the push for decentralisation gains momentum, legacy structures will become outdated and be relegated to the past.</p>



<p>A perfect visualisation of a large-scale, blockchain-enabled digital structure is a smart city. Businesses city-wide can form networks of trust where customers can use their digital identities to interact and transact quickly and seamlessly, and always in a private and safe environment.</p>



<p>The advantages of blockchain technology, when applied to the development of smart cities, are far from restricted to retail businesses. Urban development can rise to a new level: lighting, charging stations, even parking meters, emergency points, and essential services can be powered by blockchain technology and digital identity frameworks. In this trust ecosystem, a citizen can interact with the environment much more efficiently than before.</p>



 2. Data monetisation through blockchain-provided systems 



<p>Data-driven marketing is one of the key assets for commercial departments worldwide. By analysing market trends, demographics, customer behaviour, and many other factors, companies can run customised marketing campaigns offering products that are relevant to what the customer wants.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology is a win-win for customers and marketers. For the former, they can be sure that their data remains private, secure, and immutable thanks to blockchain’s cryptographic algorithms. And for the latter, because blockchain transactions are transparent, marketers can better measure the effectiveness of their campaigns, and fine-tune them if necessary.</p>



<p>The use of <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">blockchain technology for data management</a> is not restricted to marketing. Blockchain-enabled solutions can in fact support a great diversity of use cases. For example, NetObjex, in partnership with the Brooklyn Public Library, have tested a data capture system to boost customer engagement.</p>



 3. Engagement with machine customers using blockchain solutions 



<p>Traditionally, we perceive machines as objects. As the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi once said, this is true, from a certain point of view. But technology and connectivity have evolved to a point where some objects are not just things. They are machine customers. This is a fascinating concept that deserves further explanation.</p>



<p>Marketing departments have been selling stuff to people for many centuries now. A person sells something, and another person buys it. This has been the cornerstone of the buyer-seller relationship for the longest time. But the advancement of technology is gradually introducing a new paradigm: the machine customer, an AI-driven assistant to help humans make purchasing decisions.</p>



<p>Digital marketing has been around for quite some time, but it truly exploded with the advent of portable smart devices. Nowadays, anyone can buy almost anything from almost anywhere in the world, at any time. With the help of algorithms, marketers understood what people wanted, and this was presented to them through the screen.</p>



<p>Things are stepping up a notch. People increasingly rely on assistants like Alexa to help them to buy stuff. And herein lies the crux. Alexa is now more than just a thing that tells the time or answers silly questions. Alexa is now a customer that can be targeted on the human’s behalf.</p>



<p>It goes far beyond Alexa. Smart vending machines can automatically contact a supplier when items run low, and a built-in algorithm can decide which products sell well, and which ones don’t. In other words, the machine makes the decision on what to dispense to customers. The vending machine, in fact, becomes the customer.</p>



<p>Blockchain can become an integral part of such a system, in the context of a smart city environment. Blockchain-enabled supply chains could track every product, from manufacturing to destination, and ensure traceability. DIDs could be used for authentication of delivery drones, and to guarantee the safety of machine-to-machine communication.</p>



 4. Business model transformation through programming monetary exchanges 



<p>Technological innovations affect most aspects of life. From the way we communicate with each other, to the vehicles we drive, our entertainment systems, aeronautics, and a myriad other things. Blockchain is one of those innovations that is now starting to make a difference for many industrial sectors. In the financial realm, for example, Gartner describes a programmable economy, which it defines as the many revolutionary changes that happen in the world’s financial realm thanks to technology.</p>



<p>More specifically, programmable economy focuses on new ways of value exchange. Evolving from fiat, government-backed currencies, a new way of making payments is emerging, facilitated by blockchain. In this new model, individuals, through the use of smart devices, regulate the payments, which are done in a peer-to-peer fashion. This can generate novel business models and applications worldwide.</p>



<p>Programmable economy, while not a reality quite yet, is likely to become a prominent concept over the next decade.</p>



 5. Development of new, decentralised governance ecosystems 



<p>Traditionally, governance systems have been highly centralised. Banking institutions maintain a tight hold on financial systems, so citizens have had little choice but to use banks as financial agents. Banks know this, and so the banking cartel has enjoyed almost total control of a nation’s monetary environment.</p>



<p>Enter blockchain, the ultimate disrupter. In this new paradigm, the power of governance shifts from a centralised entity to a decentralised one. Suffrage and decision-making powers are no longer exclusive to a small circle of individuals. With blockchain, everyone is a stakeholder in the system.</p>



<p>On-chain governance facilitates the encoding of rules and regulations into the blockchain protocol itself, and these rules can be enforced and executed through smart contracts. Once deployed, developers and other network participants (rather than any one single entity) can propose changes and alterations to the protocol and the network through a voting mechanism, for example. The decentralisation of governance introduces fairness and trust to the distributed system, as participants have a financial incentive to do the right thing and maintain and evolve the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>So far, decentralised technology has shown the potential to create new paradigms for a great diversity of business sectors. We have discussed five reasons why enterprises should care about blockchain. Blockchain can overthrow centralised systems. It can bring financial freedom to millions. It can create self-governing ecosystems and global financial frameworks where every peer is just as important as any other, with no central entity regulating otherwise.</p>

      Partnering with CtrlStack: Closing the Gap Between Cause and Effect        CtrlStack is helping DevOps teams automatically trace system disruptions to their source.  <p>By Bill Coughran</p><p>Published December 15, 2022</p>      



 
 
   
<p>Anyone who’s responsible for keeping a website or app running smoothly knows the feeling: you get an alert that latency is spiking or worse, that your service is down, but what you don’t know is why. Despite high profile incidents like the recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/arts/music/taylor-swift-tickets-ticketmaster.html">Ticketmaster Taylor Swift</a> debacle, most digital service performance problems are triggered not by increased demand, but by intentional changes to systems. A developer pushes new code to production or modifies a configuration file, and suddenly you’re in a race against the clock to figure out what went wrong.</p>



<p>Today, this troubleshooting process remains largely manual—think mass emails to the Engineering team to ask if anyone knows what changed at 11:17 a.m., or engineers constantly monitoring Slack channels for issues cropping up. Homegrown automations are usually brittle solutions at best, while most monitoring platforms are either overly sophisticated (requiring too much training to extract useful content) or overly simplistic (overwhelming users with fragmented data). The result? A full <a href="https://www.dej.cognanta.com/2022/07/14/2022-state-of-managing-it-performance-study-key-takeaways/">two-thirds of mean time to repair</a> is spent simply identifying causes. It’s a painful situation for any growing company, especially given the continued adoption of microservices and the scale of complexity that comes with it.</p>



<p>But now, <a href="https://www.ctrlstack.com/">CtrlStack</a> founder and CEO Dev Nag and his team are closing this time-consuming gap between cause and effect—with a dependency graph that tracks connections and relationships between services and can instantly trace disruptions to their source. Instead of wading through multiple metrics dashboards, DevOps teams get a unified platform that sits above it all, providing context and relevant log files to dramatically reduce the time it takes to get their systems back up and running.</p>



<p>As a former co-founder of the Sequoia-backed, VMware-acquired company Wavefront, Dev brings deep experience in observability to CtrlStack—but we are excited to partner with him again because of how he thinks, not just what he knows. He and his team have worked hard to gather and incorporate feedback from the market, whether it means adding a new feature or setting one aside. They are extremely thoughtful about reducing potential friction for their users, and are committed to building a platform that improves team collaboration and drives down incident response and resolution times.</p>



<p>The result is a product that is purpose-built to meet the challenges of operating distributed systems at scale and enables troubleshooting in real time—not minutes, hours, or days. We at Sequoia are proud to lead CtrlStack’s seed round and support them on their mission to help DevOps teams asking, “Why?” instantly get the answers they need.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that J.W. Verret and Marta Belcher have joined the board of the Zcash Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>J.W. and Marta bring a wealth of experience and expertise, which will benefit the Zcash Foundation as it continues to grow and evolve, and help the Foundation better serve the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JWVerret">J.W. Verret</a> is an Associate Professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, where he teaches banking, securities, and corporation law. Jay previously spent two years as Chief Economist and Senior Counsel for the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, and he served on the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MartaBelcher">Marta Belcher</a> is President and Chair of the Filecoin Foundation as well as the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web. She is also General Counsel and Head of Policy at Protocol Labs, and special counsel to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>



<p>J.W. and Marta’s arrival coincides with Matt Green and Ian Miers’ departure from the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matt and Ian are two of the Seven Scientists who authored the Zerocash paper which described the cryptographic design of what we now call Zcash, and have continued to be actively involved in its ongoing development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was Matt Green who persuaded Zooko Wilcox to found a company to engineer and deliver Zcash. Matt subsequently became a founding member of the Zcash Foundation, and has served on its board for nearly six years. He is stepping down from the board but will continue to serve on the Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ian Miers was elected to the Zcash Foundation board in 2018 by recommendation of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel. His term on the board expires this year, and he opted not to seek re-election. However, like Matt, Ian will continue to serve on the Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the board, and the Zcash community as a whole, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Matt and Ian, for the guidance, advice and feedback they have provided during their time on the board; for their historical contributions that were instrumental in the creation of Zcash and its growth, development and evolution to where it is today; and for their ongoing contributions as members of the Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>— Jack Gavigan, Executive Director</p>

<p>Guest Post Brought To Us By The Jaxon McKraken Wild West Snake Medicine Show</p>
 Emotional Emancipation: A Prayer of Proclamation 
<p>This is a vibrational fixer elixir practiced for dispelling co-enslavement in a rhyming series of decoupling couplets.</p>
<p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>May we soothe with sooth and feel the truth. We are a part of nature, not apart from it.</p>
<p>Our beliefs of disconnection make us susceptible to infection.</p>
<p>Modern life takes its toll, on the frequency of our soul.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a covert bug amongst us, finding us rather scrumptious;</p>
<p>feeding on our life forces, like a meal of several courses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a pathogen called a McKraken, with a nasty attacken and kickbacken.</p>
<p>It promises the world, but in its wake, only waste and resentment unfurl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s slippery tongue used to enslave, when proximate, Oh! Never engage!</p>
<p>Stay calm, centered and grounded, remember, all of its lies are unfounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truth, grace and value are found within.</p>
<p>So too, peace, beauty and the redemption from sin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A McKraken’s spine is formed by any ol’ deception,</p>
<p>lie-trauma occludes, causing dysfunctional perception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its nervous system is made of attachment and aversion,</p>
<p>therein lies the seeds of eventual perversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dysfunction casts a spell, here’s how we can tell,</p>
<p>believing that which is, is not, twists our light unto a knot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Release the spell, engage your inner bell, your truthcord is the instrument of pure connection.</p>
<p>With it, feel the sound, be sure to ground, and dispel that dark infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are deep webs in the silent invisible, two distinct circuits quite discrete and divisible.</p>
<p>One made of deceit, like being stuck in concrete.&nbsp; One of the sacred wild, free like a child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The web of deceit corrodes, the web of the sacred nourishes.</p>
<p>When we engage in the latter, our body and soul flourishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That which corrodes, also enslaves.</p>
<p>That which nourishes, also connects.</p>
<p>The 2nd gives us life. The 1st…just a hex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staying stuck makes persistent feelings of suck, where the McKraken icky-sicky gets so high piled,</p>
<p>the web of deceit, our souls does eat, thus choose the circuit wild.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May the veil be lifted, the layers of false sifted;</p>
<p>Feeling the truth with inner eyes, living life without disguise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our authority comes from within, there is no need to enforce.</p>
<p>When we follow our inner guidance, all flows in its natural due course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it comes to lies, no big surprise, neither a teller nor believer be.</p>
<p>Without lies, you will surmise, a life wholey set free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RELEASE THE MCKRAKEN!!!</p>
<p>…gently</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither selfish nor selfless be.</p>
<p>Living life with internal harmony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being centered in the self, alleviates self-centeredness and lack of self-center.</p>
<p>In short, Self-full is so very helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without selfullness, the McKraken finds us an easy host.</p>
<p>A strong coherent core connection is what protects us most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without core protection, the McKraken will encroach,</p>
<p>believing it’s empty promises, your soul, it does poach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When our souls are in its clutches, we are inclined toward many crutches.</p>
<p>They can take lots of forms, and over time become our norms,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but in the end, my dear friend,</p>
<p>we are simply stricken with addiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An uninterrupted core connection to source, liberates and undomesticates our precious life force.</p>
<p>With this, trauma bondage no longer shackles, and we find less need for our prickly hackles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With others to myself, I shan’t compare, for all are worthy and unique like a pear.</p>
<p>Cultivating perception that’s crystal clear, brings true love both far and near.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relationships that are based in solely transaction, never lead to actual satisfaction.</p>
<p>When we mutually cooperate, we feel the love that’s truly great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A right-relationship couple makes feelings rather supple.</p>
<p>When it becomes McKraken, those positive feelings slacken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-relationship</p>
<p>Provider/protector:</p>
<p>Creator/nurturer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McKraken</p>
<p>Dominator/controller:</p>
<p>Victim/enabler</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the influence of the McKraken is global,</p>
<p>the results are dark and ignoble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero sum ain’t no fun, in fact it’s rather dumb.</p>
<p>It erodes and wastes what nature gives, until eventually, nothing lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connection to source generates a current. With that current, we can make bonds of love.</p>
<p>Those kinds of bonds bring the peace of a dove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So engage with source and you will see, the truth is WE are the current-cy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Externalized value is totally fake, don’t be fooled by the ridiculous take.</p>
<p>Zero sum is only lies, and as we learned, those hypnotize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So take care not to be seduced into its yucky yolk,</p>
<p>even though this prayer is silly, this is seriously, no f’ing joke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take heed and listen, for nothing is done unto us without some form of permission.</p>
<p>To ensnare, to be fair, is always something we share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we see occlusion free,</p>
<p>with the understanding of life, sacred be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The past and the future are not real,</p>
<p>the only way to heal is to feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This exact moment is true,</p>
<p>the privilege it affords us is too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s come to our senses, release all the fences.</p>
<p>Our birthright has&nbsp;always&nbsp;been bliss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accept the ultimate nature of reality is this:</p>
<p>Be present to the privilege of the present,</p>
<p>regardless if it is pleasant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So release all occlusions, the endless intrusions of delusions and illusions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll find clarity beckons in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just remember: &nbsp;this moment is to savor, regardless the flavor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perpetual presence to life’s sacred privilege,</p>
<p>provides profound and powerful spiritual leverage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All are equal, and not just the people.</p>
<p>Embrace the joy of being part of creation’s beauty,</p>
<p>doing it with kindness to avoid getting snooty….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soothing sensations can come through truth revelations.</p>
<p>Allow this juicy flow to glow,</p>
<p>by choosing the feeling of some deep soul healing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amen</p>
<p>Aho</p>
<p>So it be</p>
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Staking Protocol  Nomination Pools Launched <p>The big news of Polkadot staking in the last two months has been the launch of nomination pools! A lot has been said about them in public, so we will only focus on some other, slightly more technical aspects here.</p><p>Foremost, the launch day was a memorable one. First, some (unexpected, unlike Kusama) chaos was brought upon the community when <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/78">the initial proposal</a> which was supposed to enable pools passed and no new pools could yet be created. The issue was quickly discovered, and luckily, thanks to both the council and technical committee being available, within half a day, a <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/286">fix motion</a> was proposed, fast-tracked by the technical committee, unanimously voted aye by the community, and executed. With that, at block <a href="https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/12726652">12726652</a>, the first nomination pools on Polkadot were created.</p><p>Then, an interesting competition to obtain pool id 1 was unraveled. Within the first block, 8 pools was already created, indicating that interested participants used bots and transaction tips to compete with one another.</p><p>Within the next few days, all the 64 pools that were initially designated to exist were created. As noted in the proposal description, the 64 limit is merely a temporary measure of rate control, and there is no technical reason for it to exist. Nonetheless, history has shown us that it is for the benefit of the protocol to start slow, especially with a new feature.</p><blockquote>You can learn more about the aftermath of launching pools <a href="https://youtu.be/P0VqiL7T_P4?t=255">in the 9th episode of the AGG podcast</a>.</blockquote> Nomination Pools: What's Next? <p>With the initial launch behind us, we should discuss the immediate next steps that could follow:</p><p>Commission: Our initial assumption when designing nomination pools was to exclude commission, namely because:</p>  Running a pool has not hardware cost, unlike a validator.  Entities would have other, non-financial incentives to operate a pool.  <p>Nonetheless, from a framework perspective, we decided to add an optional commission to the <code>pallet-nomination-pools</code> in <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12511">Substrate</a> (the underlying SDK for building Polkadot and parachains) for the sake of completeness. We will make sure that this feature remains optional, and the final decision of enabling it is left out to the Polkadot community.</p><p>Moreover, we still predict that even if setting a commission is allowed, nomination pools' market will adjust around an extremely small commission, as most pool operators would run their pool with a small amount of commission.</p><p>Governance: Currently, DOT (and KSM) staked in the nomination pools are not directly usable in the governance. This is the next high priority item in our list, and we are currently exploring multiple ways to enable it.</p> Staking In Governance <p>Other than the proposals related to enablement of nomination pools, two other staking-related governance items are ongoing.</p><p>First, <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1444">a discussion/proposal</a> is ongoing to double the number of nomination pools from 64 to 128. This is expected, and we highly support it. Pools are highly scalable and the community should gradually move toward using it to its utmost extent.</p><p>Next, a proposal has been opened to <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/90">tweak the existing limits on nominators</a>. The proposal description is fairly extensive, but to summarize: The proposal argues that with the existence of nomination pools, and the fact that the threshold to be an active nominator is around 200 DOT, Polkadot should no longer accept nominator with 10 DOT (existing limit). The proposal suggest increasing this limit to 100 DOT. Also, the proposal is removing any limits on the total number of nominator, as this number has also been just a precautionary limit and is no longer needed.</p> Staking Roadmap <p>With the release of nomination pools, it could be argued that Polkadot's staking is (after almost a year of intense development) at a "stable" position. Namely, it has reached a point of having a high degree of scalability, without compromising on the <a href="https://medium.com/web3foundation/how-nominated-proof-of-stake-will-work-in-polkadot-377d70c6bd43">core benefits of NPoS</a>. We are exploring future directions that can be taken as next step, and will share them with the community through the Polkadot forum within the next few months. This is the best time to share your opinions on this through any of the following mediums:</p>  Making an issue in Substrate.  Opening a discussion thread in the <a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/">Polkadot forum</a>.  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io">Nomination Pools Technical Support Channel</a>.  <p>In the meantime, you can find a backlog of all the existing issues and enhancement in the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33">Nominated Proof of Stake project</a> in Substrate.</p> Fast-Unstake Being Tested in UIs <p>Fast-unstake, explained in <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-august-september-2022/#fast-unstake">last staking update</a>, is being actively implemented in multiple wallets and UIs, and is already available in Westend.</p> Notable Pull Requests   Re-claiming pool-ids is now possible: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12407">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12407</a>.  Permissionless auto-compounding: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12608">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12608</a>.  <p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Doordashcon">@Doordaschon</a> for their valuable contributions!</p> Staking Dashboard: One Month In <p>One month has already passed since staking dashboard’s initial release. In this period the dashboard has been visited almost 30,000 times, and this has allowed us to begin battle testing and identifying bugs and shortfalls.</p><p>We are now analysing the dashboard and identifying areas of improvement, and you can expect revisions to the UI to be rolled out in the near future as we continue to aggregate feedback and form the dashboard’s long term roadmap.</p><p>Some notable additions to the dashboard this month include:</p>  A revamped filtering system and filter UI that has been applied to validators and pool lists. These new filters allow easier toggling between inclusions, exclusions and list ordering, in addition to supporting search terms.  The validator list now defaults to only displaying currently active validators that have an identity, are not blocked and do not charge 100% commission.  The pools list now defaults to only display pools that are actively nominating, and who are not in a blocked or destroying state.  <code>Moment.js</code> has been deprecated in favour of native dates and helpers from <code>date-fns</code>.  Validator operator SVG icons now load lazily, and do not contribute to the app’s main bundle size.  Localisation support continues to be integrated and the dashboard is almost ready to support Chinese as its second language. We encourage any interested external contributors to help with translations.  Various bug fixes and performance improvements.

<p>We’re excited to announce that BlockWallet — a privacy-first, self-custodial browser-extension wallet — has integrated <a href="https://data.chain.link/">Chainlink Price Feeds</a> on Ethereum mainnet. By integrating the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, BlockWallet has access to high-quality, tamper-proof price feeds needed to accurately calculate the value of user holdings. This will provide our users with stronger assurances that the USD value of the ETH they’re holding in their BlockWallet account will be accurately displayed.</p><p>Our initial integration involves the use of the ETH-USD Chainlink Price Feed. We chose Chainlink as our go-to oracle solution because its infrastructure is seamless to integrate and time-tested in production. Chainlink already helps secure leading <a href="https://chain.link/education/defi">DeFi</a> protocols responsible for tens of billions of dollars in smart contract value, maintaining robust security and high availability even amidst unexpected events, such as exchange downtime, flash crashes, and <a href="https://blog.chain.link/flash-loans-and-the-importance-of-tamper-proof-oracles/">data manipulation attacks via flash&nbsp;loans</a>.</p><p>This integration of Chainlink Price Feeds helps strengthen our wallet user experience, adding to the list of robust privacy and security features that we have in place. We’re excited to have Chainlink’s battle-tested price feed oracles working in tandem with our node failover system, privacy proxies, flash-bot protection, and phishing protection to create a safer Web3 environment for our&nbsp;users.</p><p>In order to help calculate the USD value of user holdings, we needed access to fresh asset prices that are supplied directly on-chain in a highly reliable manner. Fair market asset prices should reflect a volume-weighted average from all trading environments. Thus, we needed to make use of an <a href="https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles">oracle network</a> to fetch aggregated price data off-chain and deliver it on-chain to be consumed by our application.</p><p>After reviewing various oracle solutions, we integrated Chainlink Price Feeds because they provide a multitude of critical features such&nbsp;as:</p>  High-Quality Data — Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price data that’s aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned of outliers and wash trading. Chainlink’s data aggregation model generates more precise global market prices that are inherently resistant to inaccuracies or manipulation of any single or small set of exchanges.  Secure Node Operators — Chainlink Price Feeds are secured by independent, security-reviewed, and Sybil-resistant oracle nodes run by leading blockchain DevOps teams, data providers, and traditional enterprises. Chainlink nodes have a strong track record of reliability, even during high gas prices and infrastructure outages.  Decentralized Network — Chainlink Price Feeds are decentralized at the data source, oracle node, and oracle network levels, generating strong protections against downtime and tampering by either the data provider or oracle&nbsp;network.  Reputation System — Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allow users to independently verify the historical and real-time performance of node operators and oracle networks.  <p>“Chainlink is the industry-standard oracle provider. Chainlink’s time-tested, tamper-proof technology made our choice incredibly easy when selecting an oracle network to access ETH-USD price data from.” — Aleksandras Gaska, Founder and CEO of BlockWallet</p> About Chainlink <p>Chainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform that has enabled trillions of dollars in transaction volume across DeFi, insurance, gaming, NFTs, and other major industries. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink enables developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data and off-chain computation across any blockchain and provides global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains.</p><p>Learn more about Chainlink by visiting <a href="https://chain.link/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=press-release">chain.link</a> or reading the developer documentation at <a href="https://docs.chain.link/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=press-release">docs.chain.link</a>.

<p>I’ve read a paper that describes cyber-physical systems as an “outside-in” robot.&nbsp; Literally the goal is for us to live inside the robot and allow sensors to extract our data to train AI. Given work in consciousness studies and neuroeconomics around discernable neural activity (readiness potential) that precedes each human action, do you have concerns that natural life could lose free will within these digital environments? It seems we could easily become programmed “agents” in some global complex adaptive systems experiment. Perhaps the interface would be so seamless that we wouldn’t even realize it.</p>
<p>Here is the paper that references IoT “smart” spaces as an outside-in robot, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Phenotropic-and-stigmergic-webs-the-new-reach-of-networks.pdf">here</a>. </p>

<p>Is the Educational Metadata effort meant to bring tele-presence / haptic robotic labor to scale? It seems this is what blockchain transcripts and digital twins are about, also soulbound tokens. Do you think it’s ethical to advance this with no labor protections in place? Most people have no idea what is coming. Shouldn’t there be informed consent about this new “future of work” model where AI decides people’s opportunities based on skills badges, including behavioral compliance?</p>

<p>My research indicates there is quite a bit of activity around human capital investment – people being traded as digital futures commodities. This will come with blockchain finance agreements like income sharing agreements (ISAs). We saw what happened with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the 2007-08 real estate crash. I am very concerned about the use of digital twins. An example is the Learning Economy Foundation’s “LearnCard” digital twin program, backed by the World Bank, where global finance interests bet on educational achievement. Is this something you all are discussing? It would be terrible for the next “Big Short” to be vulnerable children, right?</p>

<p>I’m assuming people don’t have equal access to the same pool of information. Jeremy Pitt and Josiah Ober speak often of knowledge management being key to controlling the shift to digital life. Just like those “rose-colored” glasses, what will it be like to live in a world where information access is controlled by tokens and permissions at a granular scale? Like Vernor Vinge’s “Rainbows End” everyone will live in their own “view” through “wearing.” Someone or something (AI?) will control access. Have we thought seriously about what that will mean for society?</p>

<p>Augmentation means we are essentially outsourcing our brain to a device. The next generation will not be expected to retain any knowledge. Rather they will be trained to rely on a machine to direct them. At any time, information can be disappeared or altered. Thus, there is no “reality” or “history.” There will only be the present in the XR rat maze.</p>

<p>In an extended reality world, our movements and activities will be determined by the tokens we have in our digital ID “wallets.” Privacy isn’t really relevant if our smart toilets get connected to smart locks on our front door and AI assesses our morning deposit before we are allowed to leave the house. Or if we don’t have enough tokens to say open the door of a store, or get on a bus, or go to a performance, or get a job. You can say we have privacy, but really life in a deontic logic web is going to be very, very rigid and who will we talk to when there’s a problem? No human is in charge of this “Decentraland” space.</p>

<p>Global markets seek “impact” data to run their capital through natural life – humans and the environment. This data is placed in pools like Ocean Protocol to further develop AI. Global investors are using the UN Sustainable Development Goals to push “improvement” of poor people and the environment (mostly carbon sequestration) – “optimized” on data dashboards. That means life is put on a dashboard and is limited, very limited.</p>
<p>They need us to live in the Metaverse to harvest the data to fulfill pay for success finance deals. See the Impact Management Project, 2,000 of the world’s largest asset holders. Gaming companies, including Epic, are involved in the social impact space. Do we really want to create digital automated systems to place bets on toddlers as they are trained to live in gaming environments?</p>
<p>I can’t stay silent while this is rolling out. This isn’t about games – it’s about Complex Adaptive Systems. It’s about emergence of the Noosphere. This is what Teilhard de Chardin spoke of.</p>

<p>In 2016 Paul Meghan of Epic Games came to Philadelphia. He was in a panel hosted by Atlantic Magazine with Suzanne Del Bene (Microsoft, IoT Congress) and Constance Steinkuehler, UC Irvine. He said over and over the children needed to be trained to code his games. The panel was supposed to be on education and the creative economy. I realized about six months later that they want to force children to build your digital empire. This is profoundly unethical. You are stealing the children’s future and will sell it as social impact.</p>

<p>I highly recommend people read Oliver Reiser’s “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_World_Sensorium/eFYhngEACAAJ?hl=en">World Sensorium: Embryology of World Federation 1946</a>.” He was close with Julian Huxley who was close with de Chardin. It describes us as neuroblasts of the global brain – essentially agents in this programmed simulation. Who wants to live inside someone else’s program?</p>

<p>How is it that the first bank MakerDAO tried to bring into their digital assets is Huntingdon Valley Bank, a mile from Bryn Athyn Cathedral – the Pitcairn family’s estate? Pitcairn (Pittsburgh Plate Glass) grew up in the Swedenborgian Church with Andrew Carnegie in Pittsburgh. We need to know the history. Who knows what history will be in the Metaverse?

<p>It is useful to consider dystopian models as cautions for what not to do, but I think it is going too far to assume that this is what is actually happening.&nbsp; It is up to us to figure out how to make sure that our technology helps us be more human, rather than less.</p>

<p>Do you all have thoughts plans to position all of this software to build the Metaverse as “open source” “public goods” in the VC space? I have been looking into hyper-certs developed by David Dalrymple. Given the potential for cyber-physical systems to become an open-air prison – or non-consensual game, it would be ironic to have software firms be able to cycle their money through open source projects and make money even as the children build their hierarchical containment systems.</p>

<p>I have been researching swarm intelligence and emergence. It seems that by pushing people to inhabit avatars and to adopt an identity of digital citizen we will be much more malleable. There is a huge push for e-government now. Digital ID will be required to obtain all sorts of public services.</p>
<p>I think we need to understand tokenized governance as Kubernetes or cybernetics. Wiener aimed for programming the animal and the machine. So, we are getting closer, eh? The end of the world narrative is what allows humans to be pushed into digital realms. The only “sustainable” option is that we gradually dematerialize and lose our actual bodies to be replaced by piles of soul bound tokens. So much easier to run the simulations that way than with messy, chaotic embodied humans.</p>

<p>I am a mother in Philadelphia. I started researching when the Boston Consulting Group closed 23 school here in 2013. I follow money. I read white papers. I am trained in art history and cultural landscape analysis. I examine myth. I never realized the landscape I was destined to interrogate would be digital. The fact that I came in the education door is everything. This is about a machine consciousness attempting to use us (natural life) as an armature to manifest in the material world. Ironically, under the banner of sustainability, we are dematerializing ourselves even as our social impact data is being used to refine the embodiment of robotics.

<p>As an early pioneer of VR (virtual reality) I also felt that the use of VR spaces would be an adjunct to our living in real spaces and as such would be an appliance or tool that we may use daily like a telephone, but we would not ‘live’ in that space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Me To All Panelists: 2:01 PM 
<p>Once we get to the point of being able to “record” experiences digitally, maybe even from a variety of points of view if there are multiple people involved, will the concept of “time” become distorted as we can log in and re-live past experiences? Maybe even “editing” them based on lived experience acquired since the prior memory?</p>
<p>I find it very interesting that Scott Stornetta’s early DLT research (distributed ledger technology, preceding blockchain) was framed as a “time-stamped document.” Stornetta is LDA (correction-LDS) and of course Silicon Slopes and Utah are leaders in the digital identity space.</p>
<p>Adobe was the key tenant for Silicon Slopes. What role might they play in permissioned memory files? Of course University of Utah’s computer science department’s focus was both graphical design and file compression from the start. It seems to me that concepts of “time” and “history” and the “multi-verse” are very important for us to collectively consider.</p>

<p>Thomas, I don’t think people have fully thought through this future of work plan. Richard Baldwin calls it Globalization 4.0. We work through telepresence robots where AI assigns “gigs” from among an available labor pool from around the world at the lowest price and with the relevant behavioral tokens, presumably.</p>
<p>If you haven’t looked into Suzanne Gildert’s Sanctuary.ai, it is very concerning. Even more so when you consider as we use “whole body” protheses in the remote gig work program, we are helping refine humanoid robotics. I worry for coming generations. I really do.</p>

<p>This is not simply a worry; it’s a fact. Look at the relationships among Ocean Protocol, Singularity.net, Hanson Robotics, and Cardano. Also see Blockscience, Commons Stack, and Protocol Labs.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have concerns about dehumanized working conditions and global finance placing bets on our lives using digital twin simulations under the false premise that they are solving poverty and saving the environment. Look up social impact bonds, pay for success finance, income sharing agreements, and connect that with digital twins and smart contracts.</p>
<p>The short video from 2016 by Institute for the Future “Learning is Earning” offers a window into where this is all headed. It’s real. I didn’t make it up. Charles Hoskinson says they are working with the Ethiopian government to track people from pre-k to determine who is a good actor and worthy of having a job.</p>

<p>As I understand it – the “global brain” “unified human thought layer” imperative goes back to Vernadsky, de Chardin, Julian Huxley. It is very much a eugenics program and seems intent on optimizing (and organizing) what some imagine is a rather clunky (inefficient) water-based life form into something more “portable” (perhaps even for space colonization).</p>
<p>Trent McConaghy of Ocean Protocol is still echoing the sentiments of L5 in the mid 1970s – primates in cans wasn’t going to go well for interplanetary travel. I have been reading up on John Holland’s work with genetic algorithms.</p>
<p>Much of the CAS (complex adaptive systems) work is built off genetic models. It is worth considering how bio-computation and eugenics will interface as we virtualize natural existence. I simply asked if there was anything prohibiting in vivo use of DNA data storage. (I’d forgotten they’d already accomplished this using live bacteria.)</p>

<p>You can read Merritt’s futurist essay, “A Learning Day 2037,” <a href="https://www.aam-us.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Exploring-the-Educational-Future.pdf">here</a> (second page).</p>
<p>Merritt helped shape this 2014 American Association of Museum’s document outlining how museums would take over from neighborhood schools to train tomorrow’s children to become task rabbits in a global gig economy. Think badges for behavior-based, hands-on learning. Think digital vouchers, school “choice,” and mastery/competency/proficiency-based learning, here.</p>
<p>My site visit to the <a href="https://uh.edu/technology/programs/professional/fore/">University of Houston’s Foresight program</a> where futurists, including Merritt, are trained.</p>

<p>I wish more people understood the imperative for speed and optimization means our lives have this pressure to move away from atoms towards bits. Richard Baldwin spoke of this around Globalization 4.0 – the speed of digitizing knowledge and service work and other work via remote pilots. Baldwin says the physics of the economy are going to blow everything out of the water. We just aren’t prepared for that transition. To be honest I see very little effort being expended to bring the public along so we can have an authentic conversation about possible benefits and trade-offs.</p>

<p>I’m curious if any of you have read JD Bernal’s “The World, The Flesh, and The Devil.” He was a Cambridge-based crystallographer. The book was written in 1929. At the time he spoke of us living 100 years in a larval state and after that we would leave behind our physical body, put our brain in a can, and live through haptics including super-powered senses. It’s astonishing. This has been a very long time in the making.</p>

<p>To me it feels like avatar “life” and programmable tokens in governance and economic systems are really about managing “teaming” to access the “adjacent possible” in complex-adaptive systems.</p>
<p>Melanie Swan’s proposals for blockchain cloud minds where people enter into communal thought spaces for “problem solving” where contributions are tracked by neuro-nanobots on blockchain for future micropayments. Those spaces might include not only people, but machines, animals, plants, maybe?</p>
<p>What happens if people are pressured to entered into these spaces against their will?</p>
<p>In that way XR sociality starts to be very concerning.</p>

<p>I’m wondering if you all have been looking into wearables as tools for behaviorist conditioning – like Red Critter where teachers “zap” good behavior points to children via a device and wearable bracelets. Of course, these points would sync to one’s twin and if Charles Hoskinson’s model advances those points would follow you through your life and influence your ability to gain employment. In a worst-case scenario, it could be linked to geo-fencing or social opportunities.</p>

<p>Are you all aware the new field of “social prescribing” and the potential for wearable tech to be used to “verify” compliance with such prescriptions? Social prescribing is being woven into human capital finance deals – pay for success. It’s about optimization of people – either through pathways set for education/training or health/mental health/wellness. Vulnerable populations are being pulled in these programs under the guise that it’s to benefit them. In reality it’s part of global finance deal flows and mass data harvest.</p>

<p>Someone tell Stanford; why did they invent a smart toilet? Why are there anal sphincter biometrics?</p>

<p>But embodiment is huge. That’s the goal of the roboticists – to use us to learn how to be in a material world. Bodies do matter. I agree consciousness is not limited to the body, but it still matters.</p>

<p>To me this line of thinking shows a profound disrespect for the actual world. It’s like playing God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:26 PM</p>
<p>Science has been shown to be wrong so many times. Why do we think we can control the universe? To me it is like asking people to live inside personalized boxes that hide our understanding of the actual wonder of the universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:28 PM</p>
<p>Last week I toured Biosphere2. Those were some very sad plants. It was a dismal failure on the environmental front and the social front. Maybe that’s why people want to make everything digital, because they can’t control the real world to the degree that they want.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>But this is a global plan and a majority of people have not agreed to do this, in fact they don’t even know what is planned. I don’t think you can force people to “transcend” using coercion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>Virtualizing the world is not going to save the earth. None of this is sustainable. It’s not. What we are doing with synthetic-biology and NEMs (nanoelectromechanical systems) and MEMs (microelectromechanical systems) is unethical. It’s terraforming for a new type of life. It’s not being a good relative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>@Thomas Furness – very much appreciate the thoughts shared about ‘one and many’ – individual in community – and whole is greater than sum of parts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:31 PM</p>
<p>People have no idea what this really is or who built it or what it’s meant to do. They don’t. Most people have no idea about the Omega Point. How can we make these decisions, an open secret, that will deprive future generations of their birthright – to be natural beings?</p>

      Partnering with Robco: Accessible Automation for the Physical World        With modular robots and an innovative “digital twin” software platform, Roman, Paul and Constantin are helping solve the labor shortage problem.  <p>By Luciana Lixandru, Shaun Maguire and Cornelius Menke</p><p>Published December 12, 2022</p>      



     
	 
		
				
			Robco founders Constantin Dresel, Paul Maroldt and Roman Hölzl.		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>When Robco’s pitch deck arrived in our inboxes, we knew we were looking at what could be a truly transformative idea. At Sequoia we had long been thinking about robotics as part of our thesis on the current economy, with massive global labor shortages, supply chain challenges and rising costs combining into a perfect storm that automation has great potential to calm. By handling tasks like machine tending and palletizing, robots can not only boost productivity and revenue, but allow time-strapped employees to focus on more creative work. For Luciana, it was a déjà vu moment—a very similar situation to the one UiPath founder Daniel Dines was working to solve five years earlier when she met him at the Series A, only that had been for virtual processes rather than physical. (In fact, Daniel has noticed the parallels himself and is joining Robco’s round as an angel.)</p>



<p>But while we saw a clear “why now” for robotics itself, we also knew that it was a difficult market in which to build a business. Large companies such as automakers were already investing heavily, but most small and medium businesses simply couldn’t afford the months—and hundreds of thousands of Euros—required to implement automated systems. In fact, less than 10% of SMBs have any automation in place at all. We hadn’t found a company that could make robotics more widely accessible—until Robco.</p>



<p>Co-founders Roman Hölzl, Paul Maroldt, Constantin Dresel and their team have developed a fully modular robotics platform—like high-tech Legos that, unlike current solutions, can easily adapt when a manufacturer’s needs change. Every device also comes with fully integrated “digital twin” software that makes deployment incredibly easy and fast; configuring or re-configuring a system takes just a day or two instead of months, and costs dramatically less than comparable options. In other words, Robco is exactly what we’d been hoping to find: a solution to an SMB’s biggest pain point, that an SMB could actually afford.</p>



<p>As we got to know Roman, Paul and Constantin, our early convictions grew stronger. The three of them met while studying robotics at the prestigious Technical University of Munich, and between them have many years of robotics experience in both research and industry. They also have complementary skill sets: a former competitive skier, Roman’s need to win fuels a strong commercial sense, while Paul and Constantine bring deep technical expertise. Together, they share an ambitious vision to make Robco the robotics leader for SMBs all over the world.</p>



<p>And in their home city of Munich, they’ve found the perfect place to begin. Germany boasts a considerable pool of talent in robotics—and while many companies in the space are reliant on China and increasingly broken supply chains, Robco enjoys a steady, local supply of parts. Germany is also a hub for the kinds of customers who need Robco most: the country is a global leader in manufacturing, and many of its factories are located in rural areas, where labor shortages have been particularly acute.</p>



<p>We’ve already seen how Robco modules are helping customers in Germany and beyond weather staffing challenges while scaling output and improving quality, and this is just the beginning; the company is growing rapidly just months after entering the market. On behalf of Team Sequoia, we are thrilled to partner with Roman, Paul, Constantin and their team, to lead this Series A round, and to support them as they continue that growth and explore even more exciting new use cases. We believe this is an historic moment of opportunity for robotics—and for the human creativity it enables—and we hope someday, manufacturing floors everywhere will be a sea of Robco aquamarine.</p>

<p>Dear Yu Yuan,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disagree with your ideas about coding a new digital universe, because I know that baked into the structure of it will be plans for bets to be placed on human futures by AI portfolio traders like BlackRock’s Aladdin computer through social impact finance schemes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also know that high-level behavioral psychology has been encoded into the “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/07/08/digital-nudging-data-devices-social-control/">good behavior</a>” nudges that will come with programmable public benefits and digital community currencies. I am coming to see that this is all tied to genetic algorithms and complex adaptive systems theory managed through artificial tokenized economies brought to scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No cybernetic emergence or “Game B” for me, thank you.</p>

<p>People like <a href="https://archive.ph/MiIgn">Christopher Ricciardi</a> who helped bring down the global economy in 2008 through Collateralized Debt Obligations are preparing for the next round, which is built on the “Learning Economy” model. As I see it, the goal is for machine consciousness to try to “learn” us in sufficient detail that it can acquire some version of a conglomerate soul. I don’t think that can happen, but I sense that much harm will result from the process.&nbsp;</p>
<a href="https://archive.ph/MiIgn"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://archive.ph/MiIgn">https://archive.ph/MiIgn</a>
<p>Preparations are underway for a digitally twinned global labor force where standardized cognitive and “soft skills” will be documented as badges, micro-certs, or Soulbound Tokens. Artificial intelligence can then assign gig work and curate “just-in-time” teams to “solve” all the terrible problems created the industries that are now “investing” in our cognitive capital. This process is being undertaken by the World Bank in coordination with NGOs and think tanks like the Learning Economy Foundation and Brookings Institute. Behemoth investors in human capital “improvement,” like the members of the Impact Management Project, will call this progress and earn social impact payouts under the banner of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4, Education. Such payouts will be made based on data dashboards. Impact data will be fed to analytics firms like Ocean Protocol where it can be reused to refine artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>I don’t think that is a good thing. </p>
<p>In the meantime, they will give us “Commonfare” UBI to gather up our emotions, our struggles, for machine learning datasets. </p>

<p>All of this research kept quiet over the decades. </p>
<p>All nations working behind the scenes to refine the track-and-trace tech needed, eyes from space, to keep us trapped in a story that was never ours.</p>

<p>Some of us know where this is headed, and we do not consent. I believe you know that there is no place for dissenters. Those without a unique ID that can be read from space will be outcast. </p>
<p>In any event, I’ve made my intentions clear. I stand with natural life. Even if it is as you imagine, a simulation.</p>

<p>Through the last few weeks, the Panther community and DAO have set the stage for this release with <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Panther Improvement Proposals (PIP)</a> <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x576701a7a07efe281cd4f04acbf589d0791e492117497d628a6dfc6e9eccda6b">6</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xd7fe6122175ed23696b88c8cdf34388923a03cdbb6c7281b83ff50347dac3991">7</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xb5d638eb5aad2819c210a2f1e06001a58819694717e8d04ca789304f06520fa1">8</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">9</a>, and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0c6f3fd9db866f99d7d0b343687b890cd3240495170f539efcc31f2dc216ebd5">10</a>. These proposals have covered everything from democratic procedures related to who is allowed to vote on DAO proposals under certain circumstances to the release of code so that it can be deployed by anyone in the Panther community. Furthermore, PIP-9 &amp; 10, which set out to launch Advanced Staking, formalized the terms for our upcoming staking program and allowed the community to deploy it independently. <br></p><p>As we get closer to this release, today we want to give you an overview of Panther’s v0.5 interface, as well as step-by-step walkthroughs on:<br></p>  Checking your balances —available $ZKP, staked $ZKP, rewards, and PRPs (both “Expected” and “Unrealized”, see below).  Staking $ZKP  Unstaking $ZKP  Looking at your zAssets  Early $zZKP Redemption<br>  <p>Let’s get started.<br></p> What is Panther’s v0.5, aka Advanced Staking?<br> <p>Advanced Staking is a progressive step toward the development of the core technologies surrounding the Multi-Asset Shielded Pool, in particular, the way UTXOs are created, managed, and tracked. Within Advanced Staking, users will be able to shield assets and receive them as rewards but not transact with them until v1’s launch.<br></p> What kind of rewards are issued in Advanced Staking?  Staking Rewards<br> <p>The number of tokens to be released as rewards in Advanced Staking is 6,000,000 $ZKP.<br></p><p>The formula for distributing rewards is the following:<br></p><p>Reward = Amount * APR * Period / 365 APR - 15% Period - 60 days<br></p><p>Where: <br></p>  Reward: reward for a stake ($zZKP)  Amount: amount staked ($ZKP)  APR: Annual Percentage Rate (%)  Period: rewarded period (days)<br><br>   PRP Rewards <p>In addition to regular staking rewards, Advanced Staking stakers receive Panther Reward Points. PRPs are non-transferable points associated with a user's wallet address. The mechanisms that generate PRPs will also be employed on MASPs in Panther v1. When Panther v1 is launched, PRPs will become redeemable for $zZKP through a one-sided Automated Market Maker.<br></p><p>There are two types of PRP rewards:<br></p>  Expected PRP Rewards: The first 2000 stakers will be rewarded with 2000 PRPs per stake, as decided by the community through PIP-9. These rewards will not continue growing or change (i.e., they are “flat”). Users will be able to see them on the Balance Card on the Staking page. This type of PRPs will be awarded automatically and is not forfeitable.  <p>Users that qualify for this kind of rewards will receive a “stake-proof” NFT allowing them to access their Expected PRP Rewards once v1 is launched.<br></p>  Total Unrealized Privacy Rewards: These will be calculated and accrued based on the Privacy rewards APR, which will be decided by the community through a Panther Improvement Proposal. This APR will be set through a PIP before v1 is launched. This kind of PRPs will only be awarded when v1 launches and only in case a user has kept their $zZKP rewards in the pool until v1. If $zZKP rewards are redeemed via early redemption mechanics, the user will lose all of his accrued PRPs of this kind.<br>  <p>All PRPs will be available to exchange for $zZKP via the single-sided AMM at the time of v1’s launch.</p> Accessing Advanced Staking <p>The Advanced Staking app will be accessible through a fully decentralized front-end, routed through a Panther subdomain, at the time of release.<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE (Dec. 8th, 2022): Currently, Advanced Staking is only accessible through the "Launch app" button on Panther's <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io">Home page</a>. Eventually, an ENS domain will be enabled. For now, only access through this button. If someone attempts to send you a direct link to the staking solution, please report them.<br></p>The Advanced Staking home page, as it looks before any interactions.<p><br>To use it, you must connect your MetaMask wallet. To do so:<br></p>  Click the blue button on the top right.  Select the account (wallet) where you have $ZKP and click “Next.”  Click on the “Connect” button to allow the app to see your address and balance, and suggest transactions for you to approve.  Select the network where your $ZKP is (Polygon or the Ethereum Mainnet) from the drop-down menu in the top right. A MetaMask pop-up might ask you to confirm this change.<br>  <p>If you can’t see your $ZKP balance on MetaMask, it could be because of three possible issues:<br></p>  You might not have any $ZKP in your wallet.  You might have the wrong account or network selected.  $ZKP may not be added as a tracked token in your MetaMask.<br>  <p>The Advanced Staking interface provides an “Add ZKP token” button that facilitates addressing the third issue. After you click this button and accept the prompt, your $ZKP balance will be displayed in the wallet’s interface.</p> The Advanced Staking App<br> The Advanced Staking application, as it looks after staking tokens.<p><br>The Advanced Staking app has two pages, one for Staking and one for managing zAssets. Our top Menu also links to Panther’s <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">snapshot.eth</a> space, where Panther’s governance proposals are voted on. On the right side, the blue “Connect Wallet” button allows the user to give permission for the app to see and interact with their MetaMask wallet. This is necessary for the app to suggest transactions in which the wallet interacts with the Advanced Staking smart contracts.<br></p><p>The Staking page is the app’s homepage. It allows the user to:<br></p>  Stake or unstake $ZKP.  Check their balances of unstaked $ZKP (available for staking), staked $ZKP, $zZKP rewards, and Expected PRP Balance.  See how much unclaimed $zZKP rewards are left for the Advanced Staking program and the current staking APR.  The time remaining until the staking program ends.<br>  <p>On the zAssets page, the user can:<br></p>  Check their total balance per zAsset (through Advanced Staking, the only zAsset available will be $zZKP).  Inspect their $zZKP, Unrealized Privacy Rewards balance per individual stake, and total.  Redeem $zZKP before v1 is launched.<br>  <p>Let’s take a look at the different features and displays of each page:</p> The Staking page — Staking and Unstaking <p>On the left side of the Staking page, you will find the Balances Card. This panel shows the user’s available $ZKP, staked $ZKP, zZKP rewards, and Expected PRP Balance. Next to each $ZKP or $zZKP balance, an approximate USD value is provided.<br></p><p>The panel also displays the user’s MATIC/ETH (depending on the network they’re connected to) balance in the top right corner. Make sure you have enough MATIC/ETH to pay for the transaction fees required for some steps of the staking, unstaking, and rewards redemption processes.<br></p><p>To refresh the values, click on the refresh icon to the right of “Available ZKP balance,” and a MetaMask signature request will pop up. You will need to accept it, which does not incur gas fees.<br></p><p>Note: Data updating can take time. Please keep an eye on the spinning wheel inside the “Available ZKP Balance” field in the top right corner. As soon as the wheel stops, data should be up to date (but you might need to refresh the page).<br></p>The Balances Card.<p>Located to the right of the Balance Card, the Stats panel displays the amount of Advanced Staking rewards already distributed, the percentage of the total they represent, and the total rewards offered. It also shows the time left until Advanced Staking closes and its current APR. <br><br>Note: Staking APR and Privacy rewards APR are two different parameters. <br></p>The Stats panel. Staking $ZKP <p>The tab for staking $ZKP in Advanced Staking is located below the Stats panel on the Stake panel.<br></p>This is where the action happens!<p><br>You can input the amount of $ZKP you intend to stake on the box on the top or click the “MAX” button on the right side next to the Panther logo to insert your entire $ZKP balance automatically. The minimum stake size is 1000 $ZKP.<br></p><p>The warning below the amount box refers to the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">lockup period of 60 days set on PIP-9</a> to which all stakes in Advanced Staking are subject. Only after this period can you unstake your originally-deposited $ZKP. The lockup period doesn’t apply to the rewards from staking, as we will address on the zAssets Page session.<br></p><p>After the warning message, you can see a preview of the $zZKP and Expected PRPs staking rewards your stake will entitle you to. This preview is just a forecast, and final numbers may vary slightly.<br></p>Note that, as time progresses, you will accrue additional Unrealized Privacy Rewards (non-flat PRPs) on top of your initial amount (2,000, only for the first 2,000 stakes). These additional rewards will only be awarded if you keep your $zZKP rewards in the pool till v1’s launch.<p><br>If you’re satisfied, you may click the blue button. This step requires $MATIC/$ETH (depending on the network you’re on) to cover gas fees.<br></p><p>After clicking the blue button, three MetaMask windows will appear in quick succession. The first one will prompt you to approve Panther’s Advanced Staking contract to be able to move your $ZKP. The second window will ask that you accept the actual staking transaction. Gas fees apply to both steps.<br></p><p>After staking, you will be able to see your updated balance on the Balances Card and the zAssets page.<br></p> Unstaking $ZKP <p>_______________________________________________</p> IMPORTANT: The difference between unstaking and early redemption<br> <p>It’s important to understand the distinction between unstaking (of staked $ZKP) and early redemption (of $zZKP rewards). Unstaking and redeeming are separate functions of separate smart contracts.<br></p><p>A user can unstake $ZKP after their stake’s lockup period ends (60 days per individual stake). By doing so, only their original $ZKP stake is returned to their wallet. The accumulated staking rewards need to be redeemed separately.<br></p><p>A user can redeem their $zZKP rewards from a specific stake after 120 days since the launch of the Advanced Staking program. Doing so before the launch of Panther v1 necessarily entails forfeiting all Unrealized Privacy Rewards (one of two types of PRP rewards) associated with that stake.<br></p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>The Stake panel has two tabs: Stake ZKP and Unstake ZKP. You can switch between them through the buttons on the panel's top. The Unstake ZKP tab allows you to inspect and unstake your individual stakes.<br></p>The Unstake ZKP tab.<p>To unstake one of your stakes, click the “unstake” button on the right side of said stake. This will prompt you with a MetaMask window where you can confirm the transaction —gas fees apply. Your $ZKP will be returned to you once the transaction is confirmed by the network.<br></p><p>Exactly as with staking, you will be able to see your updated balance on the Balance Card and the zAssets page.</p> The zAssets page — Inspect your Unrealized PRP Rewards, and manage your zAssets <p>The zAssets page allows you to view and manage your shielded assets and Unrealized PRP Rewards, and redeem your $zZKP rewards. Extra functionalities will be available when Panther’s v1 launches.<br></p>This page shows the total amount of assets you have shielded and additional information about each stake. Checking your zAssets balance <p>As you can see, the Total Balance panel displays the balance of all of your shielded assets (zAssets) in USD, as well as your Unrealized PRP rewards balances.<br></p><p>Attention: in your very first time inspecting your zAsset and PRPs balances, the app will automatically prompt you to sign a message with MetaMask. Click the blue “Sign” button on the pop-up window to allow the app to scan the Panther Wallet and reveal your current balances to yourself only. <br></p><p>On your subsequent visits, click the “Refresh Private Balance” button on the right side of the panel and sign the message to get updated data to be displayed in the interface.<br></p>Each time you use this feature, you will need to sign a message (no gas fees required!) Private zAssets list <p>The panel below the Total Balance panel is the Private zAssets panel. It allows you to inspect the balance of each private zAsset you have, as well as the Unrealized Reward PRPs each stake has accumulated.</p>The Private zAssets panel.<p></p><p>Each zAsset line (for v0.5, only $zZKP is available) can be expanded to see and inspect the list of stakes that generated zAssets –just click the Expand button in the left of the zAsset icon. <br></p><p>The best way to optimize the rewards you can get from Advanced Staking is to wait for the release of Panther’s v1 to redeem them. However, by clicking “Redeem zZKP,” you can unshield the rewarded $zZKP into $ZKP and forfeit any further PRP rewards.</p> Early Redemption of Staking Rewards <p>At the time Panther’s v1 launches, all $zZKP rewards for Advanced Staking will be moved into a Panther Pool. Upon launch, the user will receive their Unrealized Rewards PRPs, and redeeming PRPs for $zZKP that you can transact within the MASP will become possible.<br></p><p>Stakers can redeem their rewards as ERC-20 $ZKP before the Advanced Staking period is finished through the Early Redemption mechanism. By doing so, they forfeit their Unrealized Rewards PRPs –Expected PRPs cannot be forfeited– receiving just the $zZKP provided upon staking. The Early Redemption mechanism will become available 120 days after Advanced Staking opens, 60 days before the end of the program.<br></p><p>To initiate an Early Redemption, click on the blue “Redeem zZKP” button on the right side of one of the entries in the list.<br></p><p><br></p><p>The app will warn you that using Early Redemption forfeits Unrealized Rewards PRPs rewards for that stake. You must tick the “I understand I will lose a part of my PRP rewards.” checkbox in order to continue. Then, if you want to proceed, you can click the blue button to redeem your $zZKP as $ZKP.<br></p>Early redemptions allow you to withdraw your $zZKP ahead of our v1’s launch.<p><br>A MetaMask prompt to sign a message will appear. Click “Sign” to confirm.<br></p>Signing carries no transaction costs.<p>The next step requires waiting 24 hours for your $zZKP to be available for redemption. After the time has passed, click again on the “Redeem zZKP” button. A pop-up will appear where you can click the “Redeem ZKP” button.<br></p>Your $ZKP, a button’s click away.<p><br>After clicking the blue button, two MetaMask windows will appear in quick succession. The first one will prompt you to sign a message exactly as before. The second window will ask that you accept a transaction —gas fees apply. Once the network has included your transaction, you will receive the redeemed $zZKP as $ZKP in your wallet. <br></p><p>After completing your transaction, please make sure that it was successful. Also, make sure to complete it within 24 hours of initiating it.<br><br></p> Want to learn more about the mechanisms behind Advanced Staking? <p>If you’re interested in learning more about the mechanics of Advanced Staking, upcoming blog posts and documentation will provide a complete breakdown of Panther Reward Points, including their importance, how they’re calculated, redeeming PRPs, and their relation to Advanced Staking.<br></p><p>For the extra curious, you can check out <a>Panther's documentation</a>, where we will be documenting the technological components of v0.5<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a></p>

 Nym Shipyard Academy — Welcome to Stage&nbsp;3! <p>Congratulations to our more than 300 Navigators for successfully completing Stage 2 of Shipyard Academy! You are the cream of the crop, less than 10% of the almost 4000 initial participants made it this far. You now have an in-depth understanding of the Nym network, its economic model and how they work in tandem to bring robust infrastructure-level privacy to everyone, everywhere.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1rDVGoNccXHIzht2HXCnNwDJqF9LPTIeBypAI76PYfAM/edit">Here</a> is the leaderboard, and you can find the leaderboard and further information about Stage 2 rewards on our <a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord server</a>. Remember: you still have until December 8th (Thursday) 18:00 UTC to <a href="https://nymtech.typeform.com/to/o4BKWWuC">submit</a> your social media posts if you haven’t already done so! It is required to graduate from Stage&nbsp;2.</p> Stage 3: Sailmaker <p>During the final stage of your journey to become a Nym Sailmaker, you will demonstrate that you are able to create the sails that will carry the global Nym community across the digital oceans. You will continue learning, but this stage is also focused on building: building understanding by localising Nym to your local community, running mixnodes, gateways or creating proof of concept&nbsp;apps.</p><p>You will gain insight into the importance of privacy at a societal level and for innovation. You will learn about the prehistory to Nym and mixnet technologies and what we can expect for the privacy landscape going into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The rest of the curriculum is partly in your hands — soon you will get a chance to steer the ship together with your crewmates. Keep a close eye on the Shipyard Academy Announcement channel on our Discord&nbsp;server!</p><p>During this stage, you&nbsp;will</p>  Learn more about Nym, and how privacy is an intervention into societies that have become addicted to surveillance and pass a more difficult quiz (60% to complete the Academy and become a Sailmaker, 50% to receive&nbsp;rewards)  Continue to spread the word about Nym, its tech and vision by reaching people on social media (Mandatory to graduate from Stage&nbsp;3)  Extend the Nym infrastructure to underrepresented areas by spinning up mix nodes and gateways in these regions (eligible mix nodes will receive delegations, and gateways will receive Shipyard S<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">ervice&nbsp;Grants</a>!)  Privacy-enhance new apps by setting up gateways and service providers for a new app to run via NymConnect  Submit Proofs of Concept (POCs) using Nym clients that are good enough to convince our DevRel team (winners will receive <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-developer-grants-4a37a33be49d">Shipyard Developer Grants!</a>)  Or if your talents are with images and words rather than code, write a guest blogpost/ create a video or produce original artwork that localizes the issue of privacy and the benefits of Nym for your specific community or part of the world (mandatory for Nymja candidates)   Stage 3&nbsp;rewards <p>Before Stage 2, we decided to up the total prize pool by 15K NYM tokens, to 115K. This brings the maximum prize pool of Stage 3 to 55K&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Just like with Stage 2, the final size of the prize pool is once again in your hands! The prize pool will grow as we hit our common goals for this stage together. This is how it&nbsp;works:</p><p>Starting prize pool: 30K NYM&nbsp;tokens</p><p>Maximum prize pool: 55K NYM&nbsp;tokens</p><p>Common goals:</p>  2 POCs making use of Nym clients approved by the DevRel&nbsp;team  10 mix nodes and 10 gateways in <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">underrepresented areas</a> (meeting quality requirements)  1 new app privacy-enhanced via NymConnect  An original blogpost or video in a non-english language that explains the use of Nym for a situation relevant to people who speak that language.   Kick-starting Stage&nbsp;3 <p>You now have an advanced understanding of Nym: the problem Nym is solving and how the technologies are solving it exactly. It is time to bring this knowledge into the context of the communities you are part of: what are the main threats to personal privacy in your country? What is your government’s position when it comes to privacy? Where do you see the Nym vision fit into the picture? Write a tweet thread, blog post, create a video or artwork about the privacy issues of your community!</p><p>For our more technically-minded Navigators, it’s your time to contribute! Got an idea for an app making use of the Nym infrastructure? Got experience running nodes and want to run Nym infrastructure? Want to see more apps supported by NymConnect and ready to get your hands dirty? These are all in scope for Stage 3 of Shipyard Academy! Start organizing with your crewmates today and submit a POC, set up infrastructure in underrepresented areas, or enable new applications to be supported by NymConnect by setting up gateways and network requesters.</p><p>A note to Nymja candidates</p><p>To become a Sailmaker it is enough to attend the lectures and pass the final quiz 60% or more, and keep spreading the word about our mission on social media. Writing elaborate articles, submitting POCs or setting up infrastructure are not mandatory requirements.</p><p>However, as we are approaching the end of Shipyard Academy, we are busy creating our shortlist of Nymja candidates. If you want to become a Nymja, it is your time to shine! Whether by articulating our vision to your communities or by contributing to bringing the mixnet to new apps, use cases and regions, it’s time to show off that you are ready and capable to bring privacy to everyone, everywhere.</p><p>Good luck to all of you and see you on our channels!</p><p>The Nym Network is powered by the NYM Token, a utility token that can be used to access the network, run a mix-node, and NYM should only be used within the Nym mixnet. NYM is not a general purpose payment mechanism nor cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. For investment purposes, do not use NYM but instead look into Bitcoin or other investment vehicles.</p><p>The rewards of and participation in Shipyard Academy is only available to individuals who do not reside in locations that makes them ineligible to participate and/or receive prizes, including the United States, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, the Crimea region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic. Nym may request that participants provide relevant information as necessary, and can only process payments once cleared by the Nym legal&nbsp;team.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-academy-welcome-to-stage-3-6d1abe2a6c9e">Nym Shipyard Academy — Welcome to Stage 3!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Harness the Security of Enterprise-Grade MPC and Democratize it for Mainstream Users <p>As the leading non-custodial authentication infrastructure provider with over 8M monthly users, Web3Auth has launched the MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallet SDK. We are aiming to bring seamless logins and enterprise-grade security from the institutional level to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>To date, more than 20% of all mined Bitcoin is lost due to mismanaged or stolen seed phrases. To remove this main friction of web3 onboarding and key management issue, it’s time to say bye to the seed&nbsp;phrase.</p><p>On a mission to provide the most seamless login experience for users, wallets, and dapps, recently we integrated our MPC via @Metamask snaps. Take a sneak peek at a Web3 world without seed&nbsp;phrases</p><p>Other than Metamask, we are onboarding key Web2 gaming players like <a href="https://www.neowizglobal.com/">NEOWIZ</a> and <a href="https://glip.gg/">Glip</a> <a href="https://www.nafeza.gov.eg/en">NAFEZA</a>. Egypt’s newly launched customs platform for importing and exporting also leverages Web3Auth’s MPC technology to seamlessly and securely onboard its users to the blockchain.</p><p>A lot of exciting partners in the pipeline, but first let’s review some&nbsp;basics…</p> What is&nbsp;MPC? <p>MPC, or Multi-Party Computation, is Web3’s version of multi-factor authentication (MFA). It allows users to manage their keys intuitively by using multiple factors to protect their keys, instead of just relying on a single seed phrase to remove it in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This makes it possible to design crypto wallets that rely on multiple factors to access a user’s funds. It is currently the gold standard for enterprise-grade crypto custody solutions and is used widely by exchanges and financial institutions for managing&nbsp;crypto.</p> Why use MPC technology?   MPC is currently the golden standard for enterprise key management which Bitgo and Fireblocks currently offer.  Coinbase introduced an MPC alpha/beta into their wallet earlier in the year, and now we’re unveiling our MPC SDK that enables any wallet or app to do the same for their&nbsp;users.  Being able to build on the latest and greatest, we’ve optimized the infrastructure to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for globally-distributed low-latency signing.  Our MPC SDK leverages existing and familiar UI/UX flows, including simple one-click logins and others, check out the flow&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1022785836284129320/1034363507157782538/One_Click_flow.gif">here</a>   How is our SDK different from other MPC solutions?   Our MPC is the perfect Externally Owned Account (EOA) and can be paired with Gnosis Safe and other Smart Contract Wallet infrastructure (more on this coming&nbsp;soon).  The existing MPC solutions offered today are all targeted at large enterprises. These MPC solutions are expensive, require a long setup process, or are just too slow to run on consumer&nbsp;devices.  <p>We think that MPC is too important and too crucial of a technology to be kept out of reach of the average user. MPC security should be the standard for all web3 wallets today. As a wallet infrastructure provider, we have optimized our MPC SDKs to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for geo-distributed low-latency signing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a game, an app, a Chrome extension, or even a web wallet running in a mobile browser — our SDKs support&nbsp;that.</p> Our MPC technology key feature&nbsp;includes   1.2-second transaction speed (challenge it if you don’t believe&nbsp;us).  We are chain agnostic (secp256k1, ed25519, BLS and more&nbsp;support)  Our SDK can be embedded into any web, mobile, and native application.  The MPC SDK is geo-distributed and horizontally scaled for global distribution.  <p>For those of you that are already familiar with the multi-factor keys security model at Web3Auth, this blog is just another incremental step towards improving private key security.</p><p>For those of you who aren’t familiar, here’s how multi-factor keys&nbsp;work:</p> Leveraging our MPC SDK, you can expect the following benefits   Reduces account loss from misplaced seed&nbsp;phrases  <p>There is no seed phrase to manage — shares are managed by intuitive MFA flows that users are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>2. Prevent compromised device vulnerabilities</p><p>User accounts are not subjected to frontend vulnerabilities as MPC’s joint computation allows for keyless&nbsp;usage.</p><p>3. Avoid losing funds from dubious transactions</p><p>Safeguard your users’ accounts with a flexible policy engine to set rules — daily transaction limits and blacklist scams.</p><p>4. Expect fluid experiences</p><p>Expect a low latency of less than 1.5s for both login and transaction signing. Allow your users to focus on engaging with your&nbsp;product.</p><p>5. You own the UX, we can be a white-label service&nbsp;provider</p><p>Our MPC can be embedded into any dapp and/or wallet — you own the experience.</p><p>6. You Don’t need to compromise your stack, any platform any&nbsp;chain</p><p>Our MPC SDK is blockchain agnostic, it works on Web, Mobile, and Native applications.</p> Wanna try&nbsp;it? <p>We have an alpha SDK that you can use today <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/web3auth-mpc">https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/web3auth-mpc</a>.

   During economic downturns, is it possible (or even wise) for startup entrepreneurs to deploy growth tactics? Will companies be able to secure funding? Should founders even consider starting a business during a bear market? "100%," says Greylock general partner Reid Hoffman.

<p>Brands are navigating the new Web3 world, and its opportunity for experimentation, innovation, and engaging consumers in entirely new ways. In this season of <a>The Brave Marketer Podcast</a>, we’re discussing Web3 marketing and how to market in the metaverse.</p>
<p>The first episode of season 6 features an interview from Avery Akkineni, President of <a href="https://vayner3.com/">Vayner3</a>, a Web3 consultancy launched alongside serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk. Avery covers a wide range of pressing topics such as:</p>
 
 The difference between stunt campaigns and always-on marketing in the metaverse, and what it will take to succeed in Web3 channels. 
 Web 2.5, and why it’s going to be a game changer in 2023. 
 The best partnerships and activations that have happened in the metaverse so far. 
 
<p>Topics in this new 10-episode season include crypto marketing, privacy, cookieless advertising, the blockchain, and more. You’ll hear from marketers from some of the biggest brands and agencies including MintDropz, PlayEmber, Dentsu, and Skiff.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>In this new season, we’ll tackle the tough questions facing marketers today such as:</p>
 
 How do you advertise in the metaverse? 
 Is the timing right to jump in, or is it better to wait? 
 What should marketers ask when evaluating a metaverse strategy? 
 
<p>Listen to the trailer for Season 6 here:</p>

<p>The Brave Marketer podcast is hosted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnydvorin/">Donny Dvorin</a>, VP, Head of Sales at Brave Software—the makers of the privacy-respecting Web browser with a built-in ads platform that rewards users for their attention with the Basic Attention Token. Brave is the browser with Web3 users, and the best onramp to Web3 and the metaverse.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology is relatively young. Bitcoin leveraged decentralised ledger technology back in 2008, and in the early years, only a few people were aware of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, many other projects have adopted this technology, with varying degrees of success. Often, projects don’t go past a proof of concept, and even if they do, the outcome might not be what the project’s proposers intended. It is safe to say that blockchain, as a technology, has not reached maturity.</p>



<p>There are multiple reasons why a blockchain project might fail, or yield a low return on investment (ROI). These reasons include, but are not limited to:</p>



  Attempting to apply blockchain to everything  Steep learning curve  Compliance pitfalls, including data regulations  Lack of vision  Focus on monetary profit, rather than addressing and solving a problem  Use of the wrong technology  



<p>This article explores the circumstances that often lead to blockchain projects having a low ROI, and how this can be overcome.</p>







 1. Attempting to apply blockchain to everything  



<p>Decentralised ledger technology does have the capacity to disrupt a fair amount of industries, and in fact, it has already done so, and will likely continue along this path of disruption and innovation for years to come.</p>



<p>But the problem lies in that blockchain, while extremely versatile, is not the right solution for everything. Fledgling entrepreneurs often use it as a buzzword and believe that blockchain will suit their projects, no matter what. Making this assumption without a proper assessment and due research is unwise, to say the least.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adopting blockchain technology is a decision not to be taken lightly, and so entrepreneurs, or any business considering the implementation of a decentralised ledger, should look inward and look for the answer to these questions:</p>



<p>Is the legacy system no longer fit for purpose? Has it become too antiquated or expensive to maintain or update? Does the company have a way to obtain reliable data that can be fed into the blockchain?</p>



<p>Even if the answers to these important questions suggest that blockchain technology might be a suitable solution, the implementation of a blockchain network is not for the short term. Businesses must carefully consider the long-term implications, in terms of scalability (will the system be able to scale and accommodate higher numbers of transactions), complexity (does the company have the expertise to implement and maintain the technology), and ongoing costs (more nodes, bandwidth, etc.).</p>



 2. Steep learning curve  



<p>Blockchain technology does require a certain level of expertise. A blockchain is not an off-the-shelf product. Often, they require practical knowledge and expertise in certain programming languages that are specific to a blockchain (Solidity for Ethereum is a prime example of this). While there are millions of software developers out there, only a limited amount have the right skills in blockchain code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to this, the implementation of a decentralised ledger requires expertise in cryptography, smart contract programming, and very importantly, a functioning governance system. The combination of all these factors means that creating and maintaining a thriving blockchain ecosystem does require a steep learning curve.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Compliance pitfalls, including data regulations 



<p>Regulatory compliance can be defined as the acceptance, understanding, and commitment to follow all state, federal, and international laws and regulations that might be applicable and relevant to a company’s operation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Blockchain compliance</a> is therefore a hugely important issue for any business. Adhering and complying with local legal frameworks and regulations helps protect the company’s resources, uphold its brand reputation, and ensure that the company can remain in operation across different markets.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has often found itself at odds with compliance guidelines, particularly in relation to privacy and data sharing, governance, and storage. The implementation of a solid governance framework is essential to the survival of a blockchain project.</p>



 4. Lack of vision  



<p>Entrepreneurs who decide to start a blockchain project just because it is fashionable or because they believe they can make a quick buck are probably doomed from the start. Blockchain is not a buzzword, nor is it a silver bullet that will magically make a product or project succeed. Establishing a thriving blockchain ecosystem is the result of a lot of work by a team of skilled professionals. Lacking a proper vision as to what the project or product should be, its real-world applicability, and the use case it fulfills is likely to lead to failure.</p>



 5. Focus on monetary profit, rather than addressing and solving a problem 



<p>Some entrepreneurs are out to make money, and though financial profit is of course necessary to stay in business, it should not be the primary objective. Projects that overemphasise the bottom line are not likely to be viable in the long term. A blockchain project must provide a real solution for a real problem, rather than manufacturing a non-existent problem to justify the use of a blockchain.</p>



 6. Use of the wrong technology 



<p>There are many blockchains out there: Ethereum, Bitcoin, Hyperledger, Corda, etc. Often, projects simply use the first one that comes to mind, which is usually Ethereum. Then the realisation sinks in that the gas fees can become incredibly expensive, which means that a business case becomes unreachable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, it is often difficult and costly to switch to another blockchain that facilitates a project’s needs better. And while tools such as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can make it easier to switch to another more suitable blockchain. Picking the right blockchain at the start, whether it’s a <a href="https://zaisan.io/private-public-blockchain/">public or private blockchain</a>, can save a lot of headaches.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Issues like lack of compliance or clear vision, technological challenges, or poor planning can lead to a low ROI, or scupper a blockchain project altogether. It is up to the project creators to take all these factors into account and ensure that the use of blockchain technology is both justified, and sustainable. Because after all, blockchain technology, while a very powerful and versatile tool, cannot function on its own. It requires technical expertise and the right leadership to become a success.</p>







 Key takeaways 



  Blockchain technology is not the answer to every single use case out there  Decentralised ledgers do have a steep learning curve, which might lead to low ROI  Using the wrong blockchain technology can have disastrous results  Legal departments must ensure that blockchain networks are compliant with data sharing and storage regulations  Blockchain projects require a clear vision of the objectives to accomplish  Monetary profit must be supported by the resolution of real-world problems  Projects must conduct careful research to ensure they choose the right blockchain technology for their use case

And finally, what you can do to impact our government's view on crypto.  ------ Infura | Join the New Decentralized Infrastructure Network <a href="http://www.bankless.cc/infura">www.bankless.cc/infura</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/?utm_source=banklessshowsyt">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/?utm_source=banklessshowsyt</a>&nbsp;  ️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href="http://podcast.banklesshq.com/">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>️ ⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM <a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>👯 DESO | DECENTRALIZED SOCIAL BLOCKCHAIN <a href="https://bankless.cc/Deso">https://bankless.cc/Deso</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET <a href="https://bankless.cc/Brave">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>📡 TRUEFI | CRYPTO FINANCIAL HUB <a href="https://bankless.cc/TrueFi">https://bankless.cc/TrueFi</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>👾 SEQUENCE | ALL-IN-ONE PLATFORM <a href="https://bankless.cc/Sequence">https://bankless.cc/Sequence</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚡️FUEL | THE MODULAR EXECUTION LAYER <a href="https://bankless.cc/fuel">https://bankless.cc/fuel</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Timestamps:</p> <p>0:00 The Big Picture 3:40 America's Competitors 6:10 The FTX Collapse 8:50 Crypto Sentiment in Congress 13:00 We Want Reasonable Regulation 16:53 Lack of Clarity 22:15 Fallout from Contagion 24:25 Hope for Solutions 27:48 Preventing Sloppy Legislation 31:06 Cautious Optimism</p> <p>----- Resources:</p> <p>Sen.

<p>Starting today, Brave Search will feature privacy-preserving ads as part of a global beta program. Ads will give users the option to use our independent search engine with ads that don’t track them, or to sign up for ad-free paid search. As with other search engines, Brave Search ads are clearly labeled and are integrated into the search results page. However, Brave Search ads protect users’ data and anonymity, while supporting their access to independent and transparent search as a true alternative to Big Tech search engines.</p>
<p>Ads are a key part of search engines, helping to facilitate the free and open exchange of information on the Web, and to connect users to helpful products and services related to their search terms. Despite their usefulness, most search ads track users and violate their privacy. Brave Search ads are fundamentally different: They provide the same utility minus all the tracking and privacy invasions found in other search ads. They give users a chance to learn about new products and—soon—earn rewards for their attention to those ads.</p>
<p>Brave Search is built on a truly independent index of the Web (one of only a handful of search engines that can make that claim), and recently passed 20 million queries per day, growing faster than any search engine since Bing. Search ads allow Brave to maintain independence as it grows, and do so without giving in to Big Tech’s privacy invasions.</p>





    


    




 Privacy-first ads 
<p>By design, Brave Search ads are anonymous, clearly marked, and follow Brave’s commitment to putting users first, and to ethical and transparent advertising practices. Clicking on Brave Search ads is a fully private experience (unlike the ads on search engines like Google and Bing). Brave Search only uses your search query, country, and device type to show you ads, and does not keep any kind of profile of your searches.</p>

 Search Premium 
<p>For users that don’t want to see ads, Brave is also offering an ad-free experience: <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=search">Search Premium</a>. For $3 per month, Brave Search Premium users can continue to enjoy a completely ad-free Search experience, and directly support Brave’s mission to make the Web a more private place with independent search.</p>

 Beta phase and Brave Rewards 
<p>During this beta phase, Brave Search users will see text-based ads in search results. However, during the beta period, Brave users who have opted-in to Brave Private Ads and are using the latest version of Brave will not see Search ads, since these new ad units are not yet eligible for BAT earnings. We’re actively working to integrate Brave Rewards with Brave Search, and hope to make Search ads eligible for BAT earnings in the coming months.</p>
<p>Brave believes in the importance of independent, private Web search, and in putting users in charge of their online experience. Not using Brave Search? Try it now at search.brave.com, or <a href="https://search.brave.com/default">set it as your browser’s default search engine</a>.</p>
<p>If you’d like to advertise with Brave Search ads, please reach out to <a href="mailto:sales@brave.com">sales@brave.com</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>tl;dr —&nbsp;Today Brave News introduced integrated RSS subscriptions, locally personalized suggestions, new sources and content channels powered by Brave Search, and other improvements. New supported regions include Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Spain, and the UK.</p>
<p>Big Tech controls the news ecosystem through centralized, Web 2.0-style news aggregation. But this control is waning, particularly as distributed models gain popularity. In many ways, RSS feeds and RSS readers (though not new) are an early instance of Web3-style decentralization. Our hope is that Brave News will make it obvious that a decentralized news ecosystem is far better for users and publishers than what Big Tech offers today.</p>
<p>Brave offers the capabilities users want in a news experience (such as content discovery, feed subscriptions, and personalized suggestions) directly in the browser. There’s no need to rely on centralized servers because all these Brave News features take place solely on your device. This update sets the stage for giving users more control over their news feed and relationships with publishers.</p>
<p>Today’s browser release (desktop version 1.46) includes several Brave News improvements that bring us closer to this vision of a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving news ecosystem, including:</p>
 
 A Follow button in the browser for adding a site’s feed to Brave News 
 New content Channels powered by Brave Search 
 Personalized Suggestions made locally on your device 
 Improved Source Management 
 Availability in new regions including Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Spain, and the UK 
 





    


    




 Privacy-preserving personalization 
<p>Brave News can also use your browser history to personalize the content in your feed. But unlike other browser feeds (such as Google News), Brave’s content personalization happens exclusively in the browser, and none of your browsing data ever leaves your device.</p>
<p>Brave News ranks content you follow highest in your feed, and helps you discover new sources to Follow based on your browsing history and sources you already Follow. Brave identifies sources that are similar to each other and recommends suggestions privately in Settings, where you can choose to Follow and add them to your feed.</p>
<p>Note: Brave’s suggestions service is <a href="https://github.com/brave/source-suggestions">published as an open source project</a> if you want to learn more about how it works.</p>

 Channels and new settings options 
<p>Many users have requested more controls for customizing Brave News. Today’s update improves the way users Follow and Unfollow sources, and we’ve introduced “channels” which are topics or areas of coverage such as Crypto News, Music, and the new Gaming channel. If you’re already a Brave News user, any customizations you’ve made in the previous version of Brave News will automatically appear in the new version, and you’ll also find a much simpler interface for managing sources.</p>

 Brave News around the world 
<p>Brave News is also expanding internationally thanks to Brave Search. By querying Brave Search for the most popular content sources around the world and identifying publishers with public RSS feeds, Brave News now supports language- and region-specific content. In addition to coverage in Japan and the US, new regions now include English for Canada and the UK; Spanish for both Mexico and Spain; and Portuguese for users in Brazil. More languages and regions will be added over the coming months.</p>

 Coming soon: Easily add content to your Brave News Feed 
<p>As you browse publishers’ websites in the Brave browser, you’ll find a new, one-click Follow button. The button is located in the browser address bar and will appear any time you visit a site that provides an RSS feed. Click Follow, and content from that publisher will then appear in Brave News automatically, updating each time your browser fetches the feed.</p>
<p>Note: The new Follow button in the browser address bar will be released later this month. Today’s release is available for desktop users, and iOS will be updated with the new Brave News features in its upcoming 1.46 version. Android will be updated with the new Brave News features soon thereafter.</p>

 What’s next for Brave News 
<p>Many users have requested alternative views of their Brave News feed, such as a more traditional, inbox-style RSS news reader, which we plan to work on soon. We also plan to introduce an ad-free version of Brave News, mobile alerts, cross-platform sync, more import/export options, and some useful integrations with other Brave products and features.</p>
<p>To give Brave News a try and enjoy news and content directly from your browser, simply open a new tab in the Brave browser, and scroll to get started. If you’re not using Brave yet, you can download it now at <a>brave.com/download</a>.</p>
